Can salmonella show up in a raw-egg product once it has already been made ?
There is probably still some risk , so I would n't assume it was safe ; however , ice-cream is frozen , so I would n't worry about ice-cream at all , unless the egg-mixture was left at room temperature for a significant time before freezing . As far as I know , salmonella is in the faeces of the chicken , if present . Some faeces will often stick to the shell . In very rare circumstances , which I believe are negligible , the salmonella penetrates the shell and infects not only the white ( less of a problem ) but also the nutritious yolk , and then the whole egg is contaminated . But this chance is probably too small to encounter in one 's average life time . What has normally happened if the faeces are contaminated and people get sick , is that some of the salmonella present on the outside of the shell contaminates the egg when the shell is broken , or the extremely small number of bacteria present in the white get a chance to infect the whole egg ( chance ca. 0.005 % , see below ) . ( Note that in many countries the outside of the shell of supermarket eggs is supposedly sterilized . ) At that very moment , however , the number of bacteria present in the egg white should still not be enough to make people sick . But if the egg is then left to sit outside the refrigerator for several hours , and enough faeces touched the egg white , the bacteria may have enough time to multiply and make you sick . If the egg is properly refrigerated , chances are much lower , but I do not know the exact numbers . One often sees grey spots and smears on the outside of eggs ; I believe this is normally chicken faeces . Even so , salmonella is quite rare , such that the healthy should n't be worried about making ice cream , mousse au chocolat , and such from unpasteurized eggs . But if a young child , an old person , a pregnant woman , or someone with health problems were to eat the ice cream , I would not take the chance and use pasteurized eggs . If the food is contaminated , the fact that people do not get sick who have eaten it immediately upon making it offers little evidence , because the bacteria have n't had the time to multiply yet . I believe you will normally not get sick from eating contaminated steak tartare , for example , because it is eaten immediately . However that may be , ice-cream is frozen : as Derobert said below , salmonella probably <URL> , and certainly not below 0 ° C , so ice-cream should be safe under all normal circumstances , that is , if it was frozen shortly after breaking the eggs . Normal temperatures in refrigerators slow down the growth of the bacteria as well : perhaps you should n't worry too much about anything that is kept at 7 ° C anyway for a few days . The inside of an egg was once considered almost sterile . But , over recent years , the bacterium Salmonella enteritidis ( Se ) has been found inside a small number of eggs . Scientists estimate that , on average across the U.S. , only 1 of every 20,000 eggs might contain the bacteria . So , the likelihood that an egg might contain Se is extremely small -- 0.005 % ( five one-thousandths of one percent ) . At this rate , if you 're an average consumer , you might encounter a contaminated egg once every 84 years . -- <URL> , <URL>
Up to 7 days ( homemade mayo as well ) . Egg whites/yolks out of the egg ( but not combined with the acid ) can last 3-4 days refrigerated , and eggs in-shell are good for 2-4 weeks depending on processing .
Coconut flour is what remains <URL> when extracting the milk from coconut . So I doubt you can make anything resembling coconut milk ( much less coconut cream ) from it , unless the manufacturer has done an exceptionally poor job of doing so already !
You can have raw chicken in restaurants in Japan - it 's delicious . Depending on where you live there may be better or worse food safety standards , but there is nothing poisonous about raw chicken itself . By the way , sushi is a dish with vinegary rice . The raw-meat dish is Sashimi <URL> . <URL> You will note that in this photo the chicken is actually not raw but quite rare . The exterior of the chicken flesh is actually seared and cooked through several millimeters .
It will definitely make a difference . Yolks contain various things like fats and emulsifiers that affect the flavor and texture of baked goods . If you want more details , then tell us what you 're baking .
Actually , I think " the Internet " is wrong on this one , assuming that we are talking about proper caramel sauce . In most of candy making , you are very careful of crystalization . You are working with a supersaturated sugar solution , and it is looking for the slightest excuse to precipitate . Stirring will clump the sugar out of the solution into crystals . Some candy types need to be perfectly smooth , while others ( like fudge ) get their characteristic texture from careful management of crystal size . You should n't be stirring there at all . But once you have reached caramelization , you can stir . What you have in the pan is no longer a supersaturated sugar solution , but caramelization products mixed in a less-concentrated sugar solution . In other words , you have caramel , which is a substance quite different from sugar syrup . And it does not clump into crystals . It is amorphous in its structure , not a crystal , and it 's actually got some viscosity ( if you leave a clump a solid caramel around for years , it will flow a few centimeters ) . And you are not just dealing with pure caramel , but with caramel sauce , which also has lots of liquid added in the form of cream . So much liquid would have also prevented the sugar syrup from crystalizing if it had been added earlier . So , to summarize , you should n't stir a sugar solution during candy making , but you can stir both caramel and caramel sauce . It seems that somebody learned the rule about hot sugar solutions and decided that it applies in all kinds of candy making , without exceptions . But in fact , it does n't apply to caramel sauce .
I would likely work the cream cheese first , then try adding the liquids from most to least viscous ( condensed milk , evaporated milk , eggs , vanilla ) If you try to use a mixer with cream cheese and lots of liguid , it 's harder to combine -- you end up getting floating bits of cheese in the liquid ( likely what you mentioned as a ' curdled mess ' ) , rather than it fully encorporating . Having the cream cheese at room temp helps , but is still problematic . It 's possible that you might also want to strain the mixture when you 're done , as the mixer might leave the eggs ' chalaza intact . ( if it 's too thick to easily strain when done , you can either whip the eggs first and strain them before adding them , or just skip this step )
Steam a head of cauliflower , puree it . Add it to the soup . You might also consider some squash or sweet potato puree .
If it 's raw , stick with the best-before date on the label . If cooked , you have at least <URL> , regardless of whether it 's pork , veal , or regular beef .
Butter can go bad . The oils will go rancid if exposed to too much light and heat for too long . This accelerates the process of oxidation , which happens even if you keep the butter in the fridge . Even in the fridge your butter will eventually go bad . Personally I follow the dates on all packages . I do so with an awareness that they usually tend to be conservative , which keeps me comfortable . Rancid butter in a taste test wo n't kill you , though . It 'll just taste bad . So you should be able to taste this butter to see if it is bad . While I recommend following the dates on packaging , here are signs that your butter has actually gone bad : discoloration melting ( which will happen outside of the fridge , you probably would n't see it ) sour smell sour and unusual taste
I discussed a similar subject in this question : <URL> Raw fish is n't safe to eat if it 's just been sitting around . However , the raw fish used in sushi/sashimi has been frozen ( typically flash-frozen ) in order to kill any parasites , making it as safe as any other food . Most distributors of sashimi also have their own methods and internal regulations to ensure food safety , but specifics are understandably hard to come by . Suffice it to say , it 's far safer to eat properly-prepared nigiri or sashimi than it is to eat an undercooked hamburger .
Of course you can freeze meat . If it would be unsafe , your local supermarked would n't be allowed to sell it . What you have to keep in mind when freezing your own meat : Storage time is limited , for guidelines see <URL> or <URL> . Freezing does nor remove bacteria , mold and other " nasties " , but stops them from multiplying . Rule of thumb : What 's on the meat when it goes into the freezer comes out again . So follow the usual safety procedures for raw meat before and after freezing . ----- EDIT ------ As the subject of fat going rancid has come up several times in comments : That 's one of the reasons the recommended freezing time for bacon is 1-2 months only , for game meat up to 8-12 months . Rule of thumb : The fattier the shorter .
Most of the ice creams I 've made have been custard-based , meaning that egg yolks are cooked together with cream and sugar . The mixture is chilled and then churned . For a custard-style ice cream recipe including cocoa powder , the cocoa would likely be dissolved during the cooking step . If you are following a no-cook recipe that includes cocoa powder , I would at least use a whisk to mix the cocoa in as thoroughly as possible . However , dissolving the cocoa in a hot liquid would likely result in a smoother ice cream . Not sure what kind of recipe you are following , but you could probably heat the milk/cream , stir in the cocoa powder to dissolve , then chill the mixture before churning it .
Bearing in mind the salmonella statistics given above. , yes it is safe to eat raw eggs so long as you are not very young , very old , or immunocompromised in some way -- e.g. HIV , chemotherapy , leukemia , etc. .
Roux Method The advantages of the roux method : It can be prepared in advance The raw flour taste is cooked out when the roux is prepared , so the sauce is ready as soon as it is thickened ; this also makes it easier to add more roux to adjust the thickness of the sauce . It actually requires less supervision . You are actually being overly fussy with your roux based sauce . You could add all of the milk at once , although starting with one smaller batch just to dissolve the roux is a good idea . The butter coats the flour particles , making lumping quite unlikely Can be browned for additional flavor at the cost of thickening power It also adds oil or butter to the recipe , which may or may not be an advantage . Slurry Method The advantages of the slurry method ( which is what the second method is , although it is more typically done with water or stock than milk are ) : It is fast and convenient , if you do n't have roux prepared ahead No oil or butter is required , so it does n't have to be accounted for in the recipe . Disadvantages : It is easier to get lumping if you do n't thoroughly whisk the slurry before heating It must be brought to the boil for at least a couple of minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste , and harder to adjust thickness . Harder to prepare ahead Conclusion Use whichever you are comfortable with . For fine sauces , roux based may be superior ( and certainly more buttery ) , but you can have excellent outcomes with a slurry . For casual cooking , I tend to use a slurry , saving roux for more formal dinners and fancier dishes like Thanksgiving gravy .
Microwaves do not kill bacteria , heat kills bacteria . The higher the temperature , the faster those bacteria will die off . " Instant death " for most bacteria ( including salmonella ) is about 160 ° F ( 71 ° C ) . You only need a few seconds at this temperature . The notoriously strict USDA <URL> 160 ° F for egg dishes but is considerably more lax about whole eggs and just says to cook until firm . Very few eggs are contaminated in the whites or yolks , so the risk is very low . Pasteurization begins around 57 ° C ( 135 ° F ) , so many bacteria are killed before the egg coagulates ( at 63 ° C / 145 ° F ) , which is why the USDA is not very strict about it ; if an egg by itself is " firm " then it 's generally already been hot enough for long enough to ensure safety . Unfortunately , microwaves tend to heat ( a ) quickly and ( b ) unevenly , so if you are concerned about food safety and insist on making eggs in the microwave ( not recommended ) , be sure to use short bursts and stir several times , otherwise you might end up with a combination of uncooked and overcooked parts , which is bad for food safety and for general taste and texture . Note that there is not only a possibility but actually a certainty that some salmonella is still there , assuming that there was any to begin with . Cooking is equivalent to pasteurization and that does not kill every single bacterium , nor is it meant to ; it just kills about 99.9999 % of them which makes the cooked item safe enough to consume .
Congee itself is just thick rice porridge . It is usually made with a combination of short-grain and ' sticky ' ( glutinous ) rice , but any kind of white rice will work . Put 3/4 cup rice ( 1/2 cup regular , 1/4 cup sticky , if you have it ) in a pot with 8 cups of water and a little salt . Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours , until it is a thick porridge . Stir now and then so it does n't stick . Many electric rice cookers have a congee setting , which makes everything really easy - just put in a measure of rice , add water up to the congee mark , turn it on and wait . There are many , many traditional toppings or additions to congee . Eileen Yin-Fei Lo said it well in her " From the Earth : Chinese Vegetarian Cooking " : " Virtually any food can be added to one 's breakfast congee in China . What you might add to it depends upon your preferences . "
There is no single answer to that question : it is going to vary program by program . Some shows , like America 's Test Kitchen , are going to be quite precise -- at at least , they will intend to be . Other shows , not naming any names , less so . The thing is , with very very few exceptions , you should not be cooking to time anyway . The time in a recipe is just a guideline so you have some expectation for logistical planning , and to know when to start testing . Quality recipes -- and quality television shows giving you recipes -- should always give a test for when a food is done . This can vary from " pulls away from the side of the pan " for brownies , to " pulls apart easily with a fork " for a braised pork shoulder , to " internal temperature of 135 F " for a roast . Even for shows that intend to give you very good time estimates , testing is still important , because there are many variables that effect how long it takes food to cook . For something as simple as a steak , the starting temperature of the steak , the thickness of the steak , the starting temperature of the pan and its thermal mass , and the power and setting of your burner ( hob ) will all effect how long it takes the steak to finish . You probably do n't have the same room temperature as the test kitchen where the recipe was developed , the same stove , the exact same settings , and the same thickness of steak . Such variables apply to almost all recipes . The test is what tells you when to stop cooking ; the time is only an estimate . As an aside , the few things that must be cooked to time are those that are 1 ) uniform in size and cooking properties ; and 2 ) foods for which it is difficult or impossible to observe the effect of the cooking directly . The only two examples I can think of that are appropriate are cooking eggs in the shell , and roasted peanuts in the shell .
Some ingredients do not dissolve well in hot water - the starch swells and thickens , forming lumps that may have raw powder in them and are nasty . They need to be added to cold or lukewarm water and heated after they are dissolved . Other ingredients , most notably pasta , will partially dissolve in cold water making a thick gloppy soup . But if you add them to hot water they will " seal " ( in a way ) and stay together as they cook .
It appears to be feasible ! I found <URL> in which a " cooking expert " gives a specific recipe : Frozen egg tempura Remove the shell of a frozen egg and cut the egg in half lengthwise without thawing . A peeled egg is slippery , so put a paper towel on the cutting board before you place the egg on the board . Lightly flour the halves of the egg all over , and dip it in a mixture of three tablespoons of tempura flour and two tablespoons of water . Deep-fry the egg in oil heated at 160 C for about three minutes . They 're not too specific about the results , but I imagine they 'd have mentioned if it exploded or anything ! <URL> mentions doing essentially the same thing for a scotch egg : Freeze the raw egg in its shell , de-shell the frozen raw egg and wrap the sausage meat around it whilst it is still frozen . This can be difficult as the egg 's albumen defrosts quickly . Coat in flour , egg and breadcrumb . Fry till the scotch egg floats and the crumb is a deep golden brown . It 's the only way I know that gives a soft runny yolk every time . I do n't know what frying temperature was used , and it 's got sausage and breading around the egg rather than just tempura batter , but it 's a deep-fried egg , starting from raw/frozen , and produces a soft yolk .

Can you freeze waffle batter ?
<URL> says you can safely store waffle batter for 3 months , but I 've had bad luck freezing it as far as quality goes . After thawing and cooking the batter , the waffles did n't really " rise " enough to be worthwhile . They tasted ok , but the texture was n't nearly what I wanted . Waffles are essentially a <URL> , and I believe the baking powder does n't have the same effect after freezing . I do know that you lose the frothy goodness that you get from the whisking/beating , which is important in achieving the light , fluffy lift inside the crispy exterior . I was told that if you use a yeast recipe instead of a baking powder recipe , you can thaw it overnight and it will give the yeast time to activate by morning - unfortunately I have n't tried it so I 'm only passing it on as a suggestion . What I 've found works : Making a bunch of waffles and freezing them between layers of wax paper . Not as good as fresh , but better than store-bought frozen , and very convenient . Storing the dry mix in the pantry ( short-term ) or freezer ( longer-term ) , as I generally have milk and eggs on hand and have time for a quick whisk . Not as convenient or portable , but tastier . If you modify the recipe using evaporated milk or dried buttermilk , you can make them with water and egg instead of milk and egg . As a side note , you probably have about 3 days in the fridge .
Beef bones can be used multiple times , but less flavor and gelatin will be extracted from each additional use . Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " describes this . Because a standard kitchen extraction of eight hours releases only about 20 % of the gelatin in beef bones , the bones may be extracted for a second time , for a total of up to 24 hours . The resulting liquid can then be used to start the next fresh extraction of meat and bones . I would imagine chicken bones would be similar , although , since they are smaller , the first batch may be more effective than 20 % .
I think rehydrating evenly is going to be very dicey . Instead , when you first open a large pack , immediately separate it into smaller batches , wrapping each tightly in wax paper and then a zip-loc removing as much air as possible , and re-freezing those smaller packs . Now you wo n't have to thaw and refreeze any sheets more than once - just grab the number of smaller packs you need . This should keep them in better condition .
I have frozen eggplant Parmesan before with good results . I breaded the eggplant , fried it , then put Parmesan on top while it was still hot enough to melt . I let them cool and then froze the fried eggplant slices separated by pieces of parchment paper . When I needed to use them , I put them on a sheet pan , still frozen , and threw them in the oven until the cheese was melted and slightly browned , then proceeded as I normally would .
Many , many things happen when flour flour is mixed into batter . From your description , though , it sounds like you are interested in what leads to and relieves clumping . When water ( whether it is just plain water , in milk , in juice , or whatever ) and flour are mixed , the water will begin to expand and penetrate the starch granules in the flour . The starch will swell , and become sticky . Now , imagine a small clump of flour , with water penetrating from the outside . The outside surface of the flour clump will swell up as the starches become staturated with water . They are also sticky , so they tend to not separate -- the surface sticky flour tends to stick to its neighbors and the flour on the inside . Once the outside surface of the clump is saturated with water , it is very hard for more water to penetrate the clump , so it tends to persist . The main way to mitigate this clumping is to stir vigorously , immediately upon introducing the flour and liquid . This will tend to distribute the flour particles throughout the liquid before significant swelling occurs . This is why when making a flour slurry , you whisk or beat it quite briskly right away . Additionally , slowly over time , water will also penetrate the clumps , slowly swelling and hydrating the starches in the center , but then you tend to have quite sticky lumps , like in lumpy gravy , and those are nearly impossible to dissolve , so you do n't want that to happen . Immediate agitation is the key . In the batter you describe , it is probably the additional mixing more than the the additional flour that relieves the clumping . You have said that it does n't happen until the flour is added , but it may be that the additional volume just makes your mixer more efficient since it has more to work with . Still , nothing is simple . If you have a lot of water , and a little flour , stirring easily creates a slurry without lumps . If you have a much larger ratio of flour to water , there is n't enough water to make a liquid phase , and so you get clumps . Within limits , over time , the water will distribute itself throughout the flour phase , and you will get a continuous mass of dough . This is what happens ( ignoring the effects of shortening for flakiness ) in a pie dough , for example , which is quite dry . It needs the resting time for the water to hydrolyze the starches , and spread evenly throughout , so what you have is one moderately hydrated clump , as it were . This is only a the tip of the iceberg of complexity that is just flour and water . The ratio , the temperature , the type of flour , the way it is treated all matter . The interaction of starch and water is only one important interaction . Another very important and complex interaction is the formation of glutin ( a strong , stretchy protein that forms the primary structure in yeast-raised breads , among may other things ) over time in the presence of water , and with agitation ( as in kneading bread ) .
Many hydrocolloids are very heat tolerant . <URL> Some of the options that might work for you are : <URL> A polysaccharide made from boiling seaweed , agar agar is heat stable up to about 90C . It gels when cooled to 40C . It is inexpensive and easy to find , especially in Asian markets . It would be relatively easy to coat the inside of a cone by heating the agar agar to 90C , cooling it almost to 40C and pouring into very cold cones and pouring out the excess ungelled liquid . Obviously it wo n't work if your liquid is hotter than 90C . <URL> Like agar agar , pectin is a polysaccharide but it is extracted from fruit . Regular , off the shelf , pectin that requires a lot of sugar is HM Pectin . It will melt easily . LM Pectin on the other hand , requires calcium to gel . Once gelled it is heat stable and will not melt again . Unless you have a well stocked specialty pastry supply store handy you may have to buy this online and it will definitely cost more than the agar agar . Sodium Alginate Like LM Pectin , sodium alginate gels in the presence of calcium . Often used to make " caviar " preparations of random liquids . It is easier to find for sale as part of molecular gastronomy kits . It forms a heat stable gel but you 'd have to be creative about how to coat a waffle cone with it . Perhaps you could form a sheet of it and " glue " it into the waffle cone . All in all , if your liquid is cooler than 90C , for cost and ease of use I would recommend going with the agar agar .
Sure ! You can make jerky out of any meat that is n't too fatty . Jerky is just meat that has been flavored and dried . The drying has to be done with care no matter what kind of meat you use , experimentation is playing with food-safety fire . Homemade chicken jerky for dogs was loudly in the news a few years ago because a lot of dogs got sick and even mysteriously died after eating chicken jerky dog treats imported from China . To my knowledge , the mystery has never been solved , but a lot of people started making their own chicken jerky at that point . I have no idea if there is any benefit to using a stewing chicken vs a young chicken for jerky . I rarely see stewing chickens , and if I got a hold of one I 'd stew it , but that 's just me . At least in the US , they are not common . <URL> The USDA does not endorse using any method for drying other than a dehydrator or an oven . They also ( in a step not included in many recipes ) recommend fully cooking the meat or poultry before dehydrating . <URL> Beyond taking proper safety precautions , your choice of meat for jerky is your own . My favorite is salmon .
What will happen is that you will make Escoffier cry . Nothing more . In a more serious tone , the naming of sauces is somewhat arbitrary/tradition driven . There are five mother sauces , Hollandaise being the only emulsion among them . All other sauces are derived for them , making Mayonnaise a Hollandaise derivative . There are hundreds of derived sauces , and the difference is always slight . The use of butter instead of oil ( or the other way round ) would be enough for the result to be considered a completely new sauce , neither mayonnaise nor hollandaise . While it is a common occurence in home kitchens , I do n't think there is an official name for these switched versions . Some cooks even use the name Mayonnaise for a pure water-yolk-veg oil emulsion , without the mustard and vinegar ( for example Ruhlman in Ratio ) . Technically , there is no reason not to do it . The slight difference of water to fat ratio when you are using butter should n't matter . A yolk can emulsify lots of fat , and the amount of fat you use per one part water is mostly a matter of taste . So you can go ahead and substitute butter in a mayonnaise recipe . The taste will be different , but you will be as successful as with a normal mayonnaise . Only remember to serve it warm , I would expect it to harden a bit when cooled .
Ceramic blades can only be sharpened against something that is harder than it is . I would recommend sending it back to the manufacturer for sharpening if needed . Typically it is done using a very hard abrasive wheel because of the risk of the blade breaking , you do not want to do this without proper safety equipment .
Yes.The basic ingredients for both are the same ; the difference lies in how they are cooked .
Yes you can and it is . Google <URL> and you will find plenty of restaurants that actually have it on the menu , like <URL> , <URL> or <URL> . I doubt that a restaurant would ( be allowed to ) have it on the menu if it 's unsafe to eat .
Water freezes at 0 ° C ( or 32 ° F ) , but ethanol freezes at -114 ° C , so you can guess your vermouth with freeze somewhere in between those two temperatures . Noilly Prat is 18 % ABV , or 15 % alcohol by weight , which means it would freeze at around -6 ° C to -7 ° C , or 19-21 ° F. Your freezer may or may not be tuned to be that cold , but if not , you should be able to crank it a bit and get your Noilly Prat just frozen . That said , I would not really recommend leaving an ice cube tray full of vermouth hanging out in your freezer . You may notice that old ice tastes funny . Even though you may not notice your freezer smelling , that 's partly because the cold blocks smells . Just because you do n't notice them does n't mean the odors are n't there to ruin your Noilly Prat . I would recommend leaving them for a day until just frozen ( covered if you like ) , and then moving them to a Ziploc for long term storage . All that said , freezing will not halt oxidation altogether , but it will help , as only the exposed surfaces areas should be able to be oxidized . Since ice cubes by design have a relatively high surface area , you may consider minimizing the exposure to oxygen by other means . If you have a vacuum sealer , using that would be a fairly simple means to limit that exposure , but a similar effect can be done with a simple Ziploc bag , as described <URL> ( note this link is focused on using this technique for cooking , but it is translatable to your scenario ) . Drop your ice cubes in a bag , and then slowly lower the bag into a container of cold water ( the colder the better , here , to minimize melting ) , leaving the seal exposed . I sometimes <URL> things onto the bag to weigh it down as well . Then begin closing the seal , and lower the bag further into the water as you continue sealing , so that only the unsealed portion is exposed . Finally complete the seal and you should have a reasonably low-oxygen environment to mitigate further degradation of your vermouth .
The way you 've described is precisely how I melt chocolate . If you have a double boiler , that 's even better , but a bowl on top of a pot is fine too . I can only think of two things that might be affecting the quality of your end result : Is the bowl big enough ? The melting bowl should be larger than the pot if possible ; you want the steam to be forced under and around it . Is the water temperature reasonable ? You want it to be at a simmer . If it 's rapidly boiling , the heat is too high . As long as you keep those two things in mind , your chocolate should melt fine ! Edit : Thought of one other thing : It 's possible that the steam is actually rising above the bowl , then hitting something ( like your range ) , condensing and then falling back into the bowl as water . You should n't even be getting much steam with this method , but just in case , turn your fan on , to make sure you are n't getting any condensation .
you know better than I do , it depends on the orange and type of orange . My mom , an executive chef , used to say that you 'd allow 1-2 lb of oranges for 1 drinkable cup of orange juice . I really think , that it 's highly dependent on the type of orange . I know naval and blood oranges are the juiciest compared to other varieties .
the amount of flour is likely the culprit . Flour is very sensitive to moisture and can change volume a surprising amount so that the two cups may not be two cups . Also make sure you are not scooping the flour out with your measuring cup , but filling it with another implement before leveling off the top with a straight edge . As you are after a not-quite-bread-like consistency , even though you are using high-gluten flour ( in the bread flour called for ) you do n't want a full bread-like texture Letting the yeast rise Many sweet breads do something similar . Cinnamon buns for example . It again affects the crumb and texture of the final product . It also slows down the yeast as it notes in the recipe when you refrigerate for just a little bit . The rise the next morning should give you nice small bubbles .
You will have the best results if you prep by cutting and blanching prior to freezing . This should ensure that moisture content in the veggies does less damage over time in the freezer and improve color duration . I find it helpful to freeze vegetables separately rather than as mixes as you can always grab from multiple bags , but you ca n't unmix mixed vegetables without more work . The majority of vegetables for stir-fry ( e.g. broccoli , peas , etc ) will freeze well enough , the ones in your freezer aisle obviously freeze a bit better than others . If a vegetable has a high water content ( i.e. lettuce , which I hope you are n't stir-frying with ) that is more integral to its structure than the cellulose it is likelier to burst cell walls in freezing ; these vegetables are better to avoid .
I have had some success with this recipe : <URL> The fish should keep for a couple of weeks once pickled , but I always tend to eat mine in the first few days .
I have a whole freezer full of jalapenos - so yes , you definitely can . They definitely retain their heat just fine . They keep their texture better if you do 2 things : Use a vacuum sealer and take out all the air - to reduce freezer burn . Because of this , I recommend you freeze them in batches . Blanche them for 2-3 minutes in boiling water and then drop them in freezing water . From what I 've read , this destroys a particular enzyme that helps not break the pepper down further . I 've done this and not done this - and doing it definitely helps on the texture . They should be good for a little over a year in a vacuum sealed bag - as far as the texture goes . They should never go bad otherwise . Cos and Sobachatina - bring up another good point : freezing fast and effectively . You can try AB 's method that Cos points out , but I do what Sobachatina does . Freeze on a single layer on a tray in the freezer . They freeze quicker and better than dumping them in a bag .
Based on your description , it looks like you 've made the common error of assuming that equal volume is equal weight . Butter is more dense than flour so the same volume does not equal the same weight ... you must convert the 1/4 cup for each product using a trustworthy site . Here 's one that <URL> and includes both butter and flour . As you can see , 1/4 cup of butter is 57 grams . If you look at the next chart , you see the conversion for flour and you can see that 1/4 cup of flour is only 32 grams ! This means that , if you added 60 grams of each , you 've got twice as much flour ( the thickening agent ) than the recipe calls for ... so of course it 's going to be way too thick . I recommend you start over and be more careful with your conversions . As a note , my standard recipe for Mac and Cheese uses 4 tbsp each of flour and butter ( generally equivalent to 1/4 cup ) while it only calls for two cups of milk rather than three , so I usually have a much thicker white sauce than yours will be and I find it quite enjoyable . The <URL> ( an iconic American cookbook ) recipe calls for the same percentages for their white sauce - 2:2 tbsp of butter/flour with 1 cup of milk . To answer your questions in the comments , pure butter ( rather than spreadable butter/margarine or butter blends ) in the US is usually sold in one pound boxes containing four sticks per box . Each stick is 1/4 pound of butter which is equivalent to 1/2 cup . Each stick is wrapped in waxed paper and has tick marks to show each tablespoon of butter for a total of eight tablespoons . <URL> Occasionally the paper is n't perfectly aligned but it 's usually a simple matter to adjust your cut position to allow for the offset . So , a cup of butter is two sticks , a 1/4 cup of butter is a half stick . and a tablespoon is 1/8th of a stick . Your second question I think comes from a misunderstanding of how thick the white sauce is when completed correctly . With the proper percentages of flour and butter ( and using two cups of milk ) , the final consistency you get is somewhere between thick cream-based soup and thin hummus . Adding the cheese usually does n't effect the thickness because the cheese melts and is about the same consistency as the white sauce . I also like adding softer cheeses that melt well like goat cheese for both flavor and textural reasons . Once baked , the final outcome will be fairly solid and casserole-like . You should be able to cut it with a knife and expect it to hold its shape to a good degree , like this : <URL> This recipe will not make the creamy-style macaroni and cheese ( an example is shown below . That is a different process and is generally not baked . <URL> So that you can see the differences in the recipes of baked and creamy styles I 'll link you to a couple " creamy-style " mac and cheese recipes from other sources . This is a <URL> from Whole Foods Market , an American grocery chain and here 's a <URL> recipe from Serious Eats .
Basically , you can refreeze the raspberries . When a fruit or veg . is frozen , the water inside the plant cell expands , and bursts the cell wall , which is why there is so much ' juice ' when you thaw . If you refreeze , you can be sure that the raspberries will freeze into a giant block . If you are using them to make a sauce or a jam , this is not significant . That being said , if you are using frozen raspberries in the first place , you are obviously not looking for a perfectly intact raspberry , you are using them for some other purpose . Therefor , refreezing is no big deal . I recently answered another question about freezing and refreezing , and how it is basically a myth that it renders the refrozen product inedible . Any time you freeze you know that you are not going to get ' exactly ' the same product when you thaw it , and the same goes with refreezing , there is always a ' slight ' degredation of the product with each successive freeze ( do you like my liberal usage of quotes ? ) You wo n't poison yourself or anything like that , you should have no worries . That being said , what are you doing with the berries ? Certainly a refrozen raspberry should be no worse that a raspberry frozen once .

How can I make omelettes look better ?
It sounds like this is more like scrambled eggs instead of an omelet . It does sound tasty , but I can understand your issue with the coloration . If you 're using orange sweet potatoes , that is likely the biggest cause of the coloration issues . Eggs themselves usually stay yellow when cooked , though they may turn brown if cooked and then left to cool and wait around for a while . ( I do n't normally do that , so I ca n't really say . ) I have a couple possible solutions : 1 ) As Catija suggests , you can try using white sweet potatoes . They have a similar flavor , though a somewhat different nutritional profile . Still very good for you . 2 ) Try shredding the potatoes instead of blending them with the eggs . This is probably the solution I would try first . Shredding will avoid mixing the colors to the extent that blending does , and still allows the potato to spread throughout the omelet/scramble . If you do this , I would shred the potato first ( peel if you want , though the peel has a lot of nutrients in it ) , cook the shreds ( options : baking , sauteing in a little oil or butter , or microwaving - you can try boiling , but it would be more like parboiling as the shreds would only need a minute or two in the water to cook ) . Then you can just stir the shreds in with the eggs ( no blending ) and cook . 3 ) Slice the potatoes , cook ( can cook in the same manner as the shreds , though times will obviously differ ) , cook the eggs like you would a traditional omelet and layer the egg with the potatoes in your dish . Here are a couple resources discussing the different type of sweet potatoes available so you can figure out what would work best for your purpose : <URL> Paleo/Primal site ( I 'm not Paleo , but the site has good images of the different types of sweet potatoes ) : <URL>
A lot depends on what kind of cheese you are making . I will assume that you are making a standard , medium-firm , rennet-set cheese . I have had the most success adding seasonings and herbs with the salt . That is - after the curd has set , been cut , and drained but before it has been pressed at all . Work in the salt and any other flavors before placing the curd in the mold . I imagine any herb or spice would work - it depends what flavor you want . I have used basil when I had a bumper crop . I have also used dried peppers . As to dry or fresh - either would work . As with anything if you use dry then use a lot less . I prefer fresh because it is more tender . Other cheeses might be a little different but as a rule of thumb adding with the salt should work . Mozzarella seems like it would be trickier because the kneading of the curd would change things .
Dry biscuits ( American ' biscuits ' - not cookies ) , or anything other flour based quick bread that dried out - if you 're trying to replicate the bread crumbs . You may be able to get by with a modified muffin recipe as well . You 'll want to avoid fats and oils to reduce the moistness . Yeast bread develops a particular flavor and larger hole structure than quick bread though . The flavor of a quick bread breadcrumbs should be slightly different , but in many dishes the subtle difference wo n't be overwhelming unless the breading is a ' star ' of the dish . The hole structure really does n't matter luckily - as developing that is a large part of the time factor of real bread . Drying it out will be the harder part . The denser structure holds moisture better , so slice it thin and give it low , dry , long heat . Personally , anything that you 're going to make for the purpose of breadcrumbs that is n't just a substitute ( like cereal , crackers , etc in the other answer ) , sounds like it 'd be easier just to make a loaf of fast rise bread to me .
So I have a method that I just worked out but it is insanely labor intensive and only suited to small batches . With that said , here you go . Also , steps will be slightly out of order so make sure you read completely through . To create filled french fries : First , you need to cut your potatoes into slightly larger fries than normal . You are looking for about 1/2 to 2/3 of an inch on each side . You need to preheat your grease to 275 . Once your grease has preheated , parcook the french fries . They should be cooked but not crisped or browned . Lay fries in a layer on a pan and place into fridge . Prepare your injection . I used sour cream but you can add whatever you want . ( I thinned the sour cream down with a little milk till it got to the consistency that I wanted ) Load your injection into a syringe and inject into the now cooled but not cold fries . Do n't over-inject or you will ruin fries left and right . Inject by running the needle fully in , then slowly removing while slowly deploying the filling . As you inject , lay on a pan in the freezer . This is important because you need to get the fries frozen as quick as possible . While you wait , prepare your seasoned flour . I tried some with out the flour and the fries tended to lose the filling . Your are going to be working the fries in small batches . It is imperative that the fries be frozen through , if they are n't you will lose your filling . Toss a handful of fries into the flour and coat thoroughly . Alternately , you can coat fries in an egg wash then flour , but the results were a little too far from traditional fries for me . Toss the fries into 375 degree oil until fries brown and are crisp on outside . You need to watch carefully and as soon as they start floating count to ten then remove . You ca n't over cook them or you will not have any filling remaining . A couple of extras : I do n't know how a filling that is predominately water will work in these , but I would conjecture very poorly given how fries cook . Your hole in the potato is only going to be sealed with flour so you might see some leakage . I could n't figure out a way around that . You benefit from the freezing with a much improved bite texture over my normal fry prep . The final result has a high wow factor , and was pretty tasty . I am not sure the results are worth the effort , but I think if you try a high flavor filling it will go a long way to making it worth while .
You can give your candies hard shells by dipping them into a melted mixture of one part water , two parts sugar , and 1/2 part corn syrup . Melt those ingredients together over medium to medium-high heat until the sugar has totally dissolved and the mixture is at the hard crack stage ( 295-310 & deg ; F. / 146-154 & deg ; C. ) . Remove your pot of glaze from the heat and place it into a waiting metal bowl of ice water . Once the glaze has stopped bubbling , begin dipping your candies immediately . Once dipped , set them on an appropriate , lightly greased surface to cool ( use a flavorless oil or kitchen spray for greasing ) . You 'll want to skewer your candies to dip them ; never attempt to dip candies into hot glaze by hand . You 'll also want to set everything up for dipping before you make your glaze : have your bowl of ice water ready ; have a greased tray or marble slab/counter ready to receive your dipped candies ; have your kitchen to yourself ( distractions are n't good when working with hot glaze ) . Your glaze will cool very quickly , so work carefully but efficiently .
According to <URL> , yes , you can make your own matzo meal by the obvious method of putting some crumbled matzo sheets into the food processor . She notes that you will get about 1/2 cup from two sheets . Farfel can be made simply by breaking the matzo into appropriately sized pieces . <URL> explains that it is easiest to do it by hand to get the uniform size . <URL> even says that is all farfel is : broken up matzo .
You 've pretty much answered your own question . Put the PB in a blender , drizzle in a little peanut oil , blitz and season to taste with salt and a little sugar if you want it . I 'd add them all slowly : you can always add , you ca n't take away .
Spanish hot chocolate and Italian cioccolata fiorentina both use cornstarch as a thickening agent . Both are used more for dipping or sipping ( churros in the former case ) , however you could easily just use less cornstarch to make it more ' drinkable ' . Try a teaspoon of cornstarch , mixed with a little cold water , added to the milk when you boil it . As Kate Gregory suggests , you could also use full-fat milk , or loads of shaved chocolate .
i 've only made seitan myself a couple times , and it 's been awhile , but is n't there a point where you drain it and/or squeeze out some moisture ? if so , maybe an extended sit in some sort of press would help . the times i 've made it , i put it in a smoker afterwards , so it was firm because of the low-heat semi-cooking , i guess .
You can use Chuck to make your shredded beef . Cook it for a long time , at a low temperature , until a probe slides in and out of it with no resistance . Braising in a liquid seasoned with spices like cumin , garlic , and chili powder will get you the flavor profile you want ( I recommend either finding a recipe or some trial and error ) .
Depending on how far overcooked it is , then you might be able to resuscitate it by cutting it into smaller pieces and cooking it low and slow in some liquid . For example , you could use it as the meat in a stew , or slice it thinly and then braise it with some vegetable to make a pot-roast . This also gives you an opportunity to introduce additional flavor , as it sounds as if that may have been lacking as well .
You could try using arrowroot . This is a widely available alternative to cornstarch - it is used in cookery because it does n't turn liquids cloudy like cornstarch does . In your case , it might work better as it also has a more neutral flavour . Substitute 2 tbsps of arrowroot for 1 tbsp cornstarch , and make a slurry with cool water as you would cornstarch . One issue is that overheating can break down the arrowroot , preventing it from thickening , so you are probably better off adding it to the tea after removing it from the heat .
I would likely work the cream cheese first , then try adding the liquids from most to least viscous ( condensed milk , evaporated milk , eggs , vanilla ) If you try to use a mixer with cream cheese and lots of liguid , it 's harder to combine -- you end up getting floating bits of cheese in the liquid ( likely what you mentioned as a ' curdled mess ' ) , rather than it fully encorporating . Having the cream cheese at room temp helps , but is still problematic . It 's possible that you might also want to strain the mixture when you 're done , as the mixer might leave the eggs ' chalaza intact . ( if it 's too thick to easily strain when done , you can either whip the eggs first and strain them before adding them , or just skip this step )
Here is how we made pomme puree at the restaurant I used to work at , for a very well known ( in Canada anyway ) French chef : Peel and boil as many potatoes as you need . Cook until slightly underdone . Run the potatoes through a ricer/food mill . Then -- this is key -- scrape the result through a tami -- a very fine mesh sieve . Most often used for sifting flour . Usually about 14-18 " diameter , looks like a drum . Return resulting potato to a pot , add melted butter , cream , salt , pepper , nutmeg to your desired consistency , stirring all the time . If not serving immediately , chill as fast as possible , and reheat to order in a pan using a little more cream to loosen it up . IMPORTANT : you must work as fast as possible ; the potatoes need to stay hot the whole time or will become gluey .
Real chocolate ( cocoa solids , cocoa powder , and sugar ) is not the best thing for what you want . If properly handled , it can give you a great tasting glaze - but you do n't have the conditions to handle it properly ( slow cooling ) , so you will run into problems with it ( bad texture , sweating , bad looks/dull ) . Also , it wo n't be a really snappy shell . And at this temperature , the good flavor is not very noticeable anyway . What you want to use is cocoa-containing fat glaze . This is the stuff which commercial " chocolate " coated ice cream like the Magnum brand uses . It is sold in supermarkets as " chocolate cake glaze " and similar names , but check the ingredient list to be sure . It should consist of cocoa solids and vegetable fat , possibly some emulsifiers too . You should only melt your glaze , preferably have a low-temperature water bath at your booth ( not full boil ) , and hold the glaze there for dipping . Do n't add milk at all . Milk is a bad choice for chocolate covering anyway . Cream is used for making cake icings called ganache ( mixed with real chocolate , not this glaze stuff ) , but it makes a soft , smeary icing , not a hard , snappy shell . Use the glaze the way it is , without adding anything . This glaze is quite hard at room temperature already . A thin layer of it on a frozen banana should go to below room temperature almost instantly . I think you will have your shell without any special preparation . But I have never done it this way , so I would advise you to experiment . If my hunch is wrong , there still is n't anything you can add - this stuff does n't harden because of anything added , it hardens because at room temperature , it is a hard solid . So your only way to speed hardening is to return the banana to the freezer for a short time . But then you are likely to get a condensation problem , so keep it as short as possible .
If you want more gravy you need to add more liquids and natural flavours . Better if you have bone but ... no bone : Before you roast your beef sear it , so it has good colour when it comes out , deglaze the pan/baking tray with water/red wine/white wine or Madeira one of me faves and put that to one side . ( in the gravy stock pot ) Add onions , carrots and parsnips in with the beef , and touch of water , olive oil and salt . Do n't go mad with the water you 're not poaching the beef !! Just enough to stop the veg burning - 5mm in the bottom ( top up if needed ) . When the beef is ready ( 55C internal temp = medium rare <URL> ) take it out of the tray , put the root veg to one side and and add the remains to your gravy stock pot . Sear the bottom of the roast with a little oil ( it 'll be a bit soggy from sitting in the veg ) then put it aside to rest ( 5-10 mins if you 're in a hurry 15-30 for 3kg will come out lush ! ) deglaze again adding the resulting jus to your stock pot , which now had a wealth of flavour . Use that stock pot to create a beast of a gravy ! Make it in the usual manner , if you keep the onions in they 'll make it thicker and tastier - a stick blender with give you a smoother texture if that 's what you like !
It really depends on what you are looking for in a cooking class . I can give you some thoughts from my own personal experiences , but I am sure there are many factors that you must consider , so you will get a variety of answers . I am assuming you are talking about recreational ( that is the industry term , as opposed to professional ) classes ; I do n't claim to have good advise for choosing professional programs to become a line cook or patisserie on a career path to being a chef or pastry chef . Facilities The cooking school should tell where their class is taught . A local community class in a high school home-ec room or in a community center will usually offer basic facilities ( although I imagine some will stun you ... ) Commercial cooking schools or businesses should have photos of their classroom for you to peruse , and will usually brag about the equipment they offer ( such as Viking stoves ... ) Look at the pictures , and ask if the environment will be comfortable for you . Level How advanced is the class ? If you already know how to temper your own chocolate , and own three dipping forks , you do n't want to take a basic workshop in chocolate . On the other hand , if you have never made a biscuit , you might not want to take an advanced pasty course where croissants and puff pastry the order of the day . Choose a class that is at the level you desire -- the course guide should make this very clear . Cleanup Find out if the school has interns , or other staff who do the cleanup . Commercial schools tend to -- otherwise , you might expect to be helped police and do dishes , especially in a community program like one hosted at a community center . You should be comfortable with the expectation . Curriculum or Menu Good cooking classes list exactly what dishes or items will be taught in the class in their class guide or curriculum . They should also specify the lessons learned or techniques applied . Often there is a theme , like " Valentines Dinner for Two " or " Pastry Intensive " Select classes that teach the techniques you want , and dishes you like . Duration Is it a one evening class , where you are in and out , and little is at risk , or a week long adventure where if you do n't enjoy the format or the instructor , you have lost a week 's tuition and a week 's enjoyment . I once did n't come back from lunch on the 2nd day of a five day course because I did n't like the instructor 's style . For longer classes , you might ask for guarantees of a partial refund if the instructor or style or presentation is not to your liking , before signing up . For day long and longer classes , find out if lunches or other relevant meals are provided ( at commercial schools , they often are , either cooked as part of your curriculum , or done by staff or interns for your enjoyment ) , or whether you bring your own . Often there is not enough time to go out for lunch . Presentation and Participation There are several main ways cooking classes are taught ; you want to be sure the style is one that you enjoy . Presentation only -- the instructor prepares dishes at the front of the room , and the students watch . Kind of like a cooking show on TV , but live and in person , so you can smell ( and maybe taste afterwards ) , and ask questions . Each person ( or group ) prepares some -- the class is broken up into groups or individuals , each of whom prepare one or more dishes from the menu . You might not get to do the dish you wanted from the curriculum , but you will get hands-on for something . Usually , the groups will share afterwards , so you get to taste everything . Every person ( or group ) prepares everything -- you will get to prepare everything listed in the curriculum , and usually eat it . Choose a format you are comfortable with , especially if you want to be sure you get to try a specific dish hands-on . Pacing When you evaluate the curriculum or menu , the manner of presentation , and the overall duration of the course , you should have some idea of how fast it goes . Make sure you are comfortable with the pace . If you like a slow and pleasant pace , you do n't want to be a in class where folks are expected to knock out their dishes fast -- although those are often more the advanced classes at commercial schools . Ingredients Find out whether you bring your own ingredients , or they are supplied . ( Most commercial cooking schools supply them , but community programs may not . ) Cost Cost counts . Need I say more ? General Talk to the folks at the school 's customer service line ( if they have one ) if you have questions . Take a short class at the school to evaluate the facilities and their general style before splurging on a longer or more expensive class . And bring your patience . By the nature of the beast , you often sit through things you know , or repetitions , or have to wait through lectures and demos before the hands-on portion . If you can , bring a friend to share the experience , gossip with , and generally have a good time , should you be so disposed . Bon
I second the recommendation for Lukas Volger 's <URL> . I 've been working my way through it and have made several of the recipes so far , all of which have been good . However , I would say that not all of the recipes in the book work well for the grill . I 've been doing everything vegan from the Volger book with mixed results . Many of the recipes use eggs , but you can do them with just breadcrumbs and water as the binder . They come out pretty delicate that way and are better in a skillet and then baked , as Volger recommends . His tofu and chard burgers use some tofu that has been browned then pureed as binder . This works ok , but the burgers came out quite delicate ( but still delicious ) . Silken tofu pureed in the food processor gets a thick , creamy texture that could also be used as a binder . Eggs are by far the most common binder as they may be the best edible binder there is , since they are basically liquid protein , but obviously not vegan . For delicate burgers , I use this <URL> on the grill , which works great . You can find something similar at most kitchen stores . Another binder option is steamed rice , prepared like you would for sushi . It gets sticky and makes a great binder , though they 'll still be a bit delicate . I 've been making the beet , brown rice and black bean burger recipe from Volger 's book . I add bbq sauce and a paste of pureed rehydrated prunes , similar to the veggie burger at Hillstone/Houston 's restaurant and they come out really great . They work fine right on the grill , though refrigerating them overnight makes them a little sturdier . Another option is adding vital wheat gluten and water , aka raw seitan dough . This is what is done in the <URL> black bean burger recipe . I tried these straight on the grill also and they stayed together perfectly , as well as any commercial veggie burger . However , they were a little bland and could use some more seasoning . I have n't tried any of these in burgers , but some common binders in vegan baking are peanut butter , apple sauce and <URL> . I bet peanut butter would work well in a burger with flavors that work with peanut , like Thai flavors or chipotle . Falafel-style burgers also do n't need any binders , they stick together pretty well and can be grilled , though you may want to use a grill grid or something similar . Lastly , you can put a cast iron skillet or pizza stone on the grill - it 's common now for grilled pizza and will work for delicate burgers .
I 've found a <URL> on Walmart.com that has some interesting tidbits . For functionality alone , looks like a glass jar should do the job well . Something like this would have an advantageous shape to make cookies easier to reach , and the jar less prone to falling . One feature you may want to look for specifically would be an hermetic sealing lid , which would help keep moisture in the jar and slow down the drying . Same kind of jar that is often used to store flour , sugar , coffee , beans , etc. . Is light sensitivity a factor ? I do n't think it would be , in most cases , unless you kept your cookies in an area that is heavily lit by the sun .
The problem could be the recipe . If you 're using a lot of lemon juice , then a lot of sugar to cover up all that acidity , you 're guaranteed to end up with something pretty soft . Have a look around at other lemon sorbet recipes , and see if you 're using relatively more . But if your recipe is sane , then it could be your process . Here 's how it could mess things up . Sorbet is basically sugar water with a bit of flavor . When it freezes all the way , unless it was churned as it froze , there 's going to be a tendency for it to separate into ice crystals and even stronger sugar water . Some of this may happen in your first freezing step . Then you 're pulverizing it in a food processor , probably giving it a chance to melt a bit . This is much worse than just leaving it out , since once it 's in tiny bits , there 's a lot more surface area exposed to air , and you 're continuously mixing it , bringing in warm air , and so on . Then finally , it refreezes . The part that managed to melt in the meantime is going to repeat the earlier process , except now there 's lots of space , so it 's even easier for ice crystals to form and force out the sugar . So I 'd definitely expect a tendency to end up with a runny sugar syrup component to your " sorbet " . ( If it 's at all grainy , this is probably what 's happening . ) If you 're determined to do this without any kind of ice cream maker , it 's going to be hard to avoid problems . You can certainly try to correct for it by using less sugar , though . You could also just make a granita - freeze it on a sheet , and scrape it off to serve .

Source of smoky flavor in salsa ?
Chipotle chiles , especially in adobo sauce ( e.g. , <URL> ) , give an excellent smoky flavor . You should be able to find these in your grocery store in the Mexican section .
The heat is the same ; all peppers contain <URL> . The <URL> defines heat in terms of capsaicin content . Use the peppers that have the flavor you want , and make it as hot as you want , and you 'll be set . And the flavor besides heat is definitely concentrated in the flesh , so you should n't notice any real difference in pepper flavor either .
The smoky flavour of barbecued foods is best achieved through burning lump charcoal or hardwood . In the scenario you 're describing , yes , burning hardwood and then cooking over the coals would give you a smoky flavour Store bought briquettes actually probably give you less of a smoky flavour because instead of using wood , many briquettes use other materials/binders that do n't give you the smoky flavour you want .
It is used extensively in Indian cooking . I have one book , <URL> that calls for it in virtually every recipe , and each time reminds you to cut the amount down by 3/4 's if you ca n't find Yellow Cobra brand . It does indeed have a flavor someone reminiscent of aged garlic . It is thought to have medicinal value as well ( see the wikipedia article for details ) .
The weight of flour varies immensely depending on how densely it 's packed and the humidity . If you 've started with a weight-based recipe , I 'd try to find a scale . If that 's absolutely not an option , I tend to approximate 100g = 1 cup . Be warned , I 've found some recipes that are really sensitive to the amount of flour and the difference between a lightly sifted cup and a scooped cup can really throw off the results . You might do better to try to divide another kg package of flour evenly and use the approximation that 0.6 lb is about 0.25 kg ( i.e. one quarter of the bag ) .
Main reason that comes to mind is , for the same reason compound butter 's flavour improves over a couple of days : infusion . Fat can be infused with flavour , and holds flavour incredibly well , but it needs a little time ( viscosity of fat vs water ) . Otherwise the fat in Serrano Ham would taste just like it would on day one . By holding your mix/custard overnight you are allowing the coffee or vanilla flavours get infused into the mix . You can somewhat accelerate this by letting the vanilla sit in hot ice-cream mix for 1hr as suggested by many pastry chefs ( e.g. Simple French Desserts , Jill O'Conner ) . I suspect the acceleration is due to the lower viscosity of fat at higher temperatures . The taste does follow the physics here were the higher the viscosity the longer infusion ( read equilibrium ) takes . Serrano ham : two years . Hot deep fryer oil : seconds . By the way , when it comes to ice-cream , they also recommend aging your mix/custard for up to 48 hours . It may be worth the experiment to sous-vide your ice-cream batter/mix at say 55C for a couple of hours and compare taste with the over-night version . Although mouthfeel may play a role in this case , the ' flavour improves over time ' effect is present even when crystallization is not happening .
By maximising first the flavour of every single nut and then maximising the surface : Gently roast the cashews , then grind them finely . If the resulting " gritty " texture is not to your taste , grind them further until you get a nut butter , which should dissolve nicely especially in cream-type soups .
There are several major factors that affect the texture of ice cream or gelato in the absence of stabilizers or gums : Air mixed in during the churning essentially creates a foam , which is softer than a solid product would be . While this air may be only 10 % by volume , it makes a huge difference in texture . The churning and rapid freezing also minimizes the size of ice crystals , so the non-air phase is essentially a syrup of sugary water with emulsified milk fat , with very small ice crystals suspended in it . Since it is not solid , it is easier to cut . The serving temperature for gelato I believe is traditionally warmer than the serving temperature of ice cream , which provides a softer texture ( more syrup , less ice ) allows the flavors to be perceived more easily as they are more aromatic at warmer temperatures . The gelato may contain ingredients with alcohol , such as Franglico in a hazelnut gelato ; this contributes a small anti-freeze effect . Similarly , the pectins from some fruit ingredients will also naturally interfere with ice crystal formation -- but these influences are specific to a given recipe . The lower milkfat percentage makes the flavors in the gelato more apparent , since they are not drowned out by the richness of the diary .
Agar ... derived from seaweed . Used in McDonald 's milk shakes because it 's vegetarian and cheap , lab petri dishes and vegetarian cooking . Does n't have a flavour . You can find it in health food stores but I think many grocery stores are carrying it these days . Heat it up in water like gelatin and when it cools you have jelly . You could use Arrowroot to give a slight thickening for texture or even cornstarch but I 'm thinking those wo n't give you quite what you 're looking for though Arrowroot will be closer . I think there is a Chia seed gelatin too but do n't have any first hand experience with it . Chia seeds when soaked in water give off this thick gelatenous substance , very weird to see it happen . Ask about it at the Health food store too . Here 's a website for a few more substitution ideas . <URL> Good luck !
From a cooking perspective any imitation sauce or marinade is never going to deliver the quality that venison has to deliver . We have a massive deer farm close and the price is still ridiculous . My suggestion is that you find a good butcher that will age beef for you on the bone , or you could age it yourself if you have a climate control area to keep it at the correct temperature . Anything over 30 days on the bone will start to give you the gaming flavour you are craving . Nothing is going to match deer , but aged beef or really any type of cattle ( eg buffalo etc ) will give you the gaminess if it is aged . Restaurants are getting up to 180 days , which I could only imagine would melt in your mouth but the flavour would be intense .
Cumin is most often used ground , yes . You can , if you prefer -- and as in common in Indian and other cuisines -- toast it first until it is fragrant ( a minute or two in a dry skillet at medium heat ) . Then , grind it in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle .
The smoke flavour will definitely impart into the oil and you will have to cook the wings separately to achieve the desired flavour difference . Cheers Dean
The chai tea latte at Starbucks is made from the <URL> concentrate . This product is available at supermarkets and online , and is mixed with milk to make a product not unlike what you have at Starbucks ( minus the foam , as you pointed out ) . So , what are these flavors ( say , if you wanted to make this from scratch ) ? The website mentions that the black tea is malty . You could likely reproduce that with a maltier tea like Assam , though the box also says a " a rich blend of flavorful teas " , meaning that a stronger blend like English Breakfast might be a closer match . It looks like you are on the right track with the spices as well : cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , and cloves are all listed , though the website mentions black pepper , star anise , and vanilla in addition , which ought to lift your cup of chai a bit as well .
I 'd stew the raspberries down with a little water ( and sugar if the raspberries are n't sweet ) until they 're very soft , then pass the whole thing through a sieve to remove the seeds . You can then either store the result in the fridge , or pour it into an ice cube tray for easy portioning and a nice cold smoothie .
The dried powder in a can is your best bet , short of grating a fresh root . Though an overlingering burn is n't your thing , try pinch of cayenne in the wasabi mix to lend sweetness and more ka-boom . Generous wasabi and some <URL> are my favorite sushi companions .
actually seafood 's country origin does make a very relevant difference . Why ? ocean floor type , water tempearture , tradewinds , upwelling and feed availability . Best octopus comes from Spain and Portugal ( actually portuguese octopus is the best ) Viet , China , Indonesia or Mexican octopus live in hot water . Portuguese coast has a very mild water temp , from 10 C to 20 C and a lot of sun exposure that triggers phytoplankton blooms . I could expand on this as I am a professional fisherman . Now , any country can import any seafood from anywhere and then label it as " theirs " so one must know which species are native to a certain location . Sustainability is also very imnportant and both Portugal and Spain are EU members where sustainability is a very serious matter .
According to at least <URL> that I 've found , you can just wrap in aluminum foil instead . That would imply , to me , that they 're not used for any ( significant ) flavor . The recipe does use a single banana leaf for flavor , but Ti leaves for the outer wrapping . Using foil may not give you the exact same results , but it might be " close enough " for people who do n't actually live in Hawaii .
What you are describing is often worst when the vegetables are thrown together without care as to what vegetables will do well stewed for a while , and which vegetables only need to be heated through and will suffer if they are cooked longer . A great example of that is in the case of typical " frozen mixed vegetables " . Carrots are never nicely tender in mixtures like that . Lima beans are downright chalky and peas are total mush . If you want to use frozen vegetables , avoid mixtures . Pick the vegetables that you actually enjoy , and add them to your soup at a time appropriately distant from the time that you actually want to serve the soup . So bring lima beans to a hard simmer before you add corn , bring that to a hard simmer before you add frozen potatoes , add frozen carrots , bring that to a hard simmer before you finally add peas just before you serve - your soup will be better than emptying a bag of mixed vegetables into broth .
I probably would not recommend eating a box of baking soda and chasing that with shots of vinegar . But aside from that silliness , I ca n't think of a single thing that is actual " food " that is unsafe mixed with another actual " food " , assuming reasonable quantities . Certainly anything with alcohol can be dangerous in huge quantities , as can a lot of other ingredients . Allergies or food sensitivities can make certain ingredients dangerous to certain people . But mixing ingredients to which the individual has no special sensitivity and in normal quantities ? No , I do n't think you are risking anything by doing so other than unpleasant food .
Toasted nuts keep their flavor pretty well , the way to keep them is the same way you 'd buy them at the store , ie a sealed container . What you get from freshly toasting nuts is more aromatics than flavors . Most of the aromatics go pretty quick so there 's no preserving them , it 's use 'em or lose 'em . Could you substitute pre-toasted nuts ? Sure , it wo n't be quite the same , but it will be close .

When should I use convection when baking ?
We have a convection oven and almost always use it . I ca n't remember the last time we did n't use convection . Our model automatically decreases the temperature , so if you set it for 300 , then it will heat to 275 . Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number , but it seems to work . Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven . Our also has a single and multi-rack mode , and it circulates the air differently in that case . We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative . I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven , but in our case , we always use it ( except for broiling of course ) .
I 'd say it is a " matter of taste , " literally , because what comes out will change depending on how you process the vegetables . For example , despite the common use of carrots in stock , I feel like many chefs do n't actually want a real " carroty " flavor in stock . Quartering or roughly chopping a carrot is enough to give them plenty of " carrot notes " in their optimum flavor . Thus , my theory is that chefs often follow their particular chopping pattern to produce the balance of flavor that they want . If you chop things more finely , you may actually alter that balance . Anyhow , if your goal is maximum flavor extraction , then you 'll need to chop your carrot into finer pieces . ( You may then find that you need less carrot in your mix of vegetables . ) Other vegetables like onions do n't necessarily need fine chopping , since they already exist in relatively thin layers to allow circulation . If you quarter an onion , the liquid will already be able to infiltrate -- if you want even greater circulation , just break up those quarters into layers as you throw the onion in . And things like herbs , etc. do n't generally need to be chopped at all : just throw in whole sprigs , and they 'll provide most of their flavor after simmering even for a brief time . I would note that simmering time is also an issue here . Most chefs do n't cook vegetable stock for longer than an hour or so , since there 's no benefit ( as there is with meat stocks , where it can take hours for collagen to break down , etc. ) . In fact , by simmering too long , you can actually break down some of the more subtle flavor components , lose them to evaporation , or bury them in the more generic " overcooked " vegetable flavors . Thus , some recommend adding finely-textured herbs only briefly toward the end . ( That 's also the reason why a small amount of fresh herbs are often added as a garnish to a finished dish ; the flavor is greater and more noticeable than if they were cooked in for a long time . ) I 'm therefore somewhat skeptical of the method that used a blender before cooking , since that would cause a very fast breakdown of the vegetables and potentially unbalance the flavors . ( Some people do puree the vegetables after simmering and add them back for a more hearty or thicker broth/soup . ) In general , I 'd plan on simmering vegetable stock until the various vegetables are " done " ( soft ) and then going a bit longer , tasting it periodically until the flavor is rich and full . Chopping finer will release more flavor faster , but there is a limit because things will rapidly get " overcooked . " At that point you 'll be releasing less of the " bright " and " fresh " vegetable flavors that you get early on ; these flavors may start to break down or get lost , and eventually you 'll have more of a generic " vegetable mush " flavor .
Depending on what it is I am transporting I use different methods , and I use the same methods for both hot and cold transport . The easiest is the towels in a box ; lay four towels down in a shallow box , hanging the other ends of the towels out each side of the box , then put your dish or bread or pot or whatever in the box and fold each of the four towels over the food . If you have hot food , lay some more insulation material over the top , as heat rises . If you have cold food , put the box on the seat , not the floor , as the floor will conduct heat from your vehicle up into your food . I always have a sleeping bag in my rig and I will sometimes wrap food well with towels and then open the sleeping bag and shove the food into it , wrapping the rest of the sleeping bag over the top if hot food and under the bottom if cold . This has worked a lot for frozen foods when I go bulk shopping in the city , holding food frozen food for 4 hours and more .
Wine vinegar and wine are very different although are produced from the same thing . Wine vinegars are vinegars produced from fermenting wine by acetic acid bacteria which convert the ethanol in wine into acetic acid . Being a vinegar , it is much sharper than wine although like wine many flavours can be detected beyond the generic sharp lemon-like flavour , particularly in the premium aged varieties such as balsamic vinegar from Modena . Wine vinegar has no alcoholic content in it and so there is no need to ' burn off the alcohol ' which you would do when cooking with wine . Wine has a much subtler flavour and so would use it in things like gravies , sauces , etc. . Likewise , vinegar is much stronger and I would mainly use it in vinaigrettes or in small quantities in cooking ( ie finishing of a dish with a small drizzle of vinegar ) in much the same way as you might use lemon .
I agree that , in general , other squashes can be substituted for pumpkin . I have tried some different types of squashes but obviously there are many more that I have n't tried . There are definitely differences in flavor - these will obviously change a dish but not ruin it . The biggest differences I have run into are water content and texture . When roasting squash the cooking time might need to be adjusted to obtain a product with the needed consistency . Using pie as an example - I have had to adjust my cooking to avoid a runny pie filling . Obviously in some recipes , such as soup , this wo n't be as important . Some squash , such as spaghetti , have stringy textures that would be odd where smooth pumpkin is expected .
It does n't matter in which modality ( banking , simmering ) you bring the meatballs up to temperature , only that you do . Normally , if you are cooking them in the oven first , it is for browning generate additional flavor . Otherwise , you could simply simmer them from the beginning , which is perfectly viable .
You can reuse parchment paper several times for your cookies ( it also works for other dry dishes ) , depending on cooking time and temperature , with no problem . Change the paper when it gets dirty , dark and/or brittle as it may crumble beyond this point . I always do so with no difference in the results , saving both on money and waste .
Baking powder , especially if too great a quantity is used , adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good . Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly does n't do anything to enhance the flavor . Many baked goods traditionally do n't use a chemical leavener at all , but instead rely on technique . Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created . Yeast , on the other hand , creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread . Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes ( <URL> , for example , although many " knock off " recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness ) . Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network ( usually something you absolutely do n't want in a quick bread or quick cake ) -- you do n't get a crumb with big , airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid . Also , in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge . The shelf life is not so different . If yeast scares you , you may want to check out some of the proponents of the <URL> technique . For a lot more information on this subject , there is a recent publication that covers all sorts of <URL> .
The USDA <URL> that " all plastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time . Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves , they should be discarded . " Other advice they offer for avoiding food contamination from cutting boards : Avoid Cross-Contamination The Meat and Poultry Hotline says that consumers may use wood or a nonporous surface for cutting raw meat and poultry . However , consider using one cutting board for fresh produce and bread and a separate one for raw meat , poultry , and seafood . This will prevent bacteria on a cutting board that is used for raw meat , poultry , or seafood from contaminating a food that requires no further cooking . Cleaning Cutting Boards To keep all cutting boards clean , the Hotline recommends washing them with hot , soapy water after each use ; then rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels . Nonporous acrylic , plastic , or glass boards and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher ( laminated boards may crack and split ) . Both wooden and plastic cutting boards can be sanitized with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented , liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water . Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes . Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels .
The absolute time a stock will take depends on the quantity of stock you are making and also on the ratio of solids to liquid with which you started ( along with the strength of your burner , the starting temperature of the water , the geometry of your pot , ... ) . Intentional variation is also possible depending on your intended use . The best advice I 've heard comes from Judy Rodgers in the Zuni Cafe Cookbook : taste the stock often as it cooks , more and more freqently as it starts to taste good . When it does n't taste better than the last time you checked , it 's done .
I feel your pain . If only I liked summer squash better ... You definitely can freeze squash -- thick slice it , blanch it in salty water briefly until almost tender , transfer to an ice bath until it 's chilled , bag it , and put in the freezer . Later , thaw and use with recipes that do n't require ultra-crisp squash .
According to <URL> it appears that your notion about it being protein-based is correct . Most of the recipes I 've seen say to skim it ; the above-linked site says that adding a little oil will keep the foam down . I personally would n't do anything with it as an ingredient unless I had a truly massive amount of it to experiment with -- I do n't know enough about the properties to make anything other than wild guesses about how it would work . The only similar material I can think of would be beaten egg whites , but unless you were desperate for a vegan alternative and were already boiling up vats full of chickpeas I 'd just use the eggwhites .
Cooking temperature and time are determined by a number of factors . The idea is to get the inside of the product properly cooked before the outside dries out , becomes tough , or becomes unpleasantly dark or even burned . At the same time , you usually want the product to get nicely browned ( adds flavor and looks nice ) before the inside is overcooked . So it 's a balance . Factors which influence appropriate temperature and time include : ingredients : High protein ingredients ( like meat or eggs ) easily become tough when overcooked . High sugar or starch recipes will tend to brown or burn more easily . moisture level : For some products , such as popovers or many kinds of pastry , steam is an important leavening agent , and a high temperature is called for . In other products , like cookies , one of the goals of baking is to drive off excess moisture . And in still others , moisture is absorbed into the other ingredients . shape : A fat , round loaf will usually need a longer cooking time and lower temperature than a thin , flat pizza or a long , skinny baguette because it takes longer for the center of the loaf to heat up . pH : Changing the pH of the product will change how it browns . leavening : Some chemical leavening , like double-acting baking powder , activates at a certain temperature . personal preference : At the end of the day , the most important factor is whether you like the way the product turned out . If you like a crispier crust , change the temperature and/or cooking time to suit your taste . Any baking recipe should specify the temperature and cooking time , unless perhaps it 's from a book that specifies those things for a number of recipes at once . If not , find a similar recipe and use the temperature specified there , but keep a close eye on the product during the baking process . Learn how to tell when the product is done . For cakes , you usually go by color for the outside , and by temperature or using a toothpick or wooden skewer for the inside . ( Briefly : poke a wooden toothpick into the center of a cake ; if it comes out with wet batter , keep cooking ; if it comes out clean and dry , it 's probably overcooked ; if it comes out with a few crumbs stuck to it , it 's probably perfect . )
The magic word is " water " - the dough needs sufficient moisture to stay moist while it expands to one big pocket and enough to generate the steam to make that pocket . Most people when doing doughs make them too dry because they 're easier to work with . As the dough rests , it will pull together more . Ideally make your doughs for this kind of bread slightly wetter than you think and then check it after its been mixed for 30 minutes or so . Additionally , as you knead and then in the fermentation stage it will firm up some . Difference in water content of the dough causes many of the consistencies for bakers . It will also depend on how much it dries after its been rolled so thin - keep it covered . Alternatively , if you 've put your first one in and found out its too dry , then try <URL> and let it rest there for 5 minutes or so . I tested batches with spritzing and without , and so long as there 's enough water in your dough and the oven is hot enough to make the steam - it does n't seem to matter . Every one came out perfect .
It 's definitely just a matter of preference . I 'd expect the vegetables from the stock to be overcooked for my tastes , I like a little texture in my soup .
From Greenfootsteps ' " <URL> " : Pick elderberries when they are fully ripe in early autumn . The bunches should be starting to droop downwards with the weight of the fruit . Use a fork or your fingers to gently prise the fruit away from the stalks . This can be a bit fiddly but you do n't have to be too perfect with it - a few bits of stalk will not matter .

I usually assume that if the bottle does n't specify ( and you bought it off a shelf , not out of a refrigerated area ) , then it 's safe to store in the cupboard . You can also ask at the store if you want to be sure , though I suspect unless it 's a small , specialty store with knowledgeable personnel , they will err on the side of caution and just tell you to refrigerate it . For your specific examples : Soy sauce is definitely fine to store in the cupboard , though some brands will recommend refrigeration for " best quality " . Fish sauce I 'd usually store in the fridge once opened .
There are no real doneness rules on mirepoix per se ( even raw is used in some dishes ) . However , the recipe designer may say sweat versus sauté to give an indication of colour and flavour depth to match the ' headliner ' of the dish ( usually the meat ) . Although not a rule , you may generally see sweat used more for lighter meats like fish and fowl and sauté for darker and gamier meat like beef and lamb . That way a darker and more browned mirepoix will not overwhelm say a delicate fish ( both in colour and taste ) .
Onions always benefit from a few minutes on their own to soften and start sweetening . Garlic burns easily , especially when finely chopped or crushed , so in general should not be fried as long as onion . Having said that , when doing a quick stir fry or similar dish , you can throw in the garlic first for 10-20 seconds so that it flavours the oil .

Sous-vide without a pump using convection ?
What you will be dealing with is called stratification . Given a reasonable volume of water the difference can be quite remarkable . A one metre height of water can stratify water from 20 ° C to 95 ° C as long as the water is not disturbed and heated gently , even if heated from the bottom The simple solution is to regularly stir the water , say once every five minutes . This would be OK for items only requiring an hour in sous-vide , but for much longer this can get rather tedious If you are targeting temperatures in the 40 ° C to 65 ° C range a small aquarium pump would suffice to stir the water . Arrange the intake tube nearly floating on top , and the output tube weighted on to the bottom . At a pinch an aquarium bubbler would help significantly too . Both these devices will cool the water somewhat , but a stove top heater should be able to keep up Example : Using a small bubbler in a large , well-insulated chest ( Rubbermaid cooler , Esky , chilly bin etc. ) with around 10 l of water at 60 ° C , keeps the temperature within 1 ° C from top to bottom . Heat loss is around 1 ° C per 30 minutes . By adding about 0.5 l of 95 ° C water every 30 minutes it keeps the temperature constant over a few hours To get precise temperature control within ± 0.5 ° C which some sous-vide recipes recommend , you will need a <URL> controller . For general home use with temperature control or ± 3 ° C you could get away with a stove top heater , with accurate power control and a thermometer control system . <URL> , so you might as well add that to your controller too
You want to use a gentle heating method . For this sort of thing , I prefer steaming . It will gently bring up the heat of your food without wringing the moisture out of it . This is especially helpful if it 's already cut into relatively small portions , such as slices of breast meat . Spread everything out on a single layer on the steamer basket before hand . Warming drawer would be my second choice . Slice , add a few teaspoons of water , and cover and add to your warming drawer , set to your target temperature .
Yes , you can . In professional kitchens , virtually all ovens are convection , and they work just fine . You may need to reduce the heat about 25 degrees .

The process of pasteurizing milk is to treat it with heat to kill microorganisms such as Brucella , Campylobacter , E. coli O157 : H7 , Listeria , Mycobacterium bovis , Salmonella , and Yersinia that may or may not be in the milk . This is a precautionary step that is taken when you are not 100 % sure whether your source of milk is disease free . Pasteurization can occur at different temperature for a different amount of time but the easiest temperature to pasteurize milk in the microwave is to bring it to 161 F for at least 15 seconds . Pasteurizing the milk in the microwave is a bit tricky because overheating it make cause it to boil over and it also heats the milk very unevenly . In the worse case scenario it can curdle if you overheat it . You will need to buy a thermometer for this method . You first want to microwave the milk for a minute . Then you want to stir the milk and take a temperature reading from the stirred milk . Now you want to continue to put the milk in the microwave in short 15-30 second intervals ( decreasing as it gets closer to 161 F ) and stirring and taking the temperature reading each time . When it has finally reach 161 F , you want to heat it for 15 extra seconds in the microwave and at that point it should be pasteurized . Another thing you can do is to just pasteurize it at home using your usual stove method and store the milk for later use . Once it has been pasteurized , as long as you refrigerate the milk , it will be good for a while . Just remember to quickly chill the milk ( using a ice water bath ) after you pasteurize it before you put it into the refrigerator .
This is what we figured out at Serious Eats : <URL> In sum , use more sugar , whip the cream , freeze in icecube trays and run through a Cuisinart at the end .
I do not think that there is a better way they not to squeeze the lemon until you need them :D Regardless , if you want to do testing and are concerned about the bitter notes that develop , I recommend doing the research with grapefruit instead as it turns bitter is a matter of minutes and has a much stronger bitter flavor then the lemons do . That way you at least have a shorter turn around time .
In the <URL> , Madhur says one of the few uses she 's found for a plain microwave oven is to roast cashews . She dresses them in a little bit of oil , then spreads them out on a plate in a single layer and cooks them in the microwave oven until they turn brown . I assume dressing them in a little bit of oil helps browning . I found <URL> for cashews and other nuts , but which implies the oil contained in the nuts themselves is enough to get them to brown . And finally , about.com has a page which is specifically about <URL> .
The searing applied after sous-viding should not be enough to alter the temperature of the meat notably . All you 're trying to do with the sear is create the flavorful crust on the outside of a piece of meat via the Maillard reaction , not accomplish any cooking of the interior of the meat itself . This is best done by applying very high heat for a very short amount time , usually just a few seconds . Some like doing this via pan-searing or on a very hot grill , but I usually use a high-powered blowtorch . The important thing is that you not sear for so long that interior of the meat has a chance to notice . A perfectly sous-vided piece of meat should be a uniform color throughout , except for a heavily seared crust . There should n't be any gray band of over-cooked meat under the crust . Avoiding that is why you 're sous-viding in the first place . Also , I find 125-130 ° F to be a touch on the rare side . For a good medium rare , 133-135 ° F gives me better results .
I always reserve a bit of pasta water to add it to the pan . The reason is simple : if you drain your pasta and add it to the sauce the pasta will suck up all the sauce and become a bit dry . Adding the pasta water ensures that your pasta will remain moist . Also yes , it helps thickening the sauce ( this does not necessarily apply to tomato sauce ) . Now , let 's be clear : you DO NOT add your pasta water to the sauce when you are preparing the sauce . You only add it when you put your pasta in the sauce . It also helps if you do n't drain the pasta , just take it out of the boiling water ( using tongs , ofc ) and put it in your sauce while still on the stove . A quick 30-50 secs stir and that 's it . Hope this helps . PS : 1/2 cup seems like a lot to me . For two portions of pasta I usually add around 3 tablespoons .

There is an excellent answer to this question on the Physics SE : <URL> I will summarise what I think is the most cogent part here . This does work up to a point . The bubbles formed by boiling water are filled with steam , so if anything colder than the steam ( ie < 100 ° C ) touches a bubble the steam will immediately condense and the bubble will collapse . Therefore provided the surface of your spoon is cold , it will help to prevent boiling over . If it 's a long boil and the spoon heats up to 100 ° C it will no longer work . This is why a wooden spoon is recommended : metal would heat up too quickly .
One trend I 've seen recently is making tea broths/sauces for meats , fishes , etc. . . Besides being a good use for tea , this has the double effect of giving off the tea 's natural aroma when presented to the eater as opposed to simply using the tea to crust a meat - where you would n't really get any tea flavor until you actually bit in . I 've also seen people smoking meats with tea leaves and such . I have n't tried this myself to see if the results are worth the trouble ( aka - if you can actually taste the tea flavor ) . I would also try poaching various items in a matcha tea poaching liquid . For example : Water Sugar + salt Matcha tea powder Peppercorns Bay leaves Whatever else sounds good to you . You could use this to poach chicken and fish . Lastly , do n't be afraid to add it to soups ! Carrot-ginger soup would benefit from the addition of some matcha powder .

Nope . Haha :) Brining will give you a softer texture . I have brined duck for varying times ( depending on how much of a rush I was in ) and brining really does help with the texture . You can sear it beforehand , some Maillard reaction will help in flavour development , but when I cook sous vide for more than 8 hours , I do n't bother : the meat will go green/grey , which means I need to sear afterwards anyway . So I usually just sear at the end . If your meat does n't have that much fat , or anything to keep it moist , it can go dry . Adding some butter , or maybe rendered Wagyu fat in the case of your steak , might help . As for bacteria , the longer you cook sous vide , the more you kill off the nasties . It so happens that Douglas Baldwin has a short bit about flat iron steak : <URL> Hope that helps :)
Go for 145 . 2 hours . Salmonella dies even at " low " temperatures ( from 135 ) as long as you cook it for longer . 135 for at least 87 minutes , will kill salmonella . However , I like it best when cooked at 145 for 2 hours .

The two are simply not the same , because fundamentally the two are not the same , you are not going to get the same results . It 's really as simple as that . You ca n't take two entirely methods and argue that you get the same results .
While if you have the opportunity to improvise a lid I recommend you do so as per the other answers , however it is n't always possible . I have unexpectedly been thrust into the " grill master " role when I 've shown up to parties and the charcoal is hot , food expensive , and nobody but me knows how . In situations like this you have to do the best you can with what you have , and sometimes you wo n't have a lid or anything you can use as one . The reasons you want a lid are that it evens the heat out , and reduces the oxygen supply to the fire which cools things down a bit and reduces flare-ups . Without a lid you will get a hotter temperature at the base of the grill and much cooler temperatures above , with fat having a much greater tendency to flare . You can still get good results through making good choices of what to cook , and good technique . Bad technique will lead to food that is burnt to a crisp on the outside and raw in the middle . There are some foods that you do n't need a lid for , in fact you should n't use one , like thin to medium cut steaks . Other foods like burgers you can use a lid or not and still get a good result . So part of your success will come from choosing the right things to cook . Thinner is better , as is picking foods that do n't necessarily have to be cooked through . Some food you just ca n't grill without a lid . Avoid anything that requires long , indirect heat like legs of lamb or roasting joints . Some food is best cooked with a lid , but you can get good results without one , like chicken and sausages . Your main problem is heat control , and flaring . Chicken and sausages need longer cooking temperatures , so the goal is to cook them through without burning the outside , you can do this by keeping them around the edge of the charcoal where they get enough heat , and dripping fat wo n't hit the coals and flare up . Turn them often , like once a minute to keep them from burning . If they are getting close to done and they do n't have enough char then you can move them to the center of the grill for a bit . It also helps to have some sort of baste to coat them with to keep them moist like bbq sauce or a marinade . With sausages you can cheat a bit by slicing them down the long way and cooking them flat a few minutes over high heat . If you are cooking different foods at the same time , like burgers , sausages , and chicken then separate your grill into zones . Burgers get high heat , sausages medium , and chicken low . If you want to cook mostly food that needs a medium to low heat then you will get a lot of mileage from arranging your charcoal intelligently , like in a long strip down the middle of the wide part of the grill , or in a square grill in a torus shape . This will give you much more area of your grill with the temperature you need . Really important for lidless grilling is a spray bottle full of water to put out flare-ups , a mist sprayed on the base of the flare works magic and it wo n't kick up ash all over your food .
I think in general it is much safer to transport food cold ( frozen , even ) than hot . You can buy soft-sided insulated bags with straps - I see them in the grocery store - that should be ok for a trip of that length . I buy frozen food and then drive home for an hour with it , put it straight in the freezer , and would laugh at the thought of there being food-safety issues with that . So one approach is to make a lasagna , casserole , or the like in a disposable container , freeze it at home , take it to your relative 's and put it in her freezer . Now she has a semi-quick ( but at least easy ) meal waiting for her . ( A side note from remembering my days with an infant : something that heats up FAST and can be eaten with one hand will be more useful than a serves-12-needs-a-fork-heats-for-an-hour option . In other words burritos ( 2 min in microwave , can eat while holding the baby ) beat lasagna ( 60 + min in oven , you can forget and dry it out or burn it , then you need a plate and a knife and fork to eat it . ) Samosas are good one-handers , too . ) If you want to take something that is ready-to-eat , you could use the same bag to keep hot food hot , but I would probably suggest heating it up again on arrival .

How can I thicken tea ?
You could try using arrowroot . This is a widely available alternative to cornstarch - it is used in cookery because it does n't turn liquids cloudy like cornstarch does . In your case , it might work better as it also has a more neutral flavour . Substitute 2 tbsps of arrowroot for 1 tbsp cornstarch , and make a slurry with cool water as you would cornstarch . One issue is that overheating can break down the arrowroot , preventing it from thickening , so you are probably better off adding it to the tea after removing it from the heat .

In recipes , buttermilk brings liquid , some milk solids , some acid , and if it is not made from skim milk ( it is a cultured product ) , some fat . In a pinch , you can substitute approximately 1 cup milk with 1 tbl lemon juice or vinegar . For information on making your own cultured buttermilk , <URL> . It is made from milk and an active culture starter from commercial or previous buttermilk batches , much akin to making yogurt . Edit : As hinted in Fisher 's answer , for some applications , particularly quick breads and muffins , buttermilk can also be substituted one to one with yogurt or sour cream .
There really is n't another name for Dutch processed cocoa . You could perhaps look at the ingredients or label and search for some reference to alkalization . Cocoa powder , Dutched or natural , consists of a single ingredient : cocoa . The difference is that Dutched cocoa has an extra step in the manufacturing process . Normal cocoa powder is created from cocoa beans . These beans are fermented , roasted , shelled , and then ground into a paste known as chocolate liquor . This is roughly 50/50 cocoa butter ( fat ) and cocoa solids . At this step it is can be molded and sold as unsweetened baking chocolate . To make cocoa powder the liquor is hydraulically pressed to remove ~ 75 % of the fat , and then pulverized into cocoa powder . Dutched cocoa powder has an extra step before the shelled beans are ground into liquor . They are soaked in an alkaline solution of potassium carbonate . Dutched cocoa was created in the 19th century by a Dutchman named Coenraad J. van Houten . Van Houten had invented the method of using a hydraulic press to defat chocolate liquor . Hot chocolate in these times would have a fatty greasy scum floating on the top of the beverage . Removing much of the fat prevented this . However , it also made the drink much harsher , acidic , and gave it a much lighter color . Van Houten 's idea was to counteract the cocoa 's natural acidity ( pH ~ 5.4 ) by soaking it in an alkaline solution . This neutralized the acids in the cocoa raising the pH to neutral ( 7 ) or higher depending on the duration of the soak . The higher pH also has the added benefit of darkening the cocoa ; the higher it goes , the darker it gets . Now , you might think that mellowing out the cocoa would be undesirable for the flavor . However this has been shown to not be the case . It turns out that the very acidic nature of natural cocoa can actually mask many of the natural undertones of flavor in the chocolate . Chocolate is much like wine and has hundreds of flavors that make up its flavor profile . These include sour , bitter , astringent , fruity , figgy , nutty , floral , smoky , and may more . Dutching only targets the bitter , astringent , sour and fruity undertones allowing the remaining ones to really showcase the chocolate . There is a bit of misinformation that floats amongst bakers that the pH of the cocoa can affect the leavening of the baked good . Many recipes will actually sternly suggest using either Dutched or natural cocoa depending . This makes sense since leavening is a sort of balancing act that involves both acids and bases . However , it has been experimentally shown that this does not actually occur , and baked goods made with both Dutched and natural cocoa powder showed no differences in leavening . So to actually address your questions . Again , no there is n't another name for Dutched cocoa , but it ca n't hurt to check for alkalized verbage . There is ( should ) also no additional ingredient that would identify a cocoa powder as Dutched . The key property it provides is simply chocolate flavor . This answer is adapted from the Jan. 1 , 2005 Cook 's Illustrated review of <URL> . Their results showed that without fail Dutched cocoa was voted superior to natural cocoa in every single blind taste test including : pudding , shortbread , devil 's food cake , and hot chocolate ( which was masked by a sippy-top so reviewers could not see the tell-tale color ) . If the cost does n't make you do a double take ( it 's not really that expensive considering the quantity ) . I highly suggest you buy a 1 kg ( 2.2 lb ) bag of <URL> . This was the winner of the blind taste test performed by Cook 's Illustrated . I must agree that it will change your baked goods for the better like you would not believe .
What I would suggest is rather than adding a syrup , to take some of your cooked beans , cook them a bit more , then liquify them in a blender . This should give you a thick sauce that tastes like the beans , therefore compliments them perfectly . You can then thicken them very slightly if the consistency is still too runny , be sparing with the flour though . In fact , you could probably make something satisfactory by simply using less thickener . If you have a pasty , sticky sauce it 's a classic symptom of too much thickener . Try making a roux with some butter and flour , cook it awhile for a dark roux which gives deeper color and more flavor . You can then add the roux in small amounts to your cooking liquid until you get the right consistency . If you are pressed for time and have some available a couple big spoons of refried beans may just do the trick too .
Lemon juice thickens condensed milk in the same way it would " thicken " regular milk , i.e. , by curdling . Basically , milk has two general types of proteins : casein and whey . The casein is what forms the " curds " in " curds and whey . " Both proteins are somewhat unusual in that they do n't tend to coagulate with heat ( as eggs proteins do , for example ) . Thus , they will survive largely intact even with the processing of condensed milk . Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking explains what happens when they encounter acids , though : The casein family includes four different kinds of proteins that gather together into microscopic family units called micelles . Each casein micelle contains a few thousand individual protein molecules . . . . Around a tenth of the volume of milk is taken up by casein micelles . Much of the calcium in milk is in the micelles , where it acts as a kind of glue holding the protein molecules together . One portion of calcium binds individual protein molecules together into small clusters of 15 to 25 . Another portion then helps pull several hundred of the clusters together to form the micelle ... One member of the casein family is especially influential in these gatherings . That is kappa-casein which caps the micelles once they reach a certain size , prevents them from growing larger , and keeps them dispersed and separate . One end of the capping-casein molecule extends from the micelle out into the surrounding liquid , and forms a " hairy layer " with a negative electrical charge that repels other micelles ... If [ milk ] gets acid enough to approach pH 5.5 , the capping-casein 's negative charge is neutralized , the micelles no longer repel each other , and they therefore gather in loose clusters . At the same acidity , the calcium glue that holds the micelles together dissolves , the micelles begin to fall apart , and their individual proteins scatter . Beginning around pH 4.7 , the scattered casein proteins lose their negative charge , bond to each other again and form a continuous fine network : and the milk solidifies , or curdles . Thus , if you add lemon juice to regular milk , it will curdle and thicken , just as milk does when it sours naturally or when it is fermented into yogurt , kefir , cultured buttermilk , etc. ( which all involve bacteria that acidify the milk ) . The same process happens if you add acid to condensed milk .
I think on some level you 'll just get what you get with something hard like an almond . A really really sharp knife with a thin blade can help , but you can only do so much . My hand-cut ones are always a bit on the raggedy side . When using a food processor , try smaller batches to leave bigger or more consistent pieces . You do n't have to pulse as long to get everything broken up , so you get less that 's ground to nothing . Do a small batch for a short chop , dump 'em out , do another . As to how to do slivered or sliced almonds , I always figured that they started with blanched almonds ( which are less crisp in my experience ) or maybe even raw ones and then roasted them after cutting to crisp them up . You might experiment with blanched or unroasted almonds and see if you get a better result with a knife .
This is a combination of the type of cheese and too much heat . Some cheeses melt more readily ( mozzarella for example ) , but all of them will seize up if they are heated too much too fast - the proteins ' curl up ' and separate from the fat and water in the cheese . To combat this , you should chop or grate the cheese up to speed up melting , and lower the heat a little before adding it . You should also avoid using cheese straight from the fridge .
There is apparently evidence that some of the flavour compounds in honey deteriorate during heating : <URL> The text suggests that honey should not be heated to more than 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit ) . So it might be wise to let the tea cool down a bit before adding the honey . Having said that , I usually put the honey in immediately after removing the tea leaves and it tastes fine to me . The flavour of the honey is clear and pronounced and I have never felt that anything was missing .
To make you pancakes spread more , and thus be thinner , increase the amount of liquid in the recipe . This will make the batter less viscous , so that it will spread more before beginning to set , thus giving you thinner pancakes . I would start slowly , perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk ( or just plain water ) until you find the consistency that you like . You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time , as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture . Of course , there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more . This is normal , and will somewhat even out as the pancakes cook .
My wife loves bacon that 's cooked to the cusp of burning , so I 've got a good knowledge of the properties of bacon on that fine line . It 's so brittle , you can powder it very easily . I myself would probably just stick it in a plastic bag , and whack it a few times with a pan , but I do n't see any reason why you could n't put it in the blender . I have a nice mortar and pestle I use for powdering things , but that 's probably overkill in this case .
This is a really difficult topic to approach , and I think the only reliable way to identify flavours is through years and years of practice using those flavours in your cooking . To start with , I think the easiest thing to do would be to understand the different types of flavours . Those are : Sweet Everybody knows this one . Sweet is the taste of sugar , candy , and so on . Sour Sour is the taste of acidity . Citrus fruits like lemons/limes , vinegar , pickles , and so on . Salty This is the taste of , well , salt . Needs no further explanation , I hope . Bitter Bitterness is what makes you want to grimace - but many people do acquire a taste for it . The best examples of bitter are probably coffee and beer . Leafy greens and horseradish are other good examples . Savoury or Umami This is the taste of " hearty " foods - meats and cheese especially . Specifically , it 's the taste of protein . Glutamates ( i.e. MSG ) also provide this flavour . It 's actually a lot more involved than this - our taste receptors can detect <URL> , but those are the easiest to tell apart . The most notable " quasi-flavour " is probably Hot or Piquant ( not to be confused with pungency , which is a more general term for anything " strong " tasting such as horseradish or garlic ) ; this type of heat is due to capsaicin , which is found especially in chili peppers , and I call it a quasi-flavour because it does n't actually work on taste receptors , it works on pain receptors , and it 's addictive due to the subsequent release of endorphins . Anyway , all that aside , the place to start would be to get used to the five basic flavours above . Eat some foods that are chiefly one flavour - a caramel , a lime , a few flakes of horseradish , a hunk of meat , or ... a dash of salt , I guess . Get used to what they taste like . Then you should be able to start recognizing combinations - for example , a cured sausage will be salty and savoury . Lemonade is sweet and sour . If you 're able to start identifying the flavour types then you can start trying to narrow down the actual ingredients and ask yourself , " What could be adding this [ bitter ] flavour ? " Most full entrées will try to establish a balance of all of these flavours with all of these flavour elements . For example , a Chinese stir-fry sauce will include sweet ( sugar or honey ) , sour ( rice vinegar ) , salty ( soy ) , and umami ( sesame oil ) , and used on vegetables which are primarily bitter ( i.e. broccoli ) . Whenever you 're eating a food that 's really great , expect it to have something contributing to all the basic flavours and try to think about what elements could be used to create them . Even if you only manage to figure out 4 out of 5 , chances are you can substitute something else for the 5th and manage a similar taste . Of course , it 's worth repeating that this is n't just going to come magically to you . You need to pay attention to what you 're cooking ; only when you 've constructed hundreds if not thousands of your own concoctions will you be able to deconstruct the ones that others have made - and even then , it 's kind of tricky if the recipe is complicated , because lots of preparation steps will change the flavour , like browning ( Maillard reaction , adds sweetness ) or roasting ( tends to add savouriness ) . As far as spices go , they 're pretty much all in the same flavour category ( which I 'd really just call " spicy " ) although they may also lend varying amounts of umami or pungency to the final dish . The only way you 're ever going to be able to identify spices is to start experimenting with them - lots of them - and learn what they taste like separately and together . I would say that this takes years for most cooks , and sadly , I do n't think there are any shortcuts . Well , that 's it for my intro . Hope that helps !
It might be there for body , but more likely for the umami kick that tomato past helps with . I bet you could leave it out with no ill effect ... otherwise , try some ketchup . You could also open the small can , use what you need and put the rest in a baggy in the freezer .
You can use Chuck to make your shredded beef . Cook it for a long time , at a low temperature , until a probe slides in and out of it with no resistance . Braising in a liquid seasoned with spices like cumin , garlic , and chili powder will get you the flavor profile you want ( I recommend either finding a recipe or some trial and error ) .
In the interests of science I gave this a try . Used a can of carbonated water , boiled in my kettle . There was no boiling water explosion , although I more than half expected one . It seemed to maybe boil a little faster , but that 's more likely due to the fact that it 's less liquid than I usually heat . Being a tea fanatic I have a lot of flavored teas but I opted for PG Tips , figuring I would taste any difference a little more easily . I caught very little flavor difference from usual , maybe a little stronger but that could be chalked up to any number of things besides using carbonated water . So yeah , I think carbonated water would probably work in a pinch . Probably do n't put too much of it in the kettle , though . ( A small part of me still suspects that had it been full it would have shot boiling water everywhere ) .
An0r4k , I assume that you 're making a cup of black ( ? ) tea and steeping some lemongrass in it . If so , perhaps you should make the black tea very weak as its tannins might be amplifying the ( pleasant ) slight bitterness of the lemongrass to distasteful levels . Alternatively , if you are steeping the lemongrass in hot water , try removing the outer layers of the lemongrass stalk . If they are old or tough , this can increase the bitterness of the drink . In any case , check that there is n't any dirt trapped between the layers of the lemongrass . Some recipies call for putting the lemongrass into water , bringing it to a boil and then letting it simmer for 10-15 minutes . I have n't tried this . Even if it does produce a smoother taste , then the boiling might well degradge any health-giving nutrients from the lemongrass .
I would imagine the commercial choppers used for McDonald 's nuts generate the same amount of dust . They probably sell that dust for some other purpose . The dust should be easy enough to remove : just shake them around in a strainer .
If it 's " green tea powder " it 's probably <URL> . Matcha is finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea . It 's special in two aspects of farming and processing : The green tea plants for matcha are shade-grown for about three weeks before harvest , and the stems and veins are removed in processing . The traditional Japanese tea ceremony centers on the preparation , serving , and drinking of matcha . In modern times , matcha has also come to be used to flavour and dye foods such as mochi and soba noodles , green tea ice cream and a variety of wagashi ( Japanese confectionery ) . <URL> The drink you had in Thailand is probably an iced matcha shake of some sort , made with condensed milk . In Japan , the drink is served by itself as part of tea ceremonies and is opaque even without milk added to it . There 's a guide to how tea ceremonies work and the process of making tea <URL> , if you 're interested .
I would suggest making a Mornay sauce ( <URL> ) which you should find will hold together well and provide an unctuous , rich , spreadable texture . Simply melt butter in a saucepan over a medium-low heat , whisk in an equal quantity of flour , cook it out a little , then add cold milk , whisking all the while , until you get a smooth sauce like consistency . Then dump in a load of grated parmesan , stir it through , decant to a bowl and cool .
Some fruit juices can be heated to drive off excess water ( especially those with a higher sugar content ) but citrus does n't tolerate this well . Fresh-squeezed citrus will get bitter and acrid if reduced . Instead , squeeze your citrus as normal and freeze the juice in an open container . Once it 's set into a solid block , place it into a funnel or strainer over a collection vessel . The juice itself will run off more quickly and collect in the vessel , while the ice crystals stay in the strainer ( until they melt , at least - do n't let them melt all the way , or you 're back to the beginning ) . Once the ice looks very lightly colored , discard it and enjoy your concentrated juice . You can repeat this process if you want further concentration , though eventually there will come a point where the juice is so concentrated that it wo n't freeze at conventional freezer temperatures . Good instructions for this process <URL> - it 's really quite simple !

Can flour be used interchangeably with starch ?
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
You can use compound chocolate ( the inexpensive " coating chocolate " ) . It 's what you find used in a lot of cheap store-bought chocolate , and it has very similar melting and viscosity properties to couverture . You can usually find it in most bulk food stores . The important property of couverture is its high proportion of cocoa butter and correspondingly high fat content . Compound chocolate normally does not contain any cocoa butter , so it is nowhere near as rich as couverture , but it achieves roughly the same fat content with vegetable fat and will act similar to couverture when melted . Technically , compound chocolate is not actually chocolate , so the result will be lower quality than if you had used couverture ; but if you 're pinching pennies , I think that 's the way to go .
Many of the aromatic qualities of liqueurs are due to volatile substances that will likely evaporate while reducing the liqueur . So it really depends on how volatile the substances are that you want to keep . I performed a simple experiment with Frangelico . So , what I did is ( over low heat for 20 minutes ) I reduced 1/4 cup of store bought Frangelico to cca . 1/8 cup hazelnut and caramel flavored sugar water/syrup . It tastes pleasant , but the hazelnut aroma is a bit weaker - which might suggest that some of the hazelnut aroma evaporated together with the alcohol and water ( would n't be surprising ) or that the alcohol helped with distributing ( hence perceiving ) the aroma better or that the sweetness and other flavors now overpower it . Anyway , as stated above in many cases the aromatic substances in mixtures are aromatic because they are highly volatile - we can smell them cause they escape from the mixture . So , what can you do ? Some techniques that I have used in the past come to mind : <URL> . Where you separate aromatic substances depending on their boiling points and catch them after condensation . However , the heat might not be good for some substances . <URL> . Which became a " hot " technique in molecular cooking =) Here the idea is similar to distillation , but the method is gentler in terms of temperature as it operates under reduced pressure - however it requires special equipment - a rotary evaporator . I successfully used it to separate the aroma from walnut liqueur and to make <URL> . <URL> . It has been suggested for <URL> and other stuff from the alcohol medium ( you might find suggestions for similar techniques by searching the internet for " homemade [ whatever ] essence/extract " ) . Making your own liqueurs/alcohol extracts - with more concentrated aroma than the commercial ones - so you have less volume for the same amount of the aromatic substance . This might be possible as the amount of alcohol in the solution might be able to accept more of the aromatic substance than there is in the commercial liqueur . However , it is very likely they are adding a concentrated/distilled essence , which gives a more clean and stronger flavor than what you can get from just extracting it ( from say hazelnuts ) with alcohol . However , as perviously suggested by @TFD you can just want to avoid all the hassle and buy commercially available essences/extracts or use some alternative flavorings as @razumny suggests . Or simply try the reduction technique if you do n't mind loosing some of the volatile substances - and if the result is satisfying enough . That said , I made very tasty reductions of some liqueurs with very strong flavors ( homemade wild blueberry liqueur and Terrano liqueur ) to pour over deserts , where I mostly just wanted to get rid of the alcohol taste and to thicken it a bit . So , the results will vary from liqueur to liqueur and your best bet would be to just try it out with small quantities to see how it goes .
Coconut flour is what remains <URL> when extracting the milk from coconut . So I doubt you can make anything resembling coconut milk ( much less coconut cream ) from it , unless the manufacturer has done an exceptionally poor job of doing so already !
In the pastas that I have made the structure of the noodle is built out of protein - usually entirely from gluten from wheat flour . In fact the base of my pasta is just flour and water ( or juice or pureed vegetables , etc. ) Egg noodles , obviously get structure from the egg . Quinoa has no gluten and will impart no structure to a typical pasta . You could easily add it to a normal pasta recipe as long as it was not in so high a concentration as to compromise the gluten structure . Without experimenting I do n't know what ratio this would be . A cursory google search found several quinoa pasta recipes . The ones I looked at were similar in that they relied on a variety of starches and egg for structure . I imagine these would taste fine but they would be more like dumplings or egg noodles than al dente Italian pasta . The results of the quick search : <URL> <URL>
Yes , but not in shell ( they explode , often spectacularly ) . See <URL> for some more information . In general , whites are better to freeze , although you can freeze yolks as well .
That will be absolutely fine , whether you make the sauce in the classic way by cooking the yolks with the lemon juice , or with one of the variations where the lemon juice is added only at the end . I would , of course , defrost it first , rather than add a whole ice cube of lemon juice to the pan .
There are several ways you can thicken Chili than adding Masa Harina : Add another thickening agent : flour and cornstarch are both widely used , you can also try other flours like graham flour , chickpea flour , or arrowroot . Note that if you use flour you 'll want to fry it in oil or butter or risk a raw flour taste in the dish Add refried beans : this adds thickening and a richness . It does dilute the spices some so you 'll want to make the chili more powerful to compensate Cook it down : Why add a thickener when simply simmering with the lid off will do it for you ? It takes some time ( an hour or so depending on the water content of the ingredients you add ) , but it will concentrate the flavors and give you a nice , thick chili without any additional ingredients at all
The Cuisinart SG-10 spice grinder it designed to grind soft and hard spices . There is no reason why it could n't do coffee The <URL> even mentions nutmeg , which is significantly tougher than coffee Many coffee " professionals " like the burr grind ( like a pepper grinder ) , compared to the rotary blade grind ( like a small food processor ) , but either will work fine Also , many people grind spices in rotary blade coffee grinders , so it comes down to which style of grinding you like One issue with rotary ground coffee is the inconsistency of grind size . There will be too many fine particles that will leech out of the coffee holding/filter mechanism . If you do n't want solid particles in your coffee use a burr grinder
Like Bob said , surely boiling some noodles is way less of a bother than breaking out the pasta machine ? If you really want to make fresh pasta , I do n't see any reason you could n't use it for lasagna without boiling it - the reason one boils dry noodles is because it 's hard to get them to soften in the time it takes to bake the lasagna . But just like when cooking fresh noodles , you need to be careful not to overcook it , so make sure all your fillings are fully cooked before you start layering . It also should be perfectly fine to not cut the noodles into strips - the reason dried noodles come that way is for easier handling . It is possible to make lasagna using dried lasagna noodles without boiling them first , but you need to add more water and bake it longer . A search for " no-boil lasagna " will turn up scores of recipes .
This article , from the <URL> , indicates : Garbanzo bean flour ( a.k.a. gram flour , chana flour , besan , chickpea , or cici flour ) should be a pantry staple . Unlike other bean flours , garbanzo bean flour does not have to be combined with other flours ( although you can do it if you wish ) . Garbanzo flour is high in protein and gives a slightly " beany " flavor to baked goods . However , they are not focused on food issues , and may not be the most reliable source . According to <URL> , you can use chickpea flour as a flour substitute , but they recommend no more than 75 % replacement ( garbanzo bean is another name for chickpea ) : Garbanzo bean flour - I know this gluten free flour does n't sound appetizing , but it is delicious , healthy and is a wonderful primary gluten free flour that you can use up to 75 % in a recipe . And ... ... ... ... . . NO , I know what you are thinking ... ... ... it does n't taste like beans ! ( I thought the same thing ! ) Again , not the same as a university extension center , but at least a practicing individual who tries these kinds of things . Given that cookies are made from a structure of starch rather than gluten , the lack of glutens from wheat flour should not be an issue . However , chickpea flour also contains less starch One brand of garbanzo bean flour indicated that it had 18 grams of carbohydrates per 30 grams of product on its nutritional information ; that same brand 's pastry flour ( a wheat flour ) had 27 grams of per 34 g of product . As you can see , chickpea flour has significantly less available carbohydrates ( mostly starch , some sugars ) to form the structure of the baked goods . This will change the texture and structure development . In general , gluten free baking experts recommend using a mix of flours to substitute for wheat flour , depending on how it is being used , in order to get the best possible outcome . If your goal is not to be gluten free , only substituting for 50 % of the recipe amount may provide good compromise on the outcome . Bottom line , in a cookie , you would expect when substituting 100 % chickpea flour for wheat flour : Different texture , due to less starch and more protein . My best guess is that it will be a little more fragile , due to less starch structure , but I have never tried this . Different flavor , due to the fact that beans taste different than grains Update after the question was edited to talk about the effect of leavening : In a cookie , the structure of the final product is based on gelatinized starches . With the reduced quantity of starch in the chickpea flour compared to wheat flour , there is simply less of a starch network present . This may reduce the capacity of the cookie to retain the gas generated by the baking powder or baking soda , and thus a flatter , less airy product .
Based on your edit to your question , and with some additional thought , I 'm going to answer this differently . Soured milk differs from what you called " spoiled " milk in only one way - what wild bacteria reproduced faster : bacteria with tasty waste products or bacteria with disgusting waste products . With that in mind the major potential problems with using this milk to make yogurt are : If the wild bacteria crowd out the yogurt culture If the yogurt culture is not able to work because the milk is too sour . In making homemade yogurt neither of these should be a problem . In making all yogurt - including yogurt made from raw milk in commercial settings - the milk is heated to 190F for some time to denature albumin proteins and to partially sterilize the milk so that the yogurt cultures will have the upper hand . This means that all yogurt has been pasteurized and the fact that the milk was purchased raw is a red herring . This will make problem # 1 above unlikely . Not heating the milk will leave you with @rumtscho 's answer - you can only guess what you might get by incubating it . As for problem # 2 . Milk proteins begin to coagulate at a Ph of about 4.6 . The target Ph for yogurt is usually 4.5 . When making yogurt , Streptococcus thermophilus brings the milk down to about 5.0 and Lactobacillus Acidophilus takes over and brings it down to 4.5 . Lactobacillus Acidophilus is active well below this Ph. Therefore , if your milk is not already thickened then it is , by definition , not too acidic for the yogurt culture to work . Unfortunately , as the commenter from your first link indicated , heat combined with acid will cause the milk to prematurely denature . If you milk is too sour already then heating it to 190F may cause the protein to precipitate out and you would have paneer ( sort of ) . I looked but was unable to find at what Ph milk proteins will denature at 190F . <URL> <URL> If you can strictly verify the handling of your raw milk to have confidence that it has not been contaminated with harmful bacteria , and if the milk has only slightly soured so that it can be heated without breaking , you should be able to successfully make yogurt out of it knowing that the texture might vary from that of your starter .
I do n't know that you 'd want to make a full meal of it , but it sounds like you 'd enjoy nutritional yeast . You can find it at any " health food store " type of grocery . It is deactivated , so you do n't need to worry about it filling you up with CO2 . The flavor is somewhat reminiscent of Parmesan cheese . Googling " nutritional yeast recipes " will give you plenty of ideas for what to do with it .
Cocoa butter crystallizes into various types of crystals depending on the temperature at which it cools . If the butter cools into an ad hoc assortment of crystal types then they do n't arrange themselves uniformly and the chocolate will be dull and sticky . The process of melting chocolate to encourage proper crystal growth is called tempering . You will find <URL> a <URL> <URL> on the subject here . You can use any chocolate that contains cocoa butter . However , if you are going to be putting that much work into tempering your chocolate you might spring for the nicer quality chocolate and not just plain Hershey 's . Alternatively , if it meets your needs , you can either serve your chocolate still melted or make a thick syrup/fudge dip that stays soft and does n't need to be tempered .
Cheaper spirits can certainly be used in culinary applications . The results wo n't be identical , but inexpensive liquors are a lot more cost-effective since the subtle differences in flavor between middling and quality spirits tend to get masked by other flavors . This is especially true when you 're applying heat , which will burn off much of the alcohol ( though not all ) and change some of the volatile flavor compounds in the spirit . For things like a tomato sauce made with wine , a pan sauce deglazed with brandy , or a dessert flambeed with rum , the difference between bottom-shelf and high-end product will be evident only in the cost . Poor-quality vodka will have some " rough " flavors if you 're drinking it straight , and those might carry over into the liqueur in particular . Chilling will help , so you probably wo n't notice much difference in your borscht , and once you bake the liqueur into something I doubt any flavor difference will be noticeable in the final product . As a rule of thumb , the more you manipulate the spirit , the less you 'll notice its provenance . I can say confidently that using free , leftover plonk in a culinary application will be a much better use than drinking it !
I would use it for anything other than deep frying or high temperature frying . It would be great for anything that requires oil but not cooking , like hummus .
UHT ( Ultra High Temperature ) processing kills all the pathogens in the milk , so it can be conserved for a long time . However to make yogurt you add bacteria ( lactobacillus ) , so if there are n't other microorganism it should be even better .
Fundamentally , the reason for this substitution is that applesauce contains <URL> . In baking , the role of oil is to coat the flour , preventing it from combining with the water ( or other wet ingredients ) and developing <URL> . Gluten is what causes dough to rise , and also gives elasticity to the final product - what most people think of as " chewiness . " When you 're baking , for example , a cake , or even a pie crust , you want to limit the amount of gluten that develops . A cake or pie crust should be moist , light , and fluffy , not tough and chewy . When you bite into a cake and find it very dry and bread-like , that is because it has developed a lot of gluten . A good amount of oil or other fat leads to a lighter , moister , less-glutinous result . The pectin in applesauce can also , to a certain extent , help to inhibit gluten formation in a dough , but the similarities end there . I can not stress this point enough , and I 've seen many other online resources get this dead wrong : Pectin ( applesauce ) is not a straightforward or foolproof substitute for fat . The mechanisms by which pectin and oil work in this context are completely different : Oil is a <URL> . Lipids bind to starch ( including the ~ 75 % starch in flour ) and are <URL> - the traditional example of this is dew drops forming on the surface of grass or plants ( the latter being the hydrophobe ) . In a sense , oil forms a protective " shield " around the flour molecules . Pectin , on the other hand , is a <URL> , and specifically a <URL> . Pectin is not hydrophobic and does not actually protect the flour molecules . In fact , pectin is of the same family as starches , which are also polysaccharides . What 's really happening here is that the pectin competes with the flour for water . That means less water overall reaches the starch and gluten-forming proteins ( giladin and glutenin ) in the flour , and because of this , it is not able to develop as much gluten or gelatinize much of the other starch . What does all of this actually mean for you , the baker ? Quite simply , it means you have to be very careful with this substitution : Too much pectin can turn your recipe into a jelly-like consistency . Too little pectin will fail to prevent glutenization ( in other words , you 'll get bread ) . Pectin has the property of <URL> - meaning that once it starts to gel , it also starts to expel liquid , and your dessert will dry out or deflate over time . Pectin is actually water-soluble at high temperatures ( technically , it forms a <URL> ) , it just happens to absorb a lot of water along the way . Baking for too long , or at too high a temperature , will cause the pectin to break down and dissolve completely , making it useless . There are also several other problems ( or at least " gotchas " ) when making the apple sauce substitution : Applesauce is <URL> . It has a good deal of water and various proteins and acids , and even a certain amount of lipids . The exact quantities , however , depend on how the applesauce was made , so it is very hard to get precise control over the amount of pectin , and the textbook 1:1 substitution ratio is almost never correct . Another thing that applesauce contains is sugar - even unsweetened applesauce . You will almost certainly need to reduce the amount of sugar elsewhere in your recipe . This may be difficult , especially if the bulk of the sugar is used as a dry ingredient . Applesauce behaves somewhat similarly to oil , but do not even try using it as a substitute for any other fat . Butter , in particular , contains milk proteins which act as natural emulsifiers ; pectin does have certain stabilizing properties but is a rather poor emulsifier compared to butter [ citation needed ] . And it goes without saying that the flavour is substantially different from that of applesauce ; oil is " OK " to substitute for because it has very little flavour of its own . If you plan on using applesauce as a substitute for oil in a recipe that does not specifically explain how to use it as a substitute , then I strongly suggest you do two things : Do n't substitute the entire quantity . Use 1/2 oil , 1/2 applesauce , or maybe 1/4 oil and 3/4 applesauce . You will likely also have to lower the total quantity of oil/applesauce to approximately half of what it originally was ( give or take 1/4 ) . If you can , try this substitution on a small scale first , and experiment with the quantities of oil , sugar , and applesauce , before going all-out and putting it into the oven while your guests arrive . It 's very likely that on the first few attempts , you 'll end up with something that 's palatable , but nowhere near the quality of the oil-based recipe . Ignore these disclaimers at your own risk !
Robert Cartaino 's answer hits a main point : sourdough cultures are adapted to what they are typically fed . When switching flours , it may take a while for the culture to adjust . The starter may seem a bit sluggish at first . That said , I would NOT recommend trying to start a wheat culture if you already have a healthy starter that began with rye . There are two main reasons . First , rye is particularly rich in certain sugars and food that natural yeasts tend to like , so rye starters naturally tend to look more " lively " than wheat starters , especially in the early stages of a starter . Part of what you may be seeing in your transition to wheat is simply less activity produced because the food source is less rich in nutrients , not necessarily because the yeast and bacteria ca n't digest it . Second , a lot of recipes to generate new starters recommend using rye at the beginning , regardless of what you ultimately plan to feed the starter . Because it provides a strong food source for young cultures , it 's usually a lot easier to begin with rye ( perhaps this is why you did ) . In my experience , it tends to take new wheat starters at least twice as long to get strongly established compared to rye , and there 's a higher chance of failure if you do n't use a good recipe . For both of these reasons , some people even recommend always feeding your starter with rye flour , even if you tend to make wheat-based bread . Since many people have success doing that ( and I have personally ) , I do n't think you need to begin a whole new culture with wheat alone . If your starter really is sluggish ( and not just a little less active than it was with rye ) , you can help your starter to adapt to the new food . I 'm not sure what your typical feeding routine is or what the hydration level of your starter is . But the general thing to do in these circumstances is to dilute your starter and feed it large quantities of the new food . For example , if you maintain 200 grams of your starter normally , I would discard all but maybe 40-50 grams and then add enough new flour and water to get back to 200 grams in whatever your usual proportion is . ( Some people would be even more extreme in diluting the starter and cut the starter proportion even further . ) Within a few days of feedings like this , you will have strongly selected the yeast and bacteria that thrive on whole wheat and your starter should be strong again . After a week of feedings like this , I doubt you could distinguish the performance of your starter from one that was begun on wheat . ( Note that the specific microorganisms may still be slightly different , but your starter should do a fine job raising dough and providing flavor . )
Sure it 's safe , there 's no risk in putting jam in baked goods . It says refrigerate after opening so it does n't spoil after being left out too long - some people do n't realize it needs to be refrigerated after opening because it is stored in the cupboard before opening . The important thing for food safety is to make sure that the pastries are eaten soon enough after baking . The cream cheese will go off sooner than the jam will , so do n't let them sit around .

Can I freeze stir-fry vegetables ?
You will have the best results if you prep by cutting and blanching prior to freezing . This should ensure that moisture content in the veggies does less damage over time in the freezer and improve color duration . I find it helpful to freeze vegetables separately rather than as mixes as you can always grab from multiple bags , but you ca n't unmix mixed vegetables without more work . The majority of vegetables for stir-fry ( e.g. broccoli , peas , etc ) will freeze well enough , the ones in your freezer aisle obviously freeze a bit better than others . If a vegetable has a high water content ( i.e. lettuce , which I hope you are n't stir-frying with ) that is more integral to its structure than the cellulose it is likelier to burst cell walls in freezing ; these vegetables are better to avoid .
The change in flavor is mainly affected by packaging and how long before it gets frozen . Packaging : If you have vacuum sealed chicken it will last quite a while . It wo n't get freezer burnt , dry out or pick up flavors from other freezer occupants . I would say properly packaged will last months to a year range depending on your taste buds . Time before freezing : I have a habit of buying meat to cook right away , but end up freezing it raw several days after the fact . I then see it a week or two later and pull it out to cook . It never tastes as good as when I freeze it immediately .
A few tips : Marinate the meat first ( after chopping , before stir-frying ) ; Mix the sauce first - do n't just dump the ingredients separately into the wok ; Add corn starch or tapioca flour to the sauce to thicken it . I would n't even call it a sauce without any thickening agent . About 1 tbsp per cup of sauce should be alright . ( Note : The sauce should be about 50-60 % water , do n't use a whole cup of soy sauce ! ) Add some other savoury or flavour-enhancing ingredients to the sauce - i.e. toasted sesame oil , rice vinegar , brown sugar/honey . And ditch the oregano . Briefly steam the vegetables in the wok - add just a little bit of the sauce , then cover it for a few minutes . This will make them much more tender after frying . ( Note that this only applies to hard vegetables like carrots , celery , broccoli , etc. - add the soft vegetables afterward ) Add minced garlic with the ginger . The two go together like white on rice .

The other answers touch on the fact that its the release of water from the turkey that interacts with the oil , causes the oil to overflow , and then ignite the burner . Generally , this happens pretty shortly after you put the turkey in ( due do any moisture on the outside of the bird ) . To do it safely do n't bank on the fact that you 've removed all the water - do two additional things : Do it outside . In the event something bad happens , better to lose some grass on the lawn than your house . If you do n't have space outside , you can always go to a public park or such . It may seem like a pain but turkey frying should not be done inside . There 's one absolutely surefire way to ensure than you do n't catch the burner on fire by accident . Do n't have it on ! Prep your turkey . Have it dry on the outside and completely thawed . Heat your oil outside . Turn the burner off Lower the turkey into the hot oil Wait 1-2 minutes or so , most of the initial contact between water and oil should over by now . Turn the burner back on and cook the turkey . Also make sure the burner is off while taking the turkey out , just to prevent any spills from becoming terrible . @ChrisWalker , below in the comments , also provides a method for making sure you do n't put too much oil in the pot and thus cause a spill over .
In my experience , the answer for most leafy herbs is yes , fragance and flavor is preserved . Never tryed hyssop , however <URL> site says it freezes fine : it can be dried or frozen and stored for later use . When harvesting a hyssop plant , cut it in the morning hours once any dew has dried . Hang the plants upside down in small bunches to dry in a dark , well-ventilated area . Alternatively , you can place the leaves in a plastic bag after removing them from the stems and place in the freezer until ready to use .
Water freezes at 0 ° C ( or 32 ° F ) , but ethanol freezes at -114 ° C , so you can guess your vermouth with freeze somewhere in between those two temperatures . Noilly Prat is 18 % ABV , or 15 % alcohol by weight , which means it would freeze at around -6 ° C to -7 ° C , or 19-21 ° F. Your freezer may or may not be tuned to be that cold , but if not , you should be able to crank it a bit and get your Noilly Prat just frozen . That said , I would not really recommend leaving an ice cube tray full of vermouth hanging out in your freezer . You may notice that old ice tastes funny . Even though you may not notice your freezer smelling , that 's partly because the cold blocks smells . Just because you do n't notice them does n't mean the odors are n't there to ruin your Noilly Prat . I would recommend leaving them for a day until just frozen ( covered if you like ) , and then moving them to a Ziploc for long term storage . All that said , freezing will not halt oxidation altogether , but it will help , as only the exposed surfaces areas should be able to be oxidized . Since ice cubes by design have a relatively high surface area , you may consider minimizing the exposure to oxygen by other means . If you have a vacuum sealer , using that would be a fairly simple means to limit that exposure , but a similar effect can be done with a simple Ziploc bag , as described <URL> ( note this link is focused on using this technique for cooking , but it is translatable to your scenario ) . Drop your ice cubes in a bag , and then slowly lower the bag into a container of cold water ( the colder the better , here , to minimize melting ) , leaving the seal exposed . I sometimes <URL> things onto the bag to weigh it down as well . Then begin closing the seal , and lower the bag further into the water as you continue sealing , so that only the unsealed portion is exposed . Finally complete the seal and you should have a reasonably low-oxygen environment to mitigate further degradation of your vermouth .
Yes , you can freeze parmesan cheese . Even without freezing , Parmesan is very durable since the low water and high salt content prevents mould from growing . The younger varieties may be more prone to mould growth ( having a higher water content ) , but I 've kept ripe Parmesan ( 30-36 months ) for at least a year in the fridge without problems ( and it would probably have stayed good much longer ) . Just remember to keep it wrapped in paper , not in a sealed plastic container to prevent a buildup of condensation .
The basic idea is that you want to reduce the ice crystals formed while freezing the food . Here is what I would suggest . Put a metal pan in your freezer for 30 minutes to cool . Prep your zucchini , trying to get the most surface area possible . Spread out , trying to not overlap on your pan and place back in the freezer for about an hour . Place in your freezer bag and seal with as much air out of it as possible . A completely ideal way to freeze almost all veggies or fruits is to get a cooler and some dry ice , place your cut pieces in a metal bowl inside your cooler and leave it while the dry ice does its magic . You will have minimal ice crystals while giving you the closest taste from the original .
The oil is bubbling very simply because of the water inside the object ( eg : potato ) that is rapidly vaporized when come into contact with the very hot oil . Incidently this is a very good thing as done right , all the water coming out of the object keeps it from taking on too much oil , which would cause you to have over-greasy food . Edit : Also note as @SF commented below , that this can also be a very BAD thing if you put something with too much water into hot oil . Adding this in so nobody burns themselves .
Frying the chicken tends to set the muscle fibers by drawing moisture out . An example of this would be taking a thin ( 1cm ) cutlet and frying it until both sides start to turn golden . It will be pretty dry and hard . Pressure cooking it on the other hand tends to soften the muscle fibers without drawing moisture in ( if anything , its putting moisture in ) . So , ideally , you should boil/pressure cook your chicken prior to frying in oil ( though do make sure to drain the chicken first to prevent splatters ! ) . Additionally , you should undercook the chicken slightly in the pressure cooker since you 'll be finishing it in the fryer . If you are broasting the chicken , then you are going about the recipe incorrectly by frying then pressure cooking it . When broasting , you should pressure fry - if that makes sense .
This is not true anymore , and modern recipes omit that part . Back then , when silverware was made either from silver or pre-stainless-steel-alloys the acid in sourdough ( and other foods * ) would interact with the metal and corrode/color the metal and/or spoil the food . So put your sourdough in your ( stainless steel ) mixing bowl and knead it in your kitchen machine as you like . * examples ( thanks to @Stephie ) : eggs ( there were special egg-spoons made from horn or tortoise shell and later bakelite or plastic to prevent the sulphur in the eggs interacting with the metal ) , marmelade/jam ( special spoons , jam would get runny if it got in contact with the wrong spoon ) , potatoes ( there is a rule to not cut them with a knife ) .
I would say it depends . I find once you freeze an item the flavor/texture/propeties of the item is changed ( for better or for worse ) the next time you goto use it . If your using caramelized onions in a soup , or stew , something where flavors blend together for a longer period of time , then yes go ahead . however if your using the caramelized onions on top of a steak or something similar . Then my answer would be no .
There are lots of different techniques for preparing rice , and all are equally valid . They do lead to different results , but it is up to you do decide which one you prefer . There is not one " right " way we can recommend over the other . Yes , there is a noticeable difference . Rice pre-fried in fat has a different texture . It is less fluffy , and can be even slightly slimy if cooked in too much water . It does not dry out as quickly as rice cooked in watery liquid only . It also has a slightly different taste , especially if you use a non-neutral oil . But this difference in aroma may be too subtle to notice if your paella is heavily seasoned , it is most pronounced when the rice is cooked on its own and served as a side .
Yes , you can freeze either the wrappers or the pre-made rolls and they will work fine . The wrappers I buy are typically frozen .
<URL> says you can safely store waffle batter for 3 months , but I 've had bad luck freezing it as far as quality goes . After thawing and cooking the batter , the waffles did n't really " rise " enough to be worthwhile . They tasted ok , but the texture was n't nearly what I wanted . Waffles are essentially a <URL> , and I believe the baking powder does n't have the same effect after freezing . I do know that you lose the frothy goodness that you get from the whisking/beating , which is important in achieving the light , fluffy lift inside the crispy exterior . I was told that if you use a yeast recipe instead of a baking powder recipe , you can thaw it overnight and it will give the yeast time to activate by morning - unfortunately I have n't tried it so I 'm only passing it on as a suggestion . What I 've found works : Making a bunch of waffles and freezing them between layers of wax paper . Not as good as fresh , but better than store-bought frozen , and very convenient . Storing the dry mix in the pantry ( short-term ) or freezer ( longer-term ) , as I generally have milk and eggs on hand and have time for a quick whisk . Not as convenient or portable , but tastier . If you modify the recipe using evaporated milk or dried buttermilk , you can make them with water and egg instead of milk and egg . As a side note , you probably have about 3 days in the fridge .
I have never tried it but when I googled wok burners ( thinking to find a standalone high-output gas hob ) , I found <URL> article about a wok ring called the " WokMon " on Serious Eats and had to post it here : A couple months ago I was approached by Glen Lee , an inventor who claimed to have an ingenious new device for cooking in a wok at home . Seemed to me that if it worked the way he promised , it would to revolutionize home wok cooking in the same way that the Baking Steel revolutionized home pizza-making . I played around with it a lot , measuring , tinkering , reporting a few issues ( it 's still in development phase and has kinks to work out -- luckily Glen has been extremely receptive to feedback ) , and generally cooking up a storm . I 'm happy to report that this thing solves a problem I 've been trying to work around for over a decade . It 's called the WokMon , and it 's like steroids for your gas burner , helping to concentrate your flames and , more importantly , put them under the center of your wok , where they 're supposed to be . It looks like it does exactly what you need but is way cheaper than buying a specialized heat source and does n't require more equipment . Unfortunately , they 're not quite in production yet , it seems , though you can <URL> . Here 's an action photo of the flame it produces off a standard gas stove : <URL>
In the Caribbean and other Rum producing areas , you find Rum in all sorts of recipes It is sometimes an unusual flavour pairing , but not necessarily bad . In savoury cooking it adds a semi-burnt sweetness , more like toffee or butterscotch than straight Rum Caribbean and Mexican cooking is well blended and harmonious with many common ingredients ( chilli , coriander , avocado etc. ) Considering the popularity of spicy jerk meat and Rum , the Rum Fajitas would be an interesting experiment
I always go in this order : Garlic/ginger/chili / spring onion whites This is to infuse the cooking oil with these flavours . Cook for short amount of time ~ 30secs . onions/peppers/carrots / harder veg These need a little more cooking that the other bits , so I give them a bit longer . mushrooms/sugar snaps/soft veg These need less cooking , so bit less time . bean sprouts I like these to be a bit crunchy so add them right at then end and basically just warm through . If I 'm using bigger veg like broccoli/cauliflower then I do them separately to the other veg . I use a little of the chili/garlic/ginger and fry that for 30 secs , add the broccoli fry for another minute or so just to brown the florets , then add some water , turn down the heat and put on a lid , to steam the broccoli . Once its done I remove to a separate plate the add back in at the end . It basically depends on how much you like each veg cooked . If you prefer your peppers crunchy , put them in nearer the end .
As far as food safety is concerned there is no issue . A few days at fridge temps wo n't grow anything scary . Food quality may be a concern . Vegetables want to be able to breathe . Some will handle being sealed worse than others . The problem is having the plastic in contact with the vegetables will hold condensation against them and promote spoiling . Luckily , the kind of firm veggies that can benefit from sous vide will also handle being sealed for a little bit . Just do n't hold them for more than a couple days and watch for mold .

When using fresh corn in place of canned or frozed , should I cook the corn first ?
Good question ! Corn is very versatile . I 've found that fresh and frozen whole kernel corn are very interchangeable when used in casseroles . Most casseroles cook long enough that you could use either without making any adjustments . However , canned corn is a different animal . Because it is more processed I would use it in recipes that call for it but I would not consider it a substitute for fresh or frozen .
There is no single universal answer to this question , as it depends on the specific food and outcome desired , but there are a couple of common themes that influence whether starting from cold water or boiling water is the preferred method : Larger foods that need to cook through may overcook on the outside before the inside is cooked , if started in boiling water . For example , potatoes are usually started in cold water so that they cook through to the center . Some foods contain enzymes that will be deactivated at boiling questions , but may act more quickly at lower temperatures . Starting in boiling water would be for when it is desirable that the reactions be inhibited ; starting in cold water facilitates the reactions continuing . Sometimes it is simply for precision to get a repeatable recipe . Boiling water is always the same temperature ( at least for a given altitude ) , so beginning cooking at the boil is reliable and repeatable compared to starting with cold water which may have an unknown temperature curve as it comes up to the boil .
With a gratin , the idea is that the vegetables ( traditionally just potatoes ) are sliced so thinly that they cook very easily in the cream/cooking liquid while retaining some texture . If you pre-cook the vegetables , they will just disintegrate into a mush during baking .
Putting corn in water only makes sense if it is still in the husk , as that will keep the husks from burning . Soaking precooked de-husked corn would make no difference to you . You can barbecue it , but as it is precooked I 'd keep the cooking time down to a couple of minutes , just long enough to heat it up and get a bit of color on it . Any more and it may be overcooked .
You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders . It 's just the cooking times are shorter , that 's all . Set your oven to 250-275F , and roast those ribs until they 're done . I 've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours , but as many as 5 . Optionally , you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook , with some liquid in the foil pack . Just be aware that they 'll cook faster if they 're foiled . And depending on your preference , you may want to take them out of the foil to finish them .
Phyllo dough , in particular , comes in several thicknesses , from the thinnest which is used for baklava up to horiatiko ( country ) style which is used for rustic pies . You can substitute , but there is definitely a noticeable difference and I think you 'll appreciate why a good traditional recipe calls for a specific type . Saveur has a <URL> . Also , keep in mind that although phyllo is very thin and tends to tear , in many cases a small amount of tearing is no problem . You are making multiple layers and any small imperfections will disappear . Just be sure to keep the pieces you are n't currently working with covered so they do n't dry out too fast . For wonton wrappers , they are also often available in at least two thicknesses in good Asian groceries . Again , there are traditional uses for each . When using them in a non-traditional context such as ravioli , you 'll have to decide for yourself which you prefer .
The cooking snobs will say that butter is better , and even my fading taste buds can sometimes detect the difference . But much of the time you can make the substitute . BTW the reason for the 7/8 figure is that butter runs about 1/8 water . So you may have to use 7/8 cup of oil and 1-2 tablespoons of water . The biggest difference between solid fat and oil will occur when you see lines like , " Blend together with a pastry blender until you have crumbs the size of a pea . A pie crust made with oil will not be a tender flaky crust . However for bannock making in the bush , corn oil works fine as a substitute for lard . and it 's a heck of a lot easier to keep . A comment below mentions cookie recipes . For this to be successful , the flour to fat ratio has to be fairly high . Bannock is 1 cup of flour to 1-2 tbs of fat . This is small enough that the flour absorbs all the oil . Another signal : If the directions call for chilling the dough then there is enough fat in the mix that using oil would make the recipe way too liquid . I suspect this is the case with many cookies . Cake recipes usually do n't have as high a fat : flour ratio as many cookies , but cakes are often very fussy about ingredient ratios . So : Test before counting on it . It does work for bannock . 1 cup flour 1 to 3 tbs fat or oil 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder Tiny amount of water . If you are going to fry the bannock , go light on the oil . Mix flour and salt and baking powder . Mix in fat . Mix in just enough water to make a stiff dough that holds together . It is very easy to overdo . Knead only long enough to mix . Cooking : 1 . Shape into long strips about 3/8 " thick , wrap around smooth pole and bake over a 10 second fire for 15 minutes rotating slowly . ( A 10 second fire : YOu can hold your hand where the cooking happens for 10 seconds ) Pat out into 3/8 to half inch slabs . Cook in a frying pan over a 20 second fire for 5-10 minutes on a side . Pat out to 1/8 " thick . Drop into a bucket with 2 inches of smoking hot lard in the bottom . Lift out with tongs after 30 seconds . Method 1 will keep campers busy for a long time . Method 2 makes bannock you can use for a meal later . Method 3 is the fastest method , but it is dangerous .
Well , it looks like I found my answer : <URL> is used for creating <URL> . Field corn includes a few types of corn ( dent , flour , flint , waxy ) . I 'm not sure if all types of field corn are used for masa de maíz , however . So , if anyone has a more specific answer , feel free to give it . I 'm guessing really any kind of corn could be nixtamalized , however ( but some kinds may be more ideal than others ) . Other kinds of grain besides corn can also be nixtamalized .
As André Soltner is basing his recipe from recollections of growing up in Alsace , it may be that it was not the garden pumpkin , as it 's known and which resembles the large US variety most familiar as decoration . Several of the many grown in the Alsation region might be better suited to soups and other recipes . The Hokkaido , similar to Hubbard , has a very hard outer skin , and very dark orange flesh ( image courtesy of Wikipedia ) . <URL> The Muskat-kürbis has bright orange flesh , and is used as a vegetable and for soups , in desserts , as well as being made into jam ( image from <URL> ) . <URL> As canned pumpkin is denser , it may give you the result you 're looking for in the NYTimes recipe .
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .
Great question Chris ! I 'm a US baker who has been baking for a LONG time and never gave it any thought whether my measuring utensils are " legal " or " traditional " - they say " 1 cup " , " 1 Tsp " , " 1 TBSP " , etc. . In practice , all this has meant to me is that when my US recipes call for 1 cup of flour , I measure 1 level measuring cup of flour . Same for teaspoons and tablespoons . My European cookbooks refer to ingredients in weight ( 250 grams , for example ) . In those cases , I would either convert those measurements into my more familiar cups , tsp 's , TBSP 's , etc. , or use another set of utensils with measurements marked on the side . While I 've used the written measurements for a guideline , I 've always also depended on the preparation instructions to determine the correct consistency of the dough or batter . This is particularly true for flour and liquids . Regarding uniformity in the measurement tools , unfortunately for the home cook , there is no one monopoly . Every grocery store , dollar store and cooking store has an assortment of measuring cups and spoons . Some of the better measuring cups , like those from Pyrex , have volumes written on the side of the cup to use as guides .
Yes , with any kind of ' stewing ' sauce , the flavour improves the longer you cook it ( provided it 's a slow , gentle process ) . The longer you leave it , the more chance the flavours have to ' marry ' . I have a recipe for a pasta sauce that calls for 6 hours of slow simmering ! You may also have noticed in the past that left over pasta sauce that you eat the next day is really good , for the same reason as above . Any stew , in fact , like bolognese , casserole , chilli , bourgignon etc , is really delicious when left overnight and reheated .
It may be that your oven is not up to temperature before your first batch goes in . If it 's not hot enough your cookies will have more time to melt and flatten before they cook . Try giving the oven 10 more minute preheating time before putting your first batch in .
100 ° C for 7 hours sounds just about perfect . The meat will be meltingly tender by then . In fact I think you could go even lower on the temperature if you like , say 80 ° C or 90 ° C. Of course , if you want to be absolutely sure , check with the thermometer , but unless you know that your oven is unreliable or you happen to be in possession of the largest pig shoulder in the world I am 100 % sure it will be more than done in 7 hours on 100 ° C. Good luck !
<URL> Sugar balances both salty and sour flavors in dishes . Adding just a little sugar makes salty things taste less salty and sour things taste less sour , without actually reducing the amount of salt or acid in the recipe . For example , the liquid base of the Pad Thai recipe I follow contains chili powder , fish sauce , tamarind , and light palm sugar . The palm sugar balances out the sour from the tamarind and the salt from the fish sauce . Without it , the noodles would come out too sour and too salty . I do n't know the physiological reasons for this . Would be interesting to hear them if someone knew ...
If you 're planning to smoke your sausages , natural casings will allow for greater smoke penetration than many non-natural casings , and they wo n't impart any odd flavors of their own to the meat . That said , when you first open a container of natural casings , they may have a strong smell because of gas build-up ; let them air out ( in the fridge ! ) and they 'll be fine .
Use a sharp knife , dull knives do n't slice , they split the same way an axe splits logs and that will generate that sideways force that throws carrot bits . Also learn to practice your slicing and chopping technique . You should n't be dropping the blade straight down like a axe or guillotine . You should be moving the blade in a orbital movement , so that you are slicing in a forward direction while the blade is on its way down to and through the carrot . By slicing properly much less of your veg will have that energy buildup because they wo n't " snap " apart but will be sliced apart neatly . Search YouTube for Basic Knife Skills and watch several videos , then practice , and start slowly . You will get faster with time and time only , do n't rush it or you 'll get sloppy and may hurt yourself .
The difference between sweet and tart cherries is not so much the sweet , but more the tart . If you look at the nutrition information you 'll find that tart cherries have about 2/3 as much sugar as sweet , but twice as much Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) which is what gives them their tart flavor . With this in mind , most sweet cherry pie recipes include lemon juice , while tart cherry pies recipes do n't need the lemon juice for balance . Recipes for both type seem to use between 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar , so as Stephie says , " It 's mostly a matter of taste " From personal experience - I made 2 cherry pies using a tart cherry pie recipe , except substituting Bing cherries . I got more great reviews for those pies than you would believe . ( It might have something to do with the sweet tooth gene on that side of the family )
Jennifer Frazer experimented with frozen coconut milk and wrote about it on her blog . The conclusion is that you can freeze cococnut milk . The taste is preserved , but the consistency is not . Jennifer writes : The thing is , you can still use it just fine for purposes that do n't depend on coconut milk 's texture or consistency ; Coconut milk is an emulsion of oils in water . To freeze and thaw the coconut milk is enough to affect the emulsion . You can compare the situation to cow 's milk . Cow 's milk is also an emulsion and the mouth feel will change if you freeze and thaw it . References : <URL> <URL>
As far as I understand the basic chemistry , golden syrup should do well for you . A different option is to dissolve a lot of sugar in some hot water and then to slowly reduce it to the right consistency , which should be more or less identical to corn syrup .

Can buttermilk be frozen successfully ?
Yes , you can freeze buttermilk . When thawed , the emulsion will break into solids and whey . This makes no difference for baked goods ; you can also use a blender to restore it to a smooth , thicker liquid if needed for applications like salad dressing . See also : <URL> . <URL>
There are a variety of frozen desserts which are all related . The main difference between ice cream and frozen custard is the amount of eggs used to thicken the base mix . Philadelphia style ice cream is made from a base mix of milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings . French ( or simply plain ) ice cream is made from a base mix which is essentially a very thin custard or creme anglaise : milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings thickened with egg yolks or whole egg . The base mix is cooked to thicken , and then chilled prior to churning . Frozen custard is very similar to French style ice cream , but with a greater ratio of eggs or egg yolks to dairy or liquid in the mix . With this information , you can adapt nearly any custard recipe to be freezable as ice cream or frozen custard . My survey of frozen custard recipes indicates a ratio of eggs to dairy of about 5 egg yolks to three cups ( 700 mL ) dairy , or 6 whole eggs to 4 cups ( 1 L ) of dairy . To adapt any custard recipe for freezing , then : Adjust the ratio of egg yolks to dairy to no more than about 5 yolks per 3 cups dairy . You may also want to adjust the total yield to be based on no more than 3 cups dairy depending on the capacity of your ice cream maker . Many home ice cream makers have a 1 quart ( close to 1 L ) capacity , but you need to leave room for the air which will be incorporated as the mix is churned . I recommend not using whole eggs for frozen custards , as the yolks facilitate a better texture , and create the rich eggy custard flavor . Frozen desserts are served colder than custards normally are , so the flavors will be more muted . You may need to compensate by increasing the ratio of flavoring ingredients . This will be hard to judge until you have made the frozen custard/ice cream at least once . Cook the custard until it thickens on the stove top , per the normal custard method . Chill it rapidly for safety , and then hold it for at least 4 hours ( overnight is even better ) . While I can not explain the science , empirically , allowing the mix to mature lets the flavors meld and produces a better frozen dessert . Churn it into a frozen dessert according to the instructions of your particular ice cream maker . Note that you can even convert a custard recipe into a Philadelphia style ice cream by eliminating the eggs completely , and simply creating a dairy/sugar/flavoring mix . These still benefit from overnight maturation before churning .
Try peeling the asparagus . This would work better with <URL> . Since the outer skin of asparagus is so smooth , I can see how glaze would just slip off . Peeled asparagus will have a slightly stickier surface for the glaze to hold on to . An added bonus is that some of the glaze should penetrate if the asparagus is peeled . Be aware that peeled asparagus will cook faster than unpeeled . See also : <URL>
From <URL> There 's a difference between bubbles formed from under-proofing versus over-proofing . Bubbles from under-proofing tend to be flat but large in diameter . If unpopped , they can blow up an entire pizza . This is the process by which pita or pocket bread is made . Bubbles from over-proofing tend to be high but smaller in diameter . They rise up like little ping-pong balls and eventually form a hole at the top , at which time they stop expanding . They almost always burn . Most pizza bubbling problems are of the under-proofed type . To resolve a bubbling problem , dough fermentation must be adjusted accordingly . To stop bubbling caused by under-proofed dough , increase the amount of fermentation . To stop bubbling caused by over-proofed dough , reduce the amount of fermentation . In addition to proper proofing , it has been found that reducing the amount of water in a dough formula can help with reducing bubbling when dealing with the under-proofed type . The reduction in moisture aids in creating the pinpoint holes in the cells walls . In addition , you want to make sure you properly knead your dough . Some people poke tiny holes in the dough to prevent overly large bubbles . As a final resort you could observe your pizza in the oven and poke bubbles as they form .
It appears to be feasible ! I found <URL> in which a " cooking expert " gives a specific recipe : Frozen egg tempura Remove the shell of a frozen egg and cut the egg in half lengthwise without thawing . A peeled egg is slippery , so put a paper towel on the cutting board before you place the egg on the board . Lightly flour the halves of the egg all over , and dip it in a mixture of three tablespoons of tempura flour and two tablespoons of water . Deep-fry the egg in oil heated at 160 C for about three minutes . They 're not too specific about the results , but I imagine they 'd have mentioned if it exploded or anything ! <URL> mentions doing essentially the same thing for a scotch egg : Freeze the raw egg in its shell , de-shell the frozen raw egg and wrap the sausage meat around it whilst it is still frozen . This can be difficult as the egg 's albumen defrosts quickly . Coat in flour , egg and breadcrumb . Fry till the scotch egg floats and the crumb is a deep golden brown . It 's the only way I know that gives a soft runny yolk every time . I do n't know what frying temperature was used , and it 's got sausage and breading around the egg rather than just tempura batter , but it 's a deep-fried egg , starting from raw/frozen , and produces a soft yolk .
Well , it looks like I found my answer : <URL> is used for creating <URL> . Field corn includes a few types of corn ( dent , flour , flint , waxy ) .

Flash-freezing equipment would n't hurt , but for the normal home cook , the main things are to chill it as quickly as reasonably possible , package it with as much air removed as possible ( vacuum sealers help here ) in individual meal-sized portions , then freeze . Thaw in the fridge if possible , or by heating your vacuum-sealed bag in a water bath . ( Microwaves are pretty bad at heating frozen blocks of food and even with a lot of attention paid will tend to overheat part while other parts remain frozen . ) Choose recipes that work for the equipment you have , and adapt your weeknight process to combine the frozen ingredients with fresh ones . Soups , many sauces , chilis , beans and rice dishes freeze well under normal home conditions , as do some meat preparations ( the texture can change , and usually , the larger the cut of meat , the more likely it is that the change from freezing will be negative ) . Without flash-freezing , foods with a high water content tend to become mushy , so that the broccoli you steamed to perfection will most likely thaw out to be limp and potatoes may be mushy .
That will be absolutely fine , whether you make the sauce in the classic way by cooking the yolks with the lemon juice , or with one of the variations where the lemon juice is added only at the end . I would , of course , defrost it first , rather than add a whole ice cube of lemon juice to the pan .
I would probably use diluted white cranberry juice , as being the flavour closest to rice wine vinegar . I am not sure if the acidity would be sufficient , however ; you may need to add lemon juice . A substitute for soy you will not easily find , as the development of those sorts of flavours requires fermentation .
You did n't say what kind of dough you are thinking about , so I 'll try to give a bit of an overview first : With most doughs , the way you handle it will influence the development of gluten . Roughly stated : more handling/stretching equals more/longer strands and more density . Type 1 : Pie crust , shortbread , bisquits etc. . You want to avoid excessive development of gluten as it would make the result tough instead of light and flaky . So we aim for as little handling as possible , " cut " or " rub " the fat into the flour and add liquids at the end with only a quick stir . Use of a rolling pin would counteract this approach , so no use here . Some people will even avoid re-rolling this type of dough whenever possible . Type 2 : Bread etc. . Here , the gluten strands will trap the co2 developed by the yeast , thus enabling the bread to rise . The type of strands can be influenced by the method of kneading . If you go " round and round " , either in a mixer or by hand , you 'll get lots of small bubbles , giving your bread a uniform texture inside . If you do a " stretch and fold " ( usually repeated a few times during the first rise ) you get longer , aligned strands and large bubbles . With each method , the dough will be way to sticky to use a rolling pin , at least at the beginning . Most doughs will become less sticky when the gluten strands have started to form . ( My great-aunt always said " it 's ready when it cleans the bowl and your hands " . ) That 's the point where the rolling pin could be used theoretically . Usually that 's after the first rise , when you knead gently again , then shape . I 'd strongly advise against the use of a rolling pin here because a few things are likely to happen : a ) you might " burst " too many co2 bubbles , b ) you are likely to work too much extra flour into the dough , because your hands " feel " when it starts to stick , the pin does n't , c ) you actually are n't supposed " flatten " the dough , rather gently stretch it somewhat , then fold over to the middle and just press to make it stick onto itself again ( to quote my great-aunt again : " Handle it roughly first , gently later . " ) . And you will use your hands anyway to move the dough , so why clean the pin , too ? Type 3 : Pasta dough This is actually one type of dough where the use of a rolling pin might be an option . Based on flour and very little liquid , pasta dough needs to be kneaded rather firmly and longer , because the development of gluten strands is somewhat inhibited due to the " dryness " of the dough . The pin could give you the leverage your hands do n't . Some people roll the dough a few times through the pasta machine on the wide setting before shaping it , too .
If you mean like a potpie or a TV dinner ? Yes you 're fine , go for it . If you 're really worried about it here is the rule . ( been a few years since I took serveSafe ) When reheating foods you want the internal temperature to reach 165 degrees F. ( 74C ) for 15 seconds . In practice ( at home NOT at the restaurant ) just get it nice and hot . Note : Homemade foods generally need to be carefully reheated but not frozen dinners etc. . They cook them pretty good at the factory .
Hah , I get to cite my new copy of McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " for the first time ! There are several things going on here ( all of which can be found in the 2004 edition of McGee , most on page 50 ) . Firstly , as Nathan indicates in his answer , most of the liquid that is sold as buttermilk these days is in fact not " real " buttermilk , but so-called " cultured buttermilk " , made from ordinary skim milk and fermented until acid and thick . Secondly , even traditional buttermilk was somewhat sour , though less than cultured buttermilk . To find out why , let 's examine the processes that were involved in making it . If you want to make butter , you start by separating milk into cream and whey . Since the 19th century , we typically do that with a centrifuge and it goes quite quickly , but before then , we would leave it to gravity . That would take a while , and the milk would start to ferment while it happened - especially in warmer environments . This fermenting is essentially lactic acid bacteria converting lactose into lactic acid , which sours the milk a little . So in either case , you would have more lactic acid in butter + buttermilk than in butter + whole milk .
Yes , just put them in a freezer bag and squeeze out plenty of air from it before you tie it up . It does n't matter if they 're shelled/crushed etc. . You can keep them for as long as anything else - some say 6 months , some say a year , some say indefinitely .
You should be able to cut them , wrap them up , and freeze them to be baked and served the next day without a problem .
I 'm writing this so it helps someone else . I decided to freeze my fondant because I did n't have time to air dry the fondant like @Sunishtha Singh suggested . I did n't want the fondant to become too dry either by adding the tylose/CMC powder or use the gum paste/satin ice because personally , I prefer the flavour of fondant better than gumpaste . So , I found <URL> link and <URL> one and decided to follow the instructions . But I did add a bit of guess work and common sense and instead of freezing the fondant panels for 15-20 minutes , I only froze for 10 minutes and did n't open the fridge/freezer until the 10 minutes were finished . I also put the panels in the freezer at the same time and worked very quickly to attach the panels once the 10 minutes were finished . Once I attached the panels , I switched on the aircon but not for more than 15-20 minutes and it seemed to be fine , even considering that it had been raining all day . I do n't know what role does the fridge play in this but I have a frost free fridge . I also used black fondant for the panels and even though I personally find it much more moist than the white fondant , the panels attached nicely and the shoebox looked very smooth , at least from the sides . I hope this helps someone and I give the fondant freezing a thumbs up :)
You ' can ' cook it from frozen , knowing that a few things will suffer . First , the outside will be somewhat dried out and over-cooked before it is done in the center , depending on how hot the oven is and the cooking time . That being said , if your Haggis is pre-cooked , it should be OK . You can also ' Hurry up ' the defrosting process by putting it under running water . This can affect texture , depending on what you are defrosting . Finally , you can speed-defrost something by using warm running water , but this carries SOME SERIOUS RISK if you do n't cook it right away . The bacteria will love the warmth and will start to multiply , but I have done this many times when I knew I was using a meat immediately .
Traditional dough will not freeze well . You have to par-bake it . In the US , the & ldquo ; freshly baked & rdquo ; bread sold in most supermarkets is par-baked dough . This is risen dough , which is then baked for 70 to 80 % of the usual baking time , cooled , frozen , and shipped to the supermarket , where it is baked again until golden . You could do the same . A par-baked baugette is a bit denser than a traditional one . Freezing the dough before baking it kills most of the yeast preventing it from working during the first stages of baking .
You 'll want to look for one of two products either <URL> or <URL> . Lait fermenté is a cultured buttermilk . This is homogenized and pasteurized milk which has been cultured with lactic acid bacteria . This is the de facto standard buttermilk in modern times . If you go to an American grocery store and buy buttermilk you are buying cultured buttermilk . Lait ribot is traditional buttermilk . It is the fermented liquid leftover from churning butter . This is not commonly found in the US and other western countries . See also : <URL>
Some muffins with very thick batter can be held for up to several days before being baked , but these are the exception , rather than the rule . However , quick breads , whether sliced loaves , whole loaves , or muffins , freeze extremely well . Muffins are especially easy to reheat in the microwave or a toaster oven , and can be an ideal way to have quick breads prepared in advance . Another way ( which offers fresh , hotly baked breads ) that I like I do before busy holidays that will have muffins or cornbread on the menu , is to prepare the dry mix , and the wet mix , and stick them ( separately ) into the refrigerator . Then , it is only a matter of combining them , putting them in the pan , and baking .
If you use frozen you will not have the option of having a thick cheese soup with more crisp broccoli ; i.e. if you were considering adding the broccoli toward the end after blanching it for a more toothsome floret , this would only be fruitful with fresh . I am unsure about the blogspot link in Sebiddy 's post , but my experience with frozen broccoli is that it gets the job done but not very well . As a point of logistics , using frozen without first thawing will net you a hearty release of water from the broccoli if you do n't thaw first and may cause your mornay some heart-ache if timed poorly .

What is the difference between marinara and spaghetti sauce ?
<URL> is a style / kind of a sauce that originated in Napoli usually made with tomatoes , garlic , herbs , and onions . A spaghetti sauce only says where to sauce is used ( obviously on <URL> ) but does n't say anything about what the sauce is exactly like . There are <URL> which are basically spaghetti + sauce : <URL> -- which literally translates to " spaghetti mariner 's style " <URL> -- " spaghetti with garlic and oil " , originated in Napoli <URL> -- " spaghetti whore-style " <URL> -- " spaghetti coal worker 's style " and , uhmmm ... <URL> -- an Italian-American invention
There does n't appear to be any difference . Wikipedia says " In English-speaking countries , Berliners are usually called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam , jelly , custard or whipped cream " , and <URL> says " The English translation of krapfen is cruller or doughnut " . There are so many variations of filling , topping , shape and so forth that it is hard to establish a single identity anyhow .
Depending on where you are , the word <URL> can mean a few different things . In Mexico it refers to a flatbread made of either wheat or corn and a few other ingredients . These flatbreads tend to come in standard sizes in the United States at least , one of which might be labeled the " burrito " size . A <URL> is one use for a tortilla . A burrito consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped around a filling . Often the filling might include beans , cooked meat , rice , and perhaps vegetables .
The difference between the two can be seen below ( the post it is from is an <URL> ) : The corn flour is the white , finer ingredient on the right . The first obvious difference is that the texture will differ between the two . The second is that it would have different uses . Both would be effective at displacing gluten-containing flours ( as in , neither would be helpful in gluten formation ) . In terms of substitution , however , corn meal is likelier substituted by something like semolina flour and corn flour is likelier better substituted by quinoa or garbanzo bean flour .
I ran across a good resource while looking into duck eggs . I 'll let it speak for itself : The higher protein in Duck Eggs means they must n't be overcooked , or the whites will go tough and rubbery . Some people say they will be too tough if you completely fry them : they advise to rather partially fry them then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan , cover and let the steam moderate the heat and finish cooking them . Most people , though , seem to say they do n't notice a difference between fried chicken and Duck Eggs . Swapping Duck Eggs interchangeably in recipes for chicken eggs : some people say you ca n't ; others who substitute all the time say nonsense , it 's fine . When the Duck Egg whites are beaten they will come up a bit higher owing to the protein . They take a minute or so longer to start frothing up , but then make up for lost time . There 's a great deal more information on the page as well : <URL>
There is no strict delineation between these two terms . Either can be savory or sweet . Some common differences are : Mousses may get their foaminess from from plain whipped egg whites , a meringue , whole eggs , whipped cream , or something else ; a souffle is always leavened by whipped egg whites . Mousses ( except for some seafood mousses , which are gently poached ) are rarely cooked as a whole dish ; souffles are always baked to get additional rise . Mousses are almost always served cold ; souffles are usually served hot , immediately out of the oven to retain the additional rise they get in the heat of the oven . One might consider souffles a type of baked mousse , much as quiches are a specific type of tart , but that terminology is rarely used . See also : <URL>
It 's a regional preference on what they 're called . When you 're buying seeds , they 're also called " bunching onions " , and I grew up calling them " scallions " , although I think that scallion specifically do n't have a bulb yet formed , while green/spring onions might . update : A little research suggests that " spring onion " is the preferred term in the UK , AU and Canada , " green onion " in the US south , and " scallion " in the US northeast , however I 'm not sure what the exact boundries are as in the US mid-atlantic , I 'll see both " green onions " and " scallions " for sale , with " green onions " being larger ( scallions with no bulb , maybe 12 " / 30cm long , while green onions might have a 2 " / 5cm bulb , and have over 24 " / 60cm of green top ) . It 's possible that " green onion " might be a polysemous term that varies by region .
I found a link that will provide the explanation you are looking for : <URL> Here is a direct quote from the site : Masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater ( cal ) , soaked overnight , and then ground up while still wet . Sold in this form , it 's called fresh masa , and it makes the lightest , fluffiest tamales . In Mexico , it can be purchased at tortilla factories in two ways : with smooth consistency for making tortillas and , upon request ( if you are lucky ) , with a coarser consistency for making tamales . ( Be careful to differentiate between masa para tamales and masa preparada para tamales ; the latter , available at some tortilla factories and large Mexican groceries , is the coarse-textured masa mixed with lard and flavorings .

Will says ... • ' Gravy is made from the juices of oven roast meat , thickend with a starch such as corn flour . • Jus is made from the same juices that has been refined and condensed to get a clear liquid naturally thickened . • Sauce could be made from the same juices with other ingredients added such as wines or spirits to compliment the food . Sauces can be served hot or cold . • Coulis is a thin fruit or vegetable purée , used as a sauce . If the purée is too thick , you can add some water and sometimes sugar ' . Source : <URL> My personal feeling for sauces is they can be made from anything . Parsnips , Mushrooms , Celeriac etc when ' Gravy ' and ' Jus ' must have Meat juices as their base . On menu 's you 'll often see ' Gravy ' on pub menu 's where they are n't trying to sound to posh , probably using some sort of packet mix . Jus ' on French style menu 's OR people trying too hard . Finally you 'll see something like " Beef and Juniper Sauce " on my menu and many others because ... Gravy sounds too common and Jus sounds too poncy .
Pectin is a polysacharide found in the cell walls of plants . There are two main divisions of pectin used in cooking : high methoxyl ( HM ) and low methoxyl ( LM ) . The high methoxyl is used in most jam and jelly recipes . It requires sugar and acid to gel . When the pectin is dissolved out of the cell walls it is very dilute and picks up a negative charge that prevents the molecules from binding to each other and gelling . Adding sugar isolates the pectin molecules from some of the water while dding the acid removes their charge . Pectin HM is thermally reversible which means it can be set , melted , and set again . Instead of using sugar and acid to encourage gelling , low methoxyl pectin gels in the presence of calcium . It is used in glazes and reduced sugar jams . It is not thermally reversible . Pectin NH is a type of LM pectin that has been modified to be thermally reversible . The more calcium in a gel the less able that gel will be to melt . Pectin NH gels with calcium but unlike other LM pectins it requires less calcium . This would mean that it could still be melted and reshaped . The recipes that I have seen that use pectin NH both have less sugar and require remolding . From what I have seen pectin NH tends to be more expensive . It is typically used in low-sugar pastry fillings and glazes . <URL> <URL> <URL>
Mincing produces smaller , more irregularly-shaped items than dicing . Dicing is generally uniform , usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch on all sides , kind of like a tiny cube . The best way to explain the size difference is visually , check out <URL> for a great picture near the top .
Offal is a general term for any parts of the animal 's innards which are not the conventional cuts from the muscle and bone . It would vary by cuisine , but could include liver , kidneys , heart , brains , stomach , or tongue . Those particularly fussy about what they eat might even extend it to things like tail and neck , although most would n't regard these as offal per se . Tripe , on the other hand , refers specifically to the stomach . It 's usually washed , and often bleached , then slow cooked , although again , the preparation varies by region . Common tripe dishes come from the stomachs of cow and sheep , and despite falling out of favour as a cheap alternative to regular meat , it 's still quite popular in some parts of Europe .
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .
Pies originally were specifically to denote enclosed items ( the crust sealed the item that was to be eaten ) . In many cases , the crust was n't actually eaten -- it was a nasty charred thing that was discarded . In time , pie crusts improved to the point at which you 'd eat the whole thing ... but the star was the filling , not the crust . Tarts , on the other hand , are closer to a shortbread cookie with some sort of a topping . The crust is typically a critical part of the item , rather than just being a container for something else . ( which in part is why people mention tarts being more shallow ; there 's a higher proportion of crust to filling ) . So , my best attempt at determining if I should call something a pie or a tart . Note that these are in order . ( as I 'm trying to make sure that ' pizza ' is a pie , not a tat ) fully enclosed by crust : pie full bottom crust , with a crumb or lattice top : pie no crust at all : not a tart , but not a pie , either . has no sugar or fat in the crust : pie chewy , flaky or crumb crust : pie not structurally sound enough to be picked up and eaten one-handed : pie was cooked in a tart pan : tart baked without a pan : galette over 2 " / 5cm tall ( not counting whipped cream or berries ) : pie less than 6 " / 15cm across : tart shortbread crust : tart ... I have no idea what I 'd categorize thing that did n't match something already .
I 've only heard of massaging kale . If you rub the greens together they get softer , darker and more tender and useable in a salad . Never done it with anything else . Wilted is steamed or blanched greens . Wilting definitely changes the texture and can make the greens more palatable and less bitter . I wo n't eat raw collards . I also always salt and squeeze my cooked spinach before using as it knocks out the bitterness .
If I remember correctly , flautas are made with a softer flour tortilla while taquitos are made with a harder corn tortilla . Both are filled with similar fillings and then wrapped and deep fried . However , you can oftentimes find taquitos made from flour tortillas and flautas made from corn tortillas ... so what 's the deal ? There is another differentiation : size . Flautas are often longer than taquitos , as taquitos are made from taco sized tortillas , while flautas are made from burrito sized tortillas . Another little tidbit if you go to a fancier Mexican place : flautas are often narrower on one side to create a funnel shape . But this is not common in your standard places . TL ; DR ; They 're oftentimes the same thing
<URL> is distilled from actual orange blossoms , and will have a subtle orange flavor , probably more delicate and complex than orange extract , at least on a per volume basis . Orange extract comes from the zest or colored part of the fruit , and is a very powerful flavoring with a strong orange presence , but no acidity . You will find that blossom water is more commonly used in recipes from the middle east and northern Africa , that have migrated up into Italy and France as well . Orange extract is used in more assertive , more typically western recipes . Given that fresh oranges are readily available , and the zest can be removed and use directly , using either of these is not as common as it otherwise might be .
There is considerable overlap between cupcakes and muffins . Method From a technical point of view , muffins are made by the muffin method , making them small quickbreads . In the muffin method , the wet ingredients are combined in one bowl ; and the dry ingredients are combined in another bowl . Then the two are quickly incorporated together with minimal mixing to avoid gluten development . This gives muffins a somewhat coarse crumb . Cupcakes are small cakes , and are made by one of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method , the reverse creaming method , the genoise method , the chiffon method , and so on . They tend to have a finer crumb than muffins . Contrast While no single criterion distinguishes a muffin from a cupcake if you do not adopt the technical definition above , the following trends exist : Cupcakes tend to be sweeter than muffins ; there are savory muffins such as cornbread Cupcakes are often iced or frosted , whereas muffins tend to have no topping , or a simple crumb topping Cupcakes usually have a head or top no larger than the body of the cupcake ; muffins are often encouraged to overflow their baking cup , so that their top is larger in diameter , giving them somewhat of a mushroom shape Cupcakes are almost always , well , cupcake shaped ; muffins can be made as just muffin tops Cupcakes are almost never crispy or crunchy ; muffins are often encouraged to brown and develop texture , especially on the tops
I have just looked in the book " Thai Food " ( by David Thompson ) . Both are very similar . The main difference I can see is that there are souring agents in the red curry ( fish sauce and shrimp paste ) . These are absent in the panaeng which has peanuts as a major ingredient in the paste ( and nutmeg ) . The panaeng is also usually made with beef which is simmered in count milk until tender .
Short answer : yes , milk chocolate differs from chocolate by the milk its manufacture . Real chocolate ( as opposed to many other confections ) is made from chocolate liquer , which despite the name , is not alchoholic , or even liquid at room temperature . The fruit of the <URL> tree contains seeds , known as beans . The harvested fruits are allowed to ferment , bringing many flavor and chemical changes to the beans , as well as removing the pulpy fruit . The beans are then husked for the seeds inside , the nibs . The nibs are the first true chocolate product , although they are not sweet . The nibs are roasted , and then ground . This is chocolate liquer , a solid colloid of cocoa fat and solid particles . It would be solid at room temperature , but the grinding process melts it . The cocoa liquer can be pressed to separate out the cocoa butter ( as for use in the cosmetics industry ) , leaving cocoa powder , but that is not the point of your question . Instead , to manufacture chocolate , the liquer is <URL> , a mechanical process that makes the suspended particles much smaller , part of what gives chocolate its smooth mouthfeel . Various products can be made from chocolate liquer , or cocoa butter , including : baking chocolate - essentially , just chocolate liquer , hardened and tempereded . May or may not be fully conched , so may not be as smooth as chocolate intended for eating . chocolate or dark chocolate - Chocolate liquer , possibly extra cocoa butter , and sugar . Minor optional ingredients often included are vanilla or other flavorings , and lecithen , an emulsifier . milk chocolate - Same as dark chocolate , with the addition of condensed milk or milk solids , depending on whether it is made via the Swiss method or the Hershey method white chocolate - cocoa butter , plus sugar and other flavorings chocolate chips - Another form of chocolate in a particular shape . Many manufacturers do n't make these from true chocolate , but rather substitute another fat which does n't melt as easily as cocoa butter , for economy , and so the chips hold their shape in the oven chocolate bunny - Chocolate molded into the shape of a bunny , then tempered and cooled German 's chocolate - A brand name of quite sweet dark chocolate Chocolate labels which list " cocoa percentage " are saying what proportion of the chocolate is cocoa liquer or additional cocoa butter or cocoa solids -- that is , stuff from nibs , as opposed to sugar or other flavorings . The cocoa percentage for milk chocolate tends to be much lower than that of dark chocolates , although not every milk chocolate has a lower percentage than every dark chocolate . See <URL> for information on tempering chocolate , which gives its snappy mouthfeel . Edit : On dairy products in dark chocolate : I was very surprised at Lemontwist 's comment , so I did some googling and found this <URL> : A good quality dark or semi-sweet chocolate will only have sweetener / sugar in some form added , and may also include a touch of soy lecithin as an emulsifier . These brands are milk-free by ingredients , but keep in mind that most brands of chocolate are made on shared equipment . That is , an inherently milk-free dark chocolate may be made on the same equipment as milk chocolate . See below for my note on cross-contamination issues . The complications arrive as some brands of dark and semi-sweet chocolate do include milk ingredients for a " smoother " end result . This is particularly true in mainstream brands like Hershey 's . Some ways that you may see milk listed in the ingredients include milk solids , milk , milk powder , whey , butter oil or butterfat ( see the Ask Alisa post on butter oil ) , or even casein . If milk is in the ingredients , it should be listed in a clearly identifiable manner per the labeling laws , but still , use caution . This is still in line with the information I provided , as I did mention " other flavorings " in dark chocolate , and it is not a universal or even common practice as far as I know . For people with strong allergies , the cross-contamination issue may be more of an issue . Vegans would have more of an issue , as lecithen is a very common ingredient in chocolate of all types , and may be animal sourced . Vegans would specifically need to reseearch and obtain chocolates that meet that standard . Googling will find many such products , but I did not find an easy single reference list .

What water temperature should be used for instant coffee ?
You have quite a bit of leeway with Instant Coffee . You can brew it using water of your desired temperature . I would recommend using water just below boiling point though , around 95-99 degrees Celsius . You could use 85-95 degrees Celsius water as well ; it wo n't make a big difference in terms of extraction of flavour , and here is why : How instant coffee is prepared in the factory : Coffee beans are roasted They are ground very finely ( 0.5 mm - 1.1 mm in diameter ) The ground coffee is mixed with water in percolation columns which reaches 155 - 180 degrees Celsius . This is the extraction process . This mixture is then concentrated and/or dried using vacuum evaporation , freeze drying , or spray drying methods . The result from this is what you get in the store . Conclusion : All of the very particular factors that one must consider when trying to make great coffee have already been decided for you . You have no control over roast , grind , time from grind to extraction , extraction time and temperature , or time from extraction to consumption . All of this been decided for you . It is up to you . Brew it at whatever temperature you like to drink your coffee at . However , it may be slightly harder to dissolve the coffee and get good flavor at cold temperatures . Keeping it on the hotter side may be better . That 's just chemistry though . Sources : I am a professional barista and coffee connoisseur . <URL>
Let 's do some physics again : All culinary aspects aside , a roast is a ( more or less ) solid " blob " with a certain mass and volume . To get the roast to the desired doneness , you want to reach a certain temperature at the center of the meat . The crucial properties are the <URL> and <URL> of your meat or , very simply put , how fast your meat transports the oven heat towards the center of your roast , which again is calculated on oven heat and starting temperature of your meat . This depends on geometry , or , the maximum thickness of your meat . Hence the rule to stick your meat thermometer in the thickest part of your meat . Two ducks next to each other are two separate masses , which heat up independently , not one roast of greater thickness : Two ducks in your oven need basically the same time as one duck of the same size . ( A good oven should be capable of heating enough that the second duck wo n't lower the temperature significantly . ) Now to the practical points : For the reasons discussed above , it is easiest if you choose two ducks of about the same size and weight . If not , one will need less time than the other and you might have to take one bird out of the oven sooner . If both shall be done at the same time , the smaller one needs to go in a short while after the bigger one - how much time difference is very hard to say , even with those handy " roasting time by weight " charts in cookbooks or on the Internet : Use a thermometer , not a timer , to determine doneness . ( And do n't forget that the core temperature will rise a few degrees even after you have taken the bird out . ) You ask about positioning in a conventional oven : By all means roast your birds side by side , not one above the other . Stacked , they will be very close to the top or bottom heating element , which will at least dry them out but more likely burn the top or bottom , while shielding the other bird from the heat on one side . Even if you switch positions occasionally ( do you really want to juggle hot pans ? ) , you get the same effect of a " burned-but-undercooked " bird . And no , foil will not prevent this . And just because we repeat it again and again : Do not determine the doneness of your roast by a watch , use a meat thermometer .
In this recipe , the nibs are being used as an accent ingredient , adding some crunchiness and a burst of chocolate flavor , as well as some bitterness . They are not essential to chemistry or overall outcome of the recipe . You may : Simply omit them Chopped or coarsely ground roasted coffee would have a similar profile , although not as fatty , and of course , coffee flavored Try another crunchy , possibly somewhat bitter ingredient like chopped nuts ; almonds , hazelnuts , and ( in some people 's opinions , although I dislike them ) walnuts have a particular affinity for chocolate .
UHT ( Ultra High Temperature ) processing kills all the pathogens in the milk , so it can be conserved for a long time . However to make yogurt you add bacteria ( lactobacillus ) , so if there are n't other microorganism it should be even better .
Also known as a " bird 's beak " , it 's used for <URL> root vegetables ( turning them into little footballs ) and making fancy , delicate cuts when carving garnishes from fruit or vegetables . More practically , the curved blade is great for peeling round vegetables and fruit . It 's a complete pain in the butt to sharpen without a belt grinder ( or pro sharpening service with same ) , but gosh , it looks neat . Congrats on the fun present !
Room temperature for sure ! Eating something like salami chilled detracts from its flavour . Obviously you want to be a bit careful about leaving it out for a really long time , but I usually take anything I want to eat out of the fridge well before consumption .
I do n't want to disappoint you , but the sad truth is that extra virgin olive oil is unsuitable for all the cooking methods you mention . When you heat any oil past its smoking point it starts to deteriorate and can even become dangerous . Olive oil , extra virgin in particular , has a lower smoking point than most other oils . In fact , you will be better off with an olive oil of lesser quality . Such an oil will have been processed and thus purified , increasing its smoking point . You may think that butter is unhealthy , but at high temperatures it will actually withstand the heat better than extra virgin olive oil . Good oils for the purposes you mention are canola oil , sunflower oil , peanut oil , and grapeseed oil .
You can definitely still cook it on the barbecue , just do n't ' cook it as long because the heat has less distance to penetrate . You can also try flipping the pieces more often so each side is n't exposed to the heat for too long , it ca n't penetrate too far into the meat before it is flipped over and begins cooling . This should allow you to get some nice crusting on the outside and keeping it juicy in the middle . Get that bbq SUPER hot .
Out of personal experience and out of personal taste I 'll give you the following : If you like it moist 55 degrees C for 4 hours . If you like it to feel like steak : cook it like steak . If you like your meat to feel more like fish cook it like steak for 20 minutes . Then drop the temperature by 10 degrees C.
Do n't let the tail wag the dog . When smoking , you want to figure out time and temperature first and worry about smoke second . This can obviously vary widely . That said , there are things you can do to get more smoke going : If you can smell it , you 'll get some smoke flavor . If you can see it , you 'll get more . If you 're not getting ( much ) visible smoke then you need some combination of 1 ) wetter wood 2 ) lower temperature 3 ) larger wood . You get less smoke when the wood just goes up in flames . Chips are particularly prone to do this . Larger chunks smolder better . Things also smolder better when they 're very wet or the fire is n't so hot . But again , you want to figure out your temperature and then get smoke , not make large temp changes just to get smoke . If you 're doing very low and slow ( 225F ) , sometimes that 's not enough heat to get your wood smoking well . Smaller chips or higher temperature are the only things I 've found that really solve this problem .
You can try to set up my at-home on-the-cheap monkey-at-the-controls sous-vide machine . I take a nearly full 22 quart stock pot with an analog instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature and watch the temperature and adjust the dial accordingly . With this only needing 30 minutes you probably just want to get the water to exactly 72 degrees C and then immerse the potatoes without adding any heat . The amount of energy in 20 quarts of water is phenomenal and you wo n't lose a lot of heat to the air . Alternatively you could get 72 degree water and a beer cooler and try that way for the extra insulation .
I freeze cheese all the time , mostly mozzarella . It keeps longer . ( If I keep mozzarella or similar cheeses too long in the fridge it gets moldy , often even before its expiration date . ) However , I usually use frozen cheese only for cooking - i.e. if it 's going to be melted . Freezing cheese does change the texture . Parmesan , though , being a hard , aged cheese would probably be less affected by freezing . However , on the same token , aged cheeses keep very nicely in the fridge , so I would n't see much benefit in freezing it .
Cocoa butter crystallizes into various types of crystals depending on the temperature at which it cools . If the butter cools into an ad hoc assortment of crystal types then they do n't arrange themselves uniformly and the chocolate will be dull and sticky . The process of melting chocolate to encourage proper crystal growth is called tempering . You will find <URL> a <URL> <URL> on the subject here . You can use any chocolate that contains cocoa butter . However , if you are going to be putting that much work into tempering your chocolate you might spring for the nicer quality chocolate and not just plain Hershey 's . Alternatively , if it meets your needs , you can either serve your chocolate still melted or make a thick syrup/fudge dip that stays soft and does n't need to be tempered .
I do n't think you are looking for a specific temp ( i.e. ; crack or soft ball stage ) after adding the citrus since you have already " contaminated " the syrup . My preferred recipe is from Epicurious.com ( <URL> ) . I have used it twice with great results and am going to be making again very soon for the holidays .
As far as I know , Collagen starts to break down below 60 ° C/140F , time play a big role , i.e. to get the same breakdown at 60 ° C as 80 ° C you might need 24-48h instead of 3-4h . The higher the heat the more the meat is contracted and it will get dryer , in a stew that might not be as obvious as in other cooking methods but it should still be the fact . Compare tough cuts of meat cooked sous vide at 55 ° C-60 ° C for 24-100h , they get very tender and moist . So the benefit will be moister meat . I think you must cook the veggies at much higher temperature ( 80 ° C-95 ° C ) so you would have to separate the two . If the end result is worth the effort I do not know , I have wanted to try doing a ' stew ' with meat cooked sous vide at 55 ° C - 60 ° C for 24h + , with the veggies done on the side at 80 ° C-95 ° C , normal stew style , to see if it would be better , but I have never tried . Sources Hum , I 'm sure you or anyone can find enough sources to argue that you need 70-80 ° C ( 160-180 ° F ) , see e.g. On food and cooking ( 2004 ) pg 163 " ... Meats with a significant amount of tough connective tissue must be cooked to a minimum of 160-180 ° F/70 -80 ° C to dissolve their collagen into gelatin . " The only potentially credible and official ( what do you mean by that ? ) source that potentially can trump On Food and Cooking is Modernist Cuisine , I will quote . MC 3.78-79 " When meat is cooked at temperatures above 50 ° C/122 ° F , a different chemical reaction -- the conversion of collagen into gelatin -- becomes prominent . " it continues and says " Cookbooks and some scientific sources commonly claim that collagen converts to gelatine " at " some particular temperature . Usually the cited threshold lies between 60 ° C and 75 ° C / 140 ° F and 167 ° F . In reality , the hydrolysis of collagen is simply another example of a chemical reaction whose rate varies exponentially with temperature . " it goes on describing that the exact temperature have not been measured and that it depends on what type of collagen , e.g. breed , cut and age . Finally it says " Tough meats can be cooked until tender at any temperature above 55 ° C/130 ° F ( and even a bit below , if you are patient enough ) . " Also see lots of sous vide recipes on the net saying that you can cook tough meat at much less temperature than 70 ° C/160 ° F and get it very tender . Or try it , I have and it works !!! I have stopped eating primary expensive cuts , flank , shin and brisket tastes much better ! See also SAJ14SAJ reply and Stefanos comment below , as per Baldwin which should be almost as good a source as oFaC and MC Conclusion The answer to the question , " how low can you go and still get collagen break-down " I would answer 55 ° C/130 ° F or even a bit lower . That is NOT a realistic temperature for cooking a stew , especially not if you will put veggies in it , but as far as collagen breakdown goes that is the lowest temperature for ' stewing meat ' .
Unfortunately I do n't agree with the given answers . I recently bought a $ 350 zojirushi rice cooker . According to the manual there is such a thing as " rinse-free " rice . There is even a function on the rice cooker for this setting . In addition , the rice cooker manual explains that the rice should be rinsed several times with cold water .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
Milk is mostly water . Instant coffee will dissolve just fine in milk or even cream . Of course , flavour-wise it 's going to be more like a weak latte than coffee . That 's essentially what a latte is - coffee and milk .
If you look here , at the last paragraph of <URL> , he gives you a fairly easy way of removing the air from a plastic bag without a vacuum . Put your food in the bag and then submerge the bag in water just to the zip . The pressure will expel all the air . Then zip the bag up as you pull the closed portion underwater . This gets results comparable with a home vacuum sealer , I think , with the added benefit that you can include liquids easily . While I would n't consider myself an expert on this topic , I would n't fill the bag with anything you would n't want to marinate your meat in .
I do n't know if there 's an ideal ratio since this is really about how strong you want the coffee to be . It depends on the strength of the roast you 're using , the grind , and how strong you like the coffee . I generally use 2 tbs / 6 oz , but vary it to taste .

How can I get my puff pastry to rise ?
If you 've baked your puff pastry in the past at 375 then it 's probably not a temperature problem , however I usually bake it between 400-425 degrees ( 400 convection or 425 in standard oven ) . Lower temperatures are n't a problem for the baking aspect as it will still cook through . The problem lies in the fact that the heat wo n't be significant enough to generate the steam needed for expansion . Egg wash could be a culprit as it should only be used on the top and not allowed to run down the sides where it will seal the edge together and keep it from rising unevenly .
Yes , you would remove the peas from the pods . <URL> shows how to do it efficiently . And no , the pods are not normally eaten , although according to <URL> you can .
Your metal bowl sitting in your 70 ° F room is 70 ° F ( at least , if its been sitting there for a bit ) . Your plastic bowl , or glass bowl , or ceramic bowl , or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70 ° F. They 're all actually the same temperature . Now , given , when you touch the metal bowl , it feels cooler than the plastic one . This is because your finger is n't 70 ° F , and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than ( say ) plastic . If the dough is room temperature , it wo n't matter -- heat is n't flowing out of it . The dough itself does n't generate much heat . If your dough started above room temperature , it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl . But , if you wanted to keep it from cooling , putting it in a warm place is much more effective . A stainless steel bowl is fine . I 'd avoid aluminum ( and copper , if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing ) due to them being reactive , especially if you 're making sourdough .
You need to warm them up a bit . There are a number of ways to do this 20 or 30 seconds on a griddle ( or a <URL> if you have one ) wrap a stack in foil and place in 325 oven for until warm wrap a stack in a clean towel and steam them using a steamer slightly moisten a towel and wrap it around a stack and microwave them for a bit If you 've warmed them and they are still tearing then your tortillas are no longer fresh .
The best way that I have found to cook okra , and prevent it from being slimy is to avoid cooking it with moisture . If you dredge it in seasoned cornmeal , then pan fry it , you get none of the slime that is common to okra . I have n't done any tests to verify if a quick fry would then prevent it from developing slime if you then add liquid , however . If you 're trying to add the okra to a soup or a sauce , you might still need to spend some time cooking it to break down the slime .
Optimal yeast growth happens at around 37 degrees Celsius ( 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , but dough will rise at any room temperature . As the temp rises , the yeast becomes more active , which is why you 'll sometimes see recipes call over overnight rests in the fridge , where activity slows or stops . Yeast dies at anything above 50 C ( 122 F ) . The important thing is knowing the temperature and , if you 're really particular , the humidity in the air around your proof . This information is used for the sake of timing consistency , more than anything else .
Unless there is something seriously wrong with your stove , you should not have any negative effects from using it to make choux pastry . Simply melt the butter into the water over medium then adjust the temperature to high . The purpose of boiling the water and then cooking the pastry over low heat is to gelatinize the starches in the flour . Your recipe likely adds emphasis to the point of bringing the water to a boil quickly so that you do not simmer the water away . Doing so can have negative effects on the finished product because it will throw off the water : flour ratio and you will not be able to completely gelatinize the starches . If your stove heats up so slowly that you think this might be an issue , you can simply place a lid over the pot as you bring it to a boil , making sure to add back to the pot any condensed vapor on the inside of the lid .
Start with the milk and add ice cream till you reach the desired consistency . If you want to add ' bits ' start when it is about halfway to the thickness you want
you know better than I do , it depends on the orange and type of orange . My mom , an executive chef , used to say that you 'd allow 1-2 lb of oranges for 1 drinkable cup of orange juice . I really think , that it 's highly dependent on the type of orange . I know naval and blood oranges are the juiciest compared to other varieties .
They are a little hard to find , but if you can find a " Bismarck " pastry tip , they have an elongated tip that is perfect for poking into your cream puff to fill . And , on a side note , a couple ways to keep your pastry tube from getting so messy ... Put it inside a drinking glass and fold it down over the sides to fill it . This holds it open and you 're less likely to spill all over the edges . Then , once you gather the open end , use a rubber band to tightly hold it closed . This reduces the mess dramatically .
Per the information on <URL> , there is no mention of the pan being pre-seasoned . But there is also no mention of needing to do so . From the maintenance tab on the linked page : Before you cook Remove all labels and packaging materials . Before using your new cookware , wash thoroughly in hot soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge . Dry completely . General cooking tips Prior to each use , it is recommended to add a teaspoon of cooking oil for better cooking results . Never heat an empty utensil . Be sure there is oil , butter , liquid or food before placing the cookware on the range or burner . It is not recommended to use high heat . Cooking on excessive heat can cause permanent damage to the surface and utensil . Never cut anything in the cookware or use utensils with sharp edges as to avoid damaging the surface . Add salt to water only after is has come to a boil . Salt grain deposit on the cookware bottom will attack the metal as the heat melts it down . There is also other information about cleaning and oven use . All said , I do n't follow a set rule about seasoning non-stick cookware even though I 've often seen it recommended . But when I have heated oil in a non-stick pan it does seem to do better afterwards , especially with older pans . And I always hand wash non-stick cookware . To sum up , I do n't see how you could cause any harm by pre-seasoning the pan and occasionally reseasoning , even if it does n't need it . But this is based on my experience and I have n't used this brand . The only other thing I can suggest is to contact the company and see what they say . Since they do n't mention pre-seasoning , I suspect they will say it is n't necessary . If you do contact them , we 'd be interested in what you find out . And welcome to Seasoned Advice ! EDIT : I was assuming that the OP knew about seasoning a non-stick pan , as the question is about how to tell if a non-stick pan is pre-seasoned when new . To be very clear , seasoning a non-stick pan is NOT the same thing as seasoning a cast iron or other bare metal pan . Should you ( or anyone ) decide to season a non-stick pan , please make sure to follow a recommended procedure .
The mixture should lighten in both color and texture , and it should be ' fluffy ' . It should also increase in volume . The point of creaming is to incorporate the sugar with the fat , while at the same time adding air to the mixture . The air bubbles introduced during creaming expand during cooking , making the cookies rise and giving a lighter texture . Cookies baked with under-creamed butter would therefore remain fairly flat and dense .
The key is to have the finest possible salt . One way to do this is to take any salt you like , and grind it fine in a mortar and pestle . This just takes a few seconds , and then you can customize to a particular sea salt you enjoy and avoid the need to buy a special popcorn salt . A rotating action in the mortar and pestle ( as opposed to pounding ) is most efficient for grinding salt .
<URL> is the " essense " imparted by the wok when stir-frying over very high heat . The characteristic flavor is due to the the Maillard reactions and the charring of the ingredients . Practically speaking , most home stoves do not have sufficient BTU output to achieve Wok Hei . If you have a gas stove with sufficient output , consider yourself fortunate . Get the wok really hot before adding the oil and ingredients ... and stir vigorously . You should also make sure to crank up your hood fan/ventilation , since there will be quite a bit of smoke generated . For those without a high BTU stove ( myself included ) , a suggestion was made <URL> regarding a burner that could be hooked up to a propane tank .
A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread . If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads wo n't raise much . You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens . The more temperature you can give it the better . Another possible factor may be the yeast . Are you waiting enough ? Are you using enough ? Like temperature , more yeast and longer fermentation times ca n't go wrong .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
That 's a really good question . I imagine it was probably stabilized with something that stays solid at high heat , b/c hot cheesecake would be fairly soft . Was it warm all the way through ? My wild guess would be they rewarmed it in the oven , then ( if needed ) blasted with a blowtorch for crispiness .
Oven cleaner will take that right off . If you 're sensitive to nasty harmful fumes you can get the fume free kind . Make sure you follow the manufacturer 's instructions to the letter , and make sure no kids or pets are around .
What I would suggest is rather than adding a syrup , to take some of your cooked beans , cook them a bit more , then liquify them in a blender . This should give you a thick sauce that tastes like the beans , therefore compliments them perfectly . You can then thicken them very slightly if the consistency is still too runny , be sparing with the flour though . In fact , you could probably make something satisfactory by simply using less thickener . If you have a pasty , sticky sauce it 's a classic symptom of too much thickener . Try making a roux with some butter and flour , cook it awhile for a dark roux which gives deeper color and more flavor . You can then add the roux in small amounts to your cooking liquid until you get the right consistency . If you are pressed for time and have some available a couple big spoons of refried beans may just do the trick too .
I 'm going to take a wild guess at what 's happening , based on what I know of thermodynamics , ( but I could be wrong about the whole thing ) When a cakes and bread bakes , it bakes from the outside ... as it forms a crust , it can no longer rise . ( for yeast breads , this is why we slash the top , so it can get a little extra rise out of it ) With a cake , as the sides set , it 'll continue to rise in the middle , creating a domed top . With a metal tube pan , the heat from the outside of the pan conducts to the middle of the pan , so the middle will set shortly after the outside . ... With the silicone pan , you 've actually got an insulator ... the heat 's not going to conduct to the inside , so it 's going to be able to rise longer than around the inside -- basically , the domed cake , but you 've got something for it to stick to , so it does n't fall back down as it sets . As I do n't think the issue is distribution of the batter , I 'd recommend trying other techniques to reduce the domedness of the cake -- cook it at a lower temperature ( try 25F / 15C lower ) for a longer time . You ca n't remove the problem entirely , but you might be able to reduce it . I 'd also look at the instructions that might 've come with the pan -- it 's possible that they have reommendations on how to deal with the problem . ( and it 's possible that this might not be as significant a problem in convection ovens , but replacing your whole oven for a set of pans is kinda silly )

Open Fire Paella - do I need to fry rice ?
There are lots of different techniques for preparing rice , and all are equally valid . They do lead to different results , but it is up to you do decide which one you prefer . There is not one " right " way we can recommend over the other . Yes , there is a noticeable difference . Rice pre-fried in fat has a different texture . It is less fluffy , and can be even slightly slimy if cooked in too much water . It does not dry out as quickly as rice cooked in watery liquid only . It also has a slightly different taste , especially if you use a non-neutral oil . But this difference in aroma may be too subtle to notice if your paella is heavily seasoned , it is most pronounced when the rice is cooked on its own and served as a side .
In the past when I 've cooked in the ground I put rocks into the fire . Do n't really know what sort of rocks , but I 've been involved in sessions that use bricks . Point is that you needs some way to " envelope " the heat around the thing you are cooking so what we did was put the rocks into the fire to heat them up . Carefully remove the rocks before putting the lamb in and then put the hot rocks on top of the hessian covered meat before putting the dirt back on top . Let it sit for a while and you should get a much more even result
You do n't need to grease the paper . However , if you really want to , you can grease it , but beware that the bottom of your cookies can bake quicker due to the extra fat that transfers heat . In most cookies , there is already a lot of fat which prevents them from sticking on their own .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
There are a few factors that could effect this : 1 ) How the meat is cooked and how lean or fatty it is . If you overcook the meat ( although I doubt that you would ! ) or if it 's leaner or fattier . If its a fattier meat add say an extra 2 tbsps or so of sauce and if it 's leaner ( or overcooked ) I would add a tbsp or so less of sauce . 2 ) The viscosity and composition of the sauce . If it 's a white wine sauce ( thinner , less rich ) you would want to add more , however if it 's a hollondaise sauce ( thicker , richer ) you may want less . 3 ) Opinion , some people like more sauce , some people like less . It may depend on the type of sauce which you may want more or less of . Saying this I would say around 4 tbsp of sauce , then account for the additions and your own personal preference . Any more sauce and it may become swamped , any less and you will not have enough sauce to taste or keep the meat moist . It is a very subjective subject so do keep that in mind .
The other answers touch on the fact that its the release of water from the turkey that interacts with the oil , causes the oil to overflow , and then ignite the burner . Generally , this happens pretty shortly after you put the turkey in ( due do any moisture on the outside of the bird ) . To do it safely do n't bank on the fact that you 've removed all the water - do two additional things : Do it outside . In the event something bad happens , better to lose some grass on the lawn than your house . If you do n't have space outside , you can always go to a public park or such . It may seem like a pain but turkey frying should not be done inside . There 's one absolutely surefire way to ensure than you do n't catch the burner on fire by accident . Do n't have it on ! Prep your turkey . Have it dry on the outside and completely thawed . Heat your oil outside . Turn the burner off Lower the turkey into the hot oil Wait 1-2 minutes or so , most of the initial contact between water and oil should over by now . Turn the burner back on and cook the turkey . Also make sure the burner is off while taking the turkey out , just to prevent any spills from becoming terrible . @ChrisWalker , below in the comments , also provides a method for making sure you do n't put too much oil in the pot and thus cause a spill over .
You will need the following : A pot that 's about 12 " in diameter and 4 inches deep Put the broth in the pot , you can buy broth packages usually at Chinese/Asian supermarket . You just need to mix it with water and boil . Food you want to cook in the pot . Sliced beef is my favourite , but mussels , beef balls , fish balls , shrimps , veggies , etc. . You will need chopsticks , hot pot scoop that looks like the following , so you can scoop the cooked food to your own plate : <URL> To add flavour , usually you dip the cooked food in soya sauce , but a mixture of raw egg , soya sauce and satay sauce is used as the deep . You can even add chopped chili , green onions and chili oil to it . Just make the broth . Cook the food you like as you eat . That 's it !
Depends on what you 're juicing . If you 're juicing something like a lemon/lime for lemon/limeade , you can just strategically slice and squeeze to get all but a couple mLs of juice . If you 're juicing something like an apple , you can cook it slightly and then use your food processor to make apple sauce , which can these be squeezed through a cheesecloth/pillowcase for a great deal of juice . For everything else ( practically at least ) , a manual juicer ( like <URL> ) will do just fine and cost a maybe a few bucks .
Short answer : storing food in an open can is normally safe for a short period , but inadvisable . Longer answer : There are three main issues with storing foods in an open can . They are metal oxidation , contamination , and funk . Oxidation . As commenters have observed , cans used to be made of tin , which is toxic . Modern cans are made from either steel or aluminum . If the contents of the can are acidic , cans are lined with a polymer ( plastic ) inner layer . If that layer is broken -- say , by a major dent in the can or by using a knife to scrape out contents -- then the acid can get to the metal and , over time , corrode it , and some of the now-oxidized metal will dissolve into the food . As far as we know , the oxidized metal is not toxic , but it tastes horrible . Contamination . Any open container of food can become contaminated when an airborne water droplet ( tiny -- microns wide ) containing a nasty microbe drips or settles into it . The major biological culprit here is Listeria , which can grow in any moist environment , including spaces refrigerated below 40F ( 5C ) . Also , if juices from your raw meat drips onto an upper shelf , which later gets wiped inadvertently into your container of ready-to-eat food , you are likely to get Salmonella or E coli . This risk can be mitigated if you keep your raw meats on the lowest shelf , but not eliminated . Also , it is worth noting that contamination through this pathway is a relatively rare event -- but even so , it is not worth the risk . Funk . Have you ever put an ice cube in your beverage and notice your beverage tastes strange ? The chemical compounds that give food their flavor tend to be volatile ( meaning they will readily leave the food into the surrounding air ) . Also , the mustiness of a refrigerator/freezer is due to volatile compounds produced by mold and mildew . Foods that are wet and/or fatty can be molecular velcro to these compounds .
White peppercorns are used purely for aesthetic reasons - just to avoid black specs in a pale dish . Unfortunately , in my opinion , white peppercorns taste absolutely terrible . They have a sour , astringent , flavor not at all similar to black peppercorns . I do n't think black pepper looks objectionable so I always use it .
My mother came up with a simple solution - add a capful of oil ( she recommended corn oil ) to the rice recipe . This time around the rice scooped right out perfectly .
Most of the ice creams I 've made have been custard-based , meaning that egg yolks are cooked together with cream and sugar . The mixture is chilled and then churned . For a custard-style ice cream recipe including cocoa powder , the cocoa would likely be dissolved during the cooking step . If you are following a no-cook recipe that includes cocoa powder , I would at least use a whisk to mix the cocoa in as thoroughly as possible . However , dissolving the cocoa in a hot liquid would likely result in a smoother ice cream . Not sure what kind of recipe you are following , but you could probably heat the milk/cream , stir in the cocoa powder to dissolve , then chill the mixture before churning it .
The reason for doing delayed fermentation in the fridge is that the yeast development is slowed down , while still allowing the enzymes that naturally occur in the flour to do their work ( converting starches to sugars , making a more flavorful dough ) . The risk of doing it on the counter instead of the fridge is that the enzymes are working AND the yeast is working , which can over-leaven the bread , and they 'll eat up the sugars you are trying to create with enzymes . Over-leavened bread is n't ideal , but it is n't the end of the world either . There is a lot to learn about bread baking if you want to really excel at it , but " just bake it , it 'll be fine " is always present as you experiment - glad the loaf turned out well ! " No-Knead " bread is a great introduction to " rustic " doughs ( very high water content ) , and to cold fermentation . Cold fermentation is about the best thing you can do for your bread as a home baker , whether or not you are using the no-knead recipe - I cold ferment nearly everything I bake . If you want to learn more about the process and jump off the deep end , Peter Reinhart 's book " The Bread Baker 's Apprentice " is a great place to start . It is detailed without being pedantic , simple without being over-simplified , and oriented for the home baker without forgetting the reasons that professionals do things the way they do .
It really depends on the length of time recommended . Due to the usual long length ( > 4 hours ) of slow-cooker recipe cook times most elevation differences would be negligible . However if a recipe calls for a cook time of less than 4 hours you may see some foods not cooking as usual . Legumes might especially be sensitive to this as they take a very long time to cook completely . Below is a table from <URL> on elevation vs water boiling temperatures . Altitude , m Boiling point of water , ° C ( 0ft ) 100 ( 212 ° F ) ( 984.25 ft ) 99.1 ( 210.3 ° F ) ( 1968.5 ft ) 98.1 ( 208.5 ° F ) ( 3280.8 ft ) 96.8 ( 206.2 ° F ) ( 6561.68 ft ) 93.3 ( 199.9 ° F ) ( 13123.36 ft ) 87.3 ( 189.1 ° F ) ( 19685.04 ft ) 81.3 ( 178.3 ° F ) ( 26246.72 ft ) 75.5 ( 167.9 ° F ) You may need to experiment with longer cook times for foods that you are having trouble with .
I 've heard of adding sugar to stir-fries , to make a caramel flavoured sauce/glaze in Vietnamese cooking , as in <URL> . Although I 've usually seen sugar used , I see no reason why a similar effect could not be obtained by using honey .
Yes ! Cooking with extreme heat is the killer of nutrients in vegetables . Therefore in traditional stir frying , timing is important . The goal is to coat all the vegetables with oil and searing their outer surface and not allowing the heat to transfer into the core of the vegetables . I personally do not like to cook with that kind of a heat , it is just too violent . Instead , I let the vegetable to stay in room temperature and cook them with medium heat , in a regular non-stick pan . However , I stop cooking them while they are still firm , lightly golden and vibrant .
Melting them together makes the chocolate less sticky and therefore less likely to stick to your melting pot . Probably would n't cause any other problems if you did them separately ; there is no chemical reaction between the chocolate and the butter . Either way its convenient to melt them together so that you can do it all at once and save time .
Most people get burned biryani because of the rice . It must be soaked and the par cooked before going into the pot . Also the quality of the rice is important . IMO that would always be Basmati rice . I always soak my rice for an hour for any dish . The cooking vessel has to be heavy and sealed . This ensures that the cooking happens in an almost pressure cooker state inside the pot . Some people seal their pot lid with a flour dough . Cast iron pots are the best .
Doughs are docked to keep them from blowing up with steam while they bake . Thus - you only do it in applications that you do n't want blown up - like blind pie crusts . Puff pastry applications , for example , you usually do want to blow up so you will get a lot of light layers . If you are baking a pastry with a filling then the filling will keep this from happening . If you are baking blind , even with pie weights , you should dock because the weights might not weight evenly and you might still get a bubble .
You will have the best results if you prep by cutting and blanching prior to freezing . This should ensure that moisture content in the veggies does less damage over time in the freezer and improve color duration . I find it helpful to freeze vegetables separately rather than as mixes as you can always grab from multiple bags , but you ca n't unmix mixed vegetables without more work . The majority of vegetables for stir-fry ( e.g. broccoli , peas , etc ) will freeze well enough , the ones in your freezer aisle obviously freeze a bit better than others . If a vegetable has a high water content ( i.e. lettuce , which I hope you are n't stir-frying with ) that is more integral to its structure than the cellulose it is likelier to burst cell walls in freezing ; these vegetables are better to avoid .

What are the ( most common ) different ways to thicken sauces and gravies ?
Major ways of thickening a sauce -- or , for that matter , some other liquid : Starch ( e.g. , flour , cornstarch , tapioca , arrowroot ) Emulsion ( e.g. , butter , cream , yolk , mustard , blending in lecithin-and-fat ) Coagulated protein ( e.g. , blood , egg , pureed seafood ) Gels/polysaccharides ( gelatin , alginate , xanthan , pectin , agar agar , guar gum ) Suspension ( general puree of solids ) Note that some of the examples of one category can also fit into another .
For smoothies , the main body of the drink is fruit that has been blended with some limited quantity of liquid or ice . Typically , one of the fruits is banana , and other fruits ( berries , strawberries , kiwi , etc. ) are added for flavor . They often include a sweetener of some sort , such as honey or turbinado sugar . Milk Shakes are typically composed primarily of milk or ice cream , and may include limited amounts of fruit for flavor . They also usually include some sort of sweetener , such as sugar syrup or malt syrup , or a flavored syrup such as strawberry or chocolate . The general principle is that smoothies are mostly fruit , milk shakes are mostly milk . For your drink , I think it being a smoothie or a milk shake depends on the proportions of the ingredients added ( i.e. more banana means smoothie , more milk means milk shake ) . Based on the general principles from above , you could call your drink either a milk shake or a smoothie and be correct . That said , the original Banana Smoothie , as recorded from 1941 on <URL> , included two big ripe bananas and two and one-half cups of milk . Since that seems to be exactly what you 're making , I 'd say that your drink is a smoothie based on the original definition of the term .
I asked my friend who 's written a cookbook adapting traditional ethiopian cuisine for vegetarians , here 's what he told me . Ethiopian and Eritrean food are basically identical . They were the same country until the early 90s , so that 's not too surprising , I guess . In both countries , <URL> are common and are eaten with teff-based injera . <URL> is a primary seasoning in both countries . He said the only differences are due to climate : Eritrea is at a lower elevation , so the food there uses more warm-weather vegetables like tomatoes , eggplants , etc. while Ethiopian cuisine might have more carrots , for example . However , he did point out that " Eritrean " restaurants he 'd been to in the US ( specifically , in the Bay Area ) were actually closer to what he would consider Ethiopian food anyway , which may explain your experience : you may be eating Ethiopian food at an Eritrean restaurant . Of course , since the cuisines are so similar , this is like going to a " Western New-Mexico " restaurant in China and being served ( gasp ) " Eastern New-Mexico " food -- not too surprising , in any case .
When making the slurry , stir cornstarch into cold water until it has the consistency of cream . This can be set aside until it 's needed , but be sure to stir it briefly before you pour it into the sauce to redistribute the starch granules in the water . You should pour it into your sauce toward the end of its preparation . According to McGee you should use roughly 2/3 as much starch as you would flour . If you are n't using a recipe , add your slurry a bit at time until it 's a thick as you like it . Also remember that the sauce will thicken a bit as it cools , so it should be a little bit thinner on the stove than you intend to serve it .
I would put the milk in a glass , and then put that glass in a large pot filled with warm water , this should help get the milk up to temp quickly with out haveing to worry about going over . When ever I use yeast i always shoot for around 100 F . Since body temp is 98.6 , just stick your finger ( clean finger ) in the liquid and if it feels slightly warm you should be good to go .
Both sweet and mild refers to the sausages without hot red pepper flakes . The fact they are called sweet Italian sausages does n't mean they contain sugar .
Costs to consider when making jam : One-Time Costs Pressure canner Water-bath canner Large pot for making jam in Strainer ( can use a colander-type item or something like a Squeez-o ) Jar rack that goes inside the canner Jar lifter Funnel Jars Freezer-safe containers Jar rings Recurring Costs Jar lids Fruit ( you can often get pretty cheap fruit in bulk from an orchard ) Pectin Sugar Spices Energy usage ( stove ) Compare costs for freezer jam ( no canner required ) , pressure-canned jam ( pressure canners are expensive ) , and water-bath canned jam . Also compare for recipes that do vs do not contain pectin . If you can get a lot of the one-time cost items free ( from grandma 's attic , most likely ) , and if you can get the recurring cost items on sale ( or from your own garden ) , then you can probably come close to commercially priced jam . Personally , here 's what I look at : A ) The cost of the item I would normally buy at the store - generic , cheap brand . Let 's call that price X. B ) The cost of the item I wish I could buy at the store - the really good stuff . That price is usually about 2x to 3x . Then , my goal is to be cheaper than 2x . Another Cost Consideration If you give homemade jam as holiday gifts , spending less than you otherwise would on a gift , there 's additional savings for you .
Pros : Higher smoking point . Regular butter 's smoking point is 325-375F while clarified butter is around 485F . But it can still smoke and burn ! However the higher smoking point means it 'll be much more applicable in terms of sauteing food without worrying about burning the butter . 100 % fat . Often times its hard to calculate the exact replacements in baking when you want to replace a fat with butter because regular butter is n't 100 % fat . Using regular butter , you would need to factor in how much extra water you are introducing into the recipe . Longer shelf life . Without the water and milk solids , the shelf life of the clarified butter will be much longer . Can even be stored without refrigeration . Cons : Less buttery flavor . The milk solids that you are removing makes up a lot of butter 's flavor . By removing this , you are removing flavor .
It might be there for body , but more likely for the umami kick that tomato past helps with . I bet you could leave it out with no ill effect ... otherwise , try some ketchup . You could also open the small can , use what you need and put the rest in a baggy in the freezer .
Id ' say availability , like others have commented on . If you have access to sea , seafood is an easy choice . You can not keep cattle high up in the mountains , that 's why goats and sheep are more popular in e.g. , Greece , where there are no plains for cattle to graze on . Chickens and doves are easy to keep and were cheaper than pigs or cows . Pigs are omnivores . On the one hand , they are happy in forest regions eating acorns ( which cows would n't like ) . Pigs also eat kitchen trash like potato peel and leftovers . On the other hand pigs compete with humans for food ( potatos , fruit ) . Other animals were primarily work animals ( dogs to guard , cats to catch mice , horses to pull carts and ploughs ) and were hence not eaten ( there are exemptions to this rule like Sauerbraten which was made from horse meat of horses that were too old to be used as work animals ) .
First and foremost , for both types remove the white core , which is the most bitter part . Some recipes omit that bit of instruction , assuming the reader knows this . Next , the bitter compounds are water soluble , so soaking the cut leaves for half an hour or - if applicable - blanching will remove excessive bitterness . ( Yes , you will leach out vitamins , but it 's either one or the other . ) Good produce matters in this case , too : fresh chicory / endive is only slightly bitter . If the heads have been exposed to light and warmth , they turn increasingly bitter . So if you can , buy them from stores where they are kept in dark boxes and choose firm , plump ( = fresh ) heads , then store them in the fridge at home . I would assume a similar mechanism for red chicory / radicchio , but it 's not kept dark . But again , pick firm heads . And then there is preparation : A quick stir-fry will keep the bitter compounds inside the leaves , long braising will tend to extract them into the sauce , making the whole dish being percieved as more bitter . If that 's too much for you , blanch first . Also , adding sweet or caramelly notes ( a generous pinch to a spoonful of sugar in the frying pan ) or aceto balsamico can mitigate the bitter taste .
I have had always success with sprouting fenugreek seeds that were bought as a spice . And an Indian friend of mine regularly grows fenugreek for leaves from the seeds bought for cooking . The seeds sold for cooking are whole ( intact ) seeds - they are quite hard and therefore difficult to break and damage . But I can not really say what percentage of the seeds sprouted - it probably would have been higher if I had bought seeds that were labeled for sprouting - but for me it was satisfactory . With most plant species the germination success gets lower with time . The seeds meant for sprouting have therefore often a germination success rate estimation on the label . And the manufacturers might therefore put more care into supplying fresher seeds and seeds of the same " age " to be able to guarantee that success . I have never heard of anyone selling toasted fenugreek seeds ( accept maybe if it has been some spice mix that already underwent some kind of tempering ) . I think sprouts in general are not very traditional elements of North African or Middle Eastern cuisine , where fenugreek is used as seed or less commonly as leaves . Fenugreek sprouts might be found more in Indian cooking ( where sprouts , micro greens and fenugreek leaves are used ) , or in more " hippy " / healthy-bowls styles of cooking . And of course the seeds sold for sprouting can naturally be also used as a spice , but they might be sometimes a bit more expensive ( and I guess that differences in strength of the flavor could also be found - so that the sprouting ones could maybe sometimes be milder / less flavorful ) . Anyway ... you can use them definitely as a spice , as sprouts , micro greens , or grow them into bigger plants and use the leaves . I would be a bit suspicious of the quality of the seeds in the big package if they are sold for super cheap ... but they might be totally fine .
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
All of the sources I read say the same thing ... what makes them different is that they 're fried twice . From <URL> : Frites are the supercharged cousin to paltry American-style fries : made from soft Belgian potatoes called bintjes , they 're thick-cut and -- this is key -- double-fried ( in the olden days , in molten horse or ox fat , though modern options range from lard to vegetable oil ) . Served in a paper cone with mayo and ketchup , properly executed frites -- the ones that have been fried , dried , then carefully fried again -- are an addictive riot of textures : soft and fluffy on the inside , surrounded by a crunchy , greaseless crust , dipped in luxuriously flavorful sauces . From <URL> : There is no fancy skill involved in making these crispy fries , but there is a trick . The potatoes are fried twice . The first time cooks them through and makes them tender . The second time , which can be done hours later just before serving , turns them golden brown and deliciously crisp . From a site <URL> : So high time time for a ( simple ) definition of what makes fries Belgian Fries : freshly cut , irregularly shaped cooked ( fried ) twice fluffy on the inside , crispy on the outside a distinct potato taste at least 10 mm thick preferably served in a paper cone Some sites mention the importance of certain fats or types of potato but the one similarity for all sites is the fact that they 're double fried .
Parsley is both a flavoring herb and a decorative element for plating the finished dish . By adding it during the cooking , it imparts flavor to the shrimp . By adding it to the finished dish , it provides color and flavor . The cooked parsley will have a slightly different taste to it than the fresh parsley . This is how cooks layer the flavors in a dish . TB stands for Tablespoon .
You could try using arrowroot . This is a widely available alternative to cornstarch - it is used in cookery because it does n't turn liquids cloudy like cornstarch does . In your case , it might work better as it also has a more neutral flavour . Substitute 2 tbsps of arrowroot for 1 tbsp cornstarch , and make a slurry with cool water as you would cornstarch . One issue is that overheating can break down the arrowroot , preventing it from thickening , so you are probably better off adding it to the tea after removing it from the heat .
Splenda , besides giving you the runs , is very hard to bake with . My wife had gestational diabetes so we tried baking with splenda and nothing turned out right . Splenda has no nutritional value . Raw sugar is great , but it has a slightly different taste than processed sugar , similiar to brown sugar . Artificial sweetners would probalby have similar issues to splenda , but I 've never tried them outside of sweetening tea .
Nuts can go rancid . I 've also had stale nuts , pecans or peanuts that were exposed to too much humidity . This adversely affects the texture . They need to be fresher than that . Cashews , however , are in a slightly different boat . <URL> Cashews have a toxin in their shells that resembles poison ivy . When harvested , cashews are roasted in their shells to reduce the toxin and make the shells brittle and easy to remove . If these cashews were harvested by an amateur this process might have not been done correctly and you may be reacting to the toxin .
My understanding is that the ratio shifts from 10:1 ( liquid to roux ) for a pale roux , up to about 5:1 for a nutty brown roux , with a somewhat linear relationship between the two extremes . A dark brown roux has very little thickening power , mostly they are used for flavor more than actual work-a-day thickening . The problem may not so much in the roux ratios , but in other ingredient variations . For instance , if you are using a traditional 3:2 flour : fat roux , and your fat is butter , make sure you are using clarified butter , or that you are allowing most of the water to cook out of the butter before adding the flour - excess water in the roux will break down some of the starches and reduce the thickening strength . Finally , there will be some variation no matter what - you can always make a little extra roux in a second pan to integrate if necessary .
Weak organic acids such as those found in fruits and vegetables ( citric acid , malic acid , tartaric acid ) do n't react with sugars . 1 There is no change in acidity , which you correctly defined as measured by the pH. At the same time , sweet and sour are two tastes which are real antagonists - adding something sweet actually reducess the sourness we perceive , as opposed to just distracting us from it . So the sugar changes the sourness ( the taste ) , but not the acidity ( the chemical property ) . Hearing it otherwise comes from the fact that most people do n't even realize that there is a difference between the two terms , and use them interchangeably . 1 They can partake in reactions as catalysts , for example to create invert sugar when cooking up sugar syrup , but the acid itself does not react away .

What are convenient and reliable ways to make the starter for rye bread ?
I 've received some portions from friends and family , which have always worked well . :-) When I 'm creating it from scratch , I mix 200g of rye flour , a little bit of yeast ( which you can leave out ) , 1 tsp of salt , 1 tsp of honey , 1 dl of organic yogurt and 2 dl of water . I leave this mixture out on the kitchen table ( at around 20C ) for a day with a piece of wet cloth on top . After that I add 2 dl of rye flour and enough water to make the dough soft . This sits on the kitchen table for yet another day , after which is should look like a pool of lava and smell a bit acidic . The honey and the yogurt is the magic touch that makes this starter work , according to my books and research . I 've never done anything special to control the temperature or anything else .

Which is better to sauté with , stainless steel or Teflon ?
The advantage of using stainless steel is the fond ( tasty brown bits ) that form in the pan . It both flavors whatever you are sauteing and is often used as the base for a pan sauce .
Well , first off , mold grows from spores , and your Pyrenean cheese was likely already " contaminated " with Penicillium roqueforti , Penicillium glaucum , and Penicillium candidum spores at the cheese shop ( it 'd be surprising if the cheese shop is n't covered with them ! ) . So , if you keep it in a environment habitable to them , they will grow . I suspect that you 'd get the same results even if you put them in two different plastic containers . As to its safety , if it was indeed one of the used-in-food Penicillium molds , it should be safe to eat -- you can make sheep 's milk blue cheeses ( e.g. , roquefort ) after all . But the problem is that the same humid environment that encouraged the Penicillium colonization also encourage other molds -- many of which you do n't want to eat . Also , I 'm pretty sure there are blue-green molds you do n't want to eat .
US Jalapeno and Anahiems ( red jalapenos ) are usually under 2,500 . If you cook them a little bit , it will also reduce the spiciness , while maintaining the flavor .
You will get the roasty , caramelized flavors ; how much influence they will have on the overall flavor of your stew will depend on several factors including : How deeply you roast the them How much you add , proportionately , into the stew How strongly flavored the other items in the stew are Roasting the vegetables will also cook them , so you will want to add them to the stew much later , so they do n't overcook . If you google <URL> , you will find several recipes for inspiration . As to whether this is a superior , or heartier flavor , that would be a matter of opinion . You do n't mention roasting celery or onions ( partners with carrots in the classic mire poix ) , but these are also excellent candidates for roasting , as are all types of root vegetable .
Alton Brown talked about this on an episode of Good Eats , and here 's what I remember : If you cut with the grain , you 'll end up with long strands of protein , like this : From what I understand , this means that it 'll be pretty chewy . Your mouth has to work harder to break the strands up into smaller pieces to be more easily swallowed . If you cut against the grain , you get strands like this : You can see that the strands are much shorter , which means the meat will fall apart more easily ( each strand does n't have as much surface area to connect to adjacent strands ) and will therefore be more tender .

Generally speaking , frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours . A good , heavy , screaming hot pan is required . Oil the steak , not the pan , with vegetable or groundnut oil ( olive oil will burn ) , and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour . If your steak is thick , you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150 ° C until the centre is 10 ° C off your desired doneness level ( if you do n't have a digital probe thermometer , invest the small amount they cost , it is completely worth it ) , then sear the outside on your mega hot pan . This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right .
A few tips : Marinate the meat first ( after chopping , before stir-frying ) ; Mix the sauce first - do n't just dump the ingredients separately into the wok ; Add corn starch or tapioca flour to the sauce to thicken it . I would n't even call it a sauce without any thickening agent . About 1 tbsp per cup of sauce should be alright . ( Note : The sauce should be about 50-60 % water , do n't use a whole cup of soy sauce ! ) Add some other savoury or flavour-enhancing ingredients to the sauce - i.e. toasted sesame oil , rice vinegar , brown sugar/honey . And ditch the oregano . Briefly steam the vegetables in the wok - add just a little bit of the sauce , then cover it for a few minutes . This will make them much more tender after frying . ( Note that this only applies to hard vegetables like carrots , celery , broccoli , etc. - add the soft vegetables afterward ) Add minced garlic with the ginger . The two go together like white on rice .
Keep in mind that tap water is tested to ensure it 's safe for human consumption . Rainwater has no such requirement . While rainwater seems to be a happy-fuzzy natural resource , I 'd like to stress that this could be a serious safety issue . Yes , it seems unlikely , but you need an authority who knows their water . I suggest seeking out a professional opinion on how to properly filter rainwater . Possibly from the people who handle your municipal water supply .
What would a network-attached scale even do ? You 'd have to configure it to report to something , or have something else poll for it ( and then you 'd still have to configure it , either via DHCP , BOOTP or similar to set its IP address ) . It 'd be a security nightmare , as it 'd be like a network attached medical device ( or old printer ) that never gets updates to deal with security vulnerabilities . Some sort of a serial connection like RS-232 or USB is just plain safer in this situation . ... and there are plenty of USB digital scales , as they 're used by companies to weight packages &amp; print out postage . The only reason to not go with USB might be distance limitations ( 5m for USB 2 ) , but you can get USB over Cat5 ' extenders ' . ( which would then meet your ' cat5 ' cable requirement ... but you can also get DB9 ( or DB25 ) to RJ45 adaptors , if you just want to run 232 over cat5 ) ( I 'm a programmer/sysadmin at a US government agency so it 's possible that my security concerns are a little higher than most other people 's . Even if you keep it on an isolated network to only talk to the terminal , odds are that the terminal is going to need to be updated at some point , and you risk it getting infected . Even if they exist , it 's just not worth the trouble . And yes , I do know about the <URL> )
Hello <URL> , it is perfectly safe to use stainless steel wool on a Vitreous enamel . I presume that the cast iron skillet has a Vitreous enamel finish . The reason is simple : Vitreous enamel is essentially a type of ceramic and has a hardness of around 5-6 on the <URL> . Steel has around 4-5 on the same scale . This means that generally , you can not damage it with the steel wool . Also no not confuse the " grit " of the steel wool with its hardness :P The only thing that will happen is that the enamel will get very small scratches and that things will stick a bit better in them . You can get rid of most of them with a good polishing compound if they disturb you to much . Personally I would advise you " not to need " to clean it with steel wool in the first place , but is something burned up badly and you do not have heavy cleaning agents nearby steel wool is an acceptable solution . If it is just for cleaning leftovers , usually soaking in soap water and a hard plastic brush does a very good job as well . Remember that even thou Vitreous enamel is very hard and durable it may be damaged by overheating or crack if dropped .
I 've had a good look and as far as I can see only cloves and allspice have this property . Most websites specify that it 's due to an oil present in cloves however according to Wikipedia the main chemical components in clove oil ( admittedly not cloves but fairly similar ) are : Bud oil is derived form the flower-buds of S. aromaticum . It consists of 60 -- 90 % eugenol , eugenyl acetate , caryophyllene and other minor constituents . Leaf oil is derived from the leaves of S. aromaticum . It consists of 82 -- 88 % eugenol with little or no eugenyl acetate , and minor constituents . Stem oil is derived from the twigs of S. aromaticum . It consists of 90 -- 95 % eugenol , with other minor constituents . As neither eugenol , eugenyl acetate nor caryophyllene have this property the oil that does cause ' plastic clouding ' must be fairly low . Likewise the main chemical components of allspice oil according to Essential-oils . co.za are : eugenol , menthyl eugenol , cineol , phellandrene and caryophyllene . None of these chemicals have chemicals with that property . However many of the chemicals in allspice and clove are also present in nutmeg , black pepper and cinnamon .
TLDR ; If you defrosted the chicken in the fridge , go ahead and refreeze it . If you thawed it on the counter , cook it , then freeze it . I was always taught : DO NOT REFREEZE uncooked meat ! But , I did a search and found this somewhat contradictory statement from a reliable source : " Refreezing Once food is thawed in the refrigerator , it is safe to refreeze it without cooking , although there may be a loss of quality due to the moisture lost through thawing . After cooking raw foods which were previously frozen , it is safe to freeze the cooked foods . If previously cooked foods are thawed in the refrigerator , you may refreeze the unused portion . Freeze leftovers within 3-4 days . Do not refreeze any foods left outside the refrigerator longer than 2 hours ; 1 hour in temperatures above 90 ° F . If you purchase previously frozen meat , poultry or fish at a retail store , you can refreeze if it has been handled properly . " <URL> There 's also this : <URL> Which says 1-2 days for raw chicken in the fridge .
I think you may reach the point of diminishing returns if you try and fix your oven because there 's lots that could be going wrong . It could be that your oven design is just bad , in which case you ca n't fix it anyway . It could be a faulty temperature sensor , or a bad gas valve , or a faulty burner . Your gas supply pressure could be inconsistent . By the time you replace all these you 'll have spent more than a new oven would cost . I 'd first clean it really well . Get all the dust and gunk out and see if that helps . Then you should see if you can find a pro who can have a look at it , test the gas supply , see if there 's any quick wins . One suggestion I 'd make would be to post this on the <URL> forum , the home improvement site . As this is more a question about mechanics and repair you 're likely to get a better answer there .
Non-stick pans have a coating on top of metal , this metal could be aluminum , stainless steel , copper , or any other metal or alloy . The coating does n't make a whole lot of difference to the heat distribution , that is the property of the metal underneath it . Heat distribution does n't change the end quality of your food , it determines how quickly heat spreads through the metal of the pan . What determines the quality of your end result is your technique in using the combined properties of your heat source and your equipment to cook food well . You can make great food with the most basic of equipment if you know how . The type of range you have should have a big influence on your pan choice . I cook on gas which produces a nice , steady heat which I can control very finely , I prefer using a set of inexpensive non-stick aluminum pans as they are light and heat up quickly . I can keep the pan at a steady heat by adjusting the flow of gas . If I ( god forbid ) had an electric stove I would opt for stainless steel or cast-iron instead because these materials even out the fluctuations in heat from the on-again-off-again nature of electric heating elements .
For a brine , no it does n't really matter , except that granulated sugar will dissolve more nicely than raw sugar . The sugar is for flavor more than anything else , though it does help the brine some . It also promotes browning of the meat . If you change one kind of sugar for another , I 'd use a 1:1 swap by weight rather than volume so you do n't have to worry about crystal sizes . Though the sugar does help the brining action some , the salt is the important component . From <URL> : How does brining work ? Brining promotes a change in the structure of the proteins in the muscle . The salt causes protein strands to become denatured , or unwound . This is the same process that occurs when proteins are exposed to heat , acid , or alcohol . When protein strands unwind , they get tangled up with one another , forming a matrix that traps water . Salt is commonly used to give processed meats a better texture . For example , hot dogs made without salt would be limp . In most cases , we add sugar to the brine . Sugar has little if any effect on the texture of the meat , but it does add flavor and promotes better browning of the skin .
Each variety of chile has a subtly different flavor , but generally the kind to use is determined by how spicy you want the dish to be ; spicier dishes need hotter peppers , otherwise you end up with a dish dominated by the peppers . For this reason , most people sort chiles by their spiciness , measured in Scoville Heat Units <URL> . The exact same papers can be used for Mexican and Indian cooking , as long as you want similar spiciness . To give options , I like to keep 3 kinds of dried peppers : a mild paprika , a standard hot pepper , and a ground , smoked one . The sweet paprika is for savor , the hot pepper to add spiciness , and ground , smoked peppers bring that distinctive smoky flavor to dishes . I usually use de Arbol pepper flakes ( about 30k SHU ) to add heat , and smoked hot paprika for smoked stuff . When I have a dish that showcases the flavor of a specific pepper , it 's time to get fresh ones from the store . For general purpose cooking , many people use mild paprika to add sweet , smoky flavors to Italian , French , Spanish , and Balkan cuisines . Generally these are of the Capsicum annuum species . Indian , Szechuan Chinese , and Central American cuisine normally use moderately hot peppers , in the 10-30k SHU heat range . Cayenne , tabasco , and de Arbol peppers are good examples . Thailand ( and some parts of India ) use very hot peppers up to 100k Scoville , called Bird 's Eye or Thai chiles . These peppers may be either Capsicum annuum ( normally milder ) or Capsicum frutescens ( normally hotter ) . Finally , Mexico and northeastern India use the hottest peppers of the Capsicum chinense species , including habaneros and the naga jolokia , which go from 100k SHU to 750k SHU . Mexico is a special case , because many varieties of pepper are mixed to get the desired flavor . Everything from bell peppers to habaneros gets regular use , and may be used smoked or dried .
Prefer the larger , heavier grill . It 's about thermal capacity and grill marks . You want the grill itself to be hot so that when the meat touches it , it immediately sears the meat on contact . The bigger the thermal mass , the better this works . Regardless of what you get , you 're going to need to replace the grates every few years , so bear that cost factor in mind .
You just add any vanilla-tasting product to your coffee . It does n't have to be a sugared " coffee flavor " . The best option should be plain vanilla extract . Then you have synthetic vanilin , which comes as a white powder or in tiny vials of propylene-glycol solution . As it is very concentrated , it ends up being much cheaper than the extract , but its smell is nowhere as rich as that of real vanilla extract . I suppose that you could also use real vanilla pods . I would cut off a piece , cut it open , and place it within the ground coffee during brewing ( if you think it will interfere too much , you can also just scratch out the seeds and use them , but you will be throwing out lots of vanilla that way ) . I have never done it , so I do n't know how big a piece you will need for the taste to be reasonably strong . I suspect that using vanilla extract will be more economical , as vanilla usually needs time to give off aroma , and the short espresso brewing time , even with the pressure , will need a fairly large chunk to make a difference in taste . Still , the pressure-brewed vanilla will have a different taste profile than the alcohol-dissolved vanilla extract , so if you are not happy with the taste the extract gives , this is one more method to try out .
The device is called a " panini press " and they 're available fairly small . I 've seen ones which are n't much larger than a toaster .

Can I get 900F in a charcoal grill ?
As measured by a Thermoworks IR gun thermometer , I 've reached the maximum range on the thermometer ( approx . 1000f ) on some areas of the cast-iron grates of my charcoal grill on several occasions . I used oak lump charcoal in fairly large quantities ( a few layers , started with an electric coil , supplemental charcoal added after the coals were convincingly ignited ) . It turns out this is n't a very useful temperature , of course , but I did get decent results on a dry-rubbed tri-tip steak ( according to those who ate it ; I 'm basically vegetarian ) . I seared each side and then set it up on a higher rack or a cooler spot ( ca n't remember exactly which approach I used ) because it was too hot . It was still quite rare in the middle even after increasing the distance . I just have a rather typical sheet metal grill with an adjustable shelf for the coals and a cast iron cooking surface .
" Instant " coffee typically is disolved in hot water , so I 'd think that just stirring it into a cold product would be less than ideal . You might try <URL> ( as you 're adding sugar anyway ) or try steeping the instant coffee in hot milk or water first , cool it down , then mixing that into the yoghurt .
The first thing I have to say is kebabs and overcooked are synonymous . If you want all your meats and/or veggies to be cooked right , I would advise you to put each item on it 's own skewer so you can take them off as they are finished . As for a broiler and broiler plate functioning as a substitute for a grill , I would say that it wo n't be an exact substitute , but you will at least get the high temperature cooking and caramelization you would expect from a grill ( you will just be missing the smoke flavor ) .
Raw Personally , growing up I 've usually just eat it raw after it 's ripened . That 's the only form that i 've a experienced a persimmon .

The first , served over bread pudding on a whim one evening , was so popular that it was deemed worthy of the last persimmons .

General comments on the shelf - , fridge - , and freezer-life of foods The shelf-life is the amount of time a food can be stored before it is considered unsuitable for use . It may be unsuitable due to quality degradation ( no longer tasty ) or food safety ( risk of food poisoning ) . [ <URL> ] As far as food safety goes , food stored frozen at 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) or below is remains safe forever ; only quality degrades over time . [ <URL> ] . Thus the freezer-storage times below are entirely about quality . If your freezer is set at a temperature higher than -18 ° C ( three-star setting ) , these times may not apply . Especially the safe storage time in one-star freezers ( -6 ° C ) is much reduced . The times all assume proper storage . Freezers 0 ° F or below , refrigerators 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) or below . [ <URL> ] Cans should be stored in a cool , dry place , below 85 ° F ( 30 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The tables given here assume proper storage . Food which requires refrigeration is considered unsafe if left for over two hours at temperatures between 41 -- 135 ° F ( 5 -- 57 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The Tables Regardless of the table below , if a food shows signs of spoilage ( including mold , with some exceptions described below ) , its past its shelf-life . Note that the lack of spoilage does not imply safety . Uncooked Proteins Cooked proteins Dairy Sauces For home-made mayo , there do n't seem to be official shelf-life estimates . Seasoned Advice has a question on this , <URL> . Vegetables Freezer times are given for cooked or blanched , then frozen . Generally , this is required , otherwise enzymatic degradation will occur . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each vegetable . Refrigerator and shelf times are for storage raw . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . Fruits Many fruits must be at least partially cooked ( blanched ) before freezing in order to deactivate enzymes that would otherwise degrade quality while in storage . Some are best frozen packed in acid ( lemon juice or citric acid ) and/or syrup . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each fruit . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . * : bananas stored in the fridge will blacken . This is not a sign of spoilage , and they can be eaten safely . Cooked dishes Generally 3 -- 4 days in the fridge . This includes pizza , soups , stews , casseroles , pies , and quiche [ KC ] . Some salads get a fifth day [ CFG ] . Freezer time is generally under three months . Infused oils Putting any plant matter in oil ( such as garlic , chillies or herbs ) creates the danger for botulism , a rare but fatal disease . Thus infused oils are not shelf-stable . They can be kept in the refrigerator for 3-5 days , discard them earlier if you see cloudiness or gas bubbles . Or buy commercially produced infused oils , they have been treated with industrial methods to kill the botulinum spores . Shelf-stable until opened Pantry ( not refrigerated even after opening ) General tips for storing foods How do I freeze fruits and vegetables ? Fruit . Ripe ( but not overripe ) fruit should be used . Wash them , and sort according to size . Working in small batches , remove pits , seeds , and blemishes . For fruits that turn brown , apply ascorbic acid or sugar and citric acid . Most fruits benefit from packing in dry sugar or a sugar syrup . Small , whole fruits ( e.g. , berries ) can be spread on a tray and individually frozen , then packed in a freezer bag or other airtight container . Vegetables . Most vegetables need blanching . To blanch , immerse in boiling water over high heat or steam over rapidly boiling water ( steam ) . After blanching , transfer to ice bath for the same amount of time as blanched . Drain and dry . Freeze either by packing in a freezer bag with as much air as possible removed , or by allowing to freeze on a tray , then putting in a bag or other container . General guideline is 8 -- 12 months for best quality . The above is a very quick summary of Iowa State University 's <URL> . The five-page document includes full details on over forty fruits and vegetables . Feel free to ask here on Seasoned Advice if that guide does n't answer your question . What about mold ? Some foods are expected to have mold in them ( e.g. , P. roqueforti in Roquefort cheese ) . Unexpected mold , however , is something to be concerned about . Mold can grow even on refrigerated foods , and even those high enough in salt or sugar to deter bacteria . Some molds produce mycotoxins . Mold growth can be minimized by cleaning the refrigerator every few months ( use a mixture of 1 tablespoon of baking soda per quart of water , then rinse with plain water , then dry ) , by keeping dishcloths , sponges , mops , etc. clean and fresh-smelling ; and keeping indoor humidity levels under 40 % . In general , the visible surface mold on a food is only a small part of the actual mold growth . For most foods , any visible unexpected mold grow
Dude you said you have cast iron . Cast iron rules . And it performs very well in the oven . No contest against glass and you can make pan sauce on the stove-top after the roasting is finished . My favorite pan to make roast chicken with is my 12 " Lodge cast iron skillet . Glass is probably better at roasting than cheap cookie style sheets , because it keeps the heat distribution fairly smooth . But glass will not hold up well to heavy roasting use and will eventually ruin your dinner when it cracks or shatters . All Clad makes a great roasting pan with wire rack . But for most roasting a simple cast iron skillet works well and is indestructible .
The possible risks I can think of are ( 1 ) the large thermal mass may mean that the soup cools off too slowly , leading to spoilage in the middle , and ( 2 ) freezer burn on the top of the soup , because there 's no truly effective way to seal out air from a pot . In practice , ( 1 ) is unlikely unless you 're talking about a 25-gallon pot or something , in which case it would n't fit in an ordinary freezer anyway . ( 2 ) on the other hand will be a problem , unless you 're only freezing the soup for a short period . The only risk to the pot is that it may not quite fit in the freezer comfortably , so as people take things out and put things in , they may shove the pot about and maybe break a handle or something .
The goal with ribs is " low and slow " cooking to break down connective tissue . But a quick sear will help to lock in juices and provide a good smoky flavor . I find it 's preferable to do this first so that the smokiness can work its way into the meat over the slow cook to come . After seasoning , I would start with a sear on your grill over direct heat ( 8-10 minutes per side ) . Then , either move to a very low indirect heat on the grill and cover , which will provide a more smoky flavor , or transfer to your oven at a very low temperature ( most home ovens go down to about 250F which is what I 'd use ) . Baste both sides every half hour or so if you 're using sauce . It should take about 2-3 hours at this low temperature to get good results , although you can let it go a lot longer if you want . I would have no problem at all cooking ribs for 6 , 8 , or 10 hours assuming you 've got the time . If you 're cooking on the grill the whole time , the smoke will help create a delicious glaze . If in the oven and the glaze is n't as thick as you 'd like by the time you 're ready to serve , you can crank on the broiler and place the ribs underneath for just a couple minutes to dry out the glaze a bit . You do not need to wrap them in foil during cooking if you have quality ribs and cook them slow . The only time I 'd wrap them in foil would be at the very end once you have finished cooking , in order to keep them warm until you 're ready to serve .
Food processors are wonderful kitchen tools , but they have only existed for a relatively short while . The techniques used prior to their invention still work , but are much more labor intensive . Use a <URL> . Use a mortar and pestle . The results can then be forced through a sieve of <URL> if desired to get a smoother result . You have not mentioned in your recipe whether the beans are cooked . I am guessing that they are from the other ingredients they were to be processed with . If so , the food mill should work very well . If they are not , and you are essentially making a bean flour , the mortar and pestle would be more appropriate , although a lot of work .
They are a little hard to find , but if you can find a " Bismarck " pastry tip , they have an elongated tip that is perfect for poking into your cream puff to fill . And , on a side note , a couple ways to keep your pastry tube from getting so messy ... Put it inside a drinking glass and fold it down over the sides to fill it . This holds it open and you 're less likely to spill all over the edges . Then , once you gather the open end , use a rubber band to tightly hold it closed . This reduces the mess dramatically .
Refrigerate it and the fat will get on top of the water .
Charcoal can get to 700 degrees F but in normal use you 're more likely to be in the 500F range . In order to get to the higher end of charcoal 's abilities there are a couple things you can do : Use natural <URL> , not briquettes . Lower the grill grate to within 1 " of the hot coals If 1 &amp; 2 do n't get you enough heat , consider using the Alton Brown <URL> ( Setup starts around the 8 minute mark )
Per the <URL> , frozen chicken should not be cooked in a slow-cooker or a microwave . It can only safely be cooked in the oven or on the stovetop . A similar warning is given for <URL> as well .
As a rule , avocado should only be frozen in <URL> . When frozen , it should be placed in an air-tight container ( such as a sealable dish or freezer bag ) with only enough room for expansion as it cools . The variable fat and water content of avocados is not well suited to freezing , and renders the thawed product <URL> , a far cry from the normal texture of avocados . The thawed puree , however , can be used as a sandwich spread , in the creation of dips ( such as guacamole ) , or any recipe where solid pieces of avocado are either not desired or not required . If a dish has avocado cooked into it -- again , non-solid form is preferable -- the freezability of the dish would be dependent on whether or not such a dish is normally freezable ( if not normally containing avocado ) .
The key is to have the finest possible salt . One way to do this is to take any salt you like , and grind it fine in a mortar and pestle . This just takes a few seconds , and then you can customize to a particular sea salt you enjoy and avoid the need to buy a special popcorn salt . A rotating action in the mortar and pestle ( as opposed to pounding ) is most efficient for grinding salt .
It 's going to depend on the material your ramekins are made from . If you have glass ones , maybe they 'll break . But the typical porcelain ones should be fine . Keep in mind they 're used for crème brûlée , which is prepared by chilling to set , followed by topping with some sugar , then caramelizing by either a torch or placing right under a broiler . Cold to broiler or torch is a much bigger thermal shock than cold to cold to oven .
Instead of dousing the coals , in a primitive setup , you would be better served to manipulate distance from heat source as your form of temperature control . It can be as simple as adding or removing bricks to space your grill from your flame , or as complicated as a pulley-based system to raise or lower your grate . Using water will cause your coals to smolder , which can give off creosote ( less likely with charcoal than wood , but still a possibility ) . This can impart a rather nasty flavor into your food . If you are unable to or uncomfortable with changing your grate distance , then salt or some other dry smothering agent would be viable .
If you 've baked your puff pastry in the past at 375 then it 's probably not a temperature problem , however I usually bake it between 400-425 degrees ( 400 convection or 425 in standard oven ) . Lower temperatures are n't a problem for the baking aspect as it will still cook through . The problem lies in the fact that the heat wo n't be significant enough to generate the steam needed for expansion . Egg wash could be a culprit as it should only be used on the top and not allowed to run down the sides where it will seal the edge together and keep it from rising unevenly .
To make you pancakes spread more , and thus be thinner , increase the amount of liquid in the recipe . This will make the batter less viscous , so that it will spread more before beginning to set , thus giving you thinner pancakes . I would start slowly , perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk ( or just plain water ) until you find the consistency that you like . You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time , as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture . Of course , there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more . This is normal , and will somewhat even out as the pancakes cook .
In the <URL> , Madhur says one of the few uses she 's found for a plain microwave oven is to roast cashews . She dresses them in a little bit of oil , then spreads them out on a plate in a single layer and cooks them in the microwave oven until they turn brown . I assume dressing them in a little bit of oil helps browning . I found <URL> for cashews and other nuts , but which implies the oil contained in the nuts themselves is enough to get them to brown . And finally , about.com has a page which is specifically about <URL> .

Stir-frying : how much of the oil evaporates ?
The boiling point of most cooking oils is much higher than their smoke points . The boiling point of olive oil , for example , is around 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) , which is hotter than the temperature of a pan on a typical residential range/cooktop . With that said , alcohols and esters which make up the flavor and fragrance of the oil will have lower boiling points and will therefore evaporate . That should not significantly alter the nutritional content of the oil . Furthermore , much of the perceived loss of oil is likely due to a combination of absorption of the oil into the items being fried , and also due to splatter . The latter can not be easily quantified due to its connection with the cooking vessel and the technique of the cook .
In Europe at least , the rules on advertising say : " for a product to be able to make a claim that it was low in saturated fat under EU Regulation 1924/2006 on Nutrition and Health Claims Made on Foods , it should contain no more than 1.5 g of saturated fat per 100 g of solids " ( from the <URL> )
Specifically , the reason you whisk it in slowly at first is to create small drops . If you just dump the oil in fast , it will adhere to itself and make it impossible to break up into droplets dispersed in the vinegar ( or other water based liquid , such as lemon juice ) . This is the definition of an emulsion : tiny droplets of one liquid evenly dispersed in another . Once you 've got the emulsion started , you can pour in the oil a bit faster because the already suspended droplets reduce the room for a big blob of oil to form , and act sort of as " sandpaper " to break up the incoming stream as you whisk .
According to <URL> , you should get at least one year , refrigerated . They note it may become cloudy and solidify , but that this does not affect quality . Allowing it to come to room temperature will bring it back to a liquid state .
While the above suggestions would get rid of the oil splatter problem , they would also result in overcooked meat with a soggy exterior , as all the water created during frying ( for example , chicken releases a lot of juice ) would remain in the pan and steam the meat instead of frying it . Your best bet is to get something called a splatter screen . I 've seen one at <URL> , and at walmart , and I would assume kitchen supply stores would carry it too . A splatter screen is basically a fine metal mesh lid with a handle that fits over a variety of pans/pots and while it allows the steam to escape it also prevents the oil from splattering everywhere by catching in it the fine mesh . The best $ 10 you 'll ever spend .
A little bit less than 1tbsp , maybe 4/5ths of a tablespoon .
Use one teaspoon of dried zest for one tablespoon of fresh zest , which is about what you get from a lemon . Most foods dry to about a third their original size , so I would use one third of the amount called for . Lemons vary a great deal in size , but the recipe probably means one tablespoon of fresh zest , which is normal for " medium " sized lemons . Something to watch out for is that most cheap " dried lemon peel " products are actually made from the zest and a bit of the pith , which will both give you a bitter flavor and short you some of the lemon flavor you expect . Look closely at the zest you buy , if you can see that the individual pieces have two distinct layers , or a pale yellow or white color , steer clear of that brand . This is probably a " get what you pay for " situation , so spring for the higher end lemon zest . I have also had great luck drying my own lemon zest . Unless your kitchen is humid , it will probably dry in a day or two just sitting on a plate on the counter .
The answer is that it will depend on your personal preference for the strength of your coffee , the beans themselves , the type of brewing , and so on . Many coffee bean bags have a reference on the side of them . The standard guideline for most medium roast coffee bean bags is 2 tablespoons per 6 fl . oz . ( 1 cup in your liquid measuring cup ) . The Specialty Coffee Association of America has some interesting info on this , per this <URL> . What the Specialty Coffee Association of America ( SCAA ) has to say : A cup is defined as 6 ounces of water before brewing . This will produce 5.33 ounces of brewed coffee . Or 125 ml &amp; 110 ml for Euro style coffee makers The SCAA defines 10 grams or .36 oz per cup as the proper measure for brewed coffee if using the American standards . If using Euro standards the measure is 7 grams per 125 ml . To further confuse things I will add a few more measures : 3.75 oz per 1/2 gallon 55 grams per liter 2.25 gallons per 1 lb . If you want to know more check the SCAA 's web page at www.scaa.org .
There are many styles of burger , so there is no single answer . Steamed sliders are going to have different constraints than a smashed burger compared to a pub style burger . For burgers that are griddled ( for the purposes of this post , cooked on a hot , flat surface ) , the main issue is how much heat can get into the burger , and how fast ; secondarily , there are issues of sticking and general maintainability . Some hamburger cooking methods rely on sustainable , very high heat to sear the outside of the burger , and give a good crust , even while maintaining a less cooked intererior . This is dependent mostly on the total thermal mass of the pan . Stone - Lots of mass , but low thermal mass . Does n't transmit heat very fast . Also requires considerable care and maintenance to prevent sticking . Pan - There are so many types , it is hard to give a single characterization . Thicker , heavier metal tends to be better . See <URL> for some general advice . Cast Iron - Generally has high weight , and very good thermal conductivity ( compared to any non-metal ) , so often ideal for high temperature searing of hamburgers . Requires seasoning and maintenance . Charcoal ( or propane ) grill -- can develop extremely hot radiant heat , which is ideal for some forms of burger cookery , but can not be done inside . However , there are so many different types of tools and styles of burger , the quality of outcome is going to depend on your skill , what you are trying to achieve , and how you use the equipment you have as much as the specific pan that you use . Similarly , the flavor is going to depend , not only on how you cook ( which can develop the seared , brown , meaty flavors ) , but how you season the meat , and the quality of meat you start with . This is again as important as the particularly pan that you might use .
Coconut oil has a low smoke point ( 177-204C depending on processing ) . Ghee has a smoke point of 252C . The effect of this is that it will be quite hard to stop the oil burning . But that 's not to say it would be impossible - softening onions and garlic in butter or olive oil is common , and they have lower smoke points still . But the texture from frying at a lower temperature will be quite different . It may also affect the flavour of your spices . In addition , the coconut oil will change the character of your curry significantly . That may not be a bad thing . ( all figures from <URL> )
If you are looking to fry veggies then yes it is nessassary to pre heat . If you put them in a cold pan and oil you start ' sweating ' the veggies not frying them . For example : a sliced onion put into a pan with hot oil will cook and have a nice golden brown color as it caramalizes . Put that same sliced onion in a cold pan with cold oil and then add heat the onion first turns translucent and looses moisture . Both of these cooking methods have their uses , but they are different . How do you know when the oil is ready to cook ? It will start to shimmer a little before it reaches the smokeing point . put the vegies in when you see this shimmer , or at the very fisrt wisp of smoke .
Peanut ( groundnut ) oil is a great option . In the US vegetable oil generally means soybean oil or a soybean oil blend . The main things are that it be neutral ( little or no taste of its own ) , with a high smoke point . On those scores , you ca n't do much better than peanut oil . I have not used rice bran oil . Yellow squash generally means this : ( the long one ) It can also mean the other yellow vegetable in the picture or this : What it is not , is butternut : That is a different flavor entirely . Yellow squash is more like zucchini , butternut squash is more like pumpkin . Welcome to Seasoned Advice .
Yes , it is probably true to a small degree , but irrelevant . In any deep fried food , the rapid expansion of water as it vaporizes pushes the oil away from the surface of the food , preventing it from immediately penetrating during the entire frying period . While alcohol may not have the same 1700 ( IIRC ) ratio of expansion in volume that water does when it goes from a liquid to a vapor , it will still offer some of the same effect . The thing is , most oil that penetrates deep fried foods does so after the food is removed from the oil bath , as it cools . Alcohol in the dough would not prevent this .
Not much is out there . Food-grade silicone oil ( dimethylpolysiloxane , for the chemists out there ) is routinely used in medical and food-prep devices , and it has been approved by the US FDA Office of Food Additive Safety for use as a direct additive in diverse foods , like milk , dry gelatin dessert mix , canned pineapple juice , and even salt . Of course , we 're talking about minuscule amounts , in the range of 100 ppm ; at high concentrations , it is a skin and eye irritant . So what level is safe ? We ca n't assume that the FDA ever tested it , as the Office of Food Additive Safety is woefully underfunded . An informal literature search yielded me only a handful of scientific articles looking at silicone oil in frying . The most promising was by Bertrand Matthaus , Norbert Haase , and Klaus Vossman , " Factors affecting the concentration of acrylamide during deep fat frying of potatoes , " Eur . J. Of Lipid Sci . &amp; Tech. , V. 106 ( 11 ) , pp. 793-801 ( Nov 2004 ) ( fig. 3 specifically measures acrylamide concentration as a function of the amount of silicone oil ) . Unfortunately , I do n't have a subscription , so I ca n't tell what the bottom line was . Myself , I do n't see the benefit of using it at home .
Yes , cream soups are typically roux-based . If you add some flour ( roughly an equal amount to the butter ) to the fats , whisk and cook the flour for a couple minutes and then slowly whisk in the milk , it will be much less likely to separate . The soup will also be thicker , which I would imagine is a good thing .
Tough question - there are a lot of non-scientific ways to measure small/medium/large potatoes and nobody seems to agree on exactly what weight each is . However , there are a few ways I identify large vs medium at home . In my experience , a large potato is about the size you would get in a restaurant ( I know , not very specific ) . That is , when I cook at home , the potatoes I purchase tend to be medium - round ( not oval ) and about the size of a tennis ball or baseball . When I 'm at a restaurant their potatoes are noticeably larger , and generally more oval shaped it seems ( closer to a sweet potato in shape and size ) , which makes them great for stuffing like for a loaded baked potato . Luckily most of the recipes I have at home that involve potatoes do n't require precise measurement , so I just stick with my eyeball measurements and do n't even bother weighing them . I found a source online that says this : According to Shape magazine , eatbetteramerica.com and prevention , a medium potato is the size of a computer mouse , so somewhat bigger than that . And I think I can get behind that answer . I 'd say your average computer mouse ( like , one you would get with a new PC , not a fancy third-party mouse ) is about the size of an average medium potato . Another way to eyeball : I 'm a 30 year old male with hands that are neither very large or very small . The medium potatoes in this bag are about the size of a loose fist for me . So a large potato would be bigger than either of those things . As for measurements , I have a bag of medium potatoes and it says they 're 5.3 oz ( 150g ) a piece . I weighed one and it was closer to 6.5 oz ( 185g ) . Based on that I 'd say a large potato would be anything over 8oz ( 225g ) , pushing as high as 12oz ( 340g ) . I found a way to search online for this info : calories . By searching for " large potato calories " I was able to find pages with weights and measures : <URL> <URL> So , in short , it seems like I would consider these good numbers : Medium potato : 2 to 3 " in diameter , 5-8oz ( 140-225g ) Large potato : 3 to 4.25 " in diameter , 8-12oz ( 225-340g ) Below is a picture of the medium potato from my bag , compared to some common household/kitchen items . The gift card is the size of a normal credit card , and the knife is a common steak knife from my utensil drawer . Apparently a medium potato is almost exactly the size of a 1 cup measure !
According to <URL> : Jaggery is not as sweet as white sugar , so when substituting white sugar for Jaggery use about 1/3 less . When swapping Jaggery in for sugar , use anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 more Jaggery than was called for of sugar ( if you want to keep the recipe as sweet as it was . ) That meshes with my limited experience too , so if the jaggery is ground in such a way that it will measure like the sugar you are replacing , and you are replacing 1TBS of sugar , then you would want to use somewhere in the neighborhood of 1TBS plus 1tsp of jaggery . If precision is needed ( which of course does n't really apply here , but bear with me ) consider that the way jaggery and sugar measures volumetrically are unlikely to really be identical . It would be better to measure by weight , or if there is liquid in the recipe , by water displacement .
Chefs are really fast at cooking . It 's what they do . A chef can almost effortlessly crack an egg with one-hand in about a second . Scrambled eggs would be pre-cracked and beaten prior to the cooking-shift .
No recipe alteration needed . Fried meatballs will develop more of a crust , and thus more flavour through the Maillard reaction . In any case , unless you 're making tiny meatballs ( or finishing their cooking in a sauce of some sort ) , they 're going to need to be finished via baking anyway . I would only do the baking method if I had to make an enormous quantity at once . For home cooking I always fry then bake .
Pan frying means letting the food sit in the pan and occasionally stirring or flipping . It tends to be done with larger pieces of food , and at a medium to medium-high heat . Sautéing means shaking the pan back and forth - making the food " jump " , if you 're translating directly . It 's done at a high heat , for a short time , usually with thinly-sliced or finely-chopped ingredients . Shallow frying , according to some references , refers to the food being partially ( halfway ) submerged in hot oil and flipped once , as opposed to deep-frying where the food is fully-submerged the whole time .

Does brining a chicken/turkey before roasting really make a difference ?
Assuming you do n't normally buy pre-brined / injected birds , you should notice a difference ... <URL> , it should be noticeably moist and tender , especially the white meat . A couple of things to try : Increase the time in the brine . 10 hours is plenty for breasts or quarters , but a whole chicken may take longer . A whole turkey will definitely take longer ! Check your salt . A cup of small-crystal table salt per gallon of water should be fine , but if you 're using flakes ( kosher and some sea salt ) , you may be producing too weak a brine ! If in doubt , weight it out . See also : <URL>
Put the pesto in just as the sauce is done and as you 're taking it off the heat . Generally , pesto does not benefit at all from cooking . By adding it to the sauce just as it is being pulled from the heat , it 's temp will equalize with the sauce , without being cooked . Are you planning to serve this over pasta ? If so , drain the pasta ( save some of the pasta water ) while the pasta is still quite al-dente . Simmer and stir the pasta in the sauce for a minute or so . If it needs a bit of thinning out , add reserved pasta water . Only when it feels about ready to serve , add the pesto , again just as you remove it all from the heat . If you are planning on cooking the pasta for a while in the sauce , as in soup , I encourage you to reconsider . I recommend that you make the sauce awesome . When the sauce just seems right , boil your pasta until al-dente ( do n't forget to salt ) . Add the pasta to the sauce , slowly , not too much , not too little . Use the reserved pasta water to get just the right consistency . Let it all simmer for a minute or two , let the pasta soak up the flavor . THEN , when it all looks great , add the pesto , stir , turn off the heat , and serve .
I ran across a good resource while looking into duck eggs . I 'll let it speak for itself : The higher protein in Duck Eggs means they must n't be overcooked , or the whites will go tough and rubbery . Some people say they will be too tough if you completely fry them : they advise to rather partially fry them then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan , cover and let the steam moderate the heat and finish cooking them . Most people , though , seem to say they do n't notice a difference between fried chicken and Duck Eggs . Swapping Duck Eggs interchangeably in recipes for chicken eggs : some people say you ca n't ; others who substitute all the time say nonsense , it 's fine . When the Duck Egg whites are beaten they will come up a bit higher owing to the protein . They take a minute or so longer to start frothing up , but then make up for lost time . There 's a great deal more information on the page as well : <URL>
The reasons people still roast whole birds are : Roasting a whole chicken is easier than butterflying it . While it 's not tough to butterfly a chicken many people do n't know how , or do n't want the cleanup It 's less prep time to roast a whole chicken . If you are busy you can have it from the fridge to the oven in less than a minute , while butterflying or jointing it is n't super-quick Aesthetics : some people like the look of a whole chicken on the table
I suggest starting with this <URL> for more information on brining . Much of what would be transferred into your turkey is liquid from the osmosis , but some salt , and sugar if you choose to use it , would be added as well . If you purchase an " enhanced " turkey that has already been injected , you do n't want to brine it . The injection has a similar effect . If you 've made an enhanced turkey in the past , you 've already eaten a bird with added sodium . <URL> states that the turkey will gain 10 % of its weight in a combination of water and sodium . Your brine comes out to about 3.9 % salt , so your 12 lb turkey will gain ( ( 12 lbs * .1 ) * .039 ) = .0486 lbs = 21 grams of salt from a 3.9 % brine . Your average soda has 55 milligrams of salt per serving . The total amount of salt from your brine will be spread over the entire turkey , so divide that amount by the number of servings you expect that turkey to provide to get the number of additional milligrams of sodium per serving of turkey from brining . If at the end of the day you do n't want to brine , in that same article McGee also suggests a way to keep turkey moist without a brine . EDIT : I did my math wrong above , and have corrected the formula and results .
It sounds like your chicken was simply overcooked . If you used a built in pop-up timer , these almost always are set to a temperature which will overcook your poultry . Some authorities recommend cooking white meat to 170 F ( 77 C ) , but this will leave your chicken dry and overcooked . My personal preference is to cook white meat to about 158 F ( 70 C ) in the oven , and then let carry over cooking bring it up a couple more degrees while it rests . This should leave your white meat much more succulent . Similarly , dark meat should be cooked to a temperature ( to my preference ) of at least 165 F ( 74 C ) although it is much more tolerant of being overcooked . This can be tricky when roasting a whole chicken . Some things you can do help cook a chicken more evenly : Cut it into parts , and roast the parts ( obviously , this is ideal as each can be removed when done ) Use a high quality probe or instant read thermometer , in the thickest part of the breast or thigh , to get an accurate internal reading . To ensure accuracy , check a couple of spots , and apply the lowest temperature . If you do n't want to fully cut it up , <URL> <URL> the chicken ( although I personally prefer simply to not overcook in the first place )
Let 's start with the assumption that Safety is never in the balance . Safety has to be taken into account for any method that we use and that means that we want to keep any food that is time and temperature sensitive out of the danger zone . The danger zone is the temperature range from 40 degrees F to 140 degrees F . If you have plenty of time , letting the turkey defrost in the refrigerator is safest and easiest , since there is little that you have to do . The turkey is always out of the danger zone and all you have to do is put it in the refrigerator . However , it can take a very long time , 24 hours for each 5 pounds of turkey weight ... 4 days for a 20 pound turkey . Assuming you have n't planned that far ahead , the other safe method is to defrost in the sink with cold running water . The water does n't need to be pouring out , just a steady stream so the water turns over regularly . Water is a better conductor of heat than air , so the turkey will defrost more rapidly than in the refrigerator . The danger zone is why you do n't want to defrost the turkey using warm water , or just sitting on the counter . In either of those cases , the outside meat is warmed into the danger zone before the inside defrosts , so you have some of the meat ( the part that is most likely to have come into contact with contaminants ) in a temperature range that promotes bacterial growth .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .
I 'd seriously doubt it going bad in 5 days if your fridge is set to a proper temperature and it was prepared with some semblance of proper sanitation . A vat of the stuff taken out of the fridge for serving 4 times , yes . An individual serving stored in the fridge the whole time , I doubt . The pasta texture will get weird from freezing/thawing . Should not actually affect the flavor if it 's properly sealed . You may or may not find the texture change acceptable . Your wife may or may not agree with you . As usual , experimentation will be your best guide as to whether you find it acceptable or not , so freeze one and do n't freeze one and compare the two when you eat them .
If your quartering of the chicken was done quickly then you are just asking how long you can keep a chicken in the fridge . <URL> Your 40 hours is fine .
Per Harold McGee , in On Food and Cooking ( page 86 of the 2004 edition ) , there is no truth to this common assertion . Acids and salt do pretty much the same thing to egg proteins . They get the proteins together sooner , but they do n't let them get as close together . That is , acids and salt make eggs thicken and coagulate at a lower temperature , but actually produce a more tender texture . McGee explains that the salt separates into ions , which cluster around the charged regions of the egg proteins , allowing them to get closer before being denatured because they do n't repel each other . This causes them to bond together earlier , before they become unfurled and could form tighter ( and thus tougher networks ) . McGee concludes : So eggs end up more tender when salted , and especially when acidified . So salt them when you beat them , or in the pan , in practice it will make little difference compared to many other factors , such as the temperature and technique with which you cook them .
The oven in a standard 20 " kitchen stove will accommodate a bird even as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) . The very detailed chart <URL> , the pertinent details of which are replicated in the chart below , establish the standard dimensions of such an oven as 18 X 16 X 14.5 inches ( 46 x 41 x 37 cm ) . In their downloadable Thanksgiving pdf , for a turkey as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) Williams-Sonoma <URL> a 16 X 13 X 3 inch ( 40 x 33 x 7.5 cm ) roasting pan . A pan of this sort is available with a rack which rises just above the bottom of the pan , as <URL> and pictured below . This kind of pan keeps height requirements down to roughly the height of the bird plus 3 " ( 7.5 cm ) above the bird , plus the standard 2.5 " ( 6.5 cm ) below the bottom rack . With 14.5 " ( 37 cm ) worth of oven height to work with and about a half inch space between the bird and the pan , that still leaves room for a bird 8 " ( 20 cm ) tall . ( We wo n't expect the bird to be half as tall as the pan is long . ) Meanwhile , an 18 " ( 46 cm ) oven depth accommodates a 16 " ( 41 cm ) long pan , and a 16 " ( 41 cm ) oven width a 13 " ( 33 cm ) pan width . Also , as seen <URL> and below , the pan 's handles fold down . Now , none of this is to say that there 's anything the slightest bit convenient about roasting so large a bird in so small a space . But it can be done . It should just be done with every whit of safety in mind .
Pot Roasting = Braising This more recent document from the same association , Cattlemen 's Beef Board and National Cattlemen 's Beef , supports this by using them interchangeably : <URL> I was trying to figure out what the document from your question may have been implying by the cuts the different cooking techniques were recommended for . And I 'd guess , because Pot Roasting is applied to more connective heavy cuts , that braising would be a shorter cooking time . That 's my best guess .
There is no strict delineation between these two terms . Either can be savory or sweet . Some common differences are : Mousses may get their foaminess from from plain whipped egg whites , a meringue , whole eggs , whipped cream , or something else ; a souffle is always leavened by whipped egg whites . Mousses ( except for some seafood mousses , which are gently poached ) are rarely cooked as a whole dish ; souffles are always baked to get additional rise . Mousses are almost always served cold ; souffles are usually served hot , immediately out of the oven to retain the additional rise they get in the heat of the oven . One might consider souffles a type of baked mousse , much as quiches are a specific type of tart , but that terminology is rarely used . See also : <URL>
For very high hydration loaves , you want to create your gluten development without adding an excess of flour which would reduce the relative hydration . <URL> shows the classic stretch , slap and fold method , using a 70 % hydration dough . Basically , you lift the entire dough from the work surface , allow it to stretch under its own weight , then slam it down again . Rinse and repeat . A somewhat less labor instensive method is described at <URL> ( the article has a lot of introductory material , keep reading and there are really clear instructions with lots of photos ) : Initially stir the dough together until it is is a thick and cohesive liquid , which the author describes as " like porridge . " Use the stretch and fold method of kneading to create some development : Flour your work surface moderately Pour the dough out onto the surface Use your bench knife knife ( also called a dough scraper ) to lift and drop the dough back on itself , stretching it . Images from the Fresh Loaf Allow the dough to rest and autolyse , that is , develop gluten from the reaction of the water and precursor proteins in the presence of enzymes naturally in the flour . This limits the amount of hand kneading you have to do . Repeat the stretch and fold method a couple of times to get the final development Finally , note that very wet doughs can also be kneaded entirely in a stand mixer simply by beating them for a couple of minutes . These doughs are wet enough to be nearly pourable , and do not climb and clump onto the paddle ; if they do , the hydration is not high enough for this method , and you need to use the dough hook instead .
Yes , you can use ghee or oil for sauteing instead of lard . NOTE : You will not get the same " lardy " aroma from butter , ghee or oil , but if you use other stronger aromas / spices in your recipe it might not really matter .
They are both soft-ripened cheese , and there are certainly many similarities , but they are by no means the same . Camembert is aged at least 3 weeks ; Brie may be aged as little as 1 week . Brie is generally drained for 18 hours ; Camembert is drained for 48 hours . Brie may be salted before aging ; Camembert is not . Brie is more often pasteurized than Camembert ( although " genuine " Brie is unpasteurized ) . That said , there are many different varieties of Brie and many different varieties of Camembert , and it would n't be too surprising to find at least one Brie that tastes exactly like another Camembert . Still , they are quite different - different moulds , different draining , different aging .
Dry and even heat . There is still a difference , even with the same cut of meat and using a roasting rack to avoid roasting the cut in its juices : meat on a rotating skewer will be exposed to uniform heat . If you set the temperature of a home oven to 350 & deg ; F , the top of the roast will be exposed to that temperature , but the bottom , in line of sight to the heat source , will be much hotter . <URL> also cook the meat by convection and use the heating elements to create the outside crust . As the meat roasts , it becomes darker and absorbs more of the radiant heat from the roasting coils . So the outside ends up getting overcooked unless the roasting coils are carefully controlled , which is kind of hard to do . In a convection oven the temperature is constant around the roast .
Does it work ? Yes , it does . The idea is to create something akin to an individual " dutch oven " around the chicken or fish you are baking . The meat is " steamed " in his own juices . There are a bunch of different " recipes " for the salt crust , often with some " binding agent " like egg whites . Usually , the skin is removed when serving ( go ahead , give it a try , if you like ) , so rest assured that the meat underneath is not too salty . An alternative to salt ( and arguably more " paleo style " ) would be baking in clay . A quick internet search should yield plenty of recipes for both varieties . ( Remenber : asking for recipes is a big no-no here . )
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .

How to tell when water reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit without a candy thermometer for the purposes of disolving gelatin ?
Gelatin is quite tolerant , but with a few restrictions : Never boil gelatine , because it looses it 's binding/gelling properties . Liquifying gelatine requires temperatures that feel " warm " to the touch , but not all recipes handle warm additions well - e.g. whipped cream . Cooling liquid gelatine for heat sensitive recipes should happen fairly quick , and so should incorporating the coolish gelatine to the other ingredients : Stir well or you end up with " gummy bear " - like lumps . So without knowing the details of your recipe I suggest using fairly warm water in the range of " warm bath water " or " comfortable for washing hands " but not at all " hot " . ( Note that I do n't give a precise temperature range on purpose . ) Hot tap water should suffice , but heating it on the stove is fine , too . Just use gentle heat and do n't let the gelatine rest on the bottom of the pot to avoid overheating . Depending on your next steps , you might want to stir the liquid gelatine until it 's barely warm to the touch or add a few spoonfulls of whatever cool mixture you are planning to bind , stir , then add to the rest . For warm other ingredients , extra cooling is not required , just mix and let set .
It makes no difference whether you use sheet or powdered . Just make sure to use the right amount . It should be given on the package , like " this sachet is enough for 500 ml liquid " . You can try to use less than indicated for a softer texture , but if you do n't use enough , it will stay liquid , so you may need to experiment until you get it right . You ca n't bake gelatin . It is a protein and denaturates at 50 ° C . The proper way is to bake your pie or fruit cake as always , and after it is ready , pour the gelatin containing liquid over the fruits and wait for it to congeal . ( I am assuming here that you just want a gelatin glaze over a complete pie . If you want a complete gelatinized filling , everything below applies . Bake a shell , put the fruit in it , then fill it with the liquid ) . The liquid itself can be pure water , or water syrup , or , if you used canned fruit , you can catch the liquid from the can and strain it . Then use it , pure or diluted with water . Sugar of food coloring do n't interfere with gelatin , use them as you see fit ( I think it 's popular to color the gelatin on strawberry cakes a light red ) . The mixing is very similar to panna cotta . First , bloom your gelatin by putting it into a cup with some water ( 1-2 tbsp ) and leaving it for awhile . It should soak up the water , use it while it still looks moist , before the granules stick to each other . It usually takes around 5 minutes . Meanwhile , warm your liquid on a very low setting . It is best to use a thermometer . Dump the gelatine into the liquid while still on the heat . Stir until dissolved completely , never let it get too warm . When dissolved , remove from the heat and pour immediately . There are n't many things which interfere with gelatin , but some fruits ( or the enzymes in them ) do . These tend to be tropical fruits with at least moderate acidity , like papaya , mango , kiwi and pineapple . If you pour gelatine on them when they are raw , it will have trouble setting . Cooking them should help , but I do n't know how long or what temperature . If they are canned , it should be OK . Bananas are not a problem , even when raw . And because you said you want to make it " professional " : If you are talking about a thin glaze , gelatin is not your only choice . You can use starch as a thickener , many professional bakeries do so . It eliminates the possibility of getting the right texture of the glaze ( which will be rubbery with too much gelatine and half liquid if you do n't use enough ) , and maybe you 'll feel more comfortable with it .
No <URL> : " There are no outward characteristics that all poisonous mushrooms have in common , so picking and eating wild mushrooms requires the utmost caution . To be absolutely safe , the only mushrooms you should eat are those found at supermarkets and restaurants ! All the old wives ' tales about how to tell if a mushroom is poisonous -- such as whether it tarnishes silverware or turns blue when bruised -- are dead wrong . There 's a saying that there 's no such thing as an old , bold mushroom hunter . "
The only way to test for capsaicin besides tasting is chemical testing , namely liquid chromatography . Problem is , the same kind of chili can be quite different in heat , even on the same bush it can be quite different from my experience . No idea why , though . Here is one tip on how to check the heat of a chili without actually eating part of it , but still cutting it apart : Cut through the chili below the stem , touch the membranes , touch your tongues , feel the heat . <URL> You can adjust the amount of heat a chili adds to the dish by removing the white membranes . Just add the colored flesh , check for heat , and add membranes until the desired spiciness is obtained . Capsaicin is only produced in the white mebranes in the center . It may move inside the fruit , though . Areas closer to the membranes will be hotter ( like , the seeds ) , than other parts .
My kitchen manager ( fine dining restaurant ) said that that the only thing a microwave should be used for in a professional kitchen is to heat water . Microwaving tends to dry out the outside of vegetables , and hurts both texture and flavor . Proper blanching takes about 5 minutes once you have water at a boil , and maintains both the crisp , fresh flavor and full texture . Blanching also tends maintain color better , because the outside of the vegetables heats to the same extent as the inside , and this is doubly true if you use an ice bath to cool vegetables after blanching . So yes , you are Doing Things Wrong . That said , we all take shortcuts at times , and microwave ovens do work rather well for thawing frozen vegetables . With frozen vegetables you 've already lost a lot of the texture , so the microwaving does n't do much further harm .
I found the solution which suits me : I first boil the milk , water , and jaggery together in quantity mentioned in the question . After the mixture reaches boiling point , I switch off the gas stove and throw in 2 table spoons of tea . I close the lid of the vessel and let the it sit on the gas itself for 6 minutes . After 6 minutes , I strain the tea and the result is a non woody strong hot tea . I think it is important to let the covered vessel sit on the gas because otherwise the tea will cool off in 6 minutes .
Wetted starch is not the same thing as cooked starch . If you want to see the difference in a simple experiment , make two starch slurries , boil one into a pudding , and leave the other one cold . Starch only gelates at high temperatures ( I think it starts around 70 ° C , but needs even more to complete the process ) . When you have a grain of rice , you have the problem that the starch is very closely packed together , and water ca n't penetrate into the center of the grain too well - the outside layers soak all the water they come in contact with , and so water only seeps into the center of the rice after the outer part has been hydrated . It is similar for pasta . In the worst case , when you cook rice , the time needed for cooking will be enough to heat the whole grain to the gelating temperature , but not enough for the water to hydrate the innermost part of the corn . This is fine if you want hardish-cooked rice , but if you want soft , mushy rice , you should presoak it so the inside is already hydrated when you start cooking it . I suppose you can do the same with pasta . This is the reason why some sources will advice you to presoak . But , as I said , this is not the same as cooking . Yes , the rice or pasta will get soft , so you wo n't break your teeth if you try to eat it . But it will still be raw starch . I do n't know if it is unhealthy to eat raw starch ( my mother certainly told me so , but it could have been a myth ; I asked <URL> and got no conclusive answers ) . But it will probably taste unpleasant , similar to raw potatoes or raw flour . I would try to get other sources of food for this time period . Or , as @justkt 's comment suggests , it is easy to get an electric kettle in a brand new house before the kitchen is installed . You can use it to pour cooking water over " instant " versions of pasta and rice . These have been pregelated and then dehydrated , so do n't need a prologned cooking . They are usually available as instant hot soup or rice meals in sachets and cardboard boxes , I have n't seen them as pure ingredients .
I use an instant-read thermometer . It 's by far the simplest method . I use the <URL> . As Darin states , you 're shooting for 165 ℉ for turkey . My old Taylor died a few weeks ago . After reading rave reviews from Cooks Illustrated , and Alton Brown 's recommendation , I splurged and got a <URL> . It is amazing !
Pink has to do with blood , which typically runs clear once it reaches a certain temperature . This is not a great rule of thumb for making delicious food . It 's particularly problematic with thighs , because they contain a vein that can remain red or pink well through the cooking process . This is less so if the chicken is washed or the veins cleaned . The key is temperature , not color . If you have a meat thermometer , aim for 165-170 ° F ( 74-77 ° C ) , keeping in mind that meat will continue cooking for 5-10 ° F ( 3-6 ° C ) once it 's pulled and allowed to rest for 5 minutes . If you do n't have a thermometer , aim for meat that is responsively tender but not too firm , opaque rather than transparent , and not slimy or gelatinous in texture . Thighs are a little more tolerant than breasts when it comes to drying out because they have more fat , but nothing is sadder than overcooked meat ( except maybe salmonella poisoning ) .
There is no single universal answer to this question , as it depends on the specific food and outcome desired , but there are a couple of common themes that influence whether starting from cold water or boiling water is the preferred method : Larger foods that need to cook through may overcook on the outside before the inside is cooked , if started in boiling water . For example , potatoes are usually started in cold water so that they cook through to the center . Some foods contain enzymes that will be deactivated at boiling questions , but may act more quickly at lower temperatures . Starting in boiling water would be for when it is desirable that the reactions be inhibited ; starting in cold water facilitates the reactions continuing . Sometimes it is simply for precision to get a repeatable recipe . Boiling water is always the same temperature ( at least for a given altitude ) , so beginning cooking at the boil is reliable and repeatable compared to starting with cold water which may have an unknown temperature curve as it comes up to the boil .
I 'd stew the raspberries down with a little water ( and sugar if the raspberries are n't sweet ) until they 're very soft , then pass the whole thing through a sieve to remove the seeds . You can then either store the result in the fridge , or pour it into an ice cube tray for easy portioning and a nice cold smoothie .
Sauté / stir fry : When you 're just below the smoke point of an oil , it 'll shimmer ... but that 's only useful for a precise temperature if you know what the smoke point for that oil is , and you actually want to use oil for cooking . Grilling : I ca n't remember if it was an episode of Good Eats or on Alton Brown 's first book that he recommended that if you had an automatic ice maker , so had consistent sized ice cubes , that you time how long it takes them to melt at different temperatures , so you could use that to judge how hot a grill is . Grilling / Pans in general : For grilling , and campfire cooking , I 've always gone with the hand near the cooking surface to gauge how hot it is , but I do n't know that it 's all that accurate ... and people have a different tolerance for pain , so you 'd have to do some tests to calibrate . It does n't work as well for cooking on a stove except for cast iron ; I suspect it requires a more radiant heat source . Deep / shallow frying : I like the wooden spoon test -- dip something wooden into the hot oil , and as there 's moisture in the wood , you should see small bubbles rapidly form if it 's hot enough . Searing : Listen as you add food ... After you 've added a bit of oil , touch the food to the pan , and ou should hear sizzling . If it does n't , pull it back and wait a few more minutes for it to heat . * Breadmaking ** : If I need warm water for making bread , I 'll run the hot tap against the inside of my wrist ... once it feels slightly warm , but not hot , it 's just above body temperature , so should be good ( around 38-40 ° C / 100-105 ° F ) None of these are going to be completely precise , but there 's lots of ways to gauge temperature other than a thermometer .
After much experimentation , I have found that the keys to avoiding the off-white foam/scum are : Use eggs that are as fresh as possible , as this greatly reduces the amount of scum . Use white vinegar instead of malt vinegar , as this avoids discolouring the scum , which makes it more visible .
In Germany we have an old ( joking ) saying that roughly translates to " head off , tail off - bunny " , so your question is legitimate . But first thing 's first : There is no health risk involved if you ate the latest shipment of " meowling rabbit " . ( To cat lovers everywhere : This is no endorsement , I have a much loved and pampered cat , too ! ) The most obvious differences are head ( look at the teeth ! ) , tail ( short vs. long ) , and feet ( cat claws are quite distinctive ) . But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale , so we 'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy : Shoulder blades : Cats ' shoulder blades are rounded on top , especially in the front , making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts , rabbits ' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side . Femur ( thigh bone ) : A cat 's femora are straight , whereas a rabbit 's is more or less bent , especially pronounced in older animals . Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna ( forearm ) , but they might have been removed . Ribs : Cats ' ribs are " rounder " than rabbits ' ribs according to <URL> . I ca n't say by how much , but <URL> 's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie <URL> . Pelvis : The same source as above states that the <URL> ( = the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint ) is oval in rabbits and round in cats . I could n't find a good picture to show this , though . Here 's a rabbit : Source : <URL> And a cat :
Heavier limes tend to be more juicy , but another important factor is the color and texture of the skin . Look for the brightest green ( sometimes with almost a yellow tinge ) and smoothest skin you can find . Many bumps or shriveled looking areas are good indications that there will be less juice . If that 's all that 's available in your store , though , just get more of them . If they have broken skin , I always avoid those . I 've gotten them home and found that even if there 's juice , at least the section near that break has gone dry and sometimes discolored , definitely a waste of my money and time . Another thing I 've found helpful , which can be done easily in the grocery store , is a smell-test . ( This also works with lemons , which to me are just as confusing . ) When very juicy , the skin has a scent , which may be subtle , but definitely different than those with none . It 's one sign of freshness , similar to knowing when to pick them from the tree . As Josh Caswell said in his excellent answer about pith , there 's nothing wrong with rolling them around in your hand in the store ; not enough to damage the lime of course , but enough to warm them up just a bit so they 'll release some juice and a nice smell . I do n't know where you 're from , but in Massachusetts , in the Northeastern United States , the produce department is often quite cold , so I do that with all my citrus choices . <URL> has some good pictures and information , and even mentions using them for cocktails ! <URL> gives the same basic information , with a video that I found helpful . To answer the question that was asked about the importance of skin thickness , it 's something I do n't generally think about when I shop , so I did some research . Most sites did n't mention it , especially with the common lime which is the most popular variety , but there is <URL> that does recommend choosing a thinner skinned fruit . They should feel firm and heavy for their size , because heavy limes will produce the most juice . Select limes with thin skins , avoiding the thicker skinned fruit , which is an indication of less flesh and juice . I know you did n't specifically ask , but just to add that if you have limes at home and you 're not getting the maximum effortless , free-flowing juice , you can microwave them for about 20 seconds . It helps release the juice , and works for other citrus fruits too . I 'd watch carefully , because I 've overheated my fruit doing that . It 's fine if I 'm going to use it for cooking or in my hot tea , but for cold drinks and things you then have to wait for it to cool off , which may be more effort than you need .
There are a couple of places where the ability to get to 120 ˚C might be useful . You 've already touched on one , which is cooking sugar . With a range up to 120 ˚C you get up to the firm ball stage , allowing you to make syrups , fudge , caramel , fondant , butter creams , marshmallows , meringues , and toffees . You can get some caramelization ( mostly of fructose ) at that temperature . I do n't know how practical it would be with the machine in question , but you can get Maillard reactions at <URL> if you use prolonged cooking time and/or optimize the environment by adding alkaline . This machine does not seem to have a pressurization feature , but that would be another place where the higher temperature would be useful . At a pressure of 1 bar / ~ 15 psi above the existing atmospheric pressure , water in a pressure cooker can reach a temperature of up to 121 ° C ( 250 ° F ) , depending on altitude . Pressure cooking can be used to quickly simulate the effects of long braising or simmering .
Usually you can tell when Pineapples are ripen , which will be sweet , when Leaves are loose and can easily be picked from the top The shell has golden colour ( but not dark brown , these are getting rotten ) The aroma even from out of the shell is strong A typical pineapple that is bought green and unripen , takes one to two days to ripe well . Do n't put them in the fridge if you want to ripe them . Keep them out on the counter . As a street food vendor , we always keep them in the truck for one night prior to selling , that ensure the pineapples ripe enough and the juice comes out of it . Hope it helps .
I found this on <URL> and I think it explains it quite well . RAY < > A " 50/50 " usually references an edge . So on the cutting edge , it is an even 50/50 " V " . It can be 50/50 at 12 degrees or 50/50 @ 20 , but each sides angle is equivocal . A double bevel is a knife design created by grinding . So from the spine to the cutting edge , there is a blade face that has been ground ( most of the time ) . It can be a flat grind , a convex grind , a hollow grind , and any of these grinds can be symmetric ( 50/50 ) or asymmetric . So for instance , my Ginsanko Hiromoto Western Deba has an asymmetrical semi convex grind . It has a flat ground left blade face at around 30 % of the total included angle and the right side blade face has a distinctly convex grind that is the other 70 % of the total included angle , but the actual cutting edge has an asymmetry , as well . The actual cutting edge does not look like a " V " as it is , in fact , a 60/40 right-handed bias . It 's a particularly unique blade , but exemplifies your point , quite well . : mrgreen : In short , the numbers like 50/50 or 70/30 represent the percentage of the included angle on each side of the blade . So , for a 50/50 knife with an included angle of 50 ° , it would be ground to a 25 ° edge angle on each side of the blade . See diagram below :
In terms of commercial food processing , there are more efficient ways to extract gelatin than slow-simmering the bones , generally by treating the organic matter with a strong acid prior to boiling , then using commercial evaporation and filtering equipment which is far more efficient than anything a home or even restaurant cook has access to . According to <URL> ( see the " Gelatin Manufacture " section ) it can also be first treated with a strong base solution before acidifying it , which lowers the isoionic point . It 's kind of difficult to explain exactly what that is if you do n't have a background in organic chemistry ; technically speaking it 's a relationship between pH and electrical charge - but applied to extraction it refers to the pH at which the solubility of a protein ( such as gelatin ) is the lowest . Lowering this is a good thing in extraction , because it means that the gelatin will be easier to filter out in an acidic solution . Thus I have to point out the question is actually a bit contradictory ; if your goal is the extraction of gelatin then you want to decrease the solubility . But I think this is all going to be beside the point anyway , because none of this applies to stock making ; the goal in food processing is to extract the pure gelatin , not to get a flavourful stock . When making a stock you definitely do n't want to use an acid solution , it 's going to ruin the flavour . Realistically , when it comes to stock-making , especially at home , the only way you 're going to be able to extract more gelatin is to simmer it longer . That 's it . When the bones break without any resistance , that means you 've denatured all the collagen and you 've got all the gelatin you 're going to get . I would n't worry about solubility because typically in stock-making you 're already using more than enough water to dissolve all the gelatin that you could possibly hope to extract .
I assume you mean sherbet , which is made by mixing 1 cup of powdered sugar ( also called icing or confectioner 's sugar ) with 1 tsp of baking soda ( also called bicarbonate of soda ) and 1 tsp of powdered citric acid . Altering the proportion of soda ( alkali ) to citric acid makes it more or less fizzy .

What is the difference between a poolish and a biga ?
I had to consult my copy of Bread Baker 's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart to be sure , but here is a quote : There are two types of firm , or dry , pre-ferments and two types of wet pre-ferments . The firm pre-ferments are known as pâte fermentée and biga . The wet pre-ferments are called poolish and levain levure . ... Biga , an italian style of firm pre-ferment , differs from pâte fermentée in that it does n't have any salt in it . Also , rather than cutting off a piece of finished bread dough to hold back as an improver , a biga is made specifically to be used as a pre-ferment . So , it seems the main difference lies in the hydration of the dough , where a poolish is made with a ratio of equal water and flour . There also seems to be a few other differences . A biga apparently uses .5 percent yeast to flour , while a poolish uses .25 percent . Mr Reinhart does not say anything about a concrete difference in final result between these methods - just that a ' wet ' pre-ferment is faster . Faster in the sense that in the same time-frame a poolish will develop more flavor and character than a dry pre-ferment . Sadly I 've personally only used a wet pre-ferment , since it is easier to handle . Just whisk it prior to bed time with a wire whisk and mix in the rest of the ingredients the next day . Having a full blown dough makes it more difficult to incorporate the rest of the ingredients .
There are several factors that increase price . Some are related to the objective quality of the wine , some indirectly linked , other are rather disconnected from quality ( but not necessarily irrelevant , as we 'll see ) . It 's also worth noting that being of high quality does n't necessarily mean being appealing to the average consumer . Apart from the stuff listed below , mass-market wines tend to be made in a non-challenging , easily accessible style . Lower tannin levels , less acidity and a generous amount of residual sugar ( say 10-30g / l ) makes for easy quaffing but little complexity or elegance . They can be very well-made , but the agriculture may not be very sustainable , and the fruit probably is n't of the highest quality . ( If you visit a winery at harvest when they bring in the bulk wine fruit , the meaning of " quality " becomes rather apparent . ) Wines targeted at connoisseurs , wine snobs and wine geeks ( such as yours truly ) tend have more structure ( tannins , acidity ) and are more often completely dry ( although there are of course high-quality off-dry , semi-sweet , and sweet wines ) . There 's a limit to how much a producer can spend to increase quality , a limit which varies with location ( because of salaries for workers etc ) but around $ 100 per bottle is probably in the right order of magnitude . This does not mean that all wines above this magical limit are equally good , though . A dirt-cheap wine will also have a cost associated to it which will be payed for by someone else , like under-payed harvest workers , the environment around the vineyard , etc. . Below are some factors that have a more or less direct link to wine quality and/or character : Yield per acre : Limiting the vineyard 's yield per acre ( which can be achieved by sparser planting , thinning / <URL> , old vines , etc ) increases the quality of the fruit , but you will produce less wine with more or less the same amount of work , which means you 'll have to adjust the price . Number of harvesting tries : At harvest , you can pick all the fruit of one vineyard at the same time and be done with it . Unfortunately , not all bunches ripen at exactly the same time , so to avoid over - or under-ripe grapes , you can make multiple tries ( French , pronounced " trees " ) over several days and pick each bunch at optimal ripeness . More tries inevitably means more work , and so , price increases . Selection : When the harvest is brought in , you can throw all the fruit into the press , or you can select the best grapes to make your wine ( and make brandy or a <URL> of the discarded grapes , or sell them on to a bulk wine producer ) . Being picky reduces the amount of wine produced , and so , prices increase . Drying : Some wines , like <URL> and <URL> , are made from partially dried grapes , and drying decreases the amount of wine you produce ( apart from being extra work ) which means - more expensive wine . Sparkling : Sparkling wines made with the <URL> - like <URL> and <URL> - need to be disgorged after bottle fermentation , which leads to a certain amount of waste ( a Cava producer I talked to said that around 10 % of the original wine is lost in disgorgement ) . Oak aging : Many wines are <URL> , which greatly affects the character of the wine compared to other types of containers , like concrete or stainless steel vats . ( More oak does n't mean better wine , of course . ) Oak barrels are horribly more expensive than the alternatives ( and European oak is more expensive than American , and they impart different character ) , and so , the more oak you use , the more expensive the wine gets . Aging in general : Most high-quality wine receive a bit of aging before consumption to let all components integrate ; some designations of origin even require aging prior to selling . <URL> Gran Reserva , for example , must be aged at least three years , with at least one of those years being on oak , while vintage <URL> is mandated to rest three years on the <URL> , etc. . Apart from time being money , you also need a suitable storage location ( cool and humid but not too cool and humid , secure but accessible to yourself , etc ) which is far from free . The price increases . Other factors are n't causally linked to higher quality , but tend to be connected : Reputation : If you 're an unproven winemaker you will be able to charge more if you 're operating in a district of high repute than if you 're working in an area where no-one has made quality wine before . Conversely , a well-known , high-quality producer expanding their operations to a somewhat less proven district will likely be able to charge more than their new neighbours . Brand : Marketing can take many forms , such as it advertising , tailoring wines to suit <URL> , and tends to push prices up . Wineries can even try <URL> . You can also be lucky and find some great , undiscovered producer ( do n't tell anyone ! except me , that is ) selling their wines at more-or-less cost price ( which probably still wo n't be dirt cheap , though ) . Land prices : Some spots are better for growing grapes . If you 're in
There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour . The number of different types you store will really depend on your particular requirements . All purpose ( or plain ) flour is a blend of different types of wheat and has a relatively low protein content . Bread flour is typically made from a single , high protein wheat . It also has a higher gluten strength . It may also contain ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) Cake flour is also typically made from a single type of wheat ( different from the wheat used in bread flour ) and has a high starch content , it also has the lowest protein content . There are many other types of flour , all of which server specific purposes , for example ; Self raising flour , Whole wheat flour , Chick pea flour , Rice flour , Semolina flour And others . Essentially it 's important to use the right type of flour for a give recipe .
There is no strict delineation between these two terms . Either can be savory or sweet . Some common differences are : Mousses may get their foaminess from from plain whipped egg whites , a meringue , whole eggs , whipped cream , or something else ; a souffle is always leavened by whipped egg whites . Mousses ( except for some seafood mousses , which are gently poached ) are rarely cooked as a whole dish ; souffles are always baked to get additional rise . Mousses are almost always served cold ; souffles are usually served hot , immediately out of the oven to retain the additional rise they get in the heat of the oven . One might consider souffles a type of baked mousse , much as quiches are a specific type of tart , but that terminology is rarely used . See also : <URL>
They are both soft-ripened cheese , and there are certainly many similarities , but they are by no means the same . Camembert is aged at least 3 weeks ; Brie may be aged as little as 1 week . Brie is generally drained for 18 hours ; Camembert is drained for 48 hours . Brie may be salted before aging ; Camembert is not . Brie is more often pasteurized than Camembert ( although " genuine " Brie is unpasteurized ) . That said , there are many different varieties of Brie and many different varieties of Camembert , and it would n't be too surprising to find at least one Brie that tastes exactly like another Camembert . Still , they are quite different - different moulds , different draining , different aging .
<URL> has a nice description of Devil 's Food Cake . Originally , Devil 's Food Cake had a medium dense texture . The colour had a reddish tint that was probably caused by baking soda reacting with cocoa powder . In fact , I have an old cookbook ( The Day by Day Cook Book , 1939 ) that contains a recipe for Red Devil 's Food Cake . This recipe calls for 2 oz . unsweetened chocolate and 1 tsp . of baking soda .
Short answer : yes , milk chocolate differs from chocolate by the milk its manufacture . Real chocolate ( as opposed to many other confections ) is made from chocolate liquer , which despite the name , is not alchoholic , or even liquid at room temperature . The fruit of the <URL> tree contains seeds , known as beans . The harvested fruits are allowed to ferment , bringing many flavor and chemical changes to the beans , as well as removing the pulpy fruit . The beans are then husked for the seeds inside , the nibs . The nibs are the first true chocolate product , although they are not sweet . The nibs are roasted , and then ground . This is chocolate liquer , a solid colloid of cocoa fat and solid particles . It would be solid at room temperature , but the grinding process melts it . The cocoa liquer can be pressed to separate out the cocoa butter ( as for use in the cosmetics industry ) , leaving cocoa powder , but that is not the point of your question . Instead , to manufacture chocolate , the liquer is <URL> , a mechanical process that makes the suspended particles much smaller , part of what gives chocolate its smooth mouthfeel . Various products can be made from chocolate liquer , or cocoa butter , including : baking chocolate - essentially , just chocolate liquer , hardened and tempereded . May or may not be fully conched , so may not be as smooth as chocolate intended for eating . chocolate or dark chocolate - Chocolate liquer , possibly extra cocoa butter , and sugar . Minor optional ingredients often included are vanilla or other flavorings , and lecithen , an emulsifier . milk chocolate - Same as dark chocolate , with the addition of condensed milk or milk solids , depending on whether it is made via the Swiss method or the Hershey method white chocolate - cocoa butter , plus sugar and other flavorings chocolate chips - Another form of chocolate in a particular shape . Many manufacturers do n't make these from true chocolate , but rather substitute another fat which does n't melt as easily as cocoa butter , for economy , and so the chips hold their shape in the oven chocolate bunny - Chocolate molded into the shape of a bunny , then tempered and cooled German 's chocolate - A brand name of quite sweet dark chocolate Chocolate labels which list " cocoa percentage " are saying what proportion of the chocolate is cocoa liquer or additional cocoa butter or cocoa solids -- that is , stuff from nibs , as opposed to sugar or other flavorings . The cocoa percentage for milk chocolate tends to be much lower than that of dark chocolates , although not every milk chocolate has a lower percentage than every dark chocolate . See <URL> for information on tempering chocolate , which gives its snappy mouthfeel . Edit : On dairy products in dark chocolate : I was very surprised at Lemontwist 's comment , so I did some googling and found this <URL> : A good quality dark or semi-sweet chocolate will only have sweetener / sugar in some form added , and may also include a touch of soy lecithin as an emulsifier . These brands are milk-free by ingredients , but keep in mind that most brands of chocolate are made on shared equipment . That is , an inherently milk-free dark chocolate may be made on the same equipment as milk chocolate . See below for my note on cross-contamination issues . The complications arrive as some brands of dark and semi-sweet chocolate do include milk ingredients for a " smoother " end result . This is particularly true in mainstream brands like Hershey 's . Some ways that you may see milk listed in the ingredients include milk solids , milk , milk powder , whey , butter oil or butterfat ( see the Ask Alisa post on butter oil ) , or even casein . If milk is in the ingredients , it should be listed in a clearly identifiable manner per the labeling laws , but still , use caution . This is still in line with the information I provided , as I did mention " other flavorings " in dark chocolate , and it is not a universal or even common practice as far as I know . For people with strong allergies , the cross-contamination issue may be more of an issue . Vegans would have more of an issue , as lecithen is a very common ingredient in chocolate of all types , and may be animal sourced . Vegans would specifically need to reseearch and obtain chocolates that meet that standard . Googling will find many such products , but I did not find an easy single reference list .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .
The differences are as follows : Quinoa is a pseudocerial coming from goosefoot <URL> . It is one of the trendy " superfoods " because it has a very high nutritional value ánd is gluten free . I have always used it as a grain substitute and do not know if it 's any good as the main ingredient for a burger . Quorn is a meat substitute made of mycoprotein from fungus . <URL> . In my personal experience quorn is a very acceptable substitute for ground beef , so a burger made of this material is likely to taste pretty decent . Soy is a plant material traditionally used for instance in tofu . It has long been used as a meat substitute due to the high protein content . In my humble opinion it has been surpassed by other meat alternatives , mainly because soy based meat alternatives lack in texture . All very different products then , where most likely the only common factor is the spicing .
Mincing produces smaller , more irregularly-shaped items than dicing . Dicing is generally uniform , usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch on all sides , kind of like a tiny cube . The best way to explain the size difference is visually , check out <URL> for a great picture near the top .
There 's a difference between the title ( is a sausiccon a type of salami ) , and the body ( is there a difference ) . The first is a question of classification , and no , a saucisson is type of cured sausage , but you 'd want " saucisson sec " ( dry sausage ) for a dried , cured sausage with good storage characteristics like salami . So the relation is the other way around -- a salami is a type of saucisson . " Differences " when you 're dealing with general classifications such as this tend to be a question of if there are items that might fit into one category , but not the other . It 's pretty obvious that salami is a narrower term than sausiccon , but I 'm not sure if salami and sausiccon sec are just different names for the same concept , or if there might be items in one class that would n't fall into the other . update : would <URL> be considered a saucisson sec ? It 's only semi-dried , so I would n't classify it as a salami due to storage characteristics .
I just happened across this older question and found the answers provided , including the information in the link to wikipedia to be incorrect . All Prime Ribs are Standing Rib Roasts , not all Standing Rib Roasts are Prime Rib . A " Prime Rib " is a standing rib roast , from a beef that has achieved a USDA Grade of " Prime " . Bone-In or Bone-out are separate distinctions the can be applied to any standing rib roast , regardless of grade . U.S. Prime -- This is the highest grade of beef with the most fat marbling . This meat is very tender and only accounts for about 2.9 % of all graded beef . U.S. Prime is usually reserved for high end dining establishments . Because this beef has such a high level of fat marbling , it is excellent for dry heat cooking methods . <URL> Also , technically a Prime Rib is not a ' steak ' but rather a ' slice of roast ' . If one takes a slice from a raw rib primal and grills or broils it as a steak it is a " Rib Eye " , and can also be either " bone-in " or " bone-out " . ( the use of the word ' primal ' refers to a primary cut of beef , the first cuts a butcher will use to section a beef beyond quartering , it is utterly unrelated to the word " prime " in " Prime Rib " )
The problem is , both Sarge 's and Carmi 's answers are right depending on who is using the word . Some people use the word seasoning to just mean salt , some mean salt and pepper , and some mean " anything you want to use to bring the flavor to the desired point , including salt , pepper , lemon juice , spices , herbs , etc. " If you are dealing with someone in person , it is best to ask . With a cookbook , sometimes you can figure it out from context or from other recipes . Otherwise , you 'll have to make your own best call . In my own recipes , I will generally write " taste and adjust seasoning , adding salt and/or more lemon juice as needed " .
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
It mostly depends on the heat used . If you are cooking at a high enough heat that vegetables and thinly-sliced meats ( if using ) are cooked through in only a few minutes then it matches with the term generally used as " <URL> " . In this heat , if you stop stirring even for a moment , pretty much , the food at the hottest part of the pan ( at the base , near the flame ) will start to burn . It needs to be in motion constantly . That 's the stir part of the stir-fry -- constant motion up the curved sides where it is cooler and letting other parts of the food go to the bottom to the heat and around and around . A full dish of meat , veg , noodles , etc can be completely cooked start to finish in just about 5 minutes . <URL> demonstrates stir-frying baby bok choy in 2 1/2 minutes of cooking time for the veg , <URL> for 2 minutes , and <URL> at 3-5 minutes . <URL> should also be at a fairly high heat and generally with less oil ( although stir-frying does n't use a lot of oil either , usually ) . The heat is lower than what is implied by stir-fry . With sautéing you are still generally keeping things moving , but it does n't need to be quite as frantic . You can let things stop a moment , and it can help to let them start to brown and caramelize . To demonstrate , <URL> for sautéed baby bok choy cooks them for 7 minutes , <URL> for 9-11 minutes , <URL> cooking it for 4 minutes . The fastest of these is twice as slow as most of the the stir-fry or about the same as the slowest stir-fry . The slowest of these sauté recipes is nearly 3-5 times as slow as the stir-fry with fairly similar ingredients , especially similar to the slowest of the stir-fry recipes . But to be fair , <URL> I was , strictly speaking , abusing the term sautéing by conflating it with even more moderate temperatures ( which are more properly simply called " pan frying " ) . A kadai is a good implement to use for stir-frying , but a kadai can also be used for cooking at a slightly lower temperature . Simply using a kadai does not 100 % determine the end result will be either a stir-fry or a sauté or a gentle fry , or even deep-frying . It 's a versatile vessel . :-)
Pasta as you know is a simple egg and flour mixture . You can add flavouring to it to give it a different spin or even a colour but at it 's root it 's just an egg dough . The different type of shapes are " meant " for different types of sauces in a traditional sense . I do n't want to imply that you MUST use one type of pasta with one type of sauce . What I 'm saying is that a particular style of noodle shape just lends itself better to certain suace types . I.E. penne , rigatoni , macaroni work really well with a sauce that needs a place to sit and hide so that each mouth full gives you the right amount of sauce to noodle ratio . Mac &amp; Cheese is a great example of this . In a soup or salad the type of pasta you choose is probably going to reflect the need of the guest and how you plan to serve the dish . With a soup you want to have a spoon that will carry the right proportions of broth , vegetables , pasta in each bite . Because of that you select a small pasta shape like orzo . However , as cooking is all about using what you have on hand , if you do n't have orzo but you have fetticini then use that but break it up first so it will work the same way . Hope that helps .
Traditional goulash is a stew/soup , usually using a cheaper cut of meat suited to slow cooking . It usually contains potatoes and other vegetables , as well as noodles . A true stroganoff consists of paprika-dusted fillet steak quickly pan fried with mushrooms and onions in a sour cream and brandy sauce . It is usually served with rice . I understand that in the US stroganoff can also refer to a stew made with similar ingredients as the traditional dish , and is served with noodles . This , coupled with the shared use of paprika , is evidently where the line blurs .
Butter gives more flavor , but oil provides longevity . Butter is about 20 % water . That water will evaporate during baking and continue to do so even after they are out of the oven causing your cakes to stale quicker . Also the the fat in butter remains solid at room temperature . Once your cake has cooled the fat , now dispersed in your cake solidifies once again and makes for a bit firmer of a crumb . Vegetable oil , however , is pure fat containing no water and remains liquid at room temperature . The moisture provided by oil will not evaporate during cooking and even after the product is cooled to room temp , the liquid fat remain and provide a moist crumb . Since there is no water to evaporate this product will last much longer on the shelf than one made with butter .
Yes , there is a difference in taste . I think it 's the chlorophyll , but I may be wrong . But the green asparagus has a " vegetable " or " grassy " taste which is n't present in the white asparagus . The white one has its own distinct aroma , which is less pronounced in the green one . As for texture , Caleb already said it . White asparagus is more tender , if you buy it fresh enough . On the other hand , non-tender green asparagus is snappy and somewhat brittle , like a normal stalk . Non-tender white asparagus is tough and stringy . When I cook white asparagus , I remove the lowest part ( the most stringy one ) and peel it ( the outer layer is especially string prone ) and sometimes , if it turns out to be low quality/old , it still has an unpleasant texture . The green one seldom requires removal of the lower part , and never peeling . Violet asparagus is like white one in both taste and texture , but not as common . Oh , and what Caleb says about both being the same plant is correct , but I have never heard of little shades . All farmers in Germany grow white asparagus underground . They make mounds of earth above the place where the asparagus is planted , and it has to grow a lot before it reaches the surface . They also cover the mounds with black foil to get the earth warm in spring . The harvest starts sometime in April and ends by tradition on June 24 . It is done by hand , because machines would break the rods . This makes it a quite costly vegetable . And it should be eaten fresh , because the longer it spends outside of the earth , the stringier it gets . I do n't share the common German enthusiasm for white asparagus ( " royal vegetable " etc. ) but think that it is a good vegetable in its own right . If you can get it fresh , it is worth eating now and then .
What 's the difference between gravy , jus , sauce and coulis ? Will says ... • ' Gravy is made from the juices of oven roast meat , thickend with a starch such as corn flour . • Jus is made from the same juices that has been refined and condensed to get a clear liquid naturally thickened . • Sauce could be made from the same juices with other ingredients added such as wines or spirits to compliment the food . Sauces can be served hot or cold . • Coulis is a thin fruit or vegetable purée , used as a sauce . If the purée is too thick , you can add some water and sometimes sugar ' . Source : <URL> My personal feeling for sauces is they can be made from anything . Parsnips , Mushrooms , Celeriac etc when ' Gravy ' and ' Jus ' must have Meat juices as their base . On menu 's you 'll often see ' Gravy ' on pub menu 's where they are n't trying to sound to posh , probably using some sort of packet mix . Jus ' on French style menu 's OR people trying too hard . Finally you 'll see something like " Beef and Juniper Sauce " on my menu and many others because ... Gravy sounds too common and Jus sounds too poncy .

How does soaking liver in milk work ?
My knowledge about the phenomenon itself is limited but I did see it mentioned in " Modernist Cuisine " ( Nathan Myhrvold , p. 147 ) Many recipes for foie gras , liver , sweetbreads , and other offal include a soaking step before cooking . For kidneys , this step serves a very simple purpose : to remove any trace of the animal 's bodily fluids . Recipes often call for soaking foie gras , liver , and sweetbreads in milk . It is often said that milk improves the taste , purges blood , lightens the color , or affects some other property of the meat . We were skeptical , so we tried several experiments . With a mild-flavored organ meat like foie gras , we could taste a difference , but , frankly , in our tests , we prefer the taste of water-soaked to milk-soaked foie gras . With stronger-flavored organ meats , there is even less of a difference than with foie gras . So our suggestion is to simply soak the meat in water . So , there you have it .
Here I 'm assuming that you mean macaroons as in the French patisserie <URL> rather than the simpler coconut or almond based <URL> . In any case almond meal and almond flour are essentially the same thing , both are almonds ground into a fine ( or not so much in your case ) ' flour ' or ' powder ' . <URL> , almond flour is made from ' blanched ' ( almonds which have had their skin removed ) almonds whereas almond meal can be made from either almonds with their skins on ( whole ) or ' blanched ' . I have , however , always found them to be used interchangeably . If your problem is graininess , then you could either sieve the ground almonds before using or blitz/grind them finer in a food processor until the desired consistency is reached , however if you 're grinding them in a food processor make sure you do it in small batches or if you 're making macarons blitz them with the icing sugar ( for the tant pour tant ) to avoid making <URL> . Personally , I would do both to achieve a fine powder .
Making <URL> means letting <URL> alter the texture and chemical composition of milk by digesting lactose and producing lactic acid , which in turn interacts with the proteins in the milk , causing the milk to thicken and taste sour . Unlike in cheese making you are not separating curds and whey , so you are not " losing " significant amounts of substance . Yes , there might be some fluctuation - an increasing number of lactobacillae and them eating lactose - but on a very small level . For our general kitchen precision , 500 g milk makes 500 g yogurt . Side note : 500 ml milk is not exactly 500 g , in fact , it 's 510 g according to my sources , but I consider these values precise enough for general cooking purposes . Otherwise , you ca n't even stir , as minute amounts will remain on spooons or in your pots and pans . This is a kitchen , not a lab .
As for working , they will certainly work . A cook can learn to use pots with irregular heating patterns . The bigger problem is , can you work with large pots ? If no , then your plan wo n't work , independently of the pot thickness you choose . A pot of this size just does n't behave like a small pot . It will have a heat gradient vertically , and , unless you have a giant paella burner , also horizontally . And this will happen even with the best bottom . Also , if you are making roux by one of the " depends on speed " methods , the sheer amount of roux and liquid mean you wo n't be able to mix before lumps form , and you may suddenly find yourself in need of more hands when you realize you ca n't lift your prepared liquid one-handed . If you are confident that you can deal with that , then the pots will do all right . If you are not , you will need to learn large-pot cooking , and the bottom wo n't be a major constraint . So just pick a pot and use it .
You have a few options to lower their explosiveness : Pierce the skin , like you do <URL> . Lower your frying temperature can help a bit , but you 'll probably always need to use a temperature higher than the boiling point to get any kind of crisping action . Dehydrate the liver a bit before frying . You could use a dehydrator , a low-and-slow oven bake or a low temperature , low oil sauté to get them to release their juices ( like you do for browning some mushrooms ) . I do n't know which of these will work best for liver , but naturally you 'll lose a little bit of the final juiciness . You mention the splash guard , which I ca n't recommend enough . These numbers are cheap and easy to find . <URL> But you can also protect your hands directly . I recommend something articulated , like this pair of silicon mold Storm Trooper styled oven mitts from Think Geek : <URL> <URL>
In my experience , the lowest setting of my induction cooker - 120 watts - is too high and results in scorched chocolate and will also burn dairy products like a cheese sauce . I would n't use it for a fondue - I would use a candle . It 's possible this restaurant had specialty induction cookers that could reach lower temperatures . My single-burner el cheapo induction cooker is standard off-the-shelf . Edited to add : I use my induction cooker , never my gas stove , for deep frying . With my induction cooker ( which goes up to 2000 watts ) , 600 watts is the perfect setting for deep frying and no fiddling is required - it always works perfectly . So for hot oil fondues , where you 're essentially deep frying meat , I absolutely would use an induction cooker . It would be my cooking tool of choice .
Yes , it is probably true to a small degree , but irrelevant . In any deep fried food , the rapid expansion of water as it vaporizes pushes the oil away from the surface of the food , preventing it from immediately penetrating during the entire frying period . While alcohol may not have the same 1700 ( IIRC ) ratio of expansion in volume that water does when it goes from a liquid to a vapor , it will still offer some of the same effect . The thing is , most oil that penetrates deep fried foods does so after the food is removed from the oil bath , as it cools . Alcohol in the dough would not prevent this .
The cream whipper relies on gas expansion to work . When you make whipped cream by beating , you beat fine air bubbles into the cream . The cream traps air and becomes essentially a matrix that holds those bubbles -- a foam . Your gas-charged whipper does the same thing in a totally different way . When you charge the whipper with gas , there 's high gas pressure inside with the cream . The cream will actually absorb the nitrous oxide you put in . Because of the pressure , the gas absorbed can be thought of as really really really small bubbles within the cream . So you have a matrix of gas and cream , but because the bubbles are so small , it 's essentially just cream . Chilled liquids more easily absorb gases at high pressure , which is why it 's good to use cold cream and keep the whole unit in the fridge . A limited amount of agitation ( shaking ) exposes more cream to the gas , improving absorption . When you release the cream from the device , the absorbed gas expands rapidly . The bubbles get bigger , and your cream to bubble ratio becomes more like the foam that we know as whipped cream . It 's really exactly the same thing , only with nitrous oxide instead of plain ol' boring air inside the bubbles . Why nitrous oxide ? As I understand it , it 's because it 's the cheapest non-toxic , odorless and tasteless gas you can get . Carbon dioxide would almost be a good choice , but unfortunately it 's bitter . Not a good match for cream . Finally , why is shaking too much a bad thing ? That one I do n't know for sure , but I know what happens when you over-whip cream with the mixer . You make butter . Perhaps the gas or high pressure encourages this conversion , or maybe you 're just churning it that much when you over-shake . Either way , I 'm sure you 've essentially made butter when you shook it too much .

I do n't think anything will be wrong with that milk . If it 's fresh milk , which I doubt , you should consume it in less than three days . If it 's pasteurized milk , which is much more likely , it 'll be unaffected . Signs of spoilage are a sour smell and sour taste . You should make a habit of always smelling your milk ( food ) before drinking ( eating ) it . If it does n't smell like you 'd expect , taste it . If it does n't taste like you 'd expect , ditch it . Milk is cultivated with lactobacillus , a bacteria that 's beneficial for us . So , even though milk may taste sour , it does n't mean that it 's undrinkable . In Holland , there 's sour-milk ( karnemelk ) , that some people consume ( I do n't like it , myself ) . Under the right circumstances , milk will turn into yogurt , thanks to the lactobacillus ... At any rate , if in doubt , throw it out .
I find a pair of basic Crocs to be very efficient as kitchen clogs . ( As does Mr. Batali , though the orange color may be in questionable taste ) . They are well cushioned , reasonably priced , and easily cleaned . They wo n't provide a ton of protection against dropping something heavy , sharp or hot , though they do sell some upscale models that provide more . If you really want a mat , <URL> are superbly cushioned .
To add to Stephie 's answer , sometimes dairy is incorporated for a variety of reasons . In some cases , like a coffee cake , sour cream or yogurt can account for a good amount of the moisture and fat in the batter . Rich dairy products like cream and sour cream usually lead to very tender baked goods , due to helping to incorporate more fat ( the fact that it 's already emulsified helps too ) . Soured dairy , like yogurt , sour cream , and buttermilk are frequently used so that their acidity will react with baking soda in the recipe for leavening . Finally , yogurt and buttermilk often have stabilizers like guar gum , xanthan gum , and carrageenan . These will retain moisture after baking to help the finished product be more moist . Whether a substitution will work would depend on which functions the dairy ingredient is filling , and which characteristics the substitute matches .
All of those ingredients should be fine . The only thing you really have to worry about is shelf life , so make sure to buy fresh ingredients and check your expiration dates , especially on the baking powder and baking soda and the almonds . I would just tell them to use it within a year ( or the earliest expiration date ) . Oh yeah , and do n't put the baking powder and baking soda next to the brown sugar . There is n't a lot of water in it , but it might be enough to cause issue .
When metal is exposed to microwave radiation , an electric potential difference can develop as the microwaves generate electric charge in parts of the metal . Flowing electricity can cause sparks as electrons migrate to places of lower potential . Solid metal is susceptible to this because its electrons are relatively loose , making it a good conductor of electricity . Calcium ( Ca ) in milk is bonded with other atoms ( mostly as calcium phosphate ) , so it does n't behave as a solid metal would : first because its electrons are secured in bonds with other atoms , and second , because the Ca atoms are not aggregated together but intermixed with nonconducting ones .
To have less oxygen and / or other contanminates . Like is used with pumps on wine . Not sure how many foods are negatively effected by oxygen . Potato chips for one . Potatoe chips are also effected by moisture and this is less moisture . According to <URL> fats oxide to produce " off " odors and flavors . Since nuts are sold in sealed bags / jars I suspect they are effected by oxygen . But that may be just for moisture . Found a reference that the oil in nuts will oxidize so low oxygen is good for storage . According to a comment a vacuum also required to create a seal . It kind of makes sense to me but I am not 100 % convinced a vacuum is required for a seal . For sure you are not going to hold a vacuum without a seal . A mod asked me add this information but I do n't feel athoritative here .
Well , at least here in germany it really is common to make liverwurst with beef liver ( or more often and expensive : calf liver ) . So go ahead - you really wo n't regret it ! Taken the percentage of actual liver in liverwurst you wo n't taste any difference , though I 'd say beef liver tastes better .
Any time you see something like " may contain " after an ingredient list , it 's a warning that it might contain trace amounts of that substance and so could be harmful to anyone who 's allergic to it . Basically what they 're saying is that they did n't intentionally add any milk or milk products to the cocoa butter , but since they make other products at the same factory that use milk they ca n't guarantee that some has n't slipped in somehow . So assuming that cocoa butter is the only ingredient then it would be pure cocoa butter , at least by the legal definition .
I have used a rice cooker lid as a replacement on an old crock pot . It has a small venting hole as you described . I have been using this lid for years now and have yet to have a dish dry out . The hole is just too small to let much water out .
Empty the water from inside the coconut , as this is not the milk you want . Crack open your coconut and scrape out the meat . In a blender , take about half your meat and roughly 1 1/2 cups of hot water ( more or less depending on your desired thickness ) , and process . Repeat step 3 with the other half of the meat . Place a few layers of cheesecloth over a bowl and strain the milk through . Wrap up the cheesecloth and squeeze the rest of the milk out . No special press or tools needed . However , some sort of press could help get the last few drops out when squeezing the mass through the cheesecloth . I do n't think the water necessarily has to be hot . Some sources say to just use water , while other say hot . You may also want to start out with just 1/2 cup water and see how much it yields . Keep in mind : coconuts are n't super juicy . So expect the yield to be roughly equivalent to the amount of water used . The flesh is still perfectly usable , but its applications may be limited based on how much you processed it ( in terms of size ) . <URL> has the step-by-step I used with a few ( albeit not very helpful ) pictures .
Handling raw milk is risky , and please note this information is not professional advice and is not to be taken as an authoritative response . I will , however , attempt to provide some thoughts on handling raw milk below . Selling unpasteurized milk is illegal in some countries , and official sources usually discourage the consumption of raw milk instead of offering handling instructions ( for good reason ) . The FDA has <URL> on dangers of raw milk . There are other real dangers such as <URL> with which I bouted as an 8-year old . Think of 107F fever . Also , keep in mind when you boil the raw milk you are going through a similar process as pasteurization in regards to the theory on breaking down the complex proteins and <URL> . Probably even more than pasteurization since that occurs at lower temperatures . Those theories , however , are n't proven ( yet ) as far as I know , but you do burn some of the sugars in milk if you go above 70C . The actual answers : 2 : It is better to boil first for sure . Do n't store raw milk for lengths of time . 3 : Theoretically , if you do everything right and vacuum pack the milk , it might last a couple of weeks , but the longer it stays , the more dangerous it can get . Freezing might be a better option ( we keep our pasteurized milk a couple of months in the freezer ) . 1 : I ca n't tell you how long to boil it for , though the last time I had fresh milk , it was kept simmering on the burner for about 5 minutes by the folks at the farm . It was also minutes after it was collected ( fresher is better ) . one of the safest things you can do if you 're going to have raw milk , is to know the source and get it from a farm that takes care of the conditions . If you know the farm , the farmer , and the cows conditions are safe , you 're more likely to be able to enjoy raw milk in peace .

What can be used to thicken chili other than masa harina ?
There are several ways you can thicken Chili than adding Masa Harina : Add another thickening agent : flour and cornstarch are both widely used , you can also try other flours like graham flour , chickpea flour , or arrowroot . Note that if you use flour you 'll want to fry it in oil or butter or risk a raw flour taste in the dish Add refried beans : this adds thickening and a richness . It does dilute the spices some so you 'll want to make the chili more powerful to compensate Cook it down : Why add a thickener when simply simmering with the lid off will do it for you ? It takes some time ( an hour or so depending on the water content of the ingredients you add ) , but it will concentrate the flavors and give you a nice , thick chili without any additional ingredients at all
I do n't want to disappoint you , but the sad truth is that extra virgin olive oil is unsuitable for all the cooking methods you mention . When you heat any oil past its smoking point it starts to deteriorate and can even become dangerous . Olive oil , extra virgin in particular , has a lower smoking point than most other oils . In fact , you will be better off with an olive oil of lesser quality . Such an oil will have been processed and thus purified , increasing its smoking point . You may think that butter is unhealthy , but at high temperatures it will actually withstand the heat better than extra virgin olive oil . Good oils for the purposes you mention are canola oil , sunflower oil , peanut oil , and grapeseed oil .
None of those flours on its own is a good substitute for bread flour , at least for making yeast raised breads . Yeast raised breads require the development of gluten , which is possible only with a wheat based flour . This leaves you only three choices : Whole wheat flour Maida Semolina Comparing the characteristics of each of these to bread flour : Whole wheat flour , depending on the wheat from which it is milled , may have higher or lower protein levels . Your particular whole wheat flour has a moderately high protein level , at the bottom end of the bread flour range . However , the bran that is a component of whole wheat flour is very sharp at the small scale , and does not participate in the chemistry or physical structure of gluten creation . In fact , the sharp edges of the bran actually serve to physically block formation of gluten strands , and even cut already formed strands . For this reason , whole wheat flour is less than ideal for some bread making . In general , you would want to substitute only a portion of bread flour with whole wheat flour ; in fact , it is better to use it only in bread recipes specifically designed for it . If you do choose to use it in lieu of bread flour , consider starting with only 25 % of the total flour amount . Finally , whole wheat flour has a different flavor than white flours , due to the additional components in the flour from the <URL> . The bran , the germ , and the endosperm all ground together ( thus the term whole wheat ) , giving the flour its own flavor from each of these components -- mostly the germ . This is also what leads to the shorter shelf life of whole wheat flour . Maida flour . According to <URL> , maida flour is a soft ( low protein ) flour comparable to cake flour or pastry flour . This means that it has much less protein , and much less gluten formation potential than bread flour does , on a weight for weight basis . Semolina . Semolina is a hard wheat flour with a high protein level , but is typically very coarsely ground . Generally , you can feel the individual granules when you pick it up and hold it between your fingers , and can see them when you look quite closely . This is a much larger grind than bread flour . You can make bread with semolina , as this recipe from <URL> demonstrates . With these components available to you , you would need to experiment to find the best possible outcome -- and unfortunately , that is not the best place to start if you are not already a a fairly comfortable bread maker . My best guess is that your best outcome would be from a mixture of semolina and maida , probably about 50-50 . However , the dough may take longer to hydrate and come together than expected , due to the larger grains of the semolina . If you wish to incorporate whole wheat flour , I recommend starting with 25 % of your total flour , and no more than 50 % total . Note : <URL> refers to an Indian flour called atta which is much closer in its description to bread flours ... is it not available in your region ?
When making the slurry , stir cornstarch into cold water until it has the consistency of cream . This can be set aside until it 's needed , but be sure to stir it briefly before you pour it into the sauce to redistribute the starch granules in the water . You should pour it into your sauce toward the end of its preparation . According to McGee you should use roughly 2/3 as much starch as you would flour . If you are n't using a recipe , add your slurry a bit at time until it 's a thick as you like it . Also remember that the sauce will thicken a bit as it cools , so it should be a little bit thinner on the stove than you intend to serve it .
One technique , especially in Mexican foods , for recipes that use dried chilies , is to toast the pods before using them . Toast them over medium heat until the pod blisters , but do n't blacken too much . They are very thin , so going from done to ruined takes only a few seconds of in attention . Be careful !
Cocoa butter crystallizes into various types of crystals depending on the temperature at which it cools . If the butter cools into an ad hoc assortment of crystal types then they do n't arrange themselves uniformly and the chocolate will be dull and sticky . The process of melting chocolate to encourage proper crystal growth is called tempering . You will find <URL> a <URL> <URL> on the subject here . You can use any chocolate that contains cocoa butter . However , if you are going to be putting that much work into tempering your chocolate you might spring for the nicer quality chocolate and not just plain Hershey 's . Alternatively , if it meets your needs , you can either serve your chocolate still melted or make a thick syrup/fudge dip that stays soft and does n't need to be tempered .
Korean chilli is a little different as it has a slight smoky flavour , in addition to being slightly sweet and also quite hot . The actual name of the chilli use in kimchi and for that matter , most Korean dishes is gochugaru ( 고추가루 ) . It comes in a variety of preparations , typically , finely ground , flakes and a paste . You should be able to find this in most good supermarkets or an Asian store . If you ca n't get this , you can still use a good quality chilli powder or possibly , a paste .
First off , you can use a gas grill as a gas burner , and cook anything you could on the stove . It wo n't be very efficient , and wo n't be as pleasant as using a stove , but it 'll work . The one big inconvenience is that since the burner wo n't be appropriately sized to the pan , or directly beneath it , you 'll need pots and pans that can handle heat all around - in particular , you ca n't use anything that ca n't take the heat on the handle . Cast iron might be your best bet . But from there you can do whatever you want - saute , sear , etc. . You 're not really limited to one technique . You can also essentially use the grill as an oven if you want to . You wo n't have precise temperature control like you would in the oven , and the temperature will vary more from side to side and top to bottom than it would in an oven , but it can reach the same kinds of temperatures . If you get a thermometer with a probe that can be left inside the grill , then you 'll be able to adjust the heat as needed and get a sufficiently precise temperature to do most things you could do in the oven . You 'll want to use indirect heat to do this , so that whatever you 're cooking is n't incredibly hot on the bottom . If you have three burners , you can use the two on the sides and put the food in the middle ; if you have two you 'll have to use one on one side and put the food on the other , resulting in somewhat less even heating . Here again , you 're not really limited to one technique . You can do braised things inside a dutch oven ( like a pot roast ) . You can wrap things up in foil and roast them . You 'll have a bit more trouble with things that are meant to cook open and care more about even heating , so for example thinner slices of meat ( or fish filets ) on a baking sheet might not be a great idea , but there 's still plenty you can do . All-in-all , I would n't think of this as learning a list of techniques . I 'd just look for recipes you 're interested in trying , and see if they seem like they 'll work on the grill given all that .
@Chris : Does the recipe from the Nero Wolfe cookbook say anything about dumping the milky/watery portion out of the pan before returning the butter to it to brown ? Clarified butter WILL NOT brown , that is the purpose for clarifying it . The milk solids are what brown . The portion that usually goes to the bottom will be the whey and the milk solids initially tend to form the " scum " on the top . To me it sounds like he 's trying to suggest that you should pour the butter &amp; solids off , dump out any whey , and then return the butter to the pan so you can heat it to the point of a dark brown without it splattering ( which is caused by the water in the whey ) . 4 tablespoons of butter is n't going to have much whey in the first place so just cook the whole butter to the beurre noir point .
From experience I 'd say those 6 months do n't stack . You could have 6 months in the jar , or 6 months in the freezer - very soon after defrosting the flavour would die out . If you have to freeze I would recommend using it straight from the freezer , if you can avoid it clumping . The overall potency is degrading from the moment it 's picked ! But realistically from the moment of grinding , as the oils in the ingredient are slowly seeping and evaporating out of the grain . Why not make smaller batches more regularly ? That 's what I do for garam masala , mixing a new batch every 3 months or so . I would always recommend oven drying spices / peppers very low for a long time - say 2 - 3 hours at 100C ( 212F ) . Wet ingredients could be dried in the same way , else added at the time you are going to cook with them .
Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom , along with cinnamon and cocoa . Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world , not just in India . If you have reason to want to try this particular recipe , then try the recipe as written . There are thousands of beloved recipes for all kinds of chili . There is no reason to say , " That one looks good , I 'll do it just like that but omit a certain ingredient 'cause it makes me nervous . " Your friend 's advice is a bit odd to me because Garam Masala usually contains cardamom ( sometimes black , green and brown ) My advice is to either try the recipe as written , or find another with which you 're more comfortable . Or come up with your own . There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chili . BTW , I love cardamom in savory . I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup ( Pho ) that I crave if I have n't had it for a while . It would n't be right without cardamom .
Fondant is nearly solid -- it 's rolled out , and placed onto the cake ( with a buttercream underneath as an adhesive ) . The advantage is that it goes on really quickly and smoothly over large items . It can also be cut into shapes with rather clean edges ( modeling chocolate gives sharper edges , but it 's not flexible enough to cover a round cake ) . You often see it on professional non-traditional cakes ( more novelties , when they need a solid color or something that 's strangely shaped . Fondant can also be used to give a solid background can then be piped into ( with buttercream icing , generally ) or painted . As it 's nearly solid , it can also be worked like you would clay to make decorations . Royal icing dries hard as it has no fat in it . It 's generally only used on cakes as a drizzle where you 're not attempting to cover the entire cake . You 'll often see it used on bundt cakes , but you more frequently see it used for cookies when you 're doing a flood-fill . Buttercream icings ( commonly called ' frosting ' in the US ) is likely the most standard for non-professional stacked cakes . It 's spread on , so it takes a little more work to get a clean smooth surface . ( the trick is to wait 'til the surface has hardened , put down some waxed paper , then smooth out all of the spatula marks ... you need to wait 'til the waxed paper does n't stick , but not so long that it has n't set up completely ) . You can also use buttercream in pastry bags to create flowers , ropes , basketweave and other decorations . ... And then there 's other frostings/icings , too , but they 're not as general purpose . They generally go with specific types of cakes -- caramel and other cooked frostings ( eg , used in ' German Chocolate Cake ' ) , cream cheese frosting ( for carrot and other spice cakes ) , whipped cream ( used in black forest cake &amp; strawberry shortcake )
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
If cooled and stored properly ( minimize air space in the container ) , most soups will should last in the refrigerator up to 5 days . Do you really want to be eating the same soup that long ? I would suggest dividing your soups into smaller sized containers and freezing it so you have a wide selection available at any given time . Depending on the ingredients most soups can be succesfully frozen for long term storage . Dairy based items are more likely to curdle/separate after thawing so you 'd be better to add the cream/milk when you 're reheating it . Chunks of potato or pasta are likely to break up a bit and have a more mealy consistency so it would also be better to leave the potato out and add to it and cook when reheating .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
I finally found the answer to this question : I was in the supermarket yesterday and on a can of lentils the ingredients listed on the side of the tin had the phrase ' firming agent ' in brackets beside the entry for calcium chloride .
Heinz and some other companies sell a product that they call ' chili sauce ' , which might be what you 're looking for . It 's a tomato-based sauce , with some spices and seasoning , but it 's not particularly spicy . If you have access to Dutch &amp; German ingredients , you might replace it with one of the thicker shashlik sauces ( aka ' curry ketchup ' ) . If you have access to UK ingredients , you might try brown sauce . If you wanted to make it yourself from scratch , see <URL>
The Cuisinart SG-10 spice grinder it designed to grind soft and hard spices . There is no reason why it could n't do coffee The <URL> even mentions nutmeg , which is significantly tougher than coffee Many coffee " professionals " like the burr grind ( like a pepper grinder ) , compared to the rotary blade grind ( like a small food processor ) , but either will work fine Also , many people grind spices in rotary blade coffee grinders , so it comes down to which style of grinding you like One issue with rotary ground coffee is the inconsistency of grind size . There will be too many fine particles that will leech out of the coffee holding/filter mechanism . If you do n't want solid particles in your coffee use a burr grinder
2kg of veal bones cut up for stock use from your butcher should need around 5 litre of water to cover . If you use more then you 're just thinning the stock and that 'll mean you need to reduce it more later to get the same flavour you would have had if you started with the correct amount of water . Why does this matter you may ask ... well , along with the longer reduction time you 'll taste changes to the flavour more as time goes by . You 're cooking it longer and the heat changes things , sometimes for the bad , sometimes for the good . Mainly it 's just wasted time reducing something that did n't need to happen . When all is said and done after simmering for around 6 hours , you 'll end up with about 3-4 litres of quality stock if you went with a 2kg :5 L ratio . If you use more water to start then you 'll end up with more stock but of low quality . Then you 'll spend your time reducing the stock down until it starts to taste like the stock that you could have made with 5L of water .
White fish are , as a rule , more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish . Add farm-raised to that equation and you have the makings for a very bland meal , which is why you almost always see farm-raised white-fleshed fish served with heavy herb treatments and powerful sauces , or ( in cod 's case ) fry batter . Tilapia and cod are two of the most common farm-raised fish on the market , so I 'm leaning heavily on my suspicion that you 're trying to make sushi out of the farm-raised varieties and not wild game . If it 's white fish you desire for sushi , talk to your fishmonger . Tell him what you 're doing and ask for his recommendation . He 'll direct you toward game fish that that are either very new and very fresh or that of the flash-frozen variety .

Why use onions in cooking ?
As a child , I used to hate the feel and taste when I conciously bit on a piece of onion ( strongest offender : medium-sized chunks , sautéed glassy but still firm ) . Sometimes that still happens . However , I use onion a lot myself now in cooking . Lots of dishes really need the kind of taste onions can supply ; even though that taste may by itself be a bit gross , it 's really useful in the mix . ( This is true for many other ingredients as well ! ) I can only speak for myself , but very likely , there are some dishes where you do n't even notice that onions are in , but they are -- and you would n't like it if they were n't ! Do use onions , just do it consciously . There are broadly three ways of preparing them that I consider effective , each suited to different cases : Disperse them throughout the dish . Either chop them really fine and saut&eacute;e ( with the right technique and a decent knife you can get the chunks down to only a few millimetres ) , or boil with other vegetables and then pur&eacute;e . You 'll get all the good taste , but nowhere too strong and without any unpleasant mouth-feel . Ideal for light/creamy sauces or soups . Caramelise them boldly . Frying changes the taste of onions a lot , it makes them much sweeter , gets rid of the pungency in exchange for a really concentrated savouriness , and almost completely tames the consistency . Browned onions play great together with strong seasonings like garlic and pepper , as flavouring for chewy mushrooms or meats . Or the opposite : keep them mostly raw ! The freshness and crunch of raw onions can also be very useful without evoking what I call the bad onion effect -- albeit in a completely different way . Thinly sliced in salads , or very quickly stir-fried in rice dishes , you keep the raw pungency in check while staying clear of the uncanny softness . Again , it 's a good idea to define the taste heading with other sharp flavours : vinegar or chilies work well . Perhaps you wo n't be able to befriend yourself with all of these preparation methods , but you should give them a try .
Well , it makes the eggs go further for one ... But it also produces softer , creamier results . You 're moving toward something like a custard or quiche . If you like your eggs very stiff , this is probably a bad idea .
There are <URL> ( usually of Italian origin ) specifically made with olive oil . In breads , you can certainly use it , although there often is not enough olive oil for its flavor to truly be appreciated . New York style pizza dough , for example , is traditionally made with some olive oil .
I own the same book and was similarly surprised when I read that instruction , but in the section on ingredients , the author does mention a particular variety of onions called pink onions . The mention is on pg . 32 , and there is a picture of a pink onion on the upper left of pg . 34 . Here 's an excerpt from pg . 32 : " The longer the onions are fried , the browner they will get and the deeper the color of the curry will be ... When the onions are fried until only light pink in color , they will impart a sweetish taste to the curry . Certain varieties of onion , like Spanish onions , are too sweet to be appropriate for curry-making . The most appropriate from the taste point of view are the French and the small pink English . " From <URL> I 've never seen pink onions in any of the local markets ( in northwestern US ) , I used white onions and sauteed them just to the point of browning . The recipe turned out fine , but it 's a lot of onion . ( The recipe calls for 2 large onions , finely chopped . It 's a recipe that produces 2 servings . ) Personally , I 'd go a little lighter on the amount of onion or use yellow onions ( despite the author 's recommendation against Spanish onions ) , but that is just personal preference from a Western palate . Note : it looks like the current printing of the book is different from the one I own , so the page numbers I cite may be off , but if you search inside the book ( on Amazon ) for " pink onion " you can see the page I 've cited and the picture of what the author calls a pink onion .
Without seeing the result and knowing your exact technique , my best guess is that you 're not using enough liquid , or that you 're using heat that 's too high . High heat will essentially fry the onions , like you would expect by dropping chicken or potatoes into a pan full of hot oil . Properly caramelized onions should take at least 20 to 30 minutes , I try to go for an hour whenever time permits . I actually stir as little as I can without allowing them to sit long enough to burn . Over-stirring should n't be a problem ; under-stirring may be . To start , you want the bottom of the pan to be covered with a thin layer of oil , and then make sure you stir the onions very well to coat them completely right after you toss them in . Begin with the pan on medium-high heat to get the oil up to temperature , once it ripples and you put the onions in you can lower it quite a bit . I rarely put it above 5 ( out of 10 , glass-top stove ) , and if I see things going crispy , I 'll often drop it to 4 . I 'd rather take more time and have softer onions . Are you adding any liquid along the way ? Sometime , when doing large batches , 15 minutes in I find that I do n't have enough oil in the pan , and I can see them starting to crisp up a bit more than I 'd like . When that happens , lower the heat a notch , and add a touch more oil ( or , as I prefer , a cube of homemade stock ) to the pan . It 'll take some practice , but eventually you 'll be able to know how much liquid to use instinctively . The reason I prefer stock for my " second add " is because I know the stock will evaporate off , as mentioned in the question you linked to , you do n't want to be pouring off flavor at the end of the cooking time , so evaporation is a good thing ! If you 're using cast iron , I recommend trying stainless steel , I get much better results with the latter than the former . I 'd guess that it 's because I can dynamically regulate the temperature better with the stainless steel - with cast iron , once you realize you 're at too high of a temperature , it 's hard to lower it quickly . If you need a step by step guide to start you off until you get a feel for everything , there is a great guide <URL> and another <URL> . The difference is that one recommends 1 teaspoon of oil per onion ; the other uses 3 tablespoons per onion . I find that for my kitchen , it 's somewhere in the middle ( I just eyeball so I ca n't give you an exact number , unfortunately ) - but if you try both methods on your stovetop you should be able to use that data to determine the right amount for you .
Baking powder , especially if too great a quantity is used , adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good . Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly does n't do anything to enhance the flavor . Many baked goods traditionally do n't use a chemical leavener at all , but instead rely on technique . Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created . Yeast , on the other hand , creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread . Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes ( <URL> , for example , although many " knock off " recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness ) . Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network ( usually something you absolutely do n't want in a quick bread or quick cake ) -- you do n't get a crumb with big , airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid . Also , in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge . The shelf life is not so different . If yeast scares you , you may want to check out some of the proponents of the <URL> technique . For a lot more information on this subject , there is a recent publication that covers all sorts of <URL> .
Well , you 're definitely right . Onions cooked at a high temperature act differently than ones cooked at a low temperature , per " the bible " aka On Food and Cooking . However , it does n't go in to much of an explanation as to why . Probably the most relevant aspects of what is in there are : When onions and their relatives are heated , the various sulfur compounds react with each other and with other substances to produce a range of characteristic flavor molecules . The cooking method , temperature and medium strongly affect the flavor balance . Baking , drying , and microwaving tend to generate trisulfides , the characteristic notes of overcooked cabbage . Cooking at high temperatures in fat produces more volatiles and a stronger flavor than do other techniques . <URL> Since a low temperature produces less volatiles , I assume that the natural sugars of the onion shine through instead . It 's probably also important to understand where the oniony flavor comes from . The spice , as you describe it , is the onions natural defense mechanism . However , it does n't exist defacto in the onion , but is rather the result of a chemical reaction . The onion stores very reactive sulfur in the cell fluid , and a seperate trigger mechanism in a storage vacuole . When you cut / crush / cook / peel the onion , you break the vacuole and the enzyme and sulfur cause a chemical reaction giving off the spice . <URL> &amp; <URL> )
You say you are substituting the juices for milk . You have to ask yourself , what roles does milk play in the recipe , and how well will the juices in question fill those roles ? What does milk contribute ? The milk adds : Liquid , to gelatinize the starch in the flour to create the structure of the cake ; the water will also contribute to some gluten formation , but in most cake techniques , this is minimized Very minor acid component A small amount of fat , but compared to the oil in the above recipe this becomes negligible A small amount of sugar , but compared to the sugar in the above recipe , also negligible Some proteins and other milk solids which will interfere slightly with gluten formation , again enhancing tenderness ; they also help to retain moisture so the cake stays fresh longer A very milk neutral flavor that comes out as a general contribution to the richness The fruit juice In contrast , what do fruit juices bring to the recipe ? I am ignoring the heavy/light or thin/thick distinction because it means very little . Water -- exactly the same as the milk Significant acid . Fruit juices tend to be much more acidic than milk . You might wish to experiment with reducing the baking powder , and adding some baking soda to use the additional acid to power the chemical leavening , while neutralizing some of the overall acidity Most fruit juice is essentially fat free , but as the fat contribution from milk is negligible , this is not an important distinction Possibly some pectin or other long polysaccarides which will contribute to the overall structure and mouth feel of the cake , but this effect is probably negligible Flavor . The fruit juices will have a strong and significant flavor -- of course , this may be a positive , but it will influence the outcome of the cake Sugar . Fruit juices tend to be sweeter than milk , so the overall cake will be slightly sweeter . This is probably somewhat mitigated by the increased acidity , and again , compared to the overall sugar in the recipe , probably not a large contributing factor . Fruit solids ( proteins , minerals and so on ) . Much like the milk solids , probably contribute somewhat to the more tender crumb , but hard to characterize . The truth is , the " heaviness " or " thickness " ( by which I infer you mean viscosity , or how fast the juice flows or pours -- or how easily it coats a spoon , which is an easier way to see it ) is not that important . You could use pureed fruit with almost the same result -- for example , canned or pureed pumpkin or mashed banana . Even pureed fruit is still mostly water . Still , every juice or fruit puree is its own entity . I would keep a little diary of how each trial worked out , whether you like the results , and adjust the next try accordingly . Edit : What juices to use ? I realized I never specifically answered the question , what juices to use ? Use whatever juice ( or fruit puree ) you like , based whether you like the flavor and how the cake turns out . Each time you try something new , there is some risk , but you should soon find ones you like , and which perform well .
Shellfish is usually somewhat sweet in flavour . Acidity is the natural balance to sweetness .
<URL> , using olive oil to fry is basically a waste of money . " After I 'd heated them , none of the olive oils had much olive flavor left . In fact , they did n't taste much different from the seed oils . " According to a <URL> I have access to , you could use high oleic sunflower oil for frying as it degrades better .
I do n't remember the exact science behind the potatoes not turning to mush ... I know it was discussed on an episode of America 's Test Kitchen , and they even discussed the amount of vinegar and how it affected the window for cooking times . ( I want to say it was on an episode where they were making an Austrian potato salad ) ... and it 's not specifically vinegar , and not solely potatoes . Acids will stop quite a few items from softening when cooking . I know the list inclues onions ( pre-cook onions before adding acids if you want them to disolve into a sauce ) , potatoes , apples ... I 'm guessing there 's others . For potatoes and apples , most recipes claim it 's to slow down browning . You see it in potato salad , but not mashed potatoes . You 'll see it in apple pies , but not in applesauce ... because they 'll come out lumpy . Matt already mentioned three uses for vingear : as half of a chemical leavener tenderizing / marinades preservation / picking coagulation ( eg , when poaching eggs ) But also : stabalizing eggwhite foams ( might just be a variation of coagulation ? ) denaturing / " cooking " ( eg . in the case of ceviche ; a variation of marinating ? ) flavor ( might not be a ' science case ' ... but sour is one of the primary tastes ; especially helps to balance out fatty dishes ) cleaning / disinfection ( might not be a ' cooking ' use )
There 's no rule that you have to drink your wine 24 hours after un-corking it , in fact some wines can taste better after 24 hours . 3 or 4 days is fine in many cases , and some wines are still drinkable a week after opening . This can be extended by refrigerating your wine after opening , white or red , you can get 2 weeks out of a bottle of wine if it 's stored in the fridge . With reds let the glass stand for 10 minutes or so after pouring to get the optimal temperature . 2 weeks out of the fridge and it 's probably vinegar , but if it still takes ok you can cook with it no problem .
Yes , it is safe . It is really more a question of quality . I would suggest that , in your specific situation you get a browning dish . ( It would be something that you could still use after your move , if you like . ) Please see the excerpt below from <URL> . There is nothing like a charbroiled steak straight off the grill . But for the times when you do n't want to fire up the grill - or even get the broiler dirty - there is a way to sear steaks in the microwave on an accessory called a browning dish . A microwaved steak will not brown well without one , and the dish is really the only acceptable way to brown in the microwave . Browning dishes can be either flat rectangular plates or black skillets that are designed for the microwave . Embedded in the plate or skillet are metal strips that cause the microwaves to couple or link , producing an electrical current . The dish also is coated with a metal that is resistant to the electrical current . You can read the rest of the article and the how-to information by following the link .
The baking powder does very little to the roti . If you are making them to eat as soon as they are done , there is no need for baking powder . I assume you are asking about <URL> , which are flat breads with no yeast leavening , very similar to flour tortillas . There are many publications that have studied the effects of chemical leavening agents on wheat Mexican tortillas ( which are similar or even identical to chapatis ) . They all find that <URL> , not worth it in my opinion . For a fluffier tortilla , more critical than the baking powder is , when cooking , to get both surfaces done and dry as fast as possible , so that they may act as a barrier to the steam that develops inside . In commercial settings this is achieved by hot-pressing the dough . Commercial chapatis and tortillas manufacturers have to fight staling -- the drying and toughening -- and I imagine that every little improvement counts .
Rose petals are edible . If you look for rose petal recipes , you will find many creative uses of them , including rice pudding with roses - so your pudding intuition was correct . During colonial American times they were considered a treat . You can candy rose petals with egg whites and sugar - typical cautions about appropriate raw egg white useage applies . Before using your rose petals in culinary applications , make sure to remember what chemicals you used on them . If they 've been sprayed with pesticides , you do n't want to be eating them .
How about Ruhlman 's book , <URL> ? The entire work is dedicated to breaking cooking down into ratios , and it includes recipes . I hear the bread recipe is particularly good .
Unpeeled onions and garlic help thicken liquids ( just a little ) . The skins of onions and garlic are at least 10 % pectin , the substance that is used to thicken jellies . If you are making a stock or a soup , you can place the washed unpeeled garlic or onion quarters in an oversized herb sachet . After cooking you remove the sachet and discard its contents . The <URL> . You can read all about the science of garlic and onions in <URL> . While it does discuss the antioxidant effects of Alliums in general it does not treat the particular compounds that have been discovered in the skins .
I 've been reviewing old family recipes , and I 've seen pickled onions called for in some soup , stew , and casserole recipes as an accent ; this may or may not be because my foremothers grew and canned loads of onions . It 's worth an experiment or two , I think !
I do think there is a maximum to the duration of stewing a cut of beef . There is in my opinion such a thing as too tender and soft . If you plan to cook the meat as one large chunk you will have to add a little to your normal stewing time , but I would not go as high as 15 hours . Cooking and re-heating is quite an interesting option though , as quite a few dishes benefit from this in terms of flavour . Perhaps a <URL> on this subject , or a <URL> would be of interest to you . For me , the smaller the size of your chunks of meat , the more you should stick to your normal stewing time of 8 hours and the more you could consider making it a day early to enhance the taste .
Bear in mind that I 'm using an electric kettle , rather than a stove-top one . First , the advantage of a kettle is that it is quite efficient , and turns itself off once the water is boiling . This as opposed to the microwave , which only stops after a set time , rather than relying on the condition of the water . Second , a microwave can cause water to superheat , particularly in a ceramic or glass container . This means that there is a certain risk that the water will " jump out " at you once you add something to it or put a spoon in . Additionally , most kettles have more power than the average microwave , so the kettle is probably faster to boil water .

Low Carb Pizza Dough Recipe - How Will This Make Dough ?
Do n't think of that as dough . This looks like basically making a quiche base to put pizza toppings on . I do n't see any reason to think this recipe wo n't be stable but it wo n't be anything like pizza crust . Still it sounds tasty .
My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well . It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily " broken " . I 've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it does n't take to cookie cutters , but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz ( or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle , sprinkle with your finger tips ) cold water on it . ( Like adding water to pie dough ) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in . Repeat until it just stops breaking . Do n't go overboard and make it gooey . I 'd use water over oil or milk because it 's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process . Such minuscule amounts of water should n't yield a detectable change in the end product . If this is a consistent problem with the recipe , in the future I 'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps .
If the flour is self-rising flour , then it should n't be allowed to sit for too long . However , this would n't result in it being " impossible to pour " - it would just prevent the item ( s ) from rising properly when baked . If I had to guess , I would point to the chocolate as the culprit . If your batter/dough recipe uses melted chocolate ( as opposed to just cocoa powder ) then it is almost certainly going to solidify again as it cools . In which case , you can simply heat it again ( gently - you do n't want cook the eggs ! ) to loosen it up a little before pouring it .
Kneading dough has a few functions . First , it distributes the ingredients together evenly and allows the flour to become hydrated . As the flour starts to absorb water , enzymatic reactions occur and some proteins begin to mesh together . The two most important in this process are glutenin and gliadin . When these proteins start to get tangled up together , they form gluten , which is the protein that allows bread dough to stretch and trap gas bubbles produced by yeast . These reactions will occur on their own to an extent , as in no-knead recipes , but kneading accelerates the process . Kneading also allows you to control the texture of the bread . A vigorous knead can help to produce a bread with a fine crumb as the kneading an tighten the gluten , keeping the air bubbles more uniform . Doing short kneading periods ( or folds ) spaced by time for the dough to relax and rise can give you more extensible dough which can help give you a more open crumb structure . Finally , kneading is sometimes used to add inclusions to the dough that would disrupt it 's activity if added to early . This can be things like seeds , which would cut gluten strands if included too early in the process , or things like butter in a brioche , which would shorten the dough if included before the gluten had already developed .
Generally , no they should be fine . You 'd have more of an issue with frozen than fresh . It would take fresh strawberries a long time to release enough moisture to cause any significant amount of sogginess . The issue you 're more likely to run into depending on the size of your strawberries , the density of your Bavarian cream , levelness of your cake , and the weight of your top layer is that they can act like rollers and friction between the two layers will be low . If the cake is tilted wrong , the top layer will just slide right off . I 've definitely had it happen - ruined a cake for a charity event :( . Make sure the strawberries are cut into bits - not halves or slices and preferably fold them into the cream to prevent this from happening . All the flavors will still be there , but your cake will be safer .
Yes , you can refrigerate after the machine has kneaded the dough . Cover the bowl tightly . In the morning , take the dough out of the fridge and let it ' wake up ' in a warm place for an hour , cut and shape , then either prove them again or bake straight away ( a second prove will give you a lighter texture ) .
I can honestly say I 've done this on many occasions . Especially for pizza dough , I defrost in the fridge for 24 hours in a cling filmed bowl which allows it to prove slowly through the day . Never once had an issue with it .
That is absolutely fine . 00 flour is super-overpriced here , so much so that it is hardly ever used . Semolina is often used on the pizza peel , but really not all that often in the dough itself . There are more recipes for pizza dough than probably anything else on the internet . Some use all-purpose flour , some use bread flour , and some use no wheat at all . You can get away anything with some experimentation . <URL> has some of the best instruction around on everything pizza . You do n't say where you are from , but know that " all-purpose " flour has a different meaning to some people in India , and will behave differently than the medium-gluten wheat flour that is " all-purpose " to most of us . That does n't mean you ca n't use <URL> ( what is sold in much of India as " all-purpose " flour ) , just that it will behave differently . There is no safety issue at all to mixing flour types . Assuming that the flours are safe individually , they will be safe combined .
Unbaked lumps probably mean you are n't mixing it enough . Try starting with a little less flour and knead in more as you go . Another issue is you may not be kneading it enough . Next time try using the <URL> . You do n't have to do this every time , but if you 're having trouble with a specific recipe this will help you figure out how the dough should " feel " when its ready by giving you a visual indicator . I 've found that when I have dough rising problems , it 's usually because I did n't knead long enough . This should also help fix your mixing issue . That being said , there are two good methods to see if dough has risen enough . One is to let it rise in a marked container ( though this does n't work well for shaped loaves or if you are n't supposed to let it double ) . The other is the poke test . From a <URL> : To test for doneness , use the finger test : Poke it with 2 fingers ; it holds the indentation , it 's ready . Generally I poke it and if it pops right back out , it 's not ready . For sourdough , if it holds its shape for a moment and then slowly starts to expand back , it 's perfect . For other breads , holding the indentation is a good indicator . This is n't necessarily advisable for delicate doughs . If you 're working with a delicate dough , try the test on one loaf that you do n't " need " to be perfect . You can use this as a relative time measurement for the future .
Kenji over at Serious Eats gives some of the best " pizza science " lessons on the Internet . Here 's a good article on the role of yeast and fermentation in pizza dough : <URL> In short , time and kneading cause proteins in dough to form an elastic network of fibers called gluten . Yeast consumes starch and emits carbon dioxide . Gluten traps the carbon dioxide which causes the dough to expand or " rise " . The amount of yeast and time may vary based on the intent of the cook . More time allows the cook to use less yeast ( the yeast organisms will multiply ) and allows for a greater development of the proteins in the wheat flour . A longer , slower rise will allow for the greatest flavor to be developed . In his tests , Kenji found the optimum rise time to be 2-3 days in a refrigerator . However , this must be balanced against the cook 's desire for an expedient dinner :-) In my personal pizza cooking , I usually use 1 packet of yeast ( 2.25 tsp ) for approximately 13 cups of flour . I will typically allow this to rise for around 24 hours on my kitchen counter-top ( my house says cold at around 55-60degF ) . If the dough will not be used right away , I will put it in the fridge but will allow it to warm to room temperature for several hours before cooking it . Good luck with your pies !
In Europe at least , the rules on advertising say : " for a product to be able to make a claim that it was low in saturated fat under EU Regulation 1924/2006 on Nutrition and Health Claims Made on Foods , it should contain no more than 1.5 g of saturated fat per 100 g of solids " ( from the <URL> )
Yes , you can store it for about a day in the fridge . Let it warm up again before you cook it though .
How to throw dough , a basic step by step guide . Make sure you have a dough that can stand up to being airborne . This means that you need a high gluten dough . You can throw wetter doughs as you get more experienced but they require much more precise hand placement and are much less forgiving . Make sure your dough is fully risen with out being " blown " . It should be elastic and soft to the touch . Coat dough in flour . This step is necessary to allow free spinning on your hands and to get good , clean releases . Create crust . You can use the method that daniel describes , you can use the Papa John 's fold and tuck method , you can do it like this <URL> , it does n't matter as long as you end up with a piece of dough that is flat over the interior with a ridge going around the outside . You should be comfortable with in-air hand stretching before you get to the actual throwing . This is when you place the dough on the backs of your hands , support it with your knuckles and stretch it out . This position is a great way to start a basic toss that wo n't rip your dough as you will be catching with the backs of your hands and not your fingers . You want to release the dough by having your right hand provide upward thrust as your left hand provides spin . This will provide a straight up toss that is very easy to catch . The way to do the more advanced throws is learn to release from your finger tips . This involves having your fingers rest along the ridge that we made in step four . You can check out a quick tutorial starting at 2:17 on this <URL> . Feel free to ignore the rest of it , but it was the best explanation I found online . Basically , you want the dough to hang in such a way as to allow you to impart spin and momentum with just one hand , while other is occasionally used as a stabilizer . This allows tricks like the <URL> and the through the legs and all the others . Important tips that will help you be successful at learning this skill . Cold dough is more elastic than warm dough . That means its terrible for pizza but great for practicing . It also resists puncture a little better , so less holes . A damp kitchen towel has about the same aerodynamics as a piece of dough . It 's what I used to train the guys at my restaurant on for extra practice , and it 's way cheaper than one of those rubber doughs . The dough should always be spinning in the air . If it 's not , you are n't doing it right . Throwing dough can result in a very thin middle . You want to make sure that you are stretching evenly and keeping an eye on that if you intend to use the dough for it 's actual purpose of delicious pizza . Practice , Practice ! Throwing dough is a physical skill and you have to train your muscles a little to be good at it . It can be a little frustrating at first but stick with it , it 's a lot of fun . If you have any additional concerns leave a comment and I 'll do my best answer them .
A sausage stuffer , perhaps ? Your standard food mill attachment type more typically seen in a home kitchen : <URL> Unless you 're seeing some product I 've never met , I would not call that stuff " rolled in tubes " - I 'd call it a tube ( or log ) of dough , and I expect the filling process is VERY like a ( large , automated ) sausage stuffer , and involves no rolling at all . <URL> In making refrigerator cookies , one simply makes a log out of the dough , wraps it , and places it in the fridge to harden before slicing . The dough is not liquid to start with , so it does not pour , and can be shaped without a form . If your " dough " " pours " I 'm dubious about your recipe or method .
Allowing dough to rise twice results in a finer gluten structure than allowing it to rise once . It results in a smaller crumb and prevents huge gaping airholes in your bread . The reason that you have to let it re-rise is that you just pushed all the air out with the kneading you did developing that gluten structure .
If you insist on using a damp cloth , you have to make it wet again and again , so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times . Much easier is plastic wrap , which does n't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl . Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously wo n't work . My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid . It does n't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of " stretch and fold " or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough .
Do n't think of that as dough . This looks like basically making a quiche base to put pizza toppings on . I do n't see any reason to think this recipe wo n't be stable but it wo n't be anything like pizza crust . Still it sounds tasty .
Whenever you 're worried about something crisp being made soggy by something moist , the answer is usually fat . Brush the crust with butter or oil before you add the pears , and the oil will slow the absorption of water . Alternately , dry out your pears . Cook them a bit . Roll them in sugar to dry them out some . I 'm surprised the pear juice is making it through the cheesecake batter . Usually that stuff keeps the liquids locked up tight . Maybe try a drier cheesecake , or one with a bit more egg ?
In most wheat-based recipes , gluten strands are formed while you work the dough . If you do n't rest the dough , rolling can be more difficult and you may get a tougher texture in the final product . Additionally , refrigerating the dough up to a certain point will firm up the fats in the recipe ( butter , etc ) , which will make the dough less mushy and will making rolling out the dough evenly a bit easier . Unless the dough is so firm it becomes brittle , refrigeration will make the dough less fragile in most cases . Perhaps less important , the moisture levels may become a bit more consistent throughout the dough as well .
A very sharp blade with minimum drag . The traditional tool is called a lame - basically just a curved <URL> on a handle . If you make a lot of bread you might consider buying this unitasker . ( <URL> ) You can use a kitchen knife if yours are very sharp but I 've had the best results with a straight razor blade . I 've read of people using serrated blades but they always mutilated my bread . A little bit of non stick spray will do wonders at keeping the blade from binding up in the dough . The rest is technique . Make each score in a single cut if possible . Instructions often say to make " deliberate slashes " . Plan out where you want the cut then slash confidently . Multiple slashes or slow or halting cuts will do more damage to the loaf .

How much salt can I safely add to bread dough ?
Based on experience and experimentation alone ( I bake bread several times a week ) , I 'd say to be consistently safe you probably want to max out around 3 % in baker 's percentages . 2-2 .5 % is much more common , but I 've done as much as 3 % . After 3 % , things got very inconsistent . Sometimes it would work if the structure was just right , but mostly I got loaves that did n't rise well . If I did my math and conversions to weight right , it looks like you 're probably in the 2 % range , so you should be able to add about 50 % more salt . EDIT : It must be higher , but I 'm not sure how high . Bread Baker 's Apprentice as a 4.2 % Poolish Focaccia and other others in that range . BBA seems to max out in the low 4 's .
Well , if you do n't want to spend a fortune on a <URL> , your best bet is a bone saw . Image from <URL> Here 's one on <URL> . Here 's a less expensive one from <URL> . Here 's a fairly reasonably priced <URL> . If I was going to do a lot of butchery , I 'd consider that .
In France , white button mushrooms are called champignons . Before refrigeration was common , books suggested <URL> , because undercooked mushrooms would quickly spoil . If you cooked them and later keep them in the refrigerator , it is safe to reheat mushrooms . Treat mushrooms as you would treat meat . Mushrooms are mainly water , so they reheat well in the microwave . Do it on low power . Depending on the cooking technique , the texture may change by using high power .
So I waited about 3 weeks because I was on vacation since I put my loaf in the freezer . Some notes on the dough structure The dough was fully proofed , but that meant that the structure very much resembled a cracker . It would be stiff until you broke into it , at which point it would break &amp; collapse into itself irreparably <URL> The dough was frozen into the container , so I waited about 1.5 hours for it to thaw out . That meant that the core of the dough was frozen while the outside was thawed <URL> Fortunately , the thawed dough was still just as moist as it had been went into the freezer I could not score the loaf because the interior was too frozen . The loaf therefore came out without any perforations in the top . This , along with the frozen interior , likely severely limited oven spring . I expected the non-frozen version of this loaf to have double the volume . <URL> The flavor is pretty bland , unfortunately . Overall , would not recommend unless in an emergency !
I think you will get the ' best result ' out of ' par baking ' your rolls . I have done this myself , though not for shipping . It is simply easier to make a large batch and then store them for use as needed . IMHO rolls are best served hot and fresh , and while re-heating fully baked rolls can recapture some of the glory that is fresh baked bread , allowing your customers to finish bake a partially baked product will give them the convenience of truly fresh rolls on demand . The technique ( and recipe , for my part ) I picked up from Alton Brown , in the episode of Good Eats : <URL> . Alton 's recipe for <URL> includes a par baking option : For Brown and Serve option : Assemble rolls as above , but bake as follows . Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake until the outside of the rolls just begin to set but have not browned and the internal temperature is 185 degrees , about 30 minutes . Remove and cool on the pan for 10 minutes . After 10 minutes , remove the rolls from the pan and place on a cooling rack until they are room temperature , 30 to 40 minutes . Place the rolls in bags and freeze for up to 3 months . To Finish : Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thaw the rolls for 60 to 90 minutes . Spray a sheet pan with nonstick spray . Place the rolls on the prepared sheet pan and bake until the rolls reach an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. Rotate the pan halfway through baking , 10 to 12 minutes . Remove the pan to a cooling rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving . The key ' take-aways ' that you will want to apply are : Bake to internal temp of 185 ° F Cool to Room Temp Freeze for up to 3 months
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
It wo n't be as nice if you place meat into the fresh tomato sauce . The reason why is because you are then essentially boiling the mince , so you wo n't have any caramelisation happening . That caramelisation adds a good amount of flavour to the sauce , so you 'll be losing that . Sure , the mince may dry during the frying process , but remember that it will get ' rehydrated ' anyway when you throw it into the sauce afterwards . Also , by frying the mince , you render out all the fat that can be used to fry the Mirepoix to add extra flavour . I like to add the wine to help deglaze the pot/pan once I 've fried everything , then I reduce to half , then I add the tomatoes last .
Salting the water in which you cook starches ( pasta , rice , potato ) is an effective way of enhancing the flavour of the finished product - boiling starches absorb salt well ( which is why adding chunks of potato to an overall salty stew will lessen the apparent saltiness of the dish . But salt does other things . When I am making roasted potatoes , I parboil them for 5 minutes before drying and roasting them in oil . if you divide them into two batches and boil one half in unsalted water and the other half in well salted water ( 1tbsp/2 quarts water ) , the salted potatoes will brown and crisp much better than the unsalted ones . I 'm not sure why this is , but I would encourage you to try it because it 's amazing to see .
Does it work ? Yes , it does . The idea is to create something akin to an individual " dutch oven " around the chicken or fish you are baking . The meat is " steamed " in his own juices . There are a bunch of different " recipes " for the salt crust , often with some " binding agent " like egg whites . Usually , the skin is removed when serving ( go ahead , give it a try , if you like ) , so rest assured that the meat underneath is not too salty . An alternative to salt ( and arguably more " paleo style " ) would be baking in clay . A quick internet search should yield plenty of recipes for both varieties . ( Remenber : asking for recipes is a big no-no here . )
similar to what julio said , the main reason is that typical wheat-based noodles release a lot of starch into the water , which changes the consistency of the soup . the starches can add a dirty colour to the water , but more than that , they can also thicken the soup undesirably ( think of making a roux ) . Finally , if there are leftovers , the noodles can sometimes become completely water logged , making eating it the next day a bit of a soggy experience . That said , with all these considerations there are times when you might add the noodles directly in -- non-starchy noodles ( eg . like rice noodles ) seem to do ok . also parboiling regular pasta before hand seems to help a lot with the starch and can still help you achieve the flavour integration you mentioned .
Yes , it is possible , and in fact usually results in better bread , because the yeast has more time to work and develop flavour . It depends on the recipe , but you should usually reduce the amount of yeast being used to prevent overproofing . You can keep most doughs for a couple of days in the fridge , depending again on the amount of yeast and how often the fridge is opened . Simply mix and knead your dough as normal , cover it tightly with plastic wrap over the bowl , then put it straight in the fridge . You will usually need to allow a couple of hours the next morning for the dough to ' wake up ' and finish a full proof , but if your dough has fully risen in the fridge ( ie it has grown 1.5-2 times ) you can go straight to shaping .
Make the bread all the way through . You can even let the first rise happen . Drop your yeast to about half . Oil a bowl , drop in the dough , spin once to get the ball of dough covered with the oil and then put plastic wrap over the bowl , or a damp cloth ... and plastic wrap . Put the bowl in the refrigerator . The refrigerator slows down the yeast without killing it , which also increases the flavor of the bread ( over night cool low yeast methods for bread are considered the " right " way to make bread ) . In the morning , pull out the bread , press out any large bubbles , roll it around and let it come to life again . I usually punch it down one more time and then let it rise in the pan or on a sheet depending on what kind of bread I am making , then bake as normal . In your case , because you 're doing a stuffed loaf , assuming there is a rise before the stuffing , THAT is the point where you will start the morning . Everything before the pre-stuff rise , the refrigerator IS the pre-stuff rise , pull it out , let it warm , punch it down , stuff , put in the pan , let rise , bake .
As long as you complete the salmon 's cooking in the sauce , it 's fine . If you 're not sure when the salmon 's done by your method , I 'd suggest completing its cooking in the microwave as directed by the package and then adding it to the pasta and sauce just before preparing to serve the dish .
Normally , you would not be doing a final proof overnight -- that is , the proof that you have done to form the loaf . Instead , you would do the first ferment or proof overnight , then form the loaf , let it have its final proof , and then bake it . The dough wo n't be wasted , but you do n't want to bake a formed loaf that has over-proofed and fallen . This is because the gluten network will have collapsed and you will have a very poor structure and strange texture . You will need to reknead the dough , form the loaf , and reproof it : Per <URL> , you can almost certainly just punch the dough down , and let it proof again . It may actually have an improved flavor . <URL> concurs : Using your fingertips , gently punch down the over-proofed dough and reshape it into a ball , then allow it to proof again for the recommended amount of time although it warns your final loaf may be about 20 % smaller .
There 's a reason so many recipes say " salt to taste " : there 's no single answer . Most of the time , we use close to 0.5 % salt by weight ( so 1kg food has 5g or 1 teaspoon of salt ) , but " close to " leaves plenty of wiggle room about what exactly is best . Different people have different tastes . What 's perfectly salted for one person may be oversalted or undersalted for another . Different dishes need different ratios too . Some things are supposed to taste a bit salty , while some just need a hint to amplify other flavors . Some ingredients need more salt to balance them than others . Sure , you can get approximate starting points , e.g. <URL> , <URL> , <URL> ( with tons of variation - that 's a couple random recipes ) . So very roughly , 1kg of food often comes with 5 grams of salt ( 1 teaspoon ) with exceptions ranging up to 10 grams ( 2 teaspoons ) . But your best bet is always going to be to find a good recipe for the specific dish you 're making , and possibly adjust it if you know your preferences lean one way or another . Failing that , when cooking something improvised or new , or using one of the many recipes that just says " salt to taste " , letting you do what suits you , trust the instincts that you 've developed for your own tastes . If you 're cooking for others , with possibly varying tastes , it gets trickier . For things where salt can be added after the fact , you can use less salt and let everyone individually salt to taste . For things you ca n't mix after cooking , you pretty much have to compromise somewhere in the middle and hope it works for everyone . Beyond that , if you ca n't decide what the right amount of salt is , do n't worry about it . There 's surely a range that works for you , so if two different amounts both taste good , there you are . And if you find yourself disagreeing with someone about what amount of salt results in the best flavor , stop . You probably just have different tastes from the person you 're arguing with .
... as long as it needs to , depending on a wide variety of factors . You can shape it for baking , put it in the fridge , let it rise , pull it out of the fridge and put it in the oven - no warming up time at all . If you are going to punch down/knead/form after it comes out of the fridge , you can do all that cold , and let it rise as long as it needs to before baking - which will depend on the dough and the room temperature . Or you can let the bulk dough warm a while .
In examining sponge cake recipes , I 've noticed that some call for adding the melted butter with the flour . Some call for adding it afterwards . The important thing is to fold in that butter in a way that preserves the network of bubbles that was created while whipping your eggs ( unsure if your recipe called for whipping whole eggs with sugar or yolks with sugar and egg whites separately , but both will be creating a bubble structure integral to letting your cake rise ) . <URL> mentions that folding in flour helps to preserve that network ( as long as you do n't overhandle ) . If you over handle while folding - and you may have tipped it over the line when adding butter - you will destroy that bubble network and your cake wo n't rise as you 'd like . It 's also possible to under-handle , which will result in only a thin layer of sponge on top with a thick buttery cake underneath .
Do you weigh your flour ? If not , that is the one change that you can make that will make this problem go away . Most of baking , particularly at the commercial level , is based on ratios by weight . While there will be some minor differences in the amount of moisture in 10 ounces of flour based on the humidity , how much flour packs into a cup can vary a lot on humidity , how much you 've fluffed or sifted the flour first , whether you scoop or sprinkle ... you get the idea . If you do n't weigh your flour when you bake , then there are lots of possible problems that could have occurred that may or may not have had anything to do with the humidity . The only other " seat of the pants " solution is to know your recipe so well that if you notice that there is a problem , you 'll catch it early . Third rise is a little late to be adding moisture , so you would have had to have noticed the problem at the beginning . Weighing your flour and water solves many baking problems and makes you look like a pro . Since you are weighing , then " knowing your recipe and adjusting on the fly " seems to be the only real answer . I checked around and even <URL> In the situation you described I might have added a bit of water at the third rise , then let it have another rise . Another thought is that , possibly , the air being so dry caused the tops of your rolls to dry out some , so they were n't flexible and you did n't get any oven spring . A spritz of warm water across the top of the rolls during final rise and , indeed , in the oven ( I do it with my sourdough loaves , for instance ) helps the bread skin to be loose enough to not inhibit the initial oven spring .
A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread . If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads wo n't raise much . You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens . The more temperature you can give it the better . Another possible factor may be the yeast . Are you waiting enough ? Are you using enough ? Like temperature , more yeast and longer fermentation times ca n't go wrong .
You 're going to have to start over with new chocolate . I 'm sorry to say it but there 's no way to remove the salt from the chocolate .

What makes pineapples cause a burning / itchy feeling in the mouth ?
Human skin contains oils which aid in blocking out the absorption of chemicals which would harm or irritate the skin . Those oils contain proteins . Pineapple contains a chemical compound called <URL> which has the ability to break down these proteins . This is bad , because it can then act on the skin itself ( which is also comprised of protein molecules ) . On top of that , pineapple is high in citric acid . The tingling/itching/burning sensation you describe is no doubt the result of both of these things acting upon the skin at the same time . Understandably , eating pineapple with ( or after ) meat high in oil content ( such as pork at a luau ) will mitigate against these effects . Since there 's no escaping this problem through the use of cutlery , there must have been some other factor at play to which you did n't make attribution at the time . In other words , some other factor was involved in slowing down or preventing the appearance of the undesired effects , such as the one I mentioned above . In the old plantation South there 's a tradition which involves giving pineapple as a gift to guests who are on the verge of overstaying their welcome . No doubt this is because the remarkable sweetness of pineapple is , quite soon enough , followed by a predictable unpleasantness . On a side note regarding the acidity of pineapple , find <URL> an entertaining blog entry as to whether pineapple is or is n't a citrus fruit ( from which the pictures above and below were obtained ) .
There 's an old children 's story about making Stone Soup . In it , a penniless begger offers to teach people how to make his favorite recipe : soup , made from a stone ! He boils some water and drops a stone in , and while it 's " cooking " , keeps mentioning offhand things like " It 'd go great with some carrots " or " Celery would be lovely in this " . The townspeople rush off and get celery , carrots , potatoes , onions , and the like to add to the soup , until eventually , they 've made proper soup in his pot along with the stone . So basically , the whole " stone soup " thing was a clever con game by which the begger can eat for free ( or , in kinder versions than the one I recall , to trick the townspeople into learning a lesson about sharing ) . The stone adds nothing to the soup .
Try heating the cream and milk to just below a simmer . Right before adding the milk mixture to the yolks whisk the sugar , vanilla , and eggs together . Pour the hot milk mixture into eggs very slowly . It 's best to strain it through a fine strainer . If you use vanilla bean make sure to add it after straining it . Let cool a little before putting it into the fridge . It should be cold before making the ice cream . It 's not necessary to fully temper ice cream base like crème anglaise .
So with gravy , you are talking about a scorched taste . Once you smell it , it is probably too late to salvage it . If you want to try , the best course of action is to remove it from the heat ( obviously ) and carefully ladle off as much of the top of the pan as you can , leaving the scorched part on the bottom . Then taste what you ladled off and see if it is really edible . In my experience , people try to convince themselves that the scorched flavor is n't really there , but it is , and once it is , all is lost .
There are two main types of charcoal , briquettes and hard lump . The first comes in preformed pieces , so they are all the same size and include a filler material . They will sometimes also have lighter fluid in them already and be " easy start " or something similar . Hard lump is just charcoal from hardwoods with no filler . These will usually be in all kinds of shapes and look like " natural " pieces of wood ( albeit in charcoal form ) . Hard lump is easy to light , burns hotter , and leaves much less ash than briquettes . It also has a better flavor . I strongly recommend hard lump charcoal . Wood is usually used to provide smoke as a primary function rather than heat . Smoking on your grill gives a lovely smokey flavor ( d'uh ) . The standard way to use wood is to soak it in water for a period of time prior to cooking . Packages will often say to soak for an hour , and that 's ok with wood chips which are very small ( but I recommend longer ) , but it is n't good for anything larger . I generally soak wood for at least 18 hours . Wood also comes in various sizes , from very small chips ( slightly larger than a coin ) to large chunks bigger than a fist . The smaller the chips , the less heat they provide and the faster they burn up . These are generally better for shorter smoking times . Large chunks can smoke for 12 + hours if they are properly soaked . In both cases , I put the wood on to already burning coals to get them going . You can also use just wood to create your heat , in which case you do not soak the wood . When you hear about woodfire ovens , this is what they do . However , I think this is a hassle as it 's harder to get the wood lit than charcoal and does n't provide as much smoke since you have n't soaked the wood . So it 's really sub-par in my view . The exception is if you are doing low and slow smoking on some types of charcoal grill , you can use a small bed of coals to light large chunks of soaked wood . Once they get smoldering , this becomes the only source of heat as the coals go out . They smolder hot enough to get new wood going if you find you need more . Great for 12 hour smoking at 200F for Boston Butt or Brisket . In terms of wood , you want hard woods with low amounts of resin / sap . No glue , nails , etc. . It wants to be natural . This is a <URL> of types of wood and the smoke they produce . Common woods for BBQ in the SE US are hickory , mesquite , and cedar . I 've used old wine barrel chunks which have a really nice flavor , and also bits of rosemary branch ( thick from a large plant ) which did n't turn out as well as I 'd hoped . You can even use the shells of nuts like pecans . This is really a question of seeing what 's readily available and experimenting with your own personal taste . You can also use wood with a gas grill by putting it in a smoking box or tin foil with holes in it , and placing directly on the heating element . Wood chips work best for this . I 've never had much luck with this though . It 's hard to get the chips smoking and , more importantly , gas grills do n't have the airflow through them to properly move smoke over the food . I switched to charcoal pretty quickly and a <URL> about two years ago , and I 've never looked back .
No , it wo n't be different . It is , however , a bit harder . The issues are mainly : It 's harder to get the heat away from the food . So you end up cooking with some direct heat . This can be avoided by using a small amount of well soaked , large wood chunks and get them smoking with some normal charcoal . You should also use indirect heat by stacking the chunks on one side of the grill . If you use wood chips , this wo n't work . They burn too fast and need too much of an ignition source . Heat insulation is n't very good . The walls are thin and you have to remove the whole lid to tend your food . The heat dissipation can be a real issue for long low and slow recipes . Smokers either tend to be well insulated ( brick or ceramic ) or have small doors so you can access your food from the side . Adding fuel can be a pain . It 's made easier if you have a grill surface that is hinged . If you do n't , I 'd suggest getting one if you are seriously considering smoking . It makes adding fuel much easier . Of course , adding fuel causes the above heat dissipation issues , so add fuel as infrequently as possible . That said , I smoked for years on a Webber grill , and it worked just fine . I did , however , upgrade to a <URL> at the first available opportunity . The results are more consistent and the process is much easier . But you 'll be fine getting started with the webber .
What I look for in a good mixer are : A comfortable grip ( I 'm sure we 've all have painful wrists after whisking up eggs whites or similar ) Well made , sturdy parts . ( some whisks are strong others are just thin wire . ) Variable speed control The Watt rating . To answer your No. 2 question , watts are important . They measure how much power the machine uses . Higher watts will mean the machine does more of the work and your wrist does less of the work . The cheapest machines on the market are only good for whipping light foods like cream and mayonnaise . If you plan on mixing up heavy fruit cakes or bread doughs , you should choose a higher wattage machine . Paying for a good quality machine , if you can afford it , will save you money in the end . My mother has had the same hand mixer for over 35 years . She paid for a good one and it lasted . I however , like you , opted for a low price machine because I was on a budget , I am now on my third and this time I bought a sturdier model and I am much more satisfied with it . If I 'd bought the better machine at first , I 'd have saved myself # 50 or so over the time .
The big missing thing in your description ( fat , salt , smoke ) is umami . You can see this in bacon-flavored products . For example , <URL> ( click on a " nutritional info " link ) contains monosodium glutamate . So if you want to make something bacon-flavored , short of using bacon ( and possibly draining away a lot of fat ) , you 're generally going to be looking for source of umami ; see <URL> or <URL> . Also , bacon is definitely not acidic , and perhaps slightly sweet . This means , for example , tomatoes are probably not a good way to get the umami , and that whatever you do , you might try adding a tiny touch of sugar to bring out the flavor a little more . Things like shitake mushrooms and nori seem like better flavor matches . ( If you 've had <URL> this should n't be too surprising . )
I have been told that cedar , white and yellow pine , and many other variaties are safe in normal quantities and have high vitamin content . Some have supposed medicinal effect for headaches , such as cedar . My advice is to look up " tea " or " infusion " with each type of needle you want to try so you can avoid a poisonous concoction . As for white pine , I have made delicious tea for breakfast and for the canteen with it while camping and have survived so far . It goes quite well with wild mint .

The biggest indicator I 've found of quality dried pasta is how rough it feels when you rub it between your fingers . Compare Barilla and De Cecco spaghetti to see what I mean . The best brands use copper dies when extruding their pasta and this lends a rougher texture that will hold sauce better than plastic or teflon extruded pastas .
This often happens when the tomatoes used are not fully mature . Although apparently are completely red , the parties less red lighten the sauce . Alternatively , depends on the quality of tomatoes . The Native Americans tomatoes were yellow ( hence the Italian name " golden apple " = " pomo d'oro " = " pomodoro " ) . Through the selections have become red . But remaining mixed colors , which are " not red " but " reddish " . Or yellow - orange . In the United States , the orange tomatoes are sold seasonally in the markets of agricultural producers : it is " heirloom tomatoes " or " tomatoes tradition " ( heirloom tomatoes ) , ie those that were cultivated before 1800 and which for centuries delighted the palates of our ancestors . The study conducted by the chemist Betty J. Burry and biologist Betty K. Ishida has shown that orange tomatoes contain more lycopene ( an important antioxidant molecule ) of the common red tomatoes . The difference is due to the chemical form of lycopene in red tomatoes that occurs in the trans form while in the orange tomatoes in tetra-cis form . Research conducted in California and in Ohio ( USA ) have shown that the form of the tetra-cis lycopene is more efficiently absorbed by the body compared to the trans form . The research group has also assessed the oxidative damage : lycopene and other antioxidant molecules , in fact , may protect both the cells and the essential fatty acids from oxidation . Using a procedure known as " TBARS assay " the researchers noted that oxidative damage is decreased by consuming tomato sauce and tomato sauce red orange , but the damage reduction was greater in the diet that included the consumption of orange tomatoes . ( * ) <URL> Data di pubblicazione : 05/07/2012 Autore : Emanuela Fontana Copyright : www.freshplaza.it Personally I can say that in the diets of very young children less red tomatoes ( fresh , peeled and seeded ) are preferred , because they are more digestible and light . PS A very prolonged cooking of the sauce , on the contrary , gives a very dark and indigestible sauce ( tomato paste ) which is used more as a seasoning for cooking of regional recipes . Is never used on pasta , as the taste is altered and too strong . EDIT Yes it happens very often , and we all start with deep red tomatoes , san marzano and so on . But often the salsa comes oranges . <URL> that it comes from blending tomatoes after mixing with oil . But I never put so much oil to think that it could depend by oil . And it happens to me too . And the other persons disagree too . Everyone does buy san marzano tomatoes ( or similar ) , very mature and red . But when you cut them , inside they can be hard and a bit pale , not really red . And flavonoid and lycopene are into any tomato , just in different or more or less visible quantity . ( flavonoyd becomes from latin : flavus = yellow or blond / leukos is from greek = white ) . To me , since the original DNA is yellow , it could be that some genetic trait has remained , not limited to only one quality but in general the whole botanical species , and sometimes emerges . The major dietary source of lycopene is represented by the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) from which it takes its name , and its derivatives , in which represents 60 % of the total content in carotenoids . The lycopene content is influenced by the level of maturation of the tomato , has been calculated that in fact red and ripe tomatoes are present 50 mg / kg of lycopene . But of course , i can wrong . <URL> / <URL> <URL> " The date of his arrival in Europe in 1540 when the Spaniard Hernán Cortés returned to his homeland and brought the specimens , but its cultivation and propagation waited until the second half of the seventeenth century . Arrives in Italy in 1596 but only later , finding favorable climatic conditions in the south of the country , you have the color change of its color from the original and distinctive gold color , which gave its name to the plant , the current red , thanks to selections and subsequent grafts . " EDIT II @ MandoMando Yes , I agree . What you say agrees with my experience . I must say that it is false that " many often " happens , it just happens sometimes . Normally remain red . But I never use electrical equipment , only hand devices , like these : The first is precisely for the tomato sauce . The second pass any cooked vegetables . But if you want , you can tray the ancient recipe , that I use only when I have guests and I want to offer some pasta with a fresh made sauce . You must blanch the tomatoes in boiling water until the skin breaks down ( usually 20-30 seconds ) . Then remove the tomatoes from the water and peel them right away , still intact and hot . This is the method used by our grandmothers who were canned . After removing the skin , you can put the whole tomatoes into the jars and sterilize them . Or you can make a sauce with olive oil , salt and herbs ( as I do ) or with other ingredients such as carrots , celery or whatever . I do not think that modern industries for storage of tomato sauce stil
" Cream " is most certainly süße Sahne . A modifier gives you knowledge about the fat percentage . Half and half refers to 20 % fat , which you could mix yourself if needed , but few recipes are that sensitive , so you can use milk ( Vollmilch , 3.5 ) or whipping cream ( Schlagsahne , 30 to 35 percent ) . The only problem is double cream . That 's Konditorsahne , at inner 40 percent , and not available retail in Germany . If it has to be whipped , you have to find a high-ish Schlagsahne ( 33 instead of 30 ) , drizzle some Sahnesteif , and cross your fingers . If the recipe needed a cultured product , it would have specified Greek yogurt ( 10 ) or sour cream ( 10 to 20 , use saure Sahne or Schmand for that ) . Creme fraiche is not used in traditional American recipes , as it is a rare and expensive imported product . You can use it in a recipe calling for sour cream , obtaining a product with a richer mouthfeel and less tanginess . The " what type of cream is suitable " question is unrelated to terminology and should be asked separately . Briefly , the answer is " all of them " .
I 've found a <URL> on Walmart.com that has some interesting tidbits . For functionality alone , looks like a glass jar should do the job well . Something like this would have an advantageous shape to make cookies easier to reach , and the jar less prone to falling . One feature you may want to look for specifically would be an hermetic sealing lid , which would help keep moisture in the jar and slow down the drying . Same kind of jar that is often used to store flour , sugar , coffee , beans , etc. . Is light sensitivity a factor ? I do n't think it would be , in most cases , unless you kept your cookies in an area that is heavily lit by the sun .
Some answers to your questions , based on my experience with wild sourdough starter in San Francisco : 70-80F is the ideal temperature range . Below that the yeast incubates very slowly ; above it , the starter will tend to ferment alcoholically . Do not leave the starter in direct sun . UV light is a powerful sterilizing agent . An organic , cold-processed ( i.e. stone milled ) flour works best , because it will retain the maximum amount of its own wild yeast on it . Cheeseboard : Collective Works likes to start with rye flour and gradually add bread flour , but they do n't give a tested reason for this . I have never heard of using fruit juice in a sourdough starter . I would be dubious about it ; you 'd be likely to end up with vinegar . Sugar is unnecessary for sourdough starters . Use purified water ; chlorine/chloramine/ozone in tap water can kill your starter . Finally , starters incorporating milk are fridge-only starters ( as opposed to flour-and-water starters , which can be kept at room temperature if split frequently ) which depend on the bacteria and lactic acid from the fermenting milk for part of their sourness . They can be effective , and actually a good choice if you live somewhere with weak/poor wild yeast . Note that you can not transform a milk sourdough into a water sourdough , and using up 2 cups of milk every 2 weeks is more expensive than 2 cups of filtered water .
what i used to do for popping whole cubes is-take out the ice tray from freezer . Put it under running tap of normal temp water ( for 2-4 secs ) from both sides of ice tray , from top and bottom back of ice tray . then twist the trays to remove ice . It pops out shattered ice less frequently .
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
Smell . Really , this is the most reliable criterion for practically any fruit . Flavor contains both taste and smell . For a strawberry , you want a fragrant smell together with enough sweetness . For both , the berry has to be ripe enough . If it was picked underripe , it wo n't smell good enough yet , and it will also be hard and sour . If it was picked long ago and is not fresh any more , it will have lost the more volatile components of its fragrance . So ripe , fresh strawberries smell great . I have had occasions when I entered a supermarket to quickly buy one thing , aimed at the correct aisle , but when the smell of good strawberries reached me near the produce , I turned and added a pack of them . I have never been disappointed with such strawberries . Also , if you smell the slightest hint of mold , fermentation , or foulness , you know they may not keep even one night . Another sign is that a ripe strawberry will be red through and through . A strawberry picked underripe will be white or even slightly greenish at the top . It does n't taste good then . But this is a negative sign , because not all red strawberries taste good . Do n't ever go by shape . The tastiest sort of strawberries my grandparents grew produced ugly , lumpy strawberries of a light , slightly orange color . They also had a few rows of a sort which produced perfectly conical , deep red strawberries , they looked like an advertisement - but they were hard and dry , and did n't have much aroma . Probably , there are some strawberries which both look and taste good - just do n't think that looks or color predict a good strawberry , because they are independent . And of course , any strawberries which have visible mold or fouled spots are not good any more . You can usually also recognize overripened strawberries in their appearance , but I do n't know how to describe it well . They just look old .
Since I could see this being a cooking/food science question if you really wanted to play with this property of liquids in drinks , perhaps a quick answer is in order . This really would be quite well-suited to the physics stackexchange , though - this is a concept that 's quite describable by physics . To follow up on Sobachatina 's comment , the property you 're in fact looking for is surface tension ( which is reduced by surfactants like detergent ) . If you want to compare liquids , be they water , water + detergent , milk ( water + stuff ) , or even alcohol or oil , you just want to compare their surface tensions . Surface tension is in fact a measurable quantity , with dimensions of force per length . There are a couple of equivalent definitions : when increasing the area of the surface by a small amount , the amount of work ( energy ) required per area increase ; or when the surface is bounded by a line ( imagine a bubble film and string ) , the amount of force on that line per length . You should note that surface tension depends on the fluids on both sides of the surface . Most commonly we talk about surface tension of an arbitrary liquid against air , but surface tension against glass , plastic , or metal is commonly visible in your vessels and utensils , and surface tension between various fluids is of course visible when you try something like mixing oil and water . As for actual examples , Wikipedia has a <URL> with surface tensions of various fluids against air . Among them are a few potentially relevant for cooking : acetic acid + water ( though stronger than normal vinegar ) , ethanol + water , a very concentrated sucrose solution , and water . Note that the addition of alcohol or acetic acid substantially reduces surface tension of water ! If anyone can follow up with more data on surface tension of liquids commonly seen in cooking , I 'd be very interested ! It 's also possible to measure surface tension at home , though I 've never done it , and I 'm not sure how accurate you could get .
Given that the frying of a cube of bread is a test for oil temperature , I suspect one or both of two things are happening here - 1 The oil is not at the correct temperature when the cubes of bread are dropped in it ; and 2 The oil temperature drops when you add too many cubes in at the same time so some get burnt and some end up soggy for the single time duration you 're cooking them for . Suggested solutions - 1 Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature for the level of browness you want the cubes of bread to be fried to . 2 Do n't over-crowd the pan . Fry them in batches , ensuring the oil temperature rises back to the correct one before the next batch is fried .

Have you ever eaten something so hot it made you cry and felt like it 'd never stop burning ? Given what you 've said you 've tried , this thing is probably 10-100x as hot as the kind of pepper that would do that to you . Please be careful . In any case , pretty much the sole point of a pepper like this is to try to be the hottest thing in the world . The amount of capsaicin is incredibly huge compared to the amount of other flavor in it ; you 're basically never going to taste anything but heat from it . So if you want to actually use it , just assume that the only thing you can do with it is make something hot . I have a decent heat tolerance and love things with a bit of heat , but I still probably would n't bother . There are plenty of ways to add heat with much less risk of creating something completely inedible . If I really wanted to make use of it , I 'd probably start with a very small quantity in a dish to try to get a sense for the heat level . This means using it in some kind of soup/stew/sauce where you can incrementally add things as you cook , not in something like a cake where you have to just go for it and possibly end up throwing away a whole cake . ( For some peppers I might also try touching it to my tongue first , but I do n't think I 'd recommend that in this case . ) Finally , you can always try to cover it up by using it in a rich , fatty dish , e.g. a sauce with plenty of cream or coconut milk , but honestly , you 'll still be lucky if you can taste anything from the pepper besides the heat .
Some people , and some well known Chef 's ( Micheal Ruhlman , Julia Child ) swear that trussing is necessary . I say that it is not , and that the meat between the thigh and the breast , on a trussed bird , cooks too slowly so that the rest of the bird risks overcooking . I do just the opposite and splay out the legs as much as I can . My two favourite sources for recipes ( Heston Blumenthal , and the cookbook The New Best Recipe ) do not truss for Chicken and I would n't for Turkey either . Unless you are convinced that a trussed bird cooks more evenly , I would say that it is mostly for presentation .
I fill a tall frying pan ( or pot ) with water . Add some white vinegar . Let it come to a boil Add the eggs . Do n't make it too overcrowded Take it out with a flipper or a spoon with holes when they look done .
As I have noted in a couple of other answers , I have worked in the CPG ( Consumer Packaged Goods ) industry for almost 30 years . It is safe to say that there is not a simple answer to this question . There are so many variables that it would be difficult to even go into all of them . Before I go further , let me say that common sense goes a long way . Most food dating falls into three areas : Sell by , best if used by , and an actual expiration date . The one asked about , best if used by , probably has more variables than the others and is much more subjective . First , it depends on the type of product . Is it a dry product , canned/bottled/jarred , or perishable ? Here is a little about each : Dry products such as cereals , grains , crackers - These products vary in how long they will remain good . Keeping them well sealed and stored in a dark , cool environment will extend the time in which they would be considered good . Items such as cereals and crackers tend to get stale and unappetizing in a relatively short time . With those , common sense prevails and if it does n't have the right taste or texture you naturally would n't eat it . Can , jar , and bottle items - Items canned in actual cans can remain good after the best if used by date . However if you see a bulge , leak , etc. the item should be discarded regardless of the date . Food in dented cans should be looked at closely as the dent can cause a break in the seal . Other items such as bottled salad dressing will remain good after the best by date if they are unopened . ( Given the choice of using an unopened bottle past the best by date and one that has been open in the fridge for 6 months , I would go with the unopened bottle . ) For items canned in jars , look at how the food appears , be sure there is a good seal , and smell . Perishable items - Storage conditions are extremely important . Be sure that your refrigerator and freezer are operating at optimum temperatures for keeping items fresh longer . With most dairy products , if stored properly , common sense prevails . If it 's molded , sour , etc. it 's not going to look , smell , or taste good . An exception would be an aged , hard cheese , such as cheddar or parmigiana . You can cut past the mold and use the cheese safely . Many everyday dairy products can remain good well after their best by date . Items dated in-store - Many items are shipped to stores frozen such as heat &amp; eat items found in the deli bunker , branded meat items found in the regular meat case , etc. . In this case , you want to look for the longest dated items . This is because the items come in frozen . When ready to place in a case , the store will take out of the freezer , date it per the manufacturer 's criteria , and place in the case . Dating varies depending on the mfr . It may be one week , two , three , or even longer . ( I have seen dating out up to 35 days on a heat &amp; eat item . If most consumers saw that item in the case and the best by date was a week away , they would assume that it was pretty fresh . When I look at that item I know it has been thawed and sitting there for 4 weeks already ! ) Most of the time " best if used by " dates are of a courtesy or guideline nature rather than a legality . The above information is only a slight overview and demonstrates how subjective this is . In closing , here are a few thing to keep in mind : Use your head . Common sense goes a long way . Remember that all food will deteriorate to an unsafe or undesirable point given enough time . Once product packaging has been opened , deterioration occurs more quickly . For various reasons , food can spoil before the best by date . Proper storage is important for all foods , not only for safety , but for the best quality and flavor . It 's very important to be diligent with all canned items , regardless of whether in a can or jar . Dangerous toxins can develop which ca n't be seen , smelled , or tasted .
South-east Asian cuisine often uses fish heads in stews or steamed . I remember seeing a recipe for fish head stew . Try this one : <URL>
The term " dog " has been used as a synonym for sausage since 1884 and accusations that sausage makers used dog meat to at least 1845 . According to a myth , the use of the complete phrase " hot dog " in reference to sausage was coined by a newspaper cartoonist in 1900 , but there were several earlier references , but no specifics on the origination of the phrase .
Spanish hot chocolate and Italian cioccolata fiorentina both use cornstarch as a thickening agent . Both are used more for dipping or sipping ( churros in the former case ) , however you could easily just use less cornstarch to make it more ' drinkable ' . Try a teaspoon of cornstarch , mixed with a little cold water , added to the milk when you boil it . As Kate Gregory suggests , you could also use full-fat milk , or loads of shaved chocolate .
There are several reasons for adding orange juice : The first is for flavor . The second is to act as an acid . Although in this particular case , the acid is already in the baking powder . All baking powder needs to act as a leavening agent is some kind of liquid . Unless you meant baking soda , in which case an acid is necessary for leavening . The third is to inhibit mold growth . The real reason vitamin C is added is as a dough enhancer , not for gluten development . Since this is a quick bread ( no yeast ) , gluten development is not a main concern . The fourth reason for the orange juice is to make a tender crumb . Because of the fructose found naturally in it . Sugars are added to baked goods as a tenderizing agent . This recipe sounds yummy !
Apply heat . It 's not quite what you were looking for , but it 's probably the only solution that wo n't involve adding chemicals . Basically , a set amount of milk can hold a specific amount of chocolate in suspension . The hotter it is ( below boiling ) , the more it can hold . That 's why as the milk cools , the chocolate it can no longer hold falls to the bottom of the cup . The three options are : Keep it warm , by using a mug warmer ( like Catija suggested ) . If it does n't cool , it wo n't lose the ability to hold the chocolate . Start with less chocolate , that way , it wo n't be too much for the milk when it 's cooling . Obviously , this will affect the flavour . Add chemical additives , like emulsifiers , which will allow the milk to hold more chocolate . As I said at the beginning , I think the best option is the first one . Apply heat .
At Marriott hotel , where I worked for a while , we used similar flakes . Our technique was to add a good splash of boiling water first , incorporate the chocolate flakes by mixing it into a smooth paste ( more or less ) , and only then add hot milk . I guess the idea is that it is much more of a challenge to incorporate a small amount of solid into a large amount of liquid , however if you turn that solid into a paste first , its almost like your mixing two liquids . You 'll find that the same technique is used for making a bachamel sauce . For convenience sake , try using a small amount of hot milk , instead of water . Also , having your liquid boiling might help , which is hard to achieve in a microwave . e.g. when making a classic chocolate sauce which contains butter and cream , the chocolate is only fully dissolved when the liquid is boiled .
Legend has it that the inventor of the ring shaped donut with a hole came up with the idea because he was dissatisfied with the raw centre of regular donuts . <URL> . Having done quite a few doughnut experiments recently , it 's true that having shapes where the distance from the centre to the surface is smaller increases your chances of properly cooked doughnuts . So toroids make sense , but then so would thin cylinders . You can however , fry up donuts will no hole , that are cooked all the way through . Look at Berliners or jam-filled doughnuts .
Short answer : no , there 's no standard scale . First of all , I 'm pretty sure it 's common enough for stoves of varying power to use the same range of numbers . I see an awful lot of stoves that go up to 10 in the US , and I 'm quite confident they 're not all the same . Second , the real property of a stove is its power output , not its temperature . You can clearly see this if you go look at gas stoves - they 're described in units of power ( BTUs in the US , hooray ) . The temperature resulting from a given power will depend greatly on what you 're cooking . A burner with nothing on it will have a much higher temperature than one with a heavy pot of boiling water on it . To a lesser degree , the temperature will also depend on the environment - a cooler room with some air circulation will keep the burner a bit cooler than a warm room with still air . So , if you really want to know what you 're getting , you have to look up the power output of the stove - or failing that , maybe try to measure it yourself .
A vita mix should work pretty well ; maybe you could carefully drag a spatula in the top of the vortex ( nowhere near the blade ! ) to introduce more air . A whisk will be pretty slow going . And then there is a whole other category of foams made in a whipped cream canister . Here is a link to get you started : <URL>
The term " ground red pepper " is ambiguous in English . Things sold under that name in the US have a wide range of heats , and likely are made from multiple varieties of peppers , though I 'd say they 're more commonly hot things like cayenne , or other varieties with somewhat less heat . That said , do n't worry about it too much in these cases . Anything from mild paprika to cayenne would likely fit within what the authors meant , and you 're not going to harm a recipe by increasing or decreasing the heat , or by using a chile powder with a slightly different flavor . Just use something ( or a blend ) that provides the heat level you want , and you 'll be fine .
The antioxidants in blueberries lie in the berries themselves , not in the pesticides residing on their skin . Washing them before freezing means that water freezes on the outside . The water crystals puncture the skins of the berries , changing the texture .
Version B runs the risk of overheating the pan and damaging the coatings on it . I 've always been told to put oil in the pan before heating for that reason - nothing to do with taste . I 'd seriously doubt you could detect any difference in taste .
Here are a few things to be wary of when buying peppers : Wrinkled skin -- it 's a sign that they 're drying out . It should be firm and smooth . Soft areas -- it 's a sign that it 's starting to rot in areas . It should be firm all over . Fuzz near the stem or blossom end -- you ca n't always see outward signs of the fuzzy mold , but if you do , it 'll be right around where the stem attaches , or in the crevice on the other side . Cracks -- it 's a sign that someone 's dropped it , and opens up the possibility of rotting faster Spots -- besides the soft areas , you can get small dots in an area ... it 's a sign of disease . ( I 'm not sure which ; I typically get this when growing my own , do n't see it in the store ) . Holes -- a sign that there 's an insect that 's eaten its way inside . ( again , I see this more on home grown ones ) Things that are n't always a problem : Discoloration : if it 's a green pepper , it might start turning red , yellow or orange . Red peppers might have an area that looks black or brown . So long as that area is n't soft , and the color changes look blended in ( not where it 's an obvious line between colors ) , it 's fine . Weight : you typically want heavier specimens , but some varieties are thinner skinned , and wo n't be as heavy . If you find one that seems abnormally light , compare it to similar sized ones in the display . If they 're all the same , and do n't have wrinkled skin , they 're probably okay . White lines : you typically see this more on hot peppers , but it can happen on bell peppers , too . They 'll be roughly parallel to each other , along the line from stem to blossom . It 's a sign that they got a sudden burst of water while growing , which caused the skin to crack ( but then heal ) . Folds : some varieties of peppers are more balloon-like , while others may have a few folds ; so long as it 's still smooth skin ( not wrinkled ) , relatively heavy for its size , and you do n't see fuzz in the folds , it 's not an issue .
Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently . See <URL> . Do not at any point cough into your hands . Coughing into a sleeve is considered less likely to transmit germs . To really prevent breathing on your food and potentially transmitting germs that way , you could consider wearing a mask . Personally I 'd consider the last step optional ( and the other two not ) .
An espresso machine usually needs to push water at somewhere between 8 and 15 bar pressure , which is quite a lot . And since it is the high-pressure components that are key to how they work , it is the quality and durability of these that tends to set the price point . The quality of the pump varies from a device intended to be used for two or three cups once a week , all the way to professional machines designed to produce thousand of cups a day , month after month . This is why domestic machines are usually quite clear that they are for domestic use only : they simply can not cope with the duty cycle of any more than that . Many domestic espresso machines will turn themselves off if they are used to make too many cups in one session - quite simply , they overheat . It sounds like one you bought is one intended for occasional use . My advice is to visit a couple of retailers that have staff dedicated to selling espresso machines . They will , of course , try to sell you " their " brand , but they will also recognise when someone needs a domestic unit designed for daily use as opposed to one just for special occasions . As a bonus , you generally get what you pay for with espresso machines . The more expensive domestic ones usually really do last much longer .
Preheating is mainly needed for breads and anything that has a short cooking time ( < 15 mins or so ) . I do n't bother preheating when I 'm roasting something for a longer time . If you 're setting a timer , I assume this is something that will take a while to cook , so I would n't worry about preheating .

Are my capers still good ?
I dug around a bit , and most people seem to agree that this is normal caper behaviour , though no one has made any real assertion as to why , other than that capers have varying density , and the brine does not . The usual tests for freshness ( do they look/smell/taste okay ? ) are recommended . Brined capers should last ~ 9 months from the time the jar is opened , or 3 years in a dark pantry unopened .
Nigel Slater 's book <URL> might be useful to you . He devotes each chapter to a separate vegetable , and for each one he includes : Specific recipes Discussion of different varieties Comments on different cooking techniques Comments on effective seasonings and pairings There 's also some discussion of his attempts ( successful or not ) at growing different vegetables in his own garden .
Whenever you want grill marks . Or , perhaps , if you want to ensure fat rendered out of meat drips away . Why you would want to do this I do not know .
Certainly yes . In fact , aged egg whites can whip better - sensitive applications like macarons will frequently prescribe holding the separated egg whites for a day or two before using .

There is no substitute for salt . Sorry . It has effects on the tastebuds and the body that can not be replicated . However ! They can be approached to a degree that most people will find interchangeable . Acids can mimic the flavour-enhancing qualities of salt in a big way . The more acid you have in a dish , the less salt you will need . Beware of going too far , of course , as too much acid is just unpleasant and will need salt to counterbalance . Heat -- as in capsaicin , chili peppers -- can produce much the same effect . Echoing papin 's information above ; NA and K ( sodium and potassium ) exist in balance in the body . Too far in one direction and you have a heart attack ( too much K ) , too much in the other and ( if memory serves ; I could be wrong ) you essentially drown ( or is it edema ? I ca n't remember ) . If avoiding sodium is related to a health concern , please speak to your primary healthcare provider before adjusting your diet in this way .
While this is n't a substitute , you can get better deals on saffron and make it go further . First of all , do not buy it at a normal grocery store . It tends to be very expensive there . Instead go to a farmer 's market ( not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church , but rather the big store ) . I 'd imagine most major cities will have one or more . Atlanta has at least 4 . Saffron is much , much cheaper at the farmer 's market . Second , thoroughly grind the saffron before using it . This will help the saffron more completely flavor a dish , requiring a smaller amount of saffron to get the flavor . A quick Google suggested Tumeric , but I ca n't really imagine that working , nor did a lot of the comments on the internets .
We store them at room temperature . If only for 3-4 few days : under plastic wrap or in the microwave . If about a week : in sealed Tupperware to keep the humidity from getting to them . I do n't know if the humidity is an issue for everyone or only for those of us in a very humid climate . The refrigerator will make them last even longer but they wo n't taste as fresh after refrigeration . Freezer : 4-6 months . The absolute best place I 've found to store brownies though is in my stomach .
Bitterness can come from underripe fruit ( although a lot of times they 'll just be sour or less flavorful ) , lack of juice is usually something that has been stored too long and dried out . A ripe mandarin or clementine should be firm but not hard with a good , bright citrusy fragrance . Rubbing your finger on the skin should impart some citrus oil ( unless it 's waxed of coated ... ) I think usually the smell is the best guideline for flavor , although I have still sometimes had a fruit that smells great and tastes pretty bland . But I think usually if they are really fragrant that 's a good sign . The skin should be somewhat loose-feeling . If the skin is tight on the fruit , it is either not ripe or it is drying out ( or it 's not a mandarin or clementine ) . Do n't squeeze the fruit and bruise it , but when you pick it up , there should be a bit of give in the skin . Mandarins and clementines have very thin skins , but these still have the sort of spongy texture of other citrus . Because they are thin , they dry out quickly . It 's hard to describe what drying citrus skin feels like - progressively rougher and harder than fresh , eventually turning into a crisp and brittle almost stony layer . I 'm sure you would notice far before it gets to that stage , but it 's not going to happen overnight . ( But the fruit should n't be squishy or have soft spots , that is generally spoilage or damage . ) It should not feel dry and hard . A juicy citrus will feel heavy for its size , although for really small ones that 's kind of hard to judge . One more thing to note , though , is that most of the time , the whole batch of whatever type of fruit at the grocery store or at a particular market stall at any given time will very likely come from the same source . While there might be some better and some worse ones , overall they 'll probably be pretty similar , unless you can clearly see that some are older or from a different source . If you 're not sure about a batch , just buy a couple and then get more after you see that they 're good . ( And if you find some great ones , buy a lot and freeze some for juice for later . )
Basically anything that 's liquid . Fruit is very common , but we 've also done herbs ( mint and sage specifically ) . I 've also had vegetable spheres like pureed peas and beets as separate spheres . At restaurants , I 've had beer sphere 's served with pretzel ( at Cyrus ) and I 've seen cointreau spheres used in a drink . They pop like caviar , and that 's what releases the flavor , so they either need to be quite large or have a strong flavor . Otherwise the taste is lost and you 're left with just the ( fun ) " texture " . It also often helps to use some food coloring if your liquid is n't a strong color . With small spheres , light colors will disappear and you 're left with relatively transparent spheres . I 'd also recomend trying reverse spherification ( i.e. mix calcium chloride with your liquid and then drop in to an alginate bath ) , as this does n't use your flavored liquid to make the shell , leaving you with more " pop " . So look for a strong flavor and a nice pairing . Make it easy to get the spheres in to your mouth . It 's easier if the spheres are on another piece of food , as cutlery will often break the spheres . The best thing about spheres is presentation and the caviar pop , so use that experience and look to your advantage and feature it in whatever you 're serving . Here 's my <URL> revolving around spherification .

I 'm a coeliac from Australia and so my tips come from my experience here , but they should hopefully be useful regardless . The first thing I suggest is joining your local society which can be invaluable in terms of support , information and even training . The training covers for example how to read ingredient lists to determine whether something is gluten free by ingredient . As a general rule you need to avoid products containing [ wheat , barley , rye , malts and triticale ] [ 1 ] . There are a few exceptions such as glucose syrup , caramel colour and dextrose derived from wheat where the ingredients are so highly processed that they contain no detectable [ gluten ] [ 2 ] . Cross contamination and hidden sources of gluten can make it hard to ensure a gluten free diet . In my experience the hardest replacements are the bread based ones . They generally do not come close to the texture and taste of traditional breads . Baking your own bread may be the best option using gluten free bread mixes . Eating out can become a bit of chore because many restaurants use gluten containing products such as sauces and fillers . I recommend contacting the restaurant beforehand . The following products are some of the better gluten free alternatives I 've found ( could n't post links because I do n't have enough rep ) : Zehnder Bread San Remo Pasta BuonTempo Pasta Schar Products Neumarkter Lammsbräu beer References : [ 1 ] <URL> [ 2 ] <URL>
The problem is that there are different types of olive oil that are used for dramatically different purposes . A high quality ' cold pressed extra virgin ' oil often has fruity notes that are destroyed when you heat it , but is great for drizzling over things at the last minute , or cold applications such as salad dressings ... but note that the US labeling laws are lax , so something labeled as ' extra virgin ' in the US may not qualify as such in Europe . For most cooking , I use a good grade olive oil ( ' virgin ' , but not ' extra virgin ' ) for cooking with , not the extremely expensive stuff . For frying , there 's ' extra light ' olive oil which has a higher smoke point but little to no flavor on its own . It 's refined to such a point that you might be better off just going with any neutral flavored oil ( canola/rape , soy , corn , etc. ) Price depends on a lot of things , and a lot of it 's marketing and worthless -- if you can , I 'd look for other signs of quality ... like if there 's a packing date . Older oil is more likely to have deteriorated , and in a worst case , have gone rancid . ( more likely if it 's in a clear glass bottle ... if you 're buying large amounts of oil , keep it out of sunlight , or even better , buy it in a can ) Note that packing dates can also be cheated -- they might press the oil , then hold it for months before it 's actually bottled for sale . Also beware of ' blended oils ' . This is when they cut olive oil with something less expensive , but still try to pass it off as ' olive oil ' . ' Imported from Italy ' is another suspect label , as it might be foreign olives that were sent to Italy before being imported . ( but there 's nothing wrong with non-Italian olives ... the Greeks and Spanish make some great olive oils , and we 're starting to see more <URL> ) . ... Also note that olive oil can be classified like wines -- some companies might press a single variety of olive ( eg , Kalamata , Castelvetrano ) , which can have dramatically different flavors . They might be fruity , grassy , buttery , or even peppery . Regions can also have an impact , as some areas press olives while green , and others wait until they 're black . I wo n't get into these , as that 's more a matter of personal taste .
It is absolutely untrue and very dangerous to think that " if it looks OK , and smells OK , it must be OK . " If that were the case , food poisoning would be very rare . Food that we can sense is spoiled rarely causes illness . For one thing what you do n't eat ca n't hurt you , and people generally wo n't eat food that looks or smells spoiled . But less obviously , much of what causes spoilage that we can taste , see or smell is actually fairly harmless to humans . Spoilage and rancidity are terms that are often used interchangeably , but rancidity is actually a specific kind of spoilage , caused by the relatively harmless oxidation of fats which is unrelated to any kind of bacteria or other microorganism . It 's just a function of time , temperature , oxygen , and light . Fancy dried cured meats get a fair amount of their special flavor from controlled rancidity . Molds and yeasts cause food to spoil , but are also used in controlled ways to create flavor . Dairy cultures are bacteria , and bacteria plays a major role in fermentation . What causes illness and death are often things that we ca n't taste , see , or smell . Salmonella , E. coli and C. botulinum are usually undetectable by our senses . Mishandled food that has been heated to temperatures far hotter than is necessary to kill any and all dangerous organisms can still kill if those organisms have produced chemical toxins or deadly spores . We usually ca n't sense those either . That 's why the " rules " exist . You need to take care to keep food out of the dreaded " danger zone " . Foods that are considered unsafe unless cooked to a specific temperature ARE unsafe unless cooked to that temperature ( although government recommendations in that matter are often overly conservative , there is room there for assessing your own risk ) . Preserved foods must have appropriate acid , salinity , sugar or other tested preservatives . Stored foods must be kept at the proper temperature . Dried foods must be dried correctly . Canning procedures rules seem overly strict . They are not . Learn the rules , disobey them at your peril . There is a lot of good information here under the <URL> tag . We are not making this stuff up . The <URL> " estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans ( or 48 million people ) get sick , 128,000 are hospitalized , and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases . " That 's just in the US where food handlers ( home and professional ) are mostly educated in basic food hygiene and just about everyone has access to a refrigerator . The worldwide figures are staggering .
Yes , it certainly is safe to eat them , it happens all the time . They wo n't last quite as long in the fridge as ones which do n't crack , but as long as you eat them in a couple of days you are fine . They may look like nuclear mutants but they will taste the same .
I ca n't give you a list with good substitutes for common dishes . First , I doubt that my common dishes are your common dishes . Second , it would be too long . If you want to substitute alcohol in a dish , you have to understand what it does in the specific recipe , and then use your imagination to think of an ingredient which will have a similar effect . Alcohol has mostly three effects in a dish . First , it is a liquid , and its bulk must be considered . In recipes where the ratio is important ( mainly batters ) , if you leave out the alcohol , you have to add some other liquid to maintain the original ratio . Second , alcohol adds its own taste . A small part of it is the taste of the ethanol itself , but cooks mostly use beverages with a strong taste of their own as a component of the dish . Third , alcohol is a solvent . It can get more taste out of your other ingredients than pure water . ( Ever wondered why vanilla extract is alcohol based ? ) This is especially important in recipes which give it a longer time to interact with the other ingredients , such as the slow boiling of a coq au vin . Depending on which of these effects are important to you , you have different options to act . Just leave it out . If you are n't baking , you probably are n't that interested in the ratio . And if you expect the result to taste well enough without the alcohol , the simplest solution is to skip it . Use a liquid substitute . This is especially important in baking and confectionery , but you can decide to do it in any case . Depending on the original kind of alcohol and taste you are aiming for , you can use pure water , a liquid trying to stay close to the original taste , or a liquid which gives a completely new taste profile to the whole recipe . For example , in a sweet dish like your foster dessert you can use caramel dissolved in apple juice instead of dark rum if you want to mimic the original , or cherry juice to create a cherry-banana dessert . Common liquids to use are sugared water ( when the original recipe had a sweet liquor ) , a fruit or vegetable juice , a herbal infusion , clear stock , or pickle liquid . Do n't be afraid to use more than one liquid to get closer to the effect you want . If the recipe already uses some other liquid , you can just use more of it . Use a spice or condiment . This is when your main concern is the taste , and you do n't care about the missing liquid . Again , you could be trying to mime the original closely ( using orange zest instead of Grand Marnier ) , or just using any strong spice so the dish does n't become bland . It is up to you . A special case is to use only a taste " essence " : for some beverages common in baking , you can buy a propylene-glycol based condiment which approximates their aroma . Rum essence is widely available , but I 'm quite sure that the whiskey flavored ice cream in the supermarket is n't full of real whiskey . Leave the alcohol in the recipe ( possibly reduced ) . Obviously impossible in some circumstances , like a wine sauce , but quite feasible in others . You do n't have to drown the dessert in rum and flambe it . If you use 20 ml of rum per 1000 g of other ingredients , a child who eats a normal serving ( 150 g ) will consume somewhat less than 1.2 g of ethanol if no alcohol at all is cooked out - and in practice , if the recipe calls for cooking , maybe half of the alcohol will evaporate , and a very young child will probably not eat the whole serving . I do n't think that such miniscule amounts are problematic for children . Of course , you are free to combine these solutions in any way you see fit , depending on which effect ( s ) of alcohol you are trying to imitate . For example , if a baking recipe calls for 50 ml of calvados , use 15 ml of calvados , 35 ml of apple juice , and a breath of powdered cinnamon . Or baste a roast with a mix of tomato and carrot juice instead of red wine . The possibilities are endless , you just have to be clear on why you are choosing whatever you are choosing .
When I am using skim powdered milk and want more fat , I just replace some of the water in the recipe with heavy cream . Your recipe does n't have water , it already uses milk and cream . You could replace a little of the milk with cream to make up the difference . However , with all the cream and butter in that recipe , I doubt you would be able to notice the fat missing from the dry milk . I would just use your skim dry milk and not worry about it .
In the cowboy days , the people traveling through the western desert would carry canvas sacks which they would fill with water . The water would seep through the canvas very slowly , and wet the surface of the bag . Evaporative cooling would then keep the water cold ( at least cooler ) . You could try something similar if you are in a dry climate ( the rate of evaporation determines the cooling effect , which is limited by the relative humidity ) . Wrap the food or drink in wet cloth , and hang or set in a shady location with some wind . Keep the wrapping wet .
When does it matter ? Only worry about highly accurate measurement when it matters . This is generally when two ingredients or aspects of a recipe must be held in a close ratio to be successful . This occurs more normally in baking than in savory cooking ( except for modernist or molecular methods , where accuracy is extremely important ) . The classic example is balancing the amount of baking soda and lemon juice in a recipe , so there is enough acid for the baking soda to react with and provide good leavening . In savory cooking , many ingredients just provide bulk , flavor , or texture , but are not reacting chemically with other ingredients in a significant way . In this case , you generally do not need highly accurate measurements . Volume versus weight The goal when measuring ingredients is that you want to have a reproducible amount of the substance . The only true way to ensure this in the general case is to use an accurate scale , which measures by weight . The reason is that some foods are compressible , and can be squeezed or fluffed to different densities . The classic example is flour : depending on how you measure ( sifting into a measuring cup and then leveling , to dip and sweep , for example ) , a single cup could weight as little as about 4 ounces at the low end to over 5 ounces at the high end . That is a variance of over 20 % ! For ingredients which are highly compressible , or whose density can change , measuring by weight is simply going to be more accurate , and more repeatable . 4.5 ounces of flour by weight is always , well , 4.5 ounces . Economical kitchen scales are available that measure digitally down to 1 gram ( about 28th of an ounce ) . Switching from Volume to Weight : Common Conversions Switching from measuring primarily by volume to primarily by weight is somewhat scary . How much flour should there be in a cup ? What does a cup of sugar weight ? A quality cookbook for baked goods will give you ingredients by weight , or if not , in the front matter , will tell you what weight they are using for a standard up . Similarly , the quality websites for baked goods will tell you what weight they use for a standard " cup " of flour , or they will simply provide weight information as part of the recipe . If you do n't have recipes specified by weight , and can not find a specific conversion or standard cup size for your recipe source , here are some good values to get started for the most important ingredients . Flour - 4.5 oz / cup Sugar - 8 oz / cup Brown Sugar - 7 oz / cup Cocoa - 4.25 oz / cup Water - 8 oz / cup Vegetable oil - 8 oz / cup ( surprisingly , it is not that much less dense than water ; you would need to measure 10 cups worth to be off by one full ounce by weight ) Sour cream - 8.1 oz / cup ( in most cases , rounding to 8 would be fine ) Web searches , such as <URL> can be very helpful in finding conversion factors . As a side benefit , once you are measuring by weight , you may actually find it is more convenient , and has less cleanup , as you can measure each item into a common bowl ( pressing the tare or zero key each time ) . No more little pile of bowls and measuring spoons to wash ! When is measuring by volume okay ? Things that do n't compress , and are not mixed with air are fine when measured by volume . The scientific reason is that their density is constant , so a given volume will always have the same weight . Examples of items that can be measured accurately by volume include : Liquids of almost all sorts - water , oils , juices , extracts , milk , and so on Fine , solid powders , like granulated sugar Spices are another exception . While measuring by weight is in fact preferred and more accurate ( if you have a scale accurate to below the gram level ) , they do n't usually participate in the chemistry of a recipe , and are adjusted to taste in any case . Therefore , the inherent inaccuracy of measuring them by volume is less troublesome . Salt : the Gotcha Salt is an unusual ingredient . Depending on how it is crystalized , it can have surprisingly different weights per volume . For this reason , if you can , measuring salt by weight is always more accurate . Still , it is often used in small quantities , and it is fairly in-compressible , so measuring by volume should be okay , as long as you always measure the same type of salt . Be aware that different salt brands and types have differently shaped granules , crystals , or flakes , some of which have air inclusions , so the weight to volume conversion depends on the particular type of salt . While all granulated table salts are fairly similar , kosher and specialty salts can weight as little as half as much per unit of volume in comparison , and can vary by brand . Common US salt volume to weight conversions : Granulated ( table ) salt - 10.3 oz / cup Kosher Salt , Diamond - 5.01 oz / cup Kosher Salt , Morton 's - 7.68 oz / cup Dry volume If you do measure by volume , use the right type of measuring tool . A measuring spoon or dry measuring cup is appropriate for
It is calcium lactate crystals . It is safe to eat . On regular cheeses it is a sign that it is aged well . For packaged , sliced american cheese I am not sure I would care for it . But it is a matter of personal preference .

Can I turn coarse coarnmeal into fine with a blender ?
In theory it 's possible . However , not all blenders are created equal . <URL> mentions doing it , but in my experience to blend something into a super fine powder ( a flour-like consistency ) you need a really powerful machine like a Vita-mix . Also you may get inconsistencies in texture with a blender . This is one reason professional coffee bars use burr grinders instead of blade grinders : to achieve a consistent grind .
<URL> list chili powder as : 2 tablespoons paprika 2 teaspoons oregano 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper , or to taste ( optional ) There are other mixtures , but this one seem basic enough . The " heat " comes from the cayenne pepper . The other spices round out the flavor . So I 'd mix everything but the cayenne pepper and use that mixture to cut your present chili powder .
Short answer - not really . Fat is an essential component in any cake , and milk just is n't very fatty - about 5 % for whole milk . You can make cakes with milk , but they require totally different recipes : you ca n't simply substitute milk for oil . Bear in mind that you 're distributing the cup of oil throughout a whole cake , so that any one slice will only have a fraction of the oil . I assume you 'll also be sharing the cake with others , so you 'll be ' spreading the calories ' somewhat . You should be using a neutral oil like canola ( rapeseed ) oil anyway , as it has a relatively mild flavour . A popular alternative these days is to substitute all but a couple of tablespoons of the oil with apple sauce ( really ) , but this can be hit and miss and does n't work with all recipes - it usually works best with things like quick breads ( scones etc ) . Of course , there 's also the point that cakes are supposed to be a treat , and they 'd be less of a treat without the fat , in which case why bother ? If you want to be healthy , make a salad . If you want a treat , make a cake and do n't worry about the contents too much .
Save in a bag in your freezer along with all chicken bones you come across . Cleave through the bones to expose some collagen before freezing ( consider <URL> all ingredients before hand ) . Add whatever vegetable bits you do n't use in your cooking - including things you would n't eat ( but nothing poisonous ) to your bag , especially onions ( including skin and root ) , celery , and carrots . When you have a good amount , put in a pot and just cover with cold water . A bit of vinegar helps promote a nice gelling of your broth . Tomato paste , peppercorns , and a bay leaf will add to the flavor . Simmer gently for around five hours . Remove . If you had fat still on your meat you may want to chill until the fat rises to the surface to remove the fat . Your broth will keep 3 to 4 days in the fridge or it can be frozen until you have a recipe which calls for chicken stock or broth . Your homemade broth will be an excellent addition to sauces , a great base for soups , or an excellent liquid for cooking rice , couscous , or quinoa .
There are a variety of frozen desserts which are all related . The main difference between ice cream and frozen custard is the amount of eggs used to thicken the base mix . Philadelphia style ice cream is made from a base mix of milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings . French ( or simply plain ) ice cream is made from a base mix which is essentially a very thin custard or creme anglaise : milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings thickened with egg yolks or whole egg . The base mix is cooked to thicken , and then chilled prior to churning . Frozen custard is very similar to French style ice cream , but with a greater ratio of eggs or egg yolks to dairy or liquid in the mix . With this information , you can adapt nearly any custard recipe to be freezable as ice cream or frozen custard . My survey of frozen custard recipes indicates a ratio of eggs to dairy of about 5 egg yolks to three cups ( 700 mL ) dairy , or 6 whole eggs to 4 cups ( 1 L ) of dairy . To adapt any custard recipe for freezing , then : Adjust the ratio of egg yolks to dairy to no more than about 5 yolks per 3 cups dairy . You may also want to adjust the total yield to be based on no more than 3 cups dairy depending on the capacity of your ice cream maker . Many home ice cream makers have a 1 quart ( close to 1 L ) capacity , but you need to leave room for the air which will be incorporated as the mix is churned . I recommend not using whole eggs for frozen custards , as the yolks facilitate a better texture , and create the rich eggy custard flavor . Frozen desserts are served colder than custards normally are , so the flavors will be more muted . You may need to compensate by increasing the ratio of flavoring ingredients . This will be hard to judge until you have made the frozen custard/ice cream at least once . Cook the custard until it thickens on the stove top , per the normal custard method . Chill it rapidly for safety , and then hold it for at least 4 hours ( overnight is even better ) . While I can not explain the science , empirically , allowing the mix to mature lets the flavors meld and produces a better frozen dessert . Churn it into a frozen dessert according to the instructions of your particular ice cream maker . Note that you can even convert a custard recipe into a Philadelphia style ice cream by eliminating the eggs completely , and simply creating a dairy/sugar/flavoring mix . These still benefit from overnight maturation before churning .
One way to modify the recipes ( but you wo n't get the smooth texture of the original recipes ) is to cut the onion and carrot a lot smaller than the original recipe ask for . You want to almost dice it . When you are frying the onion and carrot in the pan , do it for like 1-2 min rather than the whole 5 minutes . And finally you will need to cook it in the stock for much longer than the recipe asks . You want to bring the stock to a boil then let it simmer covered to allow the carrot to become really soft . Then use something with a big flat surface ( a large wooden spoon or something similar ) to help you mash the rest against the side of the stock pot . The results will come out a lot lumpier than the orginal recipes but some texture and " unblended " bits of carrot is actually pretty good in carrot soup .
My answer would be to add more cake flour if you have it , but AP flour will do it too , then add an additional teaspoon of baking soda . The flour will lighten the mix so it 's not so dense chocolate/cocoa , and the additional baking soda will help it rise more than a brownie . An additional egg wo n't hurt , and it will certainly help the stickier of the cake , but I do n't know if it 's necessary .
You will need to be careful about extra liquid in your sauce . Your base recipe should be adaptable . Go ahead and use the garlic and onion , but I would omit the white wine . If you are using canned whole tomatoes , drain liquid before using them . Simmer it to reduce it down until it is " spreadable " rather than " pour-able " . We make a lot of home-made pizza sauce with canned whole San Marzano tomatoes , drained and puree 'd in blender . Salt , pepper , garlic and a few spices . My husband loves bright red color in the sauce so a bit of citric acid does the trick . Enjoy your pizza .
I use beer a LOT for my cooking . As the others have said , you need to watch out for the bitterness , which can intensify when you cook and reduce it down . As such , I often cook with different beers than I drink . You can use the IBU ( International Bitterness Unit ) rating for a beer to get an idea of whether your favorite beer will be a problem . Personally , I use Guinness and other dark beers when red wine is called for in a recipe . The flavors are definitely different than the red wine version , but it usually comes out good . I also cook quite a bit with wheat beers and the kind of beers that people describe as " nutty " , like porters . America 's Test Kitchen looked at beers for cooking at one point and a " non-alcoholic " beer actually did really well : O'Doul 's Amber . I agree with them and tend to keep it on hand for cooking , even though I never drink it . It stays mellow and away from the bitter flavors when used for cooking . So , what do I cook with it ? Like most of the others , cooking bratwurst before grilling and cheese fondue , but I also use it for lots of other stuff . I have a baked bean version that uses 4 cans of beer and a couple of shots of whiskey and sits in a crock pot on low for 24 hours . I 've made this with all different kinds of beer and each brings something different to the results . ( <URL> ) I also like using beer in most of my stews . Throw beef chunks , veggies and beer in the crock pot in the morning and it 's a tasty stew when you get home . It works well as the liquid for braising pork or beef . In the winter , I 'll often throw a pork shoulder roast into the crock pot with a bottle of beer and let it slow cook all day . When it 's completely falling apart , I pull it out , shred it and add back as much of the beer as the shredded mess will hold ( which turns out to be far more than you thought ) . What results is a juicy sandwich option , which is really good , topped with mustard or bbq sauce . It comforts me when it 's too cold to deal with slow smoking pork ( I live in MN ) . I 'll also often take some of that shredded " drunk " pork to my baked beans and give the beans some extra dimension . We do a version of " bangers and mash " that I use beer in the gravy/sauce that I like . Beer and self-rising flour make for a really quick quickbread that has an interesting flavor profile . I particularly like using wheat beers like Leinenkugel 's Sunset Wheat , as the wheat flavors work well in a bread . Beers ( and hard ciders , which I actually REALLY like ) work well for marinades . Beyond that , I tend to find myself just tossing a few ounces of it into a lot of other liquids/sauces to add some flavor .
Welcome . According to the excerpt below from <URL> , kidney beans are an acceptable substitute . azuki bean = adzuki bean = Tiensin red bean = aduki bean = asuki bean = field pea = red Oriental bean = feijao bean = red chori Equivalents : 1 cup dried yields 3 cups cooked beans Pronunciation : a-ZOO-kee Notes : The Japanese use these small red beans to make sweet red bean paste , but they 're also good in rice dishes or salads . Azuki beans are sweet and relatively easy to digest , so they wo n't make you as gassy as other beans . They also do n't take as long to cook . Substitutes : black azuki beans OR red kidney beans OR Tolosana beans That said , while you may be able to substitute them you may need to make adjustments to end up with a similar bean paste . For example you may need to add more sugar as adzuki beans have a natural slightly sweet flavor . Also , even though you have canned beans , they may require a bit of cooking to get them to the right softness . ( Adzuki beans tend to have a very creamy texture . ) Note that dark red kidney beans tend to be more firm than light red . All said and done , you can probably make adjustments and end up with a slightly different result . But as for me , I would get the adzuki beans .
I 've never used bhut jolokias but I love spicy vegetable oil . DO NOT just throw the peppers in a jar of oil . Apparently this is bad . Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly . Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little ( or a lot ) of extra heat . You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos . Bonus : if what I 've heard of these peppers is correct , you can probably make a low grade mace this way . If you 're looking for something to do right away , I 'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips , burritos , pizza , or anything really . Spicy cheese rocks . Good luck and enjoy .
A vita mix should work pretty well ; maybe you could carefully drag a spatula in the top of the vortex ( nowhere near the blade ! ) to introduce more air . A whisk will be pretty slow going . And then there is a whole other category of foams made in a whipped cream canister . Here is a link to get you started : <URL>
If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge , it means you did it right ! Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin ; that 's the very essence of stock-making . The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock ; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency , but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture . The more you reduce the stock , the more gelatinous it will become , so if it turned out stiffer than you expected , it 's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate . Typically , when making stock , you use a very low simmer ; just a few bubbles per minute . Any more than that and your stock will reduce . But reducing is perfectly OK , and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few tablespoons ; it 's like bullion , only without all the salt and preservatives . Heavily-reduced stock is called glace de viande and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick , imparting a powerful meat flavour . But you probably did n't reduce it that much . If you 're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous , even at higher temperatures , you can feel free to dilute it . For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1 , but taste as you go along just to make sure you 're not watering it down too much . When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator , it is probably fat , which you should skim off and discard ( or reserve ) . The rest is your actual stock , and in your case it sounds delicious . Also , since you mention vacuum-sealing - I prefer to use covered ice cube trays for freezing stock . That lets you portion it out much more easily than a big solid blob .
Yes , I think you can . The page you link does list the oil as " food grade " , and specifies no added solvents ... so there 's probably nothing dangerous in the jar and it can be safely used for cooking . In general , though , you usually should n't equate cosmetic treatments and edible substances , even if some of the ingredients are the same ( soaps often do this , list all food sounding ingredients until a second glance reveals it , well , soap ) , or even if the base substance is the same but may have undergone different processes ( like coconut oil or cocoa butter ) . If the coconut oil had been processed with some non-food grade solvents or processes , it might be perfectly safe for topical application , and still be quite dangerous to consume . If you are questioning whether a substance might be an ingredient as well as a cosmetic treatment , look up the information , and I mean brand-specific product page , and see if it mentions " food grade " - that means exactly the bit of information you 're looking for , that it is of a high enough quality that it passes the tests they use for product meant to be eaten .
Yes , you can add the chutney to the bread dough to produce a more flavorful bread . When you add the chutney depends on exactly how you want it distributed in the bread . If you 'd like the chutney flavor to permeate the bread throughout , mix directly in with the wet ingredients during the initial mix . If you prefer to have " streaks " of chutney or layers , you can proof the dough first , and just fold it in a few times before the final rise and bake . Depending on the texture of the chutney and how much you add , these different approaches can have different effects on the finished product . For example , if you 're adding just a small amount of chutney and it is already pureed or mashed , mixing it early could dilute it in the dough so much that it wo n't give much flavor to the bread . In that case , waiting to add it later and folding it in could produce " streaks " of flavor that might be a nice effect in the final bread . If , on the other hand , your chutney is rather " chunky " or you 're adding a large quantity , it might be better to mix it in earlier . Adding a lot of big chunks after proofing can produce layers in the final bread that can separate , make baking more difficult ( with pockets of " filling " that do n't rise in temperature as fast ) , and/or make the bread difficult to slice .
You can definitely cook donuts in a deep fryer . Most , if not all , donuts shops cook them in that manner . Just make sure your temperature is good and use something like chopsticks to flip them .
Fire is typically a poor heat source for direct cooking . It fluctuates with every breeze so the heating is very erratic . It also produces a lot of soot which tastes terrible and is bad for you . When cooking on a campfire much better results are had by cooking next to the coals than above the flame . Cooking with a gas flame is more reliable of course . A couple direct cooking applications of fire in the kitchen , that I can think of are : Flambe : Lighting a sauce which contains a lot of alcohol to burn off some of the raw alcohol taste . Roasting : Putting a steaming basket over a gas flame and charring the skin of peppers or eggplant . Caramelizing : Using a blowtorch to put a crust on creme brulee or to sear the exterior of a sous vide steak . I would recommend starting with the blowtorch for several reasons : It is harder to burn your house down with a torch than with a pan of flame . Blow torches are useful for things outside of the kitchen like stripping paint or starting the grill . There is something deeply satisfying about wielding a hissing , blue , knife of fire that appeals to the caveman within . As for safety . Keep a fire extinguisher on hand . Do n't let kids or pets in the kitchen when you are playing with fire . Keep your home owner 's insurance current .
First off , the blender should not be damaged by the shells ; if it is , it should have been replaced anyway . The mass of the shells is simply not enough to damage the blender in any significant way . I would not , however , recommend eating the product , for a few reasons : You can not be confident that the egg shell has been completely pulverised . At some point , the blades stop chopping the shell , and simply spins it around Whenever using egg shells for presentation , they should be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized , because you do n't know what is coating it . You may very conceivably contract diseases from bacteria on the shell .
The best I can offer you comes from <URL> : The gelation of egg yolk can be partially reversed by heating after thawing . This treatment improves the functional properties of proteins . The stiffness of the gels obtained after frozen storage can be reduced by more than 50 % and become pourable at 21 ° C by heating up to 45 ° C for 1 h. Eggs do n't actually start to set until you hit 63 ° C , so if I had previously-frozen eggs , I would heat them as the above paragraph suggests . Just be very careful not to use too much heat . You wo n't get perfect eggs , but they 'll be edible .
To answer your specific scenario , kimchi has myriad variations using any number of vegetables , from perilla leaves to Korean radishes to napa cabbage . There are forms of kimchi that involve no chilies ( white kimchi ) , some involve a lot of water and bear little resemblance to the typical napa cabbage one ( mul kimchi ) . The main constraints for Korean-ness of kimchi will be that you 've fermented it ( for all of the types that I can think of , anyway ) , and that it does n't stray too far from familiar Korean flavor profiles ( rules that you can break if you 've got a deep enough foundation in Korean culinary traditions ) . Napa cabbage is n't particularly hard to find in Europe , however , so I 'm not sure why it would need to be substituted . For whatever reason , it was called " Chinese cabbage " in Germany ; I 'd be surprised if you could n't find it . If I wanted to make the typical cabbage kimchi , the hardest thing would have been finding the right kind of chili powder , which I was able to obtain without too much trouble when I was a 20 year old student there many years ago . Then , the typical small bits of raw oysters or other kinds of fish or dried shrimp can reasonably be substituted with locally available ingredients ( and some regions in Korea do n't always use those ingredients anyway ) .

Will roasting ginger root give it a milder flavor ?
The reason that roasted garlic tastes so much milder than raw garlic is that it contains a sulfur compound called allicin , which roasting breaks down . Allicin is primarily what gives garlic its pungency . Technically , raw garlic mostly contains a compound called allin , which reacts with the allinase enzyme to produce the allicin , and this reaction is greatly accelerated when garlic is " distressed " , i.e. crushed or cut . Ginger contains no allicin , so you 're certainly not going to get an identical reaction . What ginger does contain are two types of oil called gingerols and shogaols , which are primarily what gives ginger its pungency . Cooking converts these into another compound called zingerone , which is far less pungent ( it 's described as " spicy-sweet " ) . It 's actually slightly more complicated ; the gingerols also convert into shogaols through cooking , and the shogaols are actually more pungent ( 160,000 SHU vs. 60,000 ) , but on the whole , the ginger does become milder . It will not become perfectly sweet as garlic does , just less pungent and more aromatic . In fact , cooked ( roasted ) ginger tastes much like dried ginger ; many of the same reactions happen during drying as during cooking . So yes , you can try roasting ginger if you want it to be milder , but do n't expect to be able to eat the whole root by itself if you do n't already love the taste of ginger . It does n't do exactly the same thing that garlic does , it 's just a little similar . It 's hard to find good references online , although you can find a lot of this in McGee .

How should I store bolognese sauce prep ?
Short version : If it 's only overnight , and you seal the containers reasonably well , you 'll be okay prepping any of those ingredients ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator overnight . I often leave onions in the fridge when preparing a recipe that calls for only half an onion , or if I 've decided to use less than I prepped , or if I 'm making a salsa and I chop the onions before realizing I do n't have as many tomatoes as I thought , etc. . If you do n't cover them they will dry out a bit , but overnight does n't do much harm ; I find if they 're tightly covered , whether in a glass bowl with plastic wrap or a sealed plastic storage container , they 're just as good the next day . The same goes for carrots and celery . I 'm sure there 's been a time when I prepped too much mirepoix ; but generally speaking , if you have a cut carrot or stalk of celery in the fridge , it does n't suffer too much overnight . More than a day and it starts to dry out ; the cut surface of the carrot will start to look like the end near the tops , and possibly split . The celery dries out more quickly , as it 's got higher water content and more fragile structure to begin with ; more than a day and it 'll lose its color , eventually turning limp and yellow , starting from the cut end . For the veggies , the way to keep them freshest is with a tight seal and as little air as possible . You could put them in a zipper bag and squeeze out any extra air but I think a reasonably-sized glass bowl , covered tightly with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge , is good enough for 12-24 hours . If you do n't have room in the fridge , you 'll probably still be okay , and they may even be less prone to drying out ( the air in your fridge is very low-humidity ; sometimes you have a special compartment for which the humidity can be adjusted , for fruits and vegetables ) . I have less experience prepping meat ahead of time , unless I 'm brining or marinading it ; in those situations , the meat 's covered by a liquid that contains preservatives ( salt , acid ) that help prevent it from spoiling , and it 's always refrigerated . Keeping it cool and minimizing the contact with air or contaminants is the main thing . If you only have enough room in the fridge to store some of your prepped ingredients , use it for the meat . In this case I 'd say a zipper bag with the air squeezed out is the clear way to go ; meat is malleable and you 'll be able to get nearly all of the air out , which means it 'll store almost as well as it did before you chopped it into pieces . The thing to remember about ground , chopped or cubed meat is that anything that contaminated the outside surface of the original cut is now mixed evenly throughout . This is why it 's generally safer to order a steak rare than it is to order a hamburger rare ; the center of the steak has n't been exposed to as much of its environment as the center of the burger , during handling and storage . So even if you refrigerate your prepped meat in a sealed container with the air evacuated , effectively storing it just as well as when it was in the original packaging and in one piece , I would n't expect it to keep the same effective " use by " date because it 's been disturbed and mixed and exposed to the environment of your prep area . You 're better off doing this with a cut that you purchased recently , which has n't been refrozen and is n't nearing expiration .
Just keep it dry . I buy 100 sheets packs and store them in a zip-loc type bag in the cupboard for over a year
Prime rib is usually sold two ways , Bone-In or Bone-Out . For a Bone-In prime rib an 8 pound should serve you well , for a Bone-Out , Six will do nicely . I would also highly recommend you refer to the prime rib narrative of " <URL> " to learn how to prepare your roast . [ Edit ] Most restaurants that I have either had or seen Prime Rib served at will offer 10 oz or 12 oz serving size , with some variations in the overall 8-16 oz ( 225g - 450g ) range . Appetites will vary from person to person , and you may wish to not serve the ' heals ' as they will be more well done than the center , though some guests may prefer this . . so , ' your-mileage-may-vary ' . The very size of beef ribs makes serving them ' bone-in ' impractical , as it results in a serving that is too thick for a single serving ( though some restaurants do this for eye-appeal ) . For your home dinner party I would not recommend planning based on ' bone count ' . Even if you buy and cook your roast " bone-in " your first cut after preparing and resting the meat should be to remove the bones from the roast . Since leftovers are goal you have set for this preparation you may wish to then slice the roast " on the bias " ( about a 15 ° -20 ° angle from perpendicular to the bone section ) as it will produce a larger footprint on the plate . The ends will provide you with good meat to include in a soup or slice up for sandwiches .
Looks like ehow has the <URL> thus far to storing bean sprouts After purchasing Bean Sprouts should be stored and washed after purchasing in growing . The article indicates that the best methods for storage are the following : Wash them after you purchase them . Wash bean sprouts after purchasing or growing . Wash them in cold water to remove seed coats , roots and other residue that may be present . If you are using them within a day , store them in the refrigerator at 40 to 45 degrees . Place the sprouts in a plastic bag with a wet paper towel to keep them moist . Store in icy water and change the water few times a day You can also store sprouts in a bucket of icy water and change the water a few times a day . Depending on how long the sprouts were in transit or on the store shelf , they should last longer than when stored in a plastic bag . Freeze them Freeze sprouts for the longest storage . Wash sprouts as described in Step One . Then heat one layer at a time in steam for three minutes . Cool right away in icy water and drain . Put the sprouts into plastic containers and seal . It also mentions in the <URL> to just grow them to provide the best freshness . Apparently the shelf life of beansprouts should only be stored up to <URL> Source : <URL>
Salt is added at the beginning , because it takes long time to dissolve . Also , it 's maybe less important for bolognese , but you want your veggies to get infused with salty water , the taste is different from bland vegetables swimming in water salted late . Last but not least , salt 's chemical properties are important for the cooking of some dishes . The stuff which depends on volatile aroma molecules ( practically all fresh herbs ) is added at the end , after the sauce ( or stew ) is removed from the heat , because lots of the compounds are destroyed by heat , and while the flavour is still discernible , it is diminished . On the other hand , if you are using dried herbs , their most fragile molecules have long since disappeared in the air . The flavours which remain in the dried leaves are sturdier and not easily loosened from the plant matter . So by adding dried herbs early enough to allow for some simmering , you can leach more of these out of the leaf ( you are practically steeping it in the sauce ) . But if you cook them for too long , even these molecules can get damaged . Plus , there were some herbs which release unpleasantly bitter alkaloids after too long a steeping ( I do n't remember if your three are among those , but I would suspect the basil may be , as it is prone to producing off-tastes ) . So add them ~ 5 minutes before turning the heat off . Spices are a bit of a boundary case . Although dried spices do n't taste the same as fresh ones , grinding them still releases volatile molecules . So I tend to add them at the end , like fresh herbs , and I 'll advise you to do so too ( using peppercorns in a grinder ) . If I use spices which were bought pre-powdered , I throw them in earlier or together with the dried herbs .
I always store mine in the pantry . I use it frequently enough that sprouting is rarely an issue . If you need it to last longer you can freeze garlic , though I have never needed to . Shelf Life An unbroken bulb of garlic can last 3-5 months in a cool ( 55-60 F ) dark place . Once broken , the remaining cloves last only about 7-10 days . Frozen , you can store garlic 10-12 months . Source : <URL>
Yes , with any kind of ' stewing ' sauce , the flavour improves the longer you cook it ( provided it 's a slow , gentle process ) . The longer you leave it , the more chance the flavours have to ' marry ' . I have a recipe for a pasta sauce that calls for 6 hours of slow simmering ! You may also have noticed in the past that left over pasta sauce that you eat the next day is really good , for the same reason as above . Any stew , in fact , like bolognese , casserole , chilli , bourgignon etc , is really delicious when left overnight and reheated .
You will need to be careful about extra liquid in your sauce . Your base recipe should be adaptable . Go ahead and use the garlic and onion , but I would omit the white wine . If you are using canned whole tomatoes , drain liquid before using them . Simmer it to reduce it down until it is " spreadable " rather than " pour-able " . We make a lot of home-made pizza sauce with canned whole San Marzano tomatoes , drained and puree 'd in blender . Salt , pepper , garlic and a few spices . My husband loves bright red color in the sauce so a bit of citric acid does the trick . Enjoy your pizza .
Technique Always use a cutting surface made for a knife , particularly a wooden chopping board/block . Avoid contact with hard surfaces such as metal , glass , or stone ; these will quickly cause dulling or even chipping of most knives . Also avoid cutting frozen items , for the same reason . Use the dull end ( " top " ) of the knife for scraping food off surfaces , or use a scraper or spatula instead . Knives are meant to cut straight , along the edge ; scraping one sideways across any surface will misalign the edge very quickly . Do not use more force than necessary . A sharp knife should cut with very little effort . The more pressure you apply , the faster it will dull . Use a <URL> for bones or other very hard foods . General-purpose chef 's knives or smaller knives are n't appropriate for this task , and may chip or even snap . General Care Wash or rinse knives promptly after use . The moisture in many foods can be acidic and/or corrosive to the metal ( fruits , onions , etc. ) . Dry knives immediately with a soft cloth or towel . Stainless steel is resistant to rust and corrosion but not immune . This goes for all metal but especially knives , because even an imperceptible amount of rust along the edge will drastically hinder its ability to cut . Air-drying may also leave you with stains or " spots " due to salts and other trace minerals in the water . Store knives in a dry , open area , away from other objects , to avoid moisture build-up , impacts , and secondary rust . <URL> . A knife in a dishwasher is subject to impacts , corrosion , and warping of the wooden handle/joint . Quality knives should be hand-washed . Honing Honing a knife is a good way to restore a slightly dull knife . You will need an <URL> ( sometimes misleadingly referred to as a sharpening steel ) , which can be bought inexpensively . Note that <URL> ; the best value tends to be in the $ 30 ( USD ) range . Honing is not the same as sharpening . Honing helps to align the existing edge , which becomes skewed or " curled " after regular use . It will not help to create a new edge if the knife is damaged , e.g. if it is corroded or chipped due to not following the " General Care " advice above . To hone a knife : Keep the honing steel vertical . Hold the knife at a slight angle to the steel . Stroke downward and towards yourself . Alternate strokes , and do an equal number of times on both sides . Here is a <URL> . Sharpening <URL> involves a whetstone ( AKA <URL> ) and is an art unto itself . <URL> , however , the technique takes a long time to master and most home cooks will prefer to leave this to a professional . If you find that regular honing is no longer effective at maintaining a knife 's edge - and if it 's been well-maintained , this should take several weeks or months - then it 's time to get the knife sharpened . An alternative to professional sharpening ( or learning to use a whetstone ) is to use a good-quality motorized electric sharpener , such as the <URL> . This will obviously not yield the same result as a professional sharpening , but it is very convenient and fast . Some people believe that all electric sharpeners will damage your knives . This may still be true of the cheaper , single-stage sharpeners , because they do a lot of grinding and generate a lot of heat . However , the more modern , higher-end sharpeners operate very quickly , have precise angle control , and use multiple stages mimicking the manual process ( grinding , steeling , stropping ) . The " grinding " stage on a multi-stage sharpener should only be used if the knife is already badly damaged , and will actually create a new edge . If your knife is in reasonable shape , then it 's fine to use a good sharpener on a semi-regular basis as long as you do n't grind too much . ( Honing should still be your primary form of maintenance ) . Yet another option , if you 're on a tight budget , is to <URL> . Follow the link for additional information on technique , grit , and tutorials .
If it 's high quality , store it in the refrigerator in an air-tight container and try to use it as quickly as possible so you can enjoy it while it 's fresh . There are always excuses to use loads of parmesan : cheese plates , pasta dinners , fondue , scones , grilled cheese sandwiches , etc. . It should last for 3-4 months in a sealed container in the fridge . As time goes on it will get drier , but that 's to be expected . If you ca n't eat it in time , consider giving some away to a friend . If you wanted , you could freeze it as well , but I would only use it for baking or melting once thawed as some flavor and a lot of texture will be lost .
Yes , store them individually . First , wrap them tightly in plastic wrap , preferably one that says it 's specifically for freezer use . Then wrap this tightly in aluminum foil . They 'll keep for months without freezer burn this way .
The cheesecake kept for 1 year just fine with no discernible off flavors or other problems . I 'm a homebrewer and we wound up putting the cheesecake into the freezer section of our spare ' beer fridge ' . That freezer is pretty much only used for overflow freezer space , and the refrigerator section is used for beer bottles and kegs , and we have had a few apples in the crispers for most of the year , but that 's it . The freezer section was rarely opened more than once per week . The cheesecake had no off flavors , and only had light water crystallisation on the surface , which was not at all detrimental to our enjoyment of the cake . This was a plain ' real ' cooked cheesecake with graham cracker crust . So , for a ' good enough ' storage method , wrap loosely in foil and store in a freezer that is rarely used , and the cheesecake should be excellent for at least one year .
It is perfectly safe to eat the peel in and of itself . You will need to make sure that you wash it properly , as it may be dirty . But beyond that , it 's simply a matter of taste . A lot of people do n't like the flavor / texture of the peel and so remove it . From a <URL> : Kiwi fruit skin is definitely edible , and there 's a lot of different theories about eating it . Kiwi fruit skin contains high levels of flavonoids , insoluble fiber and antioxidants : these substances all have a beneficial effect on your body 's metabolic functions ( flavonoids and antioxidants ) and on your digestive system and cardiovascular apparatus ( insoluble fiber ) . Common sense , however , should be practiced in this respect : while raw kiwi fruit skin contains these beneficial substances , it also tends to contain more than 99,95 % of of the pesticides in that particular fruit ( if they have been used ) , which largely outweighs the benefits from flavonoids and antioxidants .
For baking potatoes Do n't just wash them , scrub them . Otherwise you 're eating dirt . No , that 's not a joke . Potatoes grow in dirt , and are usually sold coated with dirt . Yes , really . Either salt them and wrap them in tin-foil , or simply bake them on a bed of salt . Dessication of the skin is important . You 'll probably want to bake them longer and higher than most recipes say . I find 425F for 1 1/2 hours is optimal ( and 2 hours is fine ) . That results in skin which is dry , crispy , and slightly caramelized , while this inside still is fluffy ( albeit , according to some , overcooked ) .
Dupe , but a good question . See Satanicpuppies answer here : <URL> I know you asked re : cranberry sauce specifically , but this is a great article regarding the differences in sugars , generically , which might help in the future : " Sugar can be a single molecule made up of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen -- like glucose and fructose . Other sugars , like sucrose , or white table sugar , are made up of multiple molecules ( in this case , one glucose and one fructose ) , tied together with chemical bonds . Now , when sucrose is heated with an acid , it breaks back down into the two smaller sugars , glucose and fructose , resulting in something we call invert sugar . This small chemical change makes a big difference : While sucrose is hygroscopic , invert sugar is even more water-loving . And this can make a tremendous difference when , say , you want to bake a chewy , rather than crunchy , cookie . " <URL>
Are there different qualities in prepared Hoisin sauces ? Think of it like barbecue sauce or chili powder : every company has their own recipe , and it 's always hard to know the precise justification for a specific price . The high price on one may be part of their premium brand image , and have nothing to do with the quality of the ingredients . Ultimately , you just have to try a few brands and decide which flavor appeals to you , and whether you find the price reasonable . If so , would I be better served by making my own ? As far as I can tell , hoisin sauce does not need to be fermented , so it 's going to be much easier to make authentic hoisin sauce at home than something like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce . It 's more like making your own barbecue sauce . A few different websites have minor variations on this recipe : <URL> Is it worth the effort ? That 's a matter of personal opinion . It 's probably hard to justify on purely economic terms ; do you really use more than a few cents worth of hoisin sauce in any given meal , and are the ingredients that much cheaper than the product itself ? But of course , there are other reasons to cook than just to save money . I think you 've just inspired me to try making my own hoisin sauce :) If I make my own , how long will it keep for ? Each of those ingredients can last months on its own , often without any refrigeration , and together would create a highly acidic and antimicrobial environment . The worst that might happen to homemade hoisin sauce in several months of refrigerated storage is it might separate a bit and have to be remixed .
It 's essential to get all the debris ( seeds , large fibrous bits , skins etc ) out of the pulp . I normally add a little hot water in a bowl with the block of pulp , be careful not to add too much or it 'll end up watery - better to add more as you go , wash your hands thoroughly and break the pulp up by hand . Then strain out the seeds etc and it 's ready to use . You can buy ready to use Tamarind puree in shops but it 's normally not a good . There 's more info on working with Tamarind pulp in the footnotes here ( as well as a good Pad Thai recipe ) <URL>
The original Buffalo Wings are made with <URL> . The original recipe is simply equal parts melted butter and hot sauce . However , you truly can use just about whatever hot sauce you want in even greater ratios if you want more kick . There are also some distributors that specialize in spicy wing sauces . I recommend <URL> if you are adventurous and enjoy a very nice kick of heat .
Nope . Haha :) Brining will give you a softer texture . I have brined duck for varying times ( depending on how much of a rush I was in ) and brining really does help with the texture . You can sear it beforehand , some Maillard reaction will help in flavour development , but when I cook sous vide for more than 8 hours , I do n't bother : the meat will go green/grey , which means I need to sear afterwards anyway . So I usually just sear at the end . If your meat does n't have that much fat , or anything to keep it moist , it can go dry . Adding some butter , or maybe rendered Wagyu fat in the case of your steak , might help . As for bacteria , the longer you cook sous vide , the more you kill off the nasties . It so happens that Douglas Baldwin has a short bit about flat iron steak : <URL> Hope that helps :)
I would keep the one that you are eating the next day out . I would then freeze the rest of them . If you like them warm , you could freeze them wrapped in foil . Before eating pop them in a toaster oven until gently warmed through . If not I 'd freeze individually until solid then put in a bag to prevent your frozen bagels from sticking together , then thaw overnight ( if eating in the morning ) or in the morning ( if eating for a mid-day meal ) to eat .

Does anyone know how to make a Sous Vide style cooking vessel ?
You could probably do it on the cheap , but the temperature precision might suffer in the process : ( $ 0 - $ 3 ) A container for water that can handle being warmed up a bit . ( recycle something or buy a 5 gallon bucket ) ( ~ $ 20 ) A small submersible garden pump . ( I have no idea what temperature they 're rated for , but I use one in my greenhouse hydroponics systems , and it gets rather warm in there in the summer ) ( $ 10-20 ) An immersion heater ( ~ $ 65 ) : a <URL> Total : ~ $ 100 If you 're comfortable wiring up your own circuits , you could likely make your own temperature control unit for less , as that 's the bulk of the cost . If you 're not comfortable with all of this , then the <URL> ( currently $ 25 off , bringing it to ~ $ 155 ) . You 'll have to supply your own water container . Update : Ecnerwal got me thinking -- vessels with thermostat controls . ( heater is easy , it 's the thermostat that 's expensive ) . Crock pots have the unfortunate problem that they only have one to three present temperatures ( low , high and warm ) . There are , however , a few things that might be useful : a deep-fat fryer . Preferably cleaned , or one that can be disassembled to clean . They tend to have very powerful heating elements , so you may need a screen to ensure that the pump and the food do n't get to close to it . You 'll also want to check the dial for the lowest temperature that it can maintain . ( it might not go below 200 ° F ) electric skillet . They 're quite shallow , but if you 're just cooking a steak for 1 or 2 , it might work . ( again , check the dial to see what the minimum temp it 'll hold is ) . Depending on he size , it might be possible to put another container inside it to hold more water . Coffee urns . They can be much larger , but they typically just have one setting , so you ' dd need a termostat on it .
Instant pudding contains a significant amount of cornstarch . It also contains less significant amounts of disodium phosphate and tetrasodium phosphate . All three of these ingredients will have an effect on cake . Starch absorbs water and gels during baking . This interferes with gluten formation to some degree . If you break down the starch in flour , which is , in part , how you make cake flour , the starches are more able to do this job . Cornstarch is nearly all starch . Adding it to your cake will make your flour behave more like cake flour , while increasing your cake 's hydration . The phosphates also affect your cake , but to a lesser degree . Depending on the other ingredients in your cake , they will act as a leavening agent that will help to prevent the addition of all that pudding from making your cake too heavy . Many bakers rely on a secret trick that you might try instead of pudding . They replace two tablespoons of flour in any cake recipe with cornstarch . I do this not only in cakes , but in pie dough .
Water treatment often uses chlorine or chloramine to kill germs or algae . If you are smelling it it 's more likely to be Chloramine than Chlorine . Chlorine will dissipate from water over time naturally , but boiling for 20 minute will drive it out . Chloramine will also dissipate naturally , but in a much longer time frame , and would take over a day to boil out . So boiling water will get rid of chlorine but not chloramine ( at least not in a useful time frame ) , and boiling will concentrate other minerals in the water which is usually undesirable . It will also de-oxygenate the water , making it flat . Flat water is n't great for cooking - compare the flavor of a cup of tea or coffee brewed with flat water as opposed to fresh and you 'll see what I mean . Your best option for water treatment chemical removal at home is an activated charcoal filter unless you want to invest in a UV treatment system , which would seem to be a bit OTT . You could also use a reducing agent from a brewery supply company , but if all you want is some fresh tasting and smelling water then the filter is your best option . <URL> has a thread on this which is worth reading .
Buy whole bean coffee ( preferably freshly roasted , maybe even from a local roaster ) . Start with a rough grind . Use a burr grinder to achieve a more consistent grind . If the grinder has a french press or coarse setting use that , else experiment with it to find a consistency that produces coffee you like . Take out your plunger and place 1 T of grounds per 4 oz ( 115 g ) of coffee that you are making . Again you can experiment with the amount of coffee you put in to get something that suits you taste . Use 4 oz of water per T of grounds that you put in the press . Fill your press with water no more than about 1 " ( 25 mm ) below the spout ( if you have a smaller press you go a bit higher , but not too much or you 'll spill ) . The water temp recommended is ~ 200 ° F ( 95 ° C ) ( just short of boiling . Stir gently , if you have a large pot use a chopstick . If you have a small pot a plastic spoon or coffee stirrer will work . Put the plunger in the coffee and press down slightly so all of the grounds are below the water level , this will press out some of the air in the grounds and also ensure even wetting . Wait ~ 4 minutes ( again , experiment here to determine best flavour ) . Press your pot slowly and gently . If you encounter too much resistance wait a moment ( or even pull back on the press a bit ) and then continue ( too much resistance can indicate too fine a grind , try a larger grind next time ) . When your plunger is all the way down wait a few moments and then pour . Waiting a bit allows some of the sediment to settle out of the coffee so you get less in your coffee cup . Some sediment is normal and provides body , but too much can be a turnoff . If you will not be drinking all of the coffee you made , decant it into a different pot so that it does not continue to steep in the grounds . While there is some <URL> here . A lot of what you do is informed by your own tastes and preferences . Experiment with it and see what you like . Spend some time deciding what kind of coffee , how long it steeps , how fine a grind you need and even how much sediment you like .
Authentic flour tortillas use lard . For an authentic taste , use that , or consider using shortening or butter since they are solid at room temperature like lard . You also might want to consider increasing the fat in your recipe . Fat will coat the proteins of your flour and keep the gluten network from forming so easily . I was also taught when making tortillas to let the dough rest for an hour after kneading and before rolling/pressing . This helps everything relax . After cooking each tortilla , put them in a pile with a clean towel over them . The tortillas will sweat liquid , helping them to soften up . You can also put them all in a heat-safe bag ( paper or microwave safe plastic ) for sweating . When storing your tortillas , make sure to store them in a bag and not in the open air . If your tortillas are too small , you should be able to roll out a larger piece of dough . Part of the texture issues might actually be from you rolling them too thin . If you are used to working with dough your ideas of thin might be different from the overstated ones found in recipes . Try rolling to various thicknesses .
I 'd suggest a <URL> AND an instant read digital thermometer like the <URL> ( which is pretty cheap ) or the <URL> ( which is n't ) . A leave-in probe lets you monitor the general progress of the food , giving you a good way to gauge how much cooking time remains without having to open the oven and slow down the process . The instant read variety is great for checking the internal temperature of all sorts of food that you might not normally measure -- steaks on the grill , mashed potatoes , stocks and soups ( to make sure that they 're cooling quickly enough ) , bread ( to check for doneness ) ... Both leave-in and instant read are extremely useful , and neither of them will expose your turkey to the risk of glass shards .
What you will be dealing with is called stratification . Given a reasonable volume of water the difference can be quite remarkable . A one metre height of water can stratify water from 20 ° C to 95 ° C as long as the water is not disturbed and heated gently , even if heated from the bottom The simple solution is to regularly stir the water , say once every five minutes . This would be OK for items only requiring an hour in sous-vide , but for much longer this can get rather tedious If you are targeting temperatures in the 40 ° C to 65 ° C range a small aquarium pump would suffice to stir the water . Arrange the intake tube nearly floating on top , and the output tube weighted on to the bottom . At a pinch an aquarium bubbler would help significantly too . Both these devices will cool the water somewhat , but a stove top heater should be able to keep up Example : Using a small bubbler in a large , well-insulated chest ( Rubbermaid cooler , Esky , chilly bin etc. ) with around 10 l of water at 60 ° C , keeps the temperature within 1 ° C from top to bottom . Heat loss is around 1 ° C per 30 minutes . By adding about 0.5 l of 95 ° C water every 30 minutes it keeps the temperature constant over a few hours To get precise temperature control within ± 0.5 ° C which some sous-vide recipes recommend , you will need a <URL> controller . For general home use with temperature control or ± 3 ° C you could get away with a stove top heater , with accurate power control and a thermometer control system . <URL> , so you might as well add that to your controller too
The cut is important for both techniques . For sauteing , you need a lean cut - fillet , sirloin , or good rump steak . These should be cooked quickly over a high heat . As Cerberus has suggested , if you are cooking something else in the same pan , take the beef out and re-add it later ; do n't boil it in a sauce . Stewing beef needs some fat and cartilage which breaks down during slow cooking and tenderises the meat . Packs of such beef are usually sold as such in the supermarket ; look for a pack with plenty of fat marbled through the meat ; ' Lean stewing steak ' is as useful as a waterproof teabag ! My personal favourite stewing beef is brisket , as it breaks down into nice tender fibres after 2-3 hours cooking . Contrary to popular belief , browning meat does nothing to ' seal in the juices ' . It simply provides a bit of extra colour and flavour by ' caramelising ' the outside a little . So if you have a strong flavoured stew ( like a chilli , for example ) , just throw the chunks of meat straight into the sauce .
It depends on how moist you like your jerky . A typical jerky loses half of its starting weight in moisture , so 2:1 is the proper ratio . " Low moisture " jerky can actually be 1/3 the starting weight , a 3:1 ratio . So 2-3 pounds of beef will make 1 pound of jerky .
Go for 145 . 2 hours . Salmonella dies even at " low " temperatures ( from 135 ) as long as you cook it for longer . 135 for at least 87 minutes , will kill salmonella . However , I like it best when cooked at 145 for 2 hours .
Just omit the mustard . In just about every recipe I have seen for beans , it is proportionally a very small component . And while we tend to think of mustard as being bold in flavor , it 's really the vinegar that makes it seem that way . You should also stray from any recipes that call for store bought barbecue sauces , as many will contain mustard . Finally , one reason mustard appears as an ingredient in dishes like this is it is an emulsifier . You may wish to find a substitute emulsifier , making sure of course that your friend can handle it as an ingredient , to keep too much of the pork fat from separating in your mixture .
Yes . If you would n't drink it , do n't cook with it . Whatever it tastes like out of the bottle , it will add that to the dish . Cook with a wine you might pair with the dish ( light wines for seafood , chicken ; heavier wines for meats and stews ) . Do n't use a fruity wine unless you want your dish to have some fruit notes . Do n't use a very dry wine if you 're making a sweeter dish .
You could use oil , but I do n't think it 's worth it ; realize that you 're going to be using additional energy for obtaining , cleaning , and disposal of it . Regarding using a broth with a porous bag , well , that is n't sous vide . That 's more akin to a slow-cooker . The whole point of sous vide is the airtight barrier between food and heat . Update Oil does not have a higher thermal mass than water . Ammonia does , but I 'd suggest avoiding that . ;) Source : <URL>
One of the benefits of sous vide cooking is that you can not cook food over the temperature set , if you set the temp to 70 degrees it 's physically impossible for it to go over that . This means that if you cook it longer than it needs to get up to the desired temperature you wo n't dry it out . I would think for guineafowl that 120 minutes would be enough . As for temperature shock you 'd have to go much higher than 70C to run into that , so I 'd start with the water at your desired temperature . As for sauces guineafowl is very rich and savory , so something with acidity would help to balance it . I like your sauce idea and think it would work fine . Riesling is a good choice if you get one with a more mineral character than a sweet bomb , although a squeeze of lemon can supplement the acidity if needed .
Not sure if there is a correct way . It 's basically skewered hunks of meat on a wood fired BBQ You can do your own Churrasqueira by using a Weber " kettle " style BBQ or a B.D.S. ( Big Drum Smoker ) . Use long steel skewers ( or swords ! ) for your meat and BBQ away Thick steaks of beef and lamb work well . Also try chicken drumsticks and some small Chorizo ( spicy sausage ) Do n't marinate the meat , but toss some coarse salt onto the meat surface before and during cooking . Do n't go crazy with it , but it seems to absorb the roasting flavours and really boost the taste Use a smoky fire , if your wood wo n't smoke add some fresh wood or herbs that do . Try lavender bush ( wood and flower ) , grape vine or kiwifruit vine cuttings , or any other fresh cut aromatic wood Watch the amount of fat dripping onto the hot coals ; too much will make the meat taste bad . Shield the coals as required or trim off large chunks of fat There is no need for motorised skewers that takes the fun out of it . Occasionally turn the meat by hand while enjoying your favourite beverage , and " chewing the fat " with a friend Serve by taking a skewer to the diners plate , and hold skewer nearly vertically above plate . Use an extra sharp carving knife and slice onto the plate with a downwards cut so juices and other slicing splatter goes onto the plate and not onto the diners If you are having a Churrasco party , give each diner a flippable symbol ( e.g. red/green ) to indicate to the server ( probably you ) " GIVE ME MORE ! " , or " I am stuffed " . Serve a round of each meat as their outer layer becomes done Coolest Churrasco cooker I could find The rails on the top are what the skewers rest on Following the car theme , some more cool Churrasco cookers here <URL>
One thing you can do is use much longer pieces of acetate and cut the long cigarillos afterwards gently with a hot knife . That way your spreading and rolling action is cut down to 1/2 or 1/3 .
A 9 " round pan that is 1 1/2 " deep takes 6 cups of batter , while one that is 2 " deep takes 8 . That 's for totally full to the brim . This <URL> says about the amount of batter from a box : An average 2-layer cake mix yields 4 to 5 1/2 cups of batter . and should have a bunch of helpful guides to using batter for non-standard pans .
The goal is to evaporate alcohol and concentrate flavor . If adding wine to a mirepoix , or sofrito ... some sort of early stage aromatic vegetable ... reduce the wine almost until the pan goes dry , but not dry enough to cause sticking or burning . The flavor will be absorbed into the vegetable and you are good to go . If there is another instance of wine addition that you are considering , please specify .
A thermometer is the only way to be sure . For methods with a consistent level of heat ( stove , oven ) , you should able to learn the average cooking time , and outwards cues of color and texture that match the right internal temperature . Remember that these will vary with cooking method and temperature . Internally , the meat should look opaque and white . These are CUES of doneness , not guarantees . Use the thermometer . For methods with inconsistent levels of heat ( bbq , campfire ) , wait until it looks nearly done and then check with the thermometer . Err on the safe side . Prepared properly , chicken is a lot more forgiving of overcooking than steak .
The only way to be completely sure is to contact Foster Farms and ask them what their packaging is made of and whether or not it is a totally airtight seal . Everything else is speculation . There are , however , two data points on which to speculate , both from their <URL> , and this is more broadly applicable to any company that distributes food this way : Can I freeze chicken in its original wrapper ? Yes , the original packaging is fine for freezing up to two months . For longer freezing , over-wrap packages with foil , plastic wrap , freezer paper or plastic bags . Generally something that 's been properly vacuum-sealed will last much longer than that . The above would seem to indicate that it is not completely airtight and may even allow a small amount of moisture to get through . What 's the best method for thawing frozen chicken or turkey ? [ ... ] You can also defrost in your microwave following the manufacturer 's instructions . Remove chicken from the original package , and place on a microwave safe dish to defrost . ( emphasis mine ) This pretty clearly indicates that it is not microwave-safe , and proper vacuum bags that are safe for sous-vide are generally also microwave safe ( even the cheapo FoodSaver products claim that you can boil , steam , or microwave in the bag ) . So I am leaning quite heavily toward no - I do n't think that the original packaging is safe for sous-vide , given the various other statements made by the company . But again , the best way to know for sure is to contact them directly .

How can I tell if soy sauce is of good quality ?
The simplest rule of thumb is to read the ingredients : Water , soybeans , wheat , salt ( and maybe something to preserve it ) . Other brands , may list wheat before soybeans . " Good quality " and taste may be two different things ( like wine ) . So , it gets a bit tricky to answer . And then there 's reduced sodium and light soy which may have other ingredients . This link may be useful . It covers Japanese soy sauce and touches on the " Grades of Soy Sauce " : <URL> .
Cantaloupe should feel heavier than it looks and smell musky and sweet . Also you should be able to press your thumb in slightly on the bottom and there should n't be a lip around the stem . If it smells over-sweet it 's most likely over ripe . You can let a cantaloupe ripen on your counter top if you get one under-ripe
I have found a few recipes on the web : <URL> <URL> There are also a few hard to find ready-made vegan Worcestershire sauces on the market , such as <URL> . When I read these recipes ( which I have never made ) I can tell that their flavor profile is missing some key aromas present in the original Worcestershire sauce . As strange as it may sound these sauces could use some of the aromas found in Parmigiano-Reggiano and in broccoli . Whichever recipe works out , someone should write a blog post on this topic .
Short version : If it 's only overnight , and you seal the containers reasonably well , you 'll be okay prepping any of those ingredients ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator overnight . I often leave onions in the fridge when preparing a recipe that calls for only half an onion , or if I 've decided to use less than I prepped , or if I 'm making a salsa and I chop the onions before realizing I do n't have as many tomatoes as I thought , etc. . If you do n't cover them they will dry out a bit , but overnight does n't do much harm ; I find if they 're tightly covered , whether in a glass bowl with plastic wrap or a sealed plastic storage container , they 're just as good the next day . The same goes for carrots and celery . I 'm sure there 's been a time when I prepped too much mirepoix ; but generally speaking , if you have a cut carrot or stalk of celery in the fridge , it does n't suffer too much overnight . More than a day and it starts to dry out ; the cut surface of the carrot will start to look like the end near the tops , and possibly split . The celery dries out more quickly , as it 's got higher water content and more fragile structure to begin with ; more than a day and it 'll lose its color , eventually turning limp and yellow , starting from the cut end . For the veggies , the way to keep them freshest is with a tight seal and as little air as possible . You could put them in a zipper bag and squeeze out any extra air but I think a reasonably-sized glass bowl , covered tightly with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge , is good enough for 12-24 hours . If you do n't have room in the fridge , you 'll probably still be okay , and they may even be less prone to drying out ( the air in your fridge is very low-humidity ; sometimes you have a special compartment for which the humidity can be adjusted , for fruits and vegetables ) . I have less experience prepping meat ahead of time , unless I 'm brining or marinading it ; in those situations , the meat 's covered by a liquid that contains preservatives ( salt , acid ) that help prevent it from spoiling , and it 's always refrigerated . Keeping it cool and minimizing the contact with air or contaminants is the main thing . If you only have enough room in the fridge to store some of your prepped ingredients , use it for the meat . In this case I 'd say a zipper bag with the air squeezed out is the clear way to go ; meat is malleable and you 'll be able to get nearly all of the air out , which means it 'll store almost as well as it did before you chopped it into pieces . The thing to remember about ground , chopped or cubed meat is that anything that contaminated the outside surface of the original cut is now mixed evenly throughout . This is why it 's generally safer to order a steak rare than it is to order a hamburger rare ; the center of the steak has n't been exposed to as much of its environment as the center of the burger , during handling and storage . So even if you refrigerate your prepped meat in a sealed container with the air evacuated , effectively storing it just as well as when it was in the original packaging and in one piece , I would n't expect it to keep the same effective " use by " date because it 's been disturbed and mixed and exposed to the environment of your prep area . You 're better off doing this with a cut that you purchased recently , which has n't been refrozen and is n't nearing expiration .
Venison is , generally , an extremely lean meat . This means it responds well to two cooking methods : very very fast and very very hot ( grilling , perhaps roasting with a lot of basting , or lard the meat first ) , or very very slow and moist ( braising ) . This is of course dependent on the cut ; loin is best grilled , shoulder is best braised ( due to the connective tissue ) , leg is best roasted . I would n't use plain water as a braising liquid . 50/50 water and red wine , or stock and wine , or just stock ... cider would be lovely , so would various juices .
In general you need to consider the purpose of the ingredient , and what would happen to it during the cooking that it 's missed . For example , there 's no point stirring a spoonful of flour into a sauce after cooking , since the flour needs heat in order to thicken the sauce . In the case of the tomato paste , not much will happen to that particular ingredient during cooking . It may have caramelised a little , depending on the cooking method . It would have infused more deeply into some of the other ingredients . But these are subtle things . Taste your finished product . If you feel it would benefit from an extra boost of tomato flavour , by all means stir in some tomato paste .
I have a bottle of San-J Tamari ( black label ) in my fridge and the back reads : Tamari is a premium soy sauce made with more soybeans than ordinary soy sauce giving it a richer , smoother , more complex taste . Tamari has more flavor enhancing properties than salt . Add 1 tsp . ( 320 mg sodium ) instead of tsp . salt ( 590 mg sodium ) to reduce sodium intake . Stir-fry or marinate poultry , meat fish and vegetables . Add 1-2 tsp . to perk up sauces , soups , gravies and casseroles . In my experience , I use a little less tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce . As Sean mentioned , it 's definitely a bit stronger than regular soy sauce . I eyeball most of the time , but I 'd say I use 1/2 to 3/4 portion of tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce . I reach for the tamari when I want a bit more of a complex flavor on something plain like rice - when the soy sauce is to be the star of the dish , essentially . I tend to use regular soy sauce when mixing into a larger homemade sauce or where the soy sauce flavor will blend into the background because the recipe calls for so many other strong ingredients . Oh , and tamari seems to add a bit of an almost " smoky " flavor , it seems .
That is wax , it 's done to help keep the moisture in the root . Turnips are also . You know it 's getting along when it gets soft and spongy or when the skin starts to wrinkle , same with turnips , beets , parsnips , carrots ... You pretty much can tell whether they are good or not in exactly the same ways . Are the firm and crisp or soft , flabby and spongy ?
No <URL> : " There are no outward characteristics that all poisonous mushrooms have in common , so picking and eating wild mushrooms requires the utmost caution . To be absolutely safe , the only mushrooms you should eat are those found at supermarkets and restaurants ! All the old wives ' tales about how to tell if a mushroom is poisonous -- such as whether it tarnishes silverware or turns blue when bruised -- are dead wrong . There 's a saying that there 's no such thing as an old , bold mushroom hunter . "
There are <URL> on the market that come with a lot of solids , and it 's perfectly normal for those to have all kinds of chunky weirdness if they 've sat for a little while . Wine vinegar has a wide range of normal behaviour : it can get <URL> * or <URL> , and that 's normal . Even filtered vinegar can develop cloudiness and still be perfectly safe . If your distilled vinegar gets cloudy , I 'd worry . That should n't happen . Still , foreign bacteria do NOT grow well in vinegar . If your distilled vinegar is growing something , you probably know why . <URL> , unless you 're storing it outside on your deck , or something . If you brew your own , your mileage may vary . * This is often a result of leaving live bacteria ( <URL> ) in the vinegar . <URL> , like live yoghurt cultures . There is n't much data either way , but it 's certainly not harmful .
Your typical Tamari is , to my understanding , going to be closer to dark than light soy sauce . So you 'd want light as a second soy sauce . Inside Japan , there are five kinds of soy sauce : Koikuchi , which is your most typical soy sauce Usukuchi , which is lighter because it has fermented rice in it Tamari , which has more soy than wheat and thus is a bit darker Shiro , which has more wheat than soy and thus is a bit lighter Saishikomi , which is " twice-brewed " and thus twice as dark In China , you have two : regular " light " soy sauce , and " dark " , which is the light stuff processed further and aged . Therefore , " sashikomi " is the Japanese equivalent to dark soy sauce , if you want to stick with Japanese classifications . If your recipes are aimed at english-speaking audiences , however , the terms are likely to be used a lot looser and less precisely than in Japan or China . Kikkoman , which is the biggest name brand I 've seen in the US , brews a regular , a Tamari , and a gluten-free ( Tamari can have some gluten in it ) . Therefore , I would normally assume that to an American chef , " dark soy sauce " is Tamari . " Light soy sauce " might mean the low-sodium stuff , or it might mean Shiro or Usukuchi . Your basic unqualified " soy sauce " is Koikuchi .
The only way to test for capsaicin besides tasting is chemical testing , namely liquid chromatography . Problem is , the same kind of chili can be quite different in heat , even on the same bush it can be quite different from my experience . No idea why , though . Here is one tip on how to check the heat of a chili without actually eating part of it , but still cutting it apart : Cut through the chili below the stem , touch the membranes , touch your tongues , feel the heat . <URL> You can adjust the amount of heat a chili adds to the dish by removing the white membranes . Just add the colored flesh , check for heat , and add membranes until the desired spiciness is obtained . Capsaicin is only produced in the white mebranes in the center . It may move inside the fruit , though . Areas closer to the membranes will be hotter ( like , the seeds ) , than other parts .
Thickening with starch or flour instead of roux can be quite acceptable if some other rich flavors are added . Here is where the calories can be traded in : Good low-fat broth for part of the liquid . celery root or coriander root are particularly good ing . for veggie broth Puree , in small amounts add body and flavor . soft cooked onion is particularly silky and surprisingly mild Flavorsome oils , few drops instead of copious butter . Macadamia punches above its weight . Sesame toasted ( tiny amount ) or if feeling adventurous , pricklyash from Asian market . lower-fat ' milks ' can add luscious body instead of cream or 3 % dairy milk . Unsweetened Almond or coconut does n't overwhelm most sauces .
Last summer was a long time ago . The National Center for Food Preservation has this to say about <URL> Oils may be flavored with herbs if they are made up for fresh use , stored in the refrigerator and used within 2 to 3 days . There are no canning recommendations . ... Pesto is an uncooked seasoning mixture of herbs , usually including fresh basil , and some oil . It may be frozen for long term storage <URL> is a serious enough hazard with oiled herbs that I 'd not trust a dash of lemon juice on top of the oil to protect me from getting sick after 9 months storage . You 're much safer freezing the stuff as recommended . Ice cube trays produce nice pesto cubes that you can store safely in a freezer bag for at least a couple years .
Red pizza sauce is often ( but not always ) two things : Thicker . Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings , otherwise thin is fine . Depending on the crust , the heat of the oven , the toppings above sauce , and how watery it is , this may not be needed . If you 've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand . If you 've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese , precook and reduce the sauce . It 's often simpler . Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection . They 're all about the sauce . Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it . Many of the best pizzas are simply topped . Crushed san marzano tomatoes ( sometimes ) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do , and franky , it 's enough . I 'm not talking about the jarred varieties here , but what you might cook at home . Jars in the store , the main difference is just how thick it is .
In general , it is a good idea to go light on spices when trying a new recipe , if you 're not intimately familiar with the flavor and spice combinations in question . It 's a great deal easier to add spice later than it is to mask it once you 've added too much . Assuming you are reading this because you did n't do that , and have now ended up with a sauce that 's far too spicy , then read on . The pertinent question here is where is the spiciness coming from ? There are actually several kinds of compounds that can produce that general aroma and/or sensation . In most dishes they 'll tend to fall loosely into one or more of the following : <URL> , which is the active alkaloid in black pepper . This has poor solubility in water , however , it has better solubility in alcohol . If you can incorporate wine or better yet , brandy or vodka or some other strong alcohol , this can go a long way toward reducing the heat from pepper . <URL> , the heat-producing compound in most types of hot peppers , is the highest on the <URL> ; extremely piquant and can produce a " burning " sensation in very small quantities . It is also poorly soluble in water , but is far more soluble in fat , especially oils . Adding some olive oil or a good quantity of butter to your recipe is a good bet for reducing capsaicin/capsicum heat . Garlic , onion , and other members of the <URL> family put out a volatile sulfur compound called <URL> . Although this is not " spicy " in the same sense as pepper , many people perceive it as such . Like piperine , it is more soluble in alcohol than in water . However , and here 's the catch : That allicin breaks down into various <URL> when cooked , and those polysulfides are fat soluble . So if you 're trying to mask a strong garlic or onion flavour , it 's best if you can add alcohol and fat to cover all your bases . If you 've added too much Ginger - another ingredient often perceived as spicy - then you 're dealing with <URL> and <URL> , the latter of which pack a much bigger punch . One of the things you can actually do with ginger is <URL> which converts those into much milder <URL> . In other words , add some water to the sauce and then boil it to reduce the sauce again - you 'll lose some flavour but in the process you 'll break down the ginger spice . Alternatively ( for ginger ) , all of the above compounds are alkali soluble , so if you add a buffering agent - say , <URL> ( additive E331 ) , it will improve the solubility a great deal . If , like most people , you do n't happen to keep food additives in your kitchen , you can try using something like baking soda , but too much of that will completely ruin the taste , so be careful . In fact , do n't add too much of any buffer because the acidity of most sauces is an integral part of their flavor . I think that about covers it for common " spicy stuff " that goes in sauces . If you want to fix a dish that 's too spicy , you need to know where the spice is coming from and choose what 's most appropriate for that particular sauce . You can also try to mask or balance the spice with something sweet , for example roasted vegetables or plain old sugar . That will not eliminate the heat at all , but does seem to make it more tolerable for many .
In Germany we have an old ( joking ) saying that roughly translates to " head off , tail off - bunny " , so your question is legitimate . But first thing 's first : There is no health risk involved if you ate the latest shipment of " meowling rabbit " . ( To cat lovers everywhere : This is no endorsement , I have a much loved and pampered cat , too ! ) The most obvious differences are head ( look at the teeth ! ) , tail ( short vs. long ) , and feet ( cat claws are quite distinctive ) . But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale , so we 'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy : Shoulder blades : Cats ' shoulder blades are rounded on top , especially in the front , making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts , rabbits ' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side . Femur ( thigh bone ) : A cat 's femora are straight , whereas a rabbit 's is more or less bent , especially pronounced in older animals . Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna ( forearm ) , but they might have been removed . Ribs : Cats ' ribs are " rounder " than rabbits ' ribs according to <URL> . I ca n't say by how much , but <URL> 's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie <URL> . Pelvis : The same source as above states that the <URL> ( = the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint ) is oval in rabbits and round in cats . I could n't find a good picture to show this , though . Here 's a rabbit : Source : <URL> And a cat :
<URL> has a list of Umami-rich foods along with natural concentrations of glutamate . I 've copied some of their list below ( included some meats for comparison ) in case the link disappears ( concentration number is mg glutamate/100g food ) . There 's also some information at the above link about how to prepare the foods to maximize the umami taste . Food/Concentration : Beef/107 Tuna/188 Nori/1378 ( not a typo ) Tomatoes/246 ( the riper the better ) Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms/71 Dried Shiitake Mushrooms/150 Enoki Mushrooms/22 Soy Beans/66 Potatoes/102 Sweet Potatoes/60 Chinese Cabbage/100 Carrots/33
I 'd be more concerned about the meat 's safety than taste/texture . " Warm " thawing creates the perfect environment for bacteria growth . That having been said , my experience mainly involves the use of a microwave to thaw meat . When microwaving meat to thaw , try to avoid the meat having corners or protrusions . This adversely affects taste/texture because they usually start to cook before the rest of the meat thaws . Freeze ground meat , in a circular shape with a hole in the middle for quickest microwave thawing time . When thawing meat ' parts ' place them in a circle , thickest side outward . So long as no noticeable cooking has started , the taste/texture should be fine . Cook immediately .
I tried freezing tzatziki sauce but was n't happy with it when thawed as it seemed to separate easily and even when mixed thoroughly it seemed to have a different , more watery texture than when fresh . What I do now if I have cucumbers I need to use is to prepare and process them exactly as I would for fresh tzatziki sauce . I freeze the processed cucumber in 1/2 or 1 cup containers and thaw to make fresh tzatziki sauce . Works great and the added bonus is that it does n't take up as much room in the freezer .

Why do my hamburgers smoke ?
There are a couple of things that jump out at me : 170 F ( 77 C ) - This is overkill for ground beef . The USDA guidelines recommend 160 F ( 71 C ) . Venting holes - This is unnecessary . There is no need to " vent " a hamburger . What you 're doing is creating holes for the juices to flow out of and get vaporized on the pan . This is likely a significant source of the smoking you describe . Keep those juices in ! I 'm not familiar with electric stoves , so I 'm not sure if 6/8 is too hot or not , but it might be . I cook my burgers on a gas stove at medium-high flame and generally do 5 mins per side for a medium burger ( I grind my own beef ) . My burgers are about an 3/4 " - 1 " thick too . So you might have your stove too hot , try turning it down a smidge . Update I want to clarify regarding the " blood " you are worried about . It 's a common misconception that the red liquid packaged with beef is blood . It 's not . Beef is drained of virtually all blood when it is slaughtered . Beef is 75 % water , so the liquid you see is mostly water and the pink hue comes from the iron &amp; oxygen binding protein <URL> which exists in muscle tissue . When cooking , the juices you are releasing are taking a lot of the flavor with them . This liquid is a combination of liquified fat , water , and proteins . You can verify this at the <URL> site for beef . Another common misconception is that a completely grey-brown interior indicates well done . According to the USDA , 25 % of burgers turn brown before being fully cooked ; this can happen as low as 135 F ( 57 C ) . The inverse is true as well , some beef can be cooked to the USDA recommended safe temperature 160 F ( 71 C ) and still retain some light pinkness in the center . If your concern is merely safety , cooking the beef to an interior temperature of 160 F is sufficient , regardless of it 's hue . If you you 're cooking it beyond that just because you do n't like the sight of pink meat , well you 're overcooking your burgers and doing yourself a bit of injustice . :)
Most pestos use olive oil , which solidifies at around 6 degrees celsius - just over the temperature of the average fridge . The shop-bought pestos you buy probably adulterate the olive oil with other kinds of oils . In any case , you 'll be able to eat your pesto just by leaving it out at room temperature for a few hours , or by just scooping it out and adding to your hot pasta .
What you 're describing is n't all that different from how they make various products like Liquid Smoke ( make smoke along with steam , then condense that steam ) . You will need to make sure that some actual condensation occurs ( for example , by having a lid for the smokey vapor to condense onto ) . However , it may be simpler to add a liquid smoke-type product directly ; at least the main brands are actually smoke distillates ( and not artificial flavorings or similar ) and thus should be effectively identical to this process , but quicker .
Basic Physics of the System Bread rises ( as you probably know ) due to microorganisms , primarily yeast , converting sugars into CO ₂ + byproducts . The CO ₂ forms bubbles , stretching the gluten in the flour . In order for the bread to rise , the microorganisms must produce CO ₂ faster than it can escape from the dough . Graphed over time , the amount of CO ₂ produced would start at 0 , fairly quickly rise to its maximum ( as the yeast , etc. come back from dormancy ) , then slowly decrease , eventually to 0 ( as they run out of food and/or are overwhelmed by byproducts such as alcohol ) . The amount of gas escaping from the dough also changes over time . It must obviously start at 0 , and probably increases over time ( after all , there is more to escape ) , and eventually of course its all escaped and thus it must be 0 again , but I 'm not sure of its exact shape . So , a diagram : That 's the basic physics of the system . At some point , the bread must fall . ( Well , maybe in a 0-g environment it would shrink instead of fall , but ... ) How the Environment Matters The microorganisms are very sensitive to fairly small changes in their environment . In particular : Temperature . If your kitchen is 70 ° F and the author 's is 80 ° F , it could easily take twice as long . The lower the temperature , the slow the microorganisms go ( up to a point , once it gets too hot , they 're not happy either ) . Hydration . If your bread dough is lower hydration ( drier ) than the author 's , it 'll be slowed down again . The recipe is written in volume measures ( cups ) , as you know flour packs down . That leads to huge variations in how two different people measure it . Make sure to measure it how the author says to ( hopefully it specified somewhere in the book ) . Scoop-and-sweep vs. sift-and-sweep can easily be 25 % different . Preferably , spend $ 25 on a kitchen scale , and do your baking by weight . Salinity . Salt slows down yeast . If you happened to substitute table salt for kosher salt , and still measured out 1 1/2 tablespoons , you 've used more salt than the author wanted . A fair bit more . Age of your yeast . If your yeast is old ( and sometimes the packets in the store have been sitting for ages ) , it may not have the same potency as a fresh packet would . It 'll probably take longer ( but as long as it rises , it 'll likely be fine ) The times in the book could just be nonsense . Authors and editors do sometimes make mistakes . Other times they 're in a rush , and just take a guess . " Yeah , it was about two hours ... " The book could just be wrong . Also , generally speaking , slower leads to better flavor . So its not a bad thing . Summary Give it longer . Provided you 've covered it in plastic ( so it does n't dry out ) , it 'll eventually fall . Keep in mind that " fall " does n't mean it 'll return to its original size , just that it 'll fall back from its maximum size . The " or flattens on top " comment in your book is a pretty accurate description of what it looks like . Normally , while its rising , there is a dome shape on top , with the center as the highest point . When it starts falling , that dome vanishes , and may even invert ( as in , the center will be the lowest point ) . I 've made preferments that take upwards of 20 hours to fall . It will eventually happen . And when it takes forever , it 'll probably taste better .
You are probably stirring the pudding too much . Cornstarch starts thickening at about 205 ° F/95 ° C . Once the pudding has got to that point and has thickened , stop stirring , otherwise you will interfere with the starch formation that causes the thickening . Using electric beaters probably means you are missing the point when the pudding has thickened and quickly beating the living daylights out of any starch formation that has occurred . It may also be the case that you are beating so much air into the pudding that it just does n't get hot enough to activate the cornstarch in the first place . I would use @ecnerwal 's suggestion of a double boiler , along with a balloon whisk , and some patience .
This is the nature of meringue : they will start to fall apart as soon as you stop whipping . There are a few tricks to help it hold longer , but in general you want to have EVERYTHING ready to go as soon as the meringue is whipped . To help stabilize the meringue you can : Use a copper or SILVER-plated bowl to whip , or add a tiny amount of powdered copper supplement from a health food store Acidify it slightly : add 1/8 tsp cream of tartar or 1/2 tsp lemon juice per white , before beating Let the bowl warm to room temperature , which increases the ability of the whites to take in air Ensure there is absolutely no yolk in with the whites . The fat greatly destabilizes the foam . Now for WHY these tricks work : I 'm going to quote heavily from Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " , as it does a wonderful job explaining meringues and other whipped egg whites : Like the head on a beer or a cappucino , an egg foam is a liquid -- the white -- filled with a gas -- air -- in such a way that the mixuture of liquid and gas keeps its shape , like a solid . It 's a mass of bubbles , with air inside each bubble , and the white spread out into a thin film to form the bubble walls . And the makeup of these liquid walls determines how long a foam can stand up . Pure water has such a strong surface tension -- such strong attractive forces among its molecules -- that it immediately starts to pull itself together into a compact puddle ; and it 's so runny that it puddles almost immediately . The many nonwater molecules in egg white both reduce the surface tension of the water they float in , and make it less runny , and thus allow the bubbles to survive long enough to accumulate in a sizeable mass . What gives the mass of foam a useful kitchen lifetime is the white 's team of proteins . Whisking unfolds these proteins , primarily globulins and ovotranferrin , which bond to each other and stabilize the bubble walls . Cooking will evaporate the water and unfold ovoalbumin , creating a rigid and permanent protein network . However , the same proteins can ALSO destabilize the foam if they bond too tightly . " The protein network begins to collapse when too many of these bonds accumulate and the proteins cluster together too tightly " ( page 102 ) . In the case of egg proteins , one of the strongest bonds is a disulfide bond between the sulfur-containing amino acids , cysteine and methionine . Eggs contain copious quantities of these amino acids , which are why they produce such a potent stench when they spoil ; the sulfur is converted to malodorous sulfur compounds , particularly hydrogen sulfide . Copper , silver , and acids stabilize the egg foam by preventing the formation of these disulfide bonds . To quote Harold McGee ( page 103 ) : It turns out that along with a few other metals , copper has the useful tendency to form extremely tight bonds with reactive sulfur groups : so tight that the sulfur is essentially preventing from reacting with anything else . So the presence of copper in foaming eggs whites essentially eliminates the strongest kind of protein bond that can form , and makes it harder for the proteins to embrace each other too tightly . McGee also notes that silver has the same property of inhibiting disulfide bonding . Acid achieves the same goal of reducing disulfide bonding , but works slightly differently : The sulfur bonds form when the sulfur-hydrogen ( S-H ) groups on two different protein molecules shed their hydrogens and form a sulfur-sulfur ( S-S ) connection with each other . The addition of an acid boosts the number of free-floating hydrogen ( H ) ions in the egg white , which makes it much harder for the S-H groups to shed their own H , and so slows the sulfur bonding down to a crawl .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
All of the answers you are looking for have been touched on in various parts of this question : <URL> Summary : Expiration dates are for best quality only . Nothing magical happens on that date . Truly fresh eggs ( i.e. from the chicken ) will hardly degrade at all even after a year in storage . Supermarket eggs are washed , removing the protective layer and lowering the shelf life . Some supermarket eggs are already contaminated with salmonella , and there 's no test you can do to find out for sure ( other than eating them raw ) . This will cause serious problems if you leave them in storage for several months , unless you freeze them . Lastly , damaged eggs will simply go rotten . You wo n't always see the damage , but you 'll definitely smell it by the time you hit that best-before date . As with just about every other food , you 're better off interpreting the sell-by or best-before dates as a conservative guideline ; any food can go off before the date if it 's been damaged or mis-handled , and many foods will still be fine long after they " expire " . <URL> is a good resource for finding out how long various foods actually last in storage .
I find when cooked , the skin retains a bit of bitterness and toughness , so in desserts , juices or when shaved/julienned , I 'm inclined to peel them . In fast salads , quick application , I usually do n't bother .
It needs very even heat to cook through without burning ( underneath if you cook it on the hob ) . presumably if you cook it on the hob you need to use a bain marie and for individual ramekins this is quite specialised and large . In the oven you can just use a roasting tin for your bain marie for several ramekins .
It does n't sound like you 're doing anything wrong . I 've found risotto to be one of those recipes that can vary up to 50 % ( usually less ) from what the author calls for and still turn out great . I 've even used recipes that call for " 2-4 " cups of broth . You may be overcooking it though , <URL> . It 's not uncommon for people to overcook this until you have a mushy risotto .
Gluten is what makes doughs chewy , and gluten is associated with high protein flour , so you should try and get low protein ( " soft " ) flour . Also , the colder your fat ( i.e. , butter ) the flakier and crispier your crust will be . You also may want to substitute some of the butter for lard or shortening ; the lack of water in the lard will also help the crust become crispy and avoid gluten formation associated with hydration of the flour . Note that you can not substitute lard/shortening for butter in an equal ratio ; you should try and find a recipe that specifically calls for it to get the ratio correct . As <URL> noted , you can also blind bake the crust to start its cooking process ( but as <URL> warns , you may not be able to call it a " pie " after that ! ) . Finally , it may be the case that your pie filling is too moist and therefore makes the interior of the crust very soggy . I 've found that almost all good apple pie recipes call for pre-cooking the apples to remove a lot of their moisture before putting them in the crust .
Soaking beans will not soften them . If done for a very long time ( i.e. , days ) , some beans will eventually begin to sprout or ferment , at which point they will become softer . But that is generally not desirable for basic cooking . Instead , you 'll need to cook the beans to get them to soften . Bring to a slow boil and then simmer until the interior is the desired texture . ( A common test is to take a few beans out on a spoon and blow on them ; if the outside of the bean breaks open a bit when you blow , they are likely soft and cooked through . ) By the way , the main purpose of soaking is to hydrate the seed coat ( the outer covering of the beans ) . Once that happens , the moisture can more easily penetrate the interior when cooked , allowing the beans to soften . If you do n't soak , you 'll simply waste the first part of your cooking hydrating the seed coat . Depending on the type of beans , their age , and other factors , that could increase your cooking time by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so . ( For more details , see my previous answer to another question <URL> . ) Also , do NOT try using an acid . Acids can actually toughen the seed coat , making the beans take longer to cook and soften . This is one of the reasons chili recipes ( for example ) often recommend cooking the beans first , before adding to acidic ingredients like tomatoes . ( Note that cooking times for beans and lentils can vary significantly , depending on type of bean and age . For a mixed bean soup , I 'd expect about 1-2 hours of simmering for pre-soaked beans , and perhaps as many as 3 hours . Older beans can take longer , and I 've occasionally had old batches of dried beans which never quite softened to a consistent texture . ) EDIT : Just to add onto Joe 's great advice from the Dry Bean Council , Harold McGee has this to say about beans which never soften ( from On Food and Cooking ) : " Hard-to-cook " beans ... are normal when harvested , but become resistant to softening when they 're stored for a long time -- months -- at warm temperatures and high humidities . This resistance results from a number of changes in bean cell walls and interiors , including the formation of woody lignin , the conversion of phenolic compounds into tannins that cross-link proteins to form a water-resistant coating around the starch granules . There 's no way to reverse these changes and make hard-to-cook beans as soft as regular beans . And there 's no way to spot them before cooking . Once cooked , they 're likely to be smaller than normal and so may be picked out before serving . McGee also mentions that occasionally you may encounter batches of " hard-seed " beans , which hardened during particularly hot and humid growing conditions . In such cases , the beans will be tough no matter how early they are used ; they may take much longer to cook than usual ( and sometimes may never soften ) .
The eggs are for binding - they keep the filling together . They might also provide some substance/body to the filling . Not knowing what recipes you 're looking at , it 's hard to say for sure , but since you tagged this with " cheese " I 'm guessing that the fillings would start to melt and ooze out of the shells if you did n't use egg .
The crystalization is to be expected , that 's what inverted sugar does . It is the same thing as with honey , which is chemically nothing but a contaminated inverted sugar . So , you are not doing anything wrong . In an inverted sugar at sucrose ratios , you will get sucrose crystalizing back out of the solution , just as you are observing now . If you really need it smooth , you can try changing the ratio by adding some fructose , as such a mixture is less prone to crystalizing . The one thing that puzzles me in your description is that you can not get it back smooth by heating , this should in principle be possible . Maybe try adding a bit of water to the syrup itself during heating , so it can dissolve again .
Hmm . I would say that pumpkins maybe have a slight bit of acidity , but I would never think of them as distinctly sour . I suppose it could be the variety you are using . Also , taste your stock by itself to make sure it is n't contributing an unwanted sour note . All of that said , it may just be one of those expectation things . We are used to pumpkin in a sweet context , and your brain wants that little bit of sugar there to match the template , so it seems sour without it . If you really want to test this out further , try making a small batch of the same recipe with no spices and plain water to see if it is truly the pumpkin that seems sour to you .
Toughness is usually the result of either too much gluten ( which in turn comes from using a flour too high in protein ) , or not enough fat ( or possibly adding the fat at the wrong time ) . Poor volume on the other hand is usually the result of using low-protein flour , and thus not having enough gluten formation . Therefore it is logical to assume that the most likely cause of your bread troubles is the fat . Try adding some more fat .
Typically , dutch ovens and other heavy , especially cast iron pots would be buried to allow a slow dissipation of the heat . This will allow the contents to continue to cook at a very low and slow pace , usually to allow the release and melding of more flavor . In the case of chili for instance , this could allow more of a dried chili essence to reconstitute and become more uniform throughout the pot . The insulation of the ground will slow the cooling and allow this process to extend much longer than air would . Additionally , packing soil around the pot would tend to act as a barrier to hold in more of the aromatics than in air , combined with the slower cooling to again allow more absorption and a more even distribution for a more mellow taste to the dish . Especially pots such as dutch ovens , this process is often done without additional heat , or in ground warmed by a fire , or with added coals or hot rocks depending on how long you want this process to continue and if you want more actual cooking to occur . Fully duplicating this process inside would be difficult , but a somewhat close approximation would be to heat up an oven . Put in your covered pot , preferably tightly covered . Close the oven then turn it off or down to a very low setting , and keep it closed for a few hours and you should get much of the same effect . I would call this process marrying or melding the flavor rather than saving it .
Some <URL> produce pink or white seeds so yours sounds perfectly normal . I have had white seeds and they are as delicious as the red ones . Go for it .
You can get red jalapeños at some markets , but you 're right , most places sell them when they 're still green . They sell them for the same reasons they sell green bell peppers , which includes : some people prefer the milder , grassier notes ( or just do n't know better ) they 're cheaper to produce ( do n't have to wait for them to ripen , reducing water use ) they store and ship better ( as they 're not ripe yet ) . it lowers the risk of losing the harvest ( due to weather , blight , etc. from waiting 'til they 're fully ripe ) it reduces the number of field hands needed ( as they 're not trying to pick all peppers at the peak of ripeness ) if frees up the field for another planting . In the case of hot peppers , it 's more complex than the simple colored bell peppers -- the ripe peppers are often further processed ( smoked or dried ) and then sold under a different name : chipotle == smoked &amp; dried jalapeño ancho == dried poblano colorado == ripe anaheim

Baked sweet potato french fries ( chips ) too soft , how to crispen ?
There are a few questions on this site about French fries , I 'd suggest you take a look . But I think the best answer is : baked sticks of potato do not French fries make . French fries are deep fried . You can never get the same results in air , although air fryers do come close . A normal oven bakes , not fries . Here are some sites that experiment with fries and crispiness <URL> <URL> .
I am going to get " unsciency " as I used to make fries for hours on end at a local mom and pop shop . How thin / thick does n't really matter , you 'll just have to adjust your frying time accordingly . 1 ) Use a starchy potato 2 ) slice your potato evenly , with a peeler if you do n't have a slicer or mandolin 3 ) soak them in water for 30 mins with a pinch of salt 4 ) let them dry a bit 5 ) blanch them with vegetable oil until they are limpy but has no visible color change ( Oil should be hot enough that when you put them in , 5 seconds later there are bubbles ) 6 ) cool them completely , I throw them into a container into the fridge 7 ) refried them by putting in enough pieces in such that it will still bubble immediately ( oil should be hot enough when you drop a spot of water or chop sticks in that it bubble immediately , but you would n't hear like a crackling or have oil splashing at you ) 8 ) Take them out one piece at a time as they change color . The key is vegetable that 's pretty much the only oil that makes things cripsy at lower frying temperature , other than bacon fat , this makes a much more golden chip , and generally a easier time to control , so you can make more at the same time . Shortening , olive oil , peanut oil , butter , lard has been tested and is n't really good . Sesame oil is good too if you like the taste of it . Also , do n't attempt to drain the oil after blanching , the oil will come out when you re-fry them . Salt or season while warm .
I do n't think it 's your fault . Mates do n't break that often . Besides , I 've seen a lot of people drink it hotter than me without any problems . As for preparation , it was recommended to me the following : Place the leaves in the mate Add a little bit of cold water Add hot water When and how you put the straw is a whole other chapter !
Yes , it depends on brand , humidity , etc. . My local variety is 1:4 to 1:4.5 ( polenta : water ) to get to that softness level Add nothing else until you have the polenta at the desired consistency and softness
I 'm not sure if it 's a typo but the recipe surprises me , traditionally ( as far as a 100ish year old dish can be " traditional " ) vichyssoise would have chicken stock or seasoned milk as the liquid base . For that quantity of potato and leek I would estimate 0.6 - > 0.75 L of liquid so it is possible it is a typo .
The only way I know is by adding some more liquid and warming the mixture , It may or may not improve things ... For what its worth , the consistency of the jam after cooking , tends to be related to the amount of sugar added for a given fruit , with hard skinned fruit typically requiring a slightly different process to soft skinned fruit . It 's also controlled by the amount of pectin added to the brew as well as the overall cooking time and temperature .
Yes , you can squeeze citrus too much . That bitterness you sometimes taste in citrus fruit comes from limonin , a compound that most people can detect at concentrations as small as a few parts per million . In many citrus fruits the limonin is created once the acids of the juice vesicles interact with LARL , a tasteless substance in the fruit 's tissues ( <URL> ) . In the juice of a squeezed lime the reaction from LARL to limonin takes a few hours to complete , so if it is very fresh it will not be as bitter . Over-squeezing , as in using a pestle , will expose more of the tissue ( and therefore LARL ) resulting in more bitterness later on . If the peels are in the mix , it will also extract some of the oils ( mainly limonene ) from the peel , which is very bitter . So bitter , that <URL> are designed so that the juice extracts never touch the peel . During summer , guests often ask for caipirinhas at our house . I like to imagine that it is because I peel my limes , remove most of the white pith including stem , and try to mash the limes just before mixing the drink . This way it requires less sugar allowing those great citrus flavors to stand out .
With kale crisps you are ideally trying to dehydrate instead of baking . This saves the chlorphyll from degradation . Depending on your green/veg chlorophyll starts to degrade between 100F-185F ( 40C-85C ) . Now , 220F-240F ( 100C-120C ) is as low as most domestic ovens go . However , if you are able to use a lower temprature , that would give you a greener result and a cleaner flavour . But it will take longer to crisp as you lower the temprature . Using a dehydrator would be ideal , running at around 140F ( 60C ) . Think of dryed fruit , herbs or even tomatoes , they are almost never baked , but rather dehydrated . You 'll also find that commercial kale crisps use a very low temprature and they are promoted by it as it keeps nutrients intact and preserves chlorophyll . A tip if you have to use your oven , keep checking and take them out before they crisp up completely . As they cool , the residual heat will dehydrate them a touch more .
Chia seeds can be used without soaking , but they absorb a LOT of liquid and create a gel . If this is n't accounted for in your recipe , they could cause the finished product to have an odd texture . At the very least , I 'd add extra liquid to your batter and let it sit for a few minutes to check it 's consistency before you use it .
I 'd do one or more of a few things : Treat it like the dough in <URL> , in which you sprinkle flour on top , then pull off a portion you need , then shape quickly into a ball , developing the outer skin , keeping the freshly floured side out . Chill down the dough , so it 's firmer and easier to work with . ( and then do # 1 while it 's still a bit cold ) Put it into muffin pans or similar for baking , so you do n't have to worry about it holding up on its own or even attempting to shape it . ( if you can shape it a little bit , you can then put it into a pan with enough of a lip to give them some support as they rise ; they might spread into each other , but you can typically break them apart after they 're baked ) In general , I find that kneading dough in a mixer ( unless specifically called for in a recipes ) always needs more flour . Basically , when you 're kneading normally , you might work in 1/2 cup or so of extra flour . And there are the issues with knowing what the proper way to <URL> if the measurements are given in volume ( cups ) and not by weight , which will easily throw off any bread recipe .
You could thin a little syrup or honey with water and brush it on the top of the brownies so that it soaks in a sweetens them a little . Try it on one first .
Peach and Apple wood are readily available , and I use them regularly for fish . You may find that since the wood is in fact considered treated , you may find it is in fact available ... Try here : <URL>
Dredging in lightly salted cornmeal and then frying ( shallow frying is fine , but deep frying is magical ) is an absolute classic in the Southern US , where catfish eating is big . I usually just put the plain filets in the cornmeal without first dipping in egg or milk . I do n't think it 's necessary -- though I 'd go with milk if I were forced to use something . After dredging , I let them sit on a wire rack for a minute or so before frying to set the cornmeal ( which I would do if using egg or milk also ) . Generally , though , most treatments that work for a mild , tender white fish will work . Recipes for flounder or sole ( Sole a la Meuniere for example ) , or ones that look for rockfish or striped bass will work really well . Bear in mind that catfish does have a distinctive flavor , though it 's not really strong . Some people do n't care for it , and they tend to describe it as " muddy " tasting . Personally , I do n't see it . If you like the catfish OK , but find the flavor intrusive in some applications , adding spicyness or acid ( lemon juice , vinegar ) will mute it .
It likely depends on what ' turning bad ' means ... If you have a couple in the bag starting to sprout , but the rest have n't , you can roast or bake the ones that have n't sprouted , let them cool , then store then in the fridge so you can pull them out to use them in something later in the week . ( eg . home fries , patatas bravas or a hash ) . For those that have started to sprout , but are still firm , you can cut away the sprouted bits ( this time of year , you might even be able to plant them ) , peel them , and then boil them and turn 'em into mashed potatoes ( which you can then vary for the next couple of days ... you can mash 'em with other stuff to make a sort of potato salad ; you can add cooked greens to make colcannon or bubble and squeek ; you can use as a topping for a cottage pie ( the technically correct term for shepherds pie when you 're not using mutton or lamb ) Some of these freeze well ... I 've made up cottage pies and frozen 'em in oven-proof containers ; you could likely do the same with just mashed potatoes -- I see 'em for sale in the grocery store all the time . If you 're looking for something to cook that just uses a lot of potatoes ( in a non-whole state , in case you need to cut away parts ) ... potato salad , potato bread , potato curry , latkes , potato soup , tortilla de patatas ... the list goes on . ... and if they 're soft and squishy , or oozing liquid ... pitch them . They 're rotting , and not worth getting sick over .
It 's definitely a sign that the oven is cooking too hot somewhere ; the under-done tops and middles are the give-away . I suspect your oven has a malfunctioning thermostat , which is quite common . Try setting temperatures 50 degrees below suggested , and see if it solves the problems . Failing this , purchase an oven thermometer to check it . Another possibility is that there is poor airflow within the oven . In this case , hot air is heating the bottom of the pan , but can not get around the edges of the pan to heat the top of the baked good . The solution to this is usually to use a smaller pan , and ensure only one pan at a time is loaded into the oven . My oven has problems of this nature when I try to bake in both racks with half sheet pans .
Probably the easiest way to do it is to just gently pour the blackberries into a basket strainer , then lower the strainer into a bowl of water . Then you can just lift the strainer out and the berries will come with it , no fishing required .
Soft bread is soft because CO2 produced by yeast and water that gets turned to steam by the baking process gets trapped into pockets by a mesh of gluten , causing the dough to expand . The dough then solidifies , keeping its shape . If your bread is not soft then it has n't expanded enough for one or more reasons : Dough too dry : as much as the yeast , water is responsible for getting a good rise in your bread . Gluten requires moisture to relax and stretch , forming the structure that traps the air that causes a rise , dough that is too dry wo n't form good gluten . Also , dough that is too dry wo n't have the elasticity to rise . Yeast needs water to do its work , dough that is too dry will inhibit the yeast . Also , the expansion of water into steam is as important for a good rise as yeast . If there 's one mistake many bakers make ( including myself for years ) it is making dough too dry . Yeast inactive or inhibited : if your yeast is old , came into contact with salt , or does n't have enough water to work then your yeast wo n't work well for you . Yeast does several things for you : it converts sugar into CO2 causing a rise , it improves the structure of your dough , and it adds flavor . Put the salt on the opposite side of the bowl from the yeast to avoid inhibiting it . Also , adding the yeast to sugary water does n't work well , especially with more modern yeasts . Just get quick acting yeast and add it to the flour bowl , then add water to that . The dough is not worked ( kneaded ) enough : Kneading improves the structure of your dough by stretching gluten molecules and getting them to link together , making your dough stretchy and pliable , and forming a structure that will trap air for a rise . Under-worked dough wo n't have enough structure the dough has been worked too much : as a home baker using hands this is unlikely , but still possible . Once you have the structure of the dough you need , stop and let it rise as any further working will form too much of a structure , making it too strong to expand Dough under-risen : the times in baking recipes are just guidelines , you need to go for a result rather than a time . I 've had books say 45 minutes but it takes 3 hours , especially if my yeast was old Dough over-risen : if your dough rises too long the yeast will exhaust the sugars in the dough and die out , leading to the loss of all the air . This will make the dough dense . For a nice soft sandwich bread I start with a really sticky dough . I then use it 's stickiness to stretch the dough , smearing it all over the countertop and using a pastry scraper to bring it back together . This is a really quick way to build some gluten . Then I knead in flour bit by bit , kneading for at least 1 minute between adding flour until I have a soft dough that still sticks a bit to the counter . That stickiness means that there 's enough moisture in the dough . I 'll add a bit more flour to that and then stop adding flour to avoid drying the dough . If I want to knead it more I 'll knead with a bit of vegetable oil instead to keep it from sticking . It 's consistency you 're looking for , not time . Time is relative depending on your strength and kneading technique , 5 minutes for a skilled and strong baker may translate to 15 minutes for normal humans , so knead until you have the consistency you want . When you start kneading the dough it will pull into pieces easily , and have a rough texture . As you knead that roughness disappears and it will stretch longer without breaking . For a sandwich loaf I 'll knead until I can stretch the dough from the middle of my torso to my knee without it breaking . Next , rising your dough may take much longer than recipes say as it all depends on the ambient temperature of the room , humidity , the activity of the yeast , and other factors . Again , make this results driven , not time driven . A good sandwich bread dough should rise a lot , not the " doubled " many recipes say . For me tripled is more like it . Make sure you put it in a big enough bowl ! This advice goes for the initial as well as the secondary rise in the pans . Let it rise enough in the pans until it looks like the recipe picture , that 's about right . Ideally your oven will have been pre-heating for 30 minutes by now . Now , slash your loaves the long way with a razor blade like a carpet knife , about 1/2 an inch down . Do it quick and avoid punching down the dough . Slashing will split the top skin and allow the dough to rise efficiently after you put it into the oven . Once you put it in the oven it 's going to rise a lot as the yeast goes crazy before the heat kills it , and the moisture in the dough is going to vaporize into steam . If you do n't slash you wo n't get as good a rise .
It could be sand , used to weight the handle . The weight is an important part of the design . I assume some manufacturers use sand instead of just thicker/heavier steel because it 's cheaper and easier to manufacture . For proof that at least some whisks are made like this , here 's <URL> and even a picture : <URL> It 's just inert weight . It 's not going to come into contact with your food . I guess if you get a defective one and the handle comes open and dumps sand in your food , you 'd have to throw it out , but otherwise it 's not really anything to worry about .
Thierry , Stainless steel French presses work fine . In fact , you can construct a French press out of any chemically inert material : stainless steel , class , ceramic , high-temperature plastic , enameled copper , even marble , and it will make perfectly good coffee . I myself have a collection of porcelain and stoneware presses . What material you choose is really a matter of aesthetics and how you use the press . All of that being said , my experience is that high-quality glass carafes do not break regularly unless you drop them ( which is , admittedly , an issue ) . I 'm wondering if you bought a cheaper carafe with inferior glass , like one from Ikea . I have a Bodum which is at least 8 years old . Also , for brand name presses , you can usually buy replacement carafes , since breakage ( due to dropping ) is a frequent issue . Sometimes the replacements cost as much as a whole new press , but you should at least check it out .
It does n't really matter . A lot of people cook them with peel still on and peel it with their hands when cooked ( Careful , hot ! ) . You can peel them before you cook them , and then it 's just a question of taste I 'd say . Personally , I would peel off the white as well , though I 'm not sure about this .

Why is my Buckwheat soba noodle dough crumbling ?
The crumbly texture is , apparently , quite common when working with an all buckwheat dough since it does n't develop gluten - one of the reasons why many home-made soba noodle recipes use a percentage of wheat flour to make the dough easier to work with . If you have your heart set on a buckwheat-only soba noodle , be aware this is a common problem . You might try boiling water and rolling and cutting a little thicker so they do n't end up so fragile , mentioned below . I also saw that the <URL> may be important ( using a Japanese style , rather than American style buckwheat flour , apparently makes a big difference ) . Check that the flour type is correct , that may help . Another recipe I saw " <URL> " the flour ( making a dough with water and a bit of lemon juice , and letting sit under a wet cloth overnight ) to give the dough time to hydrate the flour . I 'm not sure whether the lemon juice or the extra long resting time was the relevant factor , but she does n't seem to have problems with the dough . And the last suggestion I found involved " beating the buckwheat " , that is , mechanically working the dough long enough for the water-soluble parts of the flour to dissolve into the dough and let it become elastic that way ( this extra working may be related to the extra-hydrating time of the last hint , or perhaps actual , mechanical <URL> might be helpful in working the dough - it is used in some kinds of recipes to make dough behave ) . From an article I found , <URL> : Not only does a dough of 100 % buckwheat flour tend to crumble and break while you work it , but it also dries out incredibly quickly and the resulting noodles are very fragile . Glenn Roberts of Anson Mills recommends using boiling water when making soba with 100 % buckwheat to gelatinize the buckwheat starches and help the dough hold together . Roll the dough a bit thicker than recommended in the recipe below , and once made , cook and eat the noodles immediately before they dry out .
Gluten is what makes doughs chewy , and gluten is associated with high protein flour , so you should try and get low protein ( " soft " ) flour . Also , the colder your fat ( i.e. , butter ) the flakier and crispier your crust will be . You also may want to substitute some of the butter for lard or shortening ; the lack of water in the lard will also help the crust become crispy and avoid gluten formation associated with hydration of the flour . Note that you can not substitute lard/shortening for butter in an equal ratio ; you should try and find a recipe that specifically calls for it to get the ratio correct . As <URL> noted , you can also blind bake the crust to start its cooking process ( but as <URL> warns , you may not be able to call it a " pie " after that ! ) . Finally , it may be the case that your pie filling is too moist and therefore makes the interior of the crust very soggy . I 've found that almost all good apple pie recipes call for pre-cooking the apples to remove a lot of their moisture before putting them in the crust .
I am afraid that it is quite hard to prepare it yourself . And you do n't start from phylo dough . Kataifi is not shredded , it is spun . You need a hot metal wheel for that . It is made from a batter which is thrown on the wheel , and because the wheel is spun , it bakes on the wheel in threads . You need not only the instruments ( this wheel ) , but also quite a bit of experience to throw it in even threads . Kataifi makers are a popular attraction on middle-eastern markets . If you ca n't visit one , you have to visit an ethnic grocery store to buy the prepared kataifi noodles .
Gerbil gave the basic reasons as to why this might be happening , but as for the ' how to recover ' ... you have a few options : Wait for it to finish separating , and take the oil off , then serve without oil . If you still want some fat for mouthfeel , after separating , you can add some butter back into the warm ( but not too hot ) sauce , and stir 'til melted and combined . If going for a more gravy-like consistency , after separating , put the oil back into the pan , make a roux and follow the <URL> , but use the juices in place of the milk . After separating , take some of the non-oil part , add an emulsifier ( eg , mustard ) , then slowly whisk back in some fat , add some of the juices , then slowly add the rest of the fat 'til it 's the consistency you want . Put it into a blender an mix ( although , open the vent hole , then put a towel over the lid , and hold it down with one hand when you turn it on ... blending hot things can be a mess ) or use a stick blender . In the future , I would separate out the juice &amp; fats before reducing . You never know quite how much fat will render out of a piece of meat , and I feel I can reduce the juices faster when there is n't fat in there , but I 've never actually timed it . Or , you can go the roux / gravy route if you 're in a hurry .
My first thoughts are this which is actually a scraper but I would n't use a metal scraper in a bowl . Being flexible plastic , it flexes and molds itself to the inside of a bowl and allows easy removal of dough .
I can only guess that something from the herbs has " disturbed the balance of the mix " and is preventing it from setting . Putting my chemist 's hat on , the problem is similar to what happens when a solid reaction product forms an emulsion and refuses to precipitate . When that happens , there are ways to induce precipitation , but not all of them can be applied to food . Try adding a pinch of salt - mix , and wait . If that fails , smear a knife blade with some fresh butter and stir the mix with it . If that fails , try cooling it . If that fails , try mixing in a pinch of bicarbonate of soda . There are other suggestions , but I assume you want to eat the butter once it solidifies . Ideally , you want to find that happening after one suggestion has worked . If it takes a succession of suggestions to find a way to solidify it , this is about as far as you can go without the product starting to " lose its intention " .
While I have n't heard of it happening for the specific ingredients you list , yes , the blender can make stuff really bitter . There are two ways this can happen . First , a chemical reaction . A blender really churns the stuff through , driving lots of air bubbles into the mixture with some force . It also causes friction heat , especially professional grade blenders like vitamix . The heat , force and large reaction surface can cause the oxygen in the air to enter a reaction with the ingredients which does n't happen when using a milder method for cutting up . Olive oil is a known culprit here , it usually turns bitter when blended , but it can happen with other stuff too . Besides oxygen , a chemical reaction can also happen between two ingredients coming from two different vegetables , which would not have been mixed well enough in the knife scenario to produce noticeable amounts of reaction product . The second possibility is releasing stuff which would have stayed " packed " without the blender . A knife will only damage the plant cells at the cut surfaces , and a blunt knife , if used with a somewhat inefficient technique , might even break very ripe vegetables along the cell walls instead of cutting through the cells . If there are mini-droplets of something bitter within the plant cells , it is possible that the blender ( which really cuts cells into pieces ) released these things . On a more macro level , it is also possible that we are not talking mini-droplets , but just plant parts which did n't get cut with the knife . Stray pepper seeds come in mind : you probably did n't cut any with the knife , they tend to be pushed by a knife instead of cut when you are cutting the pepper . The blender pulverizes everything that hits the blades , including these seeds . I can not know which of these is the most probable source , or which plant contained the bitter matter exposed/created by the blender . But the different methods of mincing vegetables are not equivalent , and can have very noticeable effects on taste and texture beyond the obvious chunk size . The bitterness you encountered is only one example . In general , use the method specified in a recipe . If you are not working from a written recipe , try out a few and see which works best .
My guess would be that you boiled the soup at some point , possibly for an extended period of time . If you bring it to a full boil the fat from the meat will emulsify and distribute itself through the liquid . This is the same stuff that foams to the top , the " scum " that a lot of recipes ( usually ones that say bring to a boil , then simmer ) tell you to skim off . I would venture to say that this distribution of the fat into the liquid is also why it tasted heavier . When making stock or soups , the most I 'll heat them is to just below boiling and keep them at that simmer for a little longer to make up for not bringing it to a boil . When making stock , I strain once through a chinois and again through a piece of cheesecloth in a chinois to help reduce the floating particulates , but this wo n't really solve the cloudiness problem ( though it will help some ) . You can also try putting it into the fridge overnight so that the fat comes to the top and solidifies , but I do n't think this will solve the problem , only help reduce it . If it 's just the stock that 's gone cloudy , <URL> has some suggestions on how to clarify it , but honestly unless you 're presenting it to guests , I see no reason to even bother . I 've made cloudy stock and clear stock before and except for a slight " heaviness " difference , the taste is generally about the same . The cloudy stock sometimes has a more oily mouth feel , but it 's not a major difference - and I 've found some people seem to prefer the soups or rices I make with a cloudy stock . If you have a hard time controlling the temperature on your range-top , you can use an oven-safe stock pot and cook it in the oven at 180 & deg ; F to keep it just below a boil . One other trick , depending on what kind of soup you were making - if you were making ( for example ) chicken soup , consider trying to turn it into a cream of chicken soup to hide the cloudy broth :)
My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well . It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily " broken " . I 've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it does n't take to cookie cutters , but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz ( or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle , sprinkle with your finger tips ) cold water on it . ( Like adding water to pie dough ) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in . Repeat until it just stops breaking . Do n't go overboard and make it gooey . I 'd use water over oil or milk because it 's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process . Such minuscule amounts of water should n't yield a detectable change in the end product . If this is a consistent problem with the recipe , in the future I 'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps .
Soaking beans will not soften them . If done for a very long time ( i.e. , days ) , some beans will eventually begin to sprout or ferment , at which point they will become softer . But that is generally not desirable for basic cooking . Instead , you 'll need to cook the beans to get them to soften . Bring to a slow boil and then simmer until the interior is the desired texture . ( A common test is to take a few beans out on a spoon and blow on them ; if the outside of the bean breaks open a bit when you blow , they are likely soft and cooked through . ) By the way , the main purpose of soaking is to hydrate the seed coat ( the outer covering of the beans ) . Once that happens , the moisture can more easily penetrate the interior when cooked , allowing the beans to soften . If you do n't soak , you 'll simply waste the first part of your cooking hydrating the seed coat . Depending on the type of beans , their age , and other factors , that could increase your cooking time by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so . ( For more details , see my previous answer to another question <URL> . ) Also , do NOT try using an acid . Acids can actually toughen the seed coat , making the beans take longer to cook and soften . This is one of the reasons chili recipes ( for example ) often recommend cooking the beans first , before adding to acidic ingredients like tomatoes . ( Note that cooking times for beans and lentils can vary significantly , depending on type of bean and age . For a mixed bean soup , I 'd expect about 1-2 hours of simmering for pre-soaked beans , and perhaps as many as 3 hours . Older beans can take longer , and I 've occasionally had old batches of dried beans which never quite softened to a consistent texture . ) EDIT : Just to add onto Joe 's great advice from the Dry Bean Council , Harold McGee has this to say about beans which never soften ( from On Food and Cooking ) : " Hard-to-cook " beans ... are normal when harvested , but become resistant to softening when they 're stored for a long time -- months -- at warm temperatures and high humidities . This resistance results from a number of changes in bean cell walls and interiors , including the formation of woody lignin , the conversion of phenolic compounds into tannins that cross-link proteins to form a water-resistant coating around the starch granules . There 's no way to reverse these changes and make hard-to-cook beans as soft as regular beans . And there 's no way to spot them before cooking . Once cooked , they 're likely to be smaller than normal and so may be picked out before serving . McGee also mentions that occasionally you may encounter batches of " hard-seed " beans , which hardened during particularly hot and humid growing conditions . In such cases , the beans will be tough no matter how early they are used ; they may take much longer to cook than usual ( and sometimes may never soften ) .
Puff pastry is a laminated dough , with very strong gluten development , so an extra couple of days in the refrigerator should not have caused problems . 450 F seems like a typical temperature , and the time seems in the normal range . The only thing you have mentioned is that is definitely outside the standard treatment is trimming the edges with a butter knife . Normally , you want to trim or cut puff pastry with a very sharp knife or pizza cutter , in order to cleanly cut through the layers . A blunt knife like a butter knife can mash the layers together , making it hard for them to separate at the edges of the pastry . Still , this should have lead to lopsided or strangely risen pastry , rather than a complete failure to rise , especially in the center . The other possibility is that the dough was too warm when you rolled and worked it , or that you rolled it too much , which would work the fat or butter layers into the dough phase , rather than keeping discrete layers of flour then fat , which is what allows the rise .
I 've never made seitan , but just like when making bread , gluten needs water to activate . I do n't know the precise amount . Oil , if anything , has the opposite effect , coating the gluten molecules and keeping them from linking up , which is why we use fat in pastries to keep them from getting tough .
It 's not drastically important in making it workable , it 's more important in the texture of the finished result . When you roll out pastry dough , you are created interleaving layers of fat and the flour/water mix . When you cook it , the fat melts , leaving pockets in the dough , causing it to form flaky layers . This results in a crisp , light pastry . For this to happen , the fat must remain as solid as possible until cooking . If the fat melts and blends with the flour and water before cooking , you will have a dense , cardboard-like pastry . Also , warm pastry dough tends to become sticky and hard to work with .
Expiration dates on milk are not intended for open containers . Any open milk is only good for 3-5 days . After that , it is not safe for drinking , and taste is not guaranteed either . Many people seem to not know that . Traditionally , you could only buy HTST pasteurized milk , which has 7-10 days of usable time altogether . It spent 2-3 days on its way to the customer , and if a milk opened on day 3 after production went off on day 8 , nobody wondered , because it was on or just before the expiration date . Today , you get also ESL milks and nut milks , which have a much longer life in the closed container . But once you open them , they start acting like any other food - they are only good for 3-5 days in the fridge , no longer . The expiration date does n't matter for open foods .
I think you should be much more concerned about what happened after you turned on the heating element . It 's likely that a heavy ceramic liner crock pot fresh out of a ( properly kept ) refrigerator would keep contained food out of the <URL> for a couple hours . But once cooking begins , that 's a wide temperature range to cross - you have to make it from 40 ° F to 140 ° F within two hours , regardless of the final temperature you reach or how long you hold the food on either end . At low most crock pots do n't put out very much heat , and you had a cold starting temperature for a thick , absorptive cooking vessel , so it may have struggled to bring the chicken up to temperature in sufficient time . Unfortunately , without having monitored the temperature , there 's really no way to know if this would be considered safe by the typical guidelines informed by food safety agencies . I would consider it suspect at best , but you must make your own decision about whether that 's an acceptable risk to you . However , we tend to lean pretty conservatively about food safety advice around here , because while there are always anecdotes and opinions , much smarter experts than we have set a high bar for safety standards and acceptable risk . As always : <URL> .
If the yeast is n't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water . It should be between 105-110 . If it 's too cool then you wo n't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you 'll start to kill it . Another possible case can be when you 're adding the salt . If it 's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast . Get the yeast , sugar , water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour . Add the salt as you 're starting to bring the dough together so that it does n't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development . If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator , make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast .
The crumbly texture is , apparently , quite common when working with an all buckwheat dough since it does n't develop gluten - one of the reasons why many home-made soba noodle recipes use a percentage of wheat flour to make the dough easier to work with . If you have your heart set on a buckwheat-only soba noodle , be aware this is a common problem . You might try boiling water and rolling and cutting a little thicker so they do n't end up so fragile , mentioned below . I also saw that the <URL> may be important ( using a Japanese style , rather than American style buckwheat flour , apparently makes a big difference ) . Check that the flour type is correct , that may help . Another recipe I saw " <URL> " the flour ( making a dough with water and a bit of lemon juice , and letting sit under a wet cloth overnight ) to give the dough time to hydrate the flour . I 'm not sure whether the lemon juice or the extra long resting time was the relevant factor , but she does n't seem to have problems with the dough . And the last suggestion I found involved " beating the buckwheat " , that is , mechanically working the dough long enough for the water-soluble parts of the flour to dissolve into the dough and let it become elastic that way ( this extra working may be related to the extra-hydrating time of the last hint , or perhaps actual , mechanical <URL> might be helpful in working the dough - it is used in some kinds of recipes to make dough behave ) . From an article I found , <URL> : Not only does a dough of 100 % buckwheat flour tend to crumble and break while you work it , but it also dries out incredibly quickly and the resulting noodles are very fragile . Glenn Roberts of Anson Mills recommends using boiling water when making soba with 100 % buckwheat to gelatinize the buckwheat starches and help the dough hold together . Roll the dough a bit thicker than recommended in the recipe below , and once made , cook and eat the noodles immediately before they dry out .
rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title . However , you can also address your problem the other way round . First , cook the soup until your noodles are al dente ( but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed ) . Take the big pot of soup off the heat . Second , take a small pot , and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater . Put it on the heat , and cook until the noodles are done . ( Alternatively , put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot , but I would n't nuke a good soup for no reason ) . Third , eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own . Fourth , freeze the soup from the big pot . Finis . Note that from a food safety point of view , you are better off with flash cooling the soup . But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free . Plus , 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling . If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people , you should probably prefer a rapid cooling .
You need to 1 ) increase the emulsification , and 2 ) reduce the amount of time the sauce is very hot . You can try adding honey or mustard to the sauce , that will improve emulsification . You can also hit it with a stick blender which will do a much better job of breaking it up than can be done by hand . Also it may look ok after a few hours but who knows how much separation is starting to happen at a very small scale and will accelerate when it hits heat . Add the sauce at the last possible moment before plating . It is n't going to benefit from cooking , and it is n't going to marinade into the cooked food , so do n't have it in any longer than it takes for it to warm up . 20 seconds is probably all it will take .
The reason that your basting sauce flopped was the recipe was calling for an emulision ( basically , a vinegrette ) and by leaving out the vinegar you are changing the one of the basic building blocks of the dish . The sauce will require that you add the fats to the mustard as it will clump as experienced if you do n't . The mustard in the original recipe is used as an emuslifer and may need to be cut down without the addition of the vinegar . To build a sauce like this , you should start with the vinegar , add the seasonings and any emulisfers ( in this case , the mustard ) and slowly drizzle the fats into the resulting mixture until all has been incorperated . You will still get a smooth sauce as long as you keep the order even if you leave off an ingredient or two .

Are the white crystals on my American Cheese safe to eat ?
It is calcium lactate crystals . It is safe to eat . On regular cheeses it is a sign that it is aged well . For packaged , sliced american cheese I am not sure I would care for it . But it is a matter of personal preference .
Not worth the risk , just throw it out . There 's no way to tell whether the smell was absorbed , or comes from bacteria in the food itself .
A quick google brought <URL> : In this case , the brown ones may have been closest to mature or viable . When fully ripe , most peppers seeds are supposed to be brown or tan . not white . In my experience , peppers with brown are just old and withered . They are safe , just not as tasty . Unless the brown thing is mold , in which case they may be poisonous .
Yes it is completely safe . Microwaves do not linger in food . The microwaves stop as soon as your microwave stops . A microwave is just an electromagnetic wave similar to a radio wave , but at a higher frequency . It works by exciting molecules , particularly water , in the food and giving those molecules some of its energy as heat . Microwaves do not alter the structure or composition of molecules or atoms directly , which is what happens with <URL> ( gamma rays , x-rays , and UV-rays ) . You could cook your food with gamma rays , but you would ionize many of the particles making them radioactive .

The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick , which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold ; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2 " , maybe a little more than 1/4 " . The other " trick " is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets , which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich ; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you do n't have tension trying to pull the top piece away . Just do n't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak ; if you 've pounded the breast to 1/3 " thickness , then your cut should be no more than about 1/8 " . If you do it this way , you should n't even need to use toothpicks ; I never do , and I have n't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations .
You can have raw chicken in restaurants in Japan - it 's delicious . Depending on where you live there may be better or worse food safety standards , but there is nothing poisonous about raw chicken itself . By the way , sushi is a dish with vinegary rice .

The exterior of the chicken flesh is actually seared and cooked through several millimeters .
@niemiro , in your post does " go bad " mean food quality or food safety ? As for safety , you were no where near the " danger zone " either temperature-wise or time-wise . Initially safe , properly stored , frozen food that warms to -6 C ( or 22 F ) for 30 minutes will not render it unsafe to eat . In terms of food quality , freezers ( most of which these days are self-defrosting ) , go through temperature cycles regularly . The problem with this is not food safety , but the accumulation of ice crystals in foods , which degrades quality . Freezer burn is the extreme example . Of course , attention to packaging ( vacuum sealing , for example ) helps .
Milder cheddars are for melting . They get used in things such as grilled cheese sandwiches , grating into chili , nachos , or in quesadillas . In these uses , they do n't need the full-bodied flavor of a sharp cheddar , but they do need to melt down into soft , gooey , creamy deliciousness . Sharper cheddars are for flavor . I commonly see them in sandwiches , macaroni and cheese , topping salads , and as part of cheese boards . The reason it works like this is that " sharper " cheddars get their bite from additional aging , which develops a richer flavor but makes the cheese drier and increases the melting point . That said , there are no hard and fast rules for how to use mild vs. sharp cheddar . In my house we always use extra sharp cheddar because even everyday cheese should be a gustatory delight . It 's a little trickier to make into a quesadilla or melt on a cheeseburger , but the extra tang is worth it !
Gerbil gave the basic reasons as to why this might be happening , but as for the ' how to recover ' ... you have a few options : Wait for it to finish separating , and take the oil off , then serve without oil . If you still want some fat for mouthfeel , after separating , you can add some butter back into the warm ( but not too hot ) sauce , and stir 'til melted and combined . If going for a more gravy-like consistency , after separating , put the oil back into the pan , make a roux and follow the <URL> , but use the juices in place of the milk . After separating , take some of the non-oil part , add an emulsifier ( eg , mustard ) , then slowly whisk back in some fat , add some of the juices , then slowly add the rest of the fat 'til it 's the consistency you want . Put it into a blender an mix ( although , open the vent hole , then put a towel over the lid , and hold it down with one hand when you turn it on ... blending hot things can be a mess ) or use a stick blender . In the future , I would separate out the juice &amp; fats before reducing . You never know quite how much fat will render out of a piece of meat , and I feel I can reduce the juices faster when there is n't fat in there , but I 've never actually timed it . Or , you can go the roux / gravy route if you 're in a hurry .
The easiest solution is to use different cheeses . Most commercial pizzerias , like Domino 's or Pizza Hut do not use expensive cheeses like Parmesean or fresh mozzerella ... they use crappy cheese designed to be stretchy and to stay that way when warm instead of hot . In general , they use part-skim mozzarella , which is often sold pre-shredded and in hard blocks like you 'd find cheddars . This is addressed in another answer , <URL> . Hard cheeses like Parmesan are unlikely to melt at all and , when they do , they will firm up quickly as they lose heat . You should rarely expect a hard cheese to melt well . Most of them do n't . They also lose a lot of oils when they melt , causing unsightly separation . They 're great for a burst of salty cheese flavor but they wo n't behave like Domino 's cheese . This is why it 's common to top a completed pizza with shredded Parmesan but you would n't want to use it as your primary base cheese for the unbaked pizza . Fresh cheeses like ricotta and mozzarella have the opposite problem . Their high moisture content will often make pizza unappetizingly <URL> . In contrast , the part skim mozzarella used in pizzerias is specifically chosen because it has low water content . Check out the two questions linked here for a ton more info . You should consider doing some research into which <URL> as opposed that separate into an gross mess . Note , this list , like many others includes Asiago but it 's important to notice that the list refers specifically to fresh Asiago , not the Parmesan-like aged sibling .
My first instinct was no way , remembering that the branches and leaves contain a high amount of <URL> , which is a neurotoxin and not without risks , especially if used over a long time or while pregnant . This is the same stuff that caused absinthe to be discredited for decades . But Thuja oils typically contain 40 % α-thujon , sage ( salvia officinalis ) up to 60 % . Thuja 's pungent smell would prevent ingesting too much . So my conclusion would be : do not use for a long time or when pregnant ( most midwives caution against using sage , too , btw . ) use sparingly for health reasons , a limited amount is considered safe by health agencies world wide , <URL> for example . use very sparingly for culinary reasons , because the taste is quite " pronounced " . I had to take a herbal medicine with thuja decades ago and still shudder to think of it . ( It did work , though ... ) When thinking of potential culinary uses , think of uses for sage or juniper - you will want to use it as a spice in foods that can " handle " the woody , bitter tinge . Dark red meat or even game perhaps ? Complement with a generous amount of pepper and perhaps a good red wine . Another approach that might be worth a try is sweetening it up - like " fir syrup " ( is this known in American cuisine ? ) .
They are okay to eat . The sprouts on the other hand can be very acidic and SHOULD NOT be eaten . As long as you make sure you wash the potato thoroughly you should n't have to worry .
It is normal for store bought canned beans to have a cloudy liquid . This applies to previously dried , starchy beans such as cannellini , kidney , etc. . The water will get cloudy also when you cook dried beans . For others like green string beans or wax beans you would expect to see a clear liquid .
On another couple of sites ( <URL> for starters ) I found the answer to this . It appears that mould is expected sometimes in the Pancetta making process and as a general rule of thumb as long as it is n't too green and furry then it should be OK . I 've followed Ruhlman 's advice and dabbed the spots of mould with a vinegar soaked cloth and it wiped straight off and looks fine . My meat was coming up to the end of it 's hanging time anyway so rather than worry about it further I 've refrigerated it . I hope this helps anyone that stumbles across this with the same issue .
In either case store the cheese in the liquid it came in , transferring it to a clean container and covering well . Feta lasts reasonably well , but mozzarella only keeps well for a couple of days .
If it 's safe to eat the shrimp , it should be safe to eat the head . The US food authorities ( FDA ) have , in a way , approved of the shrimp you have bought , so it 's safe to eat .
Sprouted onions are perfectly safe to eat . If far advanced the texture may not be ideal ; yours does not sound very far advanced at all ( not even green . ) Considering you can eat green onions , there 's nothing to fear from onion sprouts .
Of course if an item is spoiled this means you should throw out anything that contains the spoiled item . However , based on your description , I have an alternative hypothesis . Brown discoloration in fruit does not mean the fruit is spoiled . Discoloration can be normal , especially if there was no unusual smells or changes in texture in the lemon . You said the lemon still appeared fresh on the outside . The more likely scenario is that the bitterness is from the lemon rind itself . The white pith underneath the outer bright yellow layer of the lemon rind is very bitter . If you go too deep while zesting a lemon your dish can easily be ruined by nasty bitterness . Only scrape the outer yellow surface when zesting a lemon . This can be quite challenging and takes some practice before you start zesting like an expert . Without a further description of the lemon , it is impossible to say whether it is spoiled or not ( it very well could be ) , but even if it was I doubt the spoiled lemon is causing bitterness ( it would probably cause a different but equally undesirable flavor ) .

How to clean a clogged Misto oil sprayer/spritzer ?
I generally clear my clogged misters / spray nozzles by unscrewing the spray part from the bottle and then submerging the uptake tube in very hot ( but certainly not boiling ! ) water and then pumping as long as it takes to clear the clog out and start spraying a mist / spray pattern again . The hot water should be enough to break up the clogs , and the pump action should force the clog out .

Bleach is your best bet . Scrub it with a long-handled scrub brush and either liquid bleach or Ajax and water . Let it soak a bit before rinsing it out .

Kosher salt and a small amount of vegetable oil . Scrub the pan with the salt on a rag or paper towel , if there are stubborn bits mix a couple drops of oil with the salt , wipe dry with clean towel . If you use a wet method to clean the pan re-heat it after cleaning to make sure it is completely dry before storing .
Providing you do n't leave anything unpleasant inside the cavity a good rinse under the tap is good enough . As you surmised , the process of cooking the chicken will kill all the bacteria . Just make sure it 's cooked correctly :)
Very simple : do n't burn the oil . Different fats start to burn at different temperatures ( called " smoke point " ) . This can be as low as ~ 100 ° C for unrefined vegetable oils . Butter is also low , at around ~ 150 ° C , which is below frying temperatures . Refined vegetable oils have very differentn smoke points depending on the plant they were made from , some starting as low as butter , and going up to around ~ 250 ° C ( safflower oil , rice bran oil ) . Fats meant for deep frying ( palm fat , clarified butter ) are also around ~ 250 ° C . So the two things you have to do is 1 . Choose the right fat , and 2 . do n't let the pan get too hot . From a nutritional point of view , deep-frying fats are not so good , so I 'd recommend using a vegetable oil with a high smoke point . If you can find refined safflower , it 's perfect , but if not , canola is also a good choice . About the temperature , the easiest way is to measure it so you will know how hot the pan gets at any given moment . I use an infrared thermometer when frying , and make crepes at 200 ° C . If you do n't have one handy , you could try heating a pan with oil on a middle setting for a long time ( 20-30 min ) , look if it smokes . If yes , let it cool down , and start again with a lower setting . If not , increase the setting and wait again . When you have found out the setting where your oil does n't smoke , you can use it , or you can try one setting above ( the first where the pan starts to smoke ) because the room-temperature batter cools the oil . It is time-consuming , but you only have to do it one to find out the correct temperature . You could use a nonstick pan , but the typical PTFE coated ones lose their nonstick layer at about 250 ° C , and a pan used for frying quickly heats much more than that . It is safe when used at lower temperatures , but you can not fry crepes at 150 ° C . So unless you have a ceramic-coated nonstick pan ( but not the type which disintegrates from hot starch in oil ! ) or you are controlling the temperature of the pan closely with a thermometer , it is better to use a noncoated pan . If you want your crepes to taste like butter , do n't fry them in butter . Instead , keep a cup with melted butter in a water bath near the pancakes . As soon as one is ready , take it out of the pan and use a glazing brush to brush it lightly with butter on both sides .
If you need the eggs raw , you could submerge them in boiling water for 5 sec . That would kill any bacteria on the shell and the egg would still be raw inside . Put the eggs in cold water right away to prevent the egg from heating up by the residual heat in the shell . I have tried this many times and the eggs do not cook . If you are serving the eggs to very young children , pregnant women or someone who are sick , you should buy pasteurized eggs instead . But normally it 's safer to eat eggs from chickens you raise , than the ones from a factory , because they are more healthy and their immune system is well developed enough to kill the salmonella itself .
Wilds of Russia ? If you have dry ice , just adding pieces of it ( chopped small ) to your drink will work to some extent . Here 's a vid : <URL> Be aware that not all dry ice is food grade . If no dry ice , you can get by with sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and vinegar ( acetic acid ) , or some other acid . Just mix the two chemicals , and bubble the resulting gas through your drink . Here 's an Instructable , w video : <URL> . It 'd be easy to improve on the kid 's method , for example by adding a <URL> , but the general principles are sound . Either method will cause some change in your liquid 's taste , as you 're lowering the pH by generating carbonic acid , but that 's true of any carbonation scheme .
You can put a cup/bowl of water ( you can also add some vinegar if you do n't mind the smell ) in there , heat it up to boiling , let the steam out . Then you should let it sit in the microwave without opening the door . Wait for a few minutes , open the microwave , and wipe off the inside . All that steam should have soften any stains or food pieces left in there . You may spray some natural cleaners or lemon/vinegar mixtures to wipe off the inside more .
The fourth option is the correct one . The problem is that if you start with oil in the mortar , the pestle will slip and you will not be able to properly mash the rest . What you usually do is : Wash the basil in cold water . Put the leaves on a tea towel and leave them to dry ( you can delicately pat them with another towel ) . You do n't want extra water in the pesto , so be sure the leaves are dry before starting . Traditional pesto is made with <URL> . Start with the garlic ( traditionally <URL> ) and a few grains of rock salt in the mortar . You would generally put 1-2 pips of garlic for ~ 50g basil leaves , but obviously that is up to your taste ( if you were to make Provencal pistou you would probably go for a higher garlic to basil ratio ) . I generally remove the inner part of the garlic ( the anima ) before mashing it . Now add the basil and mash them with a circular movement . You have to be quite delicate when doing this . You 'll see a green liquid forming at the bottom of the mortar . Now add pinenuts and/or the walnuts and finally the cheese . A mix of 36 months-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino ( sardo or romano ) is perfect for pesto . Finally add the extra-virgin olive oil slowly , while mixing . Put in clean pots , let it rest for half an hour , then if necessary cover with some extra oil . Whether you do this in batches or all at once mainly depends on the size of the mortar and how much pesto you are making . If you are making a big amount or have a small mortar repeat the steps for every batch ( I would wash the mortar each time , as it will be oily . Remember to dry it throughly before restarting ) .

My grandmother scraped both her parsnips and her carrots . Basically you hold your knife perpendicular to the vegetable and drag it down the length . It 's the same action as using a peeler . In fact , I usually just peel mine with a peeler . But scraping leaves a tiny bit more of the vegetable .
Half fill it with water , then put in on the stove top over a medium heat . Work the burnt-on bits with a wooden spoon or spatula as the water starts to boil . You should be able to soften it up and be able to get it off then .
I give my coffee maker an internal cleanse with vinegar and water once a month to avoid scale build-up . I use 1/2 cup of white vinegar plus water to make a full pot , run that through my maker two or three times , and then run five or six pots of plain water through the maker until there is no longer any scent of the vinegar . I clean the pot and its basket and insert once a week in the dishwasher , and wipe down the case and heating element daily . I 've been using the same drip coffee maker ( with its glass , dishwasher-safe pot ) for about five years . On those occasions when I 've run out of white vinegar , I use a tablespoon of citric acid dissolved in the first few cleaning pots of water , and then run five or six pots of plain water through the maker . Citric acid is just as effective as white vinegar for descaling but does n't smell as strong ; it 's also inexpensive .
As a substitute for untoasted sesame oil , most light oils will work ( light olive , peanut , canola , sunflower , etc ) . Any nut or seed oil should be pretty close . Toasted sesame oil has a much bolder and nuttier flavor . It could perhaps be approximated with a light oil and adding toasted sesame to your dish .
I would actually recommend the opposite of what was said above . Since the meat is so thin you may have much better results pan searing it in an extremely hot pan from slightly frozen . This way the outermost layer will start to undergo the maillard reaction long before the inside of the steak reaches a medium-rare temp and will give you a better chance of preventing it from overcooking . This link provides an overview of the process for a much larger piece of meat then your using but the searing process is what your concerned most with since your steaks are so thin . You will likely have to play with the timing a little bit with regards to how frozen the steak needs to start out but I figure erring on the side of too frozen is best since you can then heat them in the oven to the internal temp your looking for . <URL>
Depending on the type of honing rod and the technique you use for honing , you will remove more or less metal from the blade . You can confirm whether your rod removes metal by wiping the blade on a white tea cloth after honing . If you see a grey residue on the cloth then metal has been removed and you can decide yourself whether you want that in your food . Types of Honing Rod Steel rods , of the type that are perfectly smooth will not remove noticeable amounts of steel from a blade . Polished honing rods are used for straightening a curled blade edge . Other types have shallow grooves cut down the length of the rod that bite into the blade and shave off metal particles . Ceramic rods are slightly abrasive and will remove small amounts of metal . Diamond coated rods are used for sharpening in place of a whetstone and will remove relatively large amounts of metal . What technique you use for honing depends on what you are trying to achieve . If you only need to realign the edge of a well maintained knife , then two or three swipes on both sides of the blade , maintaining light pressure should be sufficient . If you do this with a polished steel , then I would be surprised if you need to wipe the blade afterwards . If you use one of the other types of rod , then you are also removing metal from your knife and you may want to strop the knife and give it a quick wipe after .
Perfect . Sounds like your pizza stone is nicely seasoned . Scrub it with your stiffest brush , rinse with water , no soap , done . If you 're paranoid about germs , cook it before cooking on it . Throw it in the oven at a few hundred degrees , for 15 minutes or so . Ideally , you 're supposed to heat the stone ( thus sterilizing it ) before slapping the pizza upon it anyway ( although that requires a <URL> ) .
You can definitely cook donuts in a deep fryer . Most , if not all , donuts shops cook them in that manner . Just make sure your temperature is good and use something like chopsticks to flip them .
You could certainly get a cookbook of side dishes and learn some new favourites , but what might be more useful is a book that teaches you about flavour combinations and menu planning . I would suggest <URL> as one such book . It 's not about specific recipes ( you can find those elsewhere or make them up ) , but rather it addresses the kind of skill you 're looking to learn . One technique is to consider the origin of the main dish and choose side dishes from the same region . Seasonality or market-based shopping is another approach to expanding your repertoire .

How can I cook cod without lemons ?
Lemon is used as a flavoring , not as a cooking liquid , it 's not going to keep the fish moist . The secret of having moist fish is the same as having moist beef , chicken or any meat or poultry : do n't overcook it . Cooking releases moisture from the flesh , so cooking it well is all about timing - getting it cooked enough to have the internal temperature and consistency you want and no more as every extra second means more moisture lost . Fish is especially sensitive to timing , but with a bit of practice anyone can cook fish well . Fish , meat or poultry will have a juicy mouth feel when there is enough moisture stored in the flesh after cooking . Overcooked fish in a pool of sauce will still have a dry mouth feel , whereas perfectly cooked fish with no sauce at all will have a moist mouth feel . As for what to cook cod with as a replacement for lemon the answer is nothing . Fish has enough moisture to begin with , and when baking you do n't need to assist heat transfer . Lemon is simply a flavoring , so replace it with flavoring you like . This could be browned butter ( or just a bit of butter ) if you want richness , or herbs if you like , or you could just season it with salt and pepper . If you want to get more fancy you could seal it up in parchment paper or foil ( oil the foil so it does n't stick ) with a tiny bit of water or butter and some herbs and bake it that way , it seals in the moisture and creates a sauce - delicious !
It 's very difficult to give an answer , as the size and shape of the casserole can greatly affect the reheating time . I 've found to get the best results , I start the casserole covered in a cold oven ( put it in the oven , then turn the heat on ) , and cook it at low heat ( 300 ° F / 150 ° C ) until it 's heated through . Once it 's up to temperature , I uncover the dish and turn the oven to broil ( called ' grill ' in some areas ... when only the top element is on at very high heat ) , and brown the top . If you need to , once the dish is warmed through , you can turn the oven down to its lowest setting and hold it there until you 're near time to serve it . ( it only takes a few minutes to brown the top , especially if you adjust the oven rack so the casserole is an inch or so ( 2.5 cm ) from the heating element ) I 'd probably give myself an hour minimum to heat it , preferably 1.5 hours , and 2 hours if it 's an especially large dish .
You can , but the surface-to-mass ratio means that the outer layers will overcook well before the inside is cooked , so unless you 're interested in that texture , your two main options are : Steam them ( add some liquid , then put a lid on it ) Cut them smaller . ( halve or quarter before you saute ) I tend to halve smaller ones , and quarter larger ones , cutting through the stem each time so they do n't fall completely apart while cooking ( after trimming a little off the stem if it 's showing signs of drying out ) . Then saute 'til the outside has browned a little bit , and hit with salt and whatever spices ( or bacon ... dice up some bacon and render the fat while you cut up the sprouts , then use the fat for cooking the sprouts )
Yes . In fact , many , many people believe ( falsely ) that adding salt before or during cooking will keep beans hard ( a myth addressed in your first link ) , and most of these people have been cooking perfectly good beans for many years without adding salt until the beans were fully cooked . The cooking time may vary slightly . In some circumstances , the texture of the beans and/or their skins may soften at somewhat different rates than with salt . But the beans will still cook fine . ( One note : some chefs have claimed that cooking beans without salt causes people to add even more salt afterward to create a flavor that tastes " properly salted . " Beans are generally enhanced by adding flavoring components early enough in cooking for the flavors to penetrate . But you can always add salt afterward too ; the resulting flavor distribution will just be different . )
In short , kind of , but only with the proper accessories/equipment . You 'll never match a grill or griddle but you can get surprisingly close . As was mentioned in other answers , what you 're going to lose most is the sear . I was given a Corningware Microwave Browning Dish a while back and found that it actually works pretty well when you 're stuck with only a microwave . They were apparently popular when microwaves were new and exciting , but people did n't know how to use them well and they faded into oblivion . I 've seen them on sale on eBay so you might be able to find a good price there if you 're going to be stuck in the hostel for a while . The basic idea is , there 's a special kind of microwave-safe metal inside the base of the casserole . You heat this with nothing on it for 3 minutes to get it nice and hot . When you drop the patty on , it immediately sizzles . You use the microwave function to heat the inside , while the hot surface sears the outside . Although you 're likely not going to get a perfect burger , you do get a real nice Maillard reaction on the outside of both sides ( assuming you flip halfway ) and if you play with the cooking time and power ( to reduce that rubbery texture from overcooking ) , you can get something that 's ( in my opinion ) a good 75 % - quality burger compared to a griddle or grill . I actually burned pork chops on it once , that 's how hot the surface gets . As a bonus , similar to a nice Boos block , there is a gutter around the outside and the plate is slightly concave , so the juices run off into the reservoir and the burger wo n't sit in fat during the cooking . After reading the other answers ( ElendilTheTall 's specifically ) , I would think if you combined the steaming method to cook the burgers , with the microwave browning dish to sear , you could probably get a really good result . If the burgers were fully cooked via steaming you could probably heat the dish and sear the burgers without even turning the microwave on ( except to heat the casserole initially ) . I believe Alton Brown did an episode where he talked about a specific type of brick that you can find at most hardware stores which is microwave-safe for the same searing purpose , but I ca n't find that info right now .
Sausages are pretty forgiving . As long as you do n't burn them or leave the center raw , they should come out OK . Since they 're pretty fatty ( at least the good ones are ) there 's little chance of drying them out , so when in doubt , cook them a little longer . They 'll feel firm , not squishy , when they 're done . The easiest way to cook raw sausages is in the oven ( at 350-375 ° F , 180-190 ° C or so ) . If you 're doing it on the stove , I 'd brown them first in a little ( very little ) oil , then add some water , or beer , or wine , or whatever you happen to have ( not much - just enough to cover the bottom ) , cover , reduce the heat , and simmer until done . Feel free to cook some vegetables in the pan along with the sausage .
First , potato is not the same as potato . Conventionally , potato salad is always made with waxy potatoes , because mealy potatoes ' outer layers disintegrate when tossed with the sauce , much like making risotto . They are also less creamy in texture . But there is also the school of using mealy potatoes , because they absorb more seasoning , and also because some people like the soft texture . If you decide to go with mealy , use an acid in the cooking water ( depending on your seasoning , choose vinegar , citric acid , or the neutral tasting cream of tartar ) . This will firm the potatoes . It is n't necessary for waxy potatoes . Second , the cooking time depends strongly on size . You must cut them very evenly . Else you will have both undercooked and overcooked potatoes in the pot at any given moment ( up to the time when you only have overcooked ones ) . Smaller pieces are easier to work with . Third , you want to heat them as gently as possible . Start them in cold water , and cook them at a simmer , not at a boil . There is no way to predict when the potatoes will be ready . Even if you cut them to the same size every time , the sort and the age of the potatoes will result in varying cooking times . When the time is near , you must look after them and try them constantly . Take out a piece , cut it in half , cool it in cold water , and chomp on the exact center . If it is n't crunchy , stop the cooking immediately and remove the water . The time window in which they are just right is quite short . Season them while they are hot , they will then absorb the sauce instead of just swimming in it the way cold potatoes do .
Let 's start with a definition of cooking . The Oxford English Dictionary defines to cook as : To prepare or make ready ( food ) ; to make fit for eating by due application of heat , as by boiling , baking , roasting , broiling , etc. . However , from a chemical point of view , what happens when you are cooking meat is that you are using heat , amongst other things , to <URL> the proteins of the meat . Denaturation can also be achieved by other means , such as marinating the meat in an acid , such as citric acid ( contain in lemon juice ) or acetic acid ( contained in vinegar ) . You can also use other agents to induce denaturation , but they are not always fit for eating . However , it is important to understand that from a purely cooking perspective the two things are not the same : " cooking " with lemon ( I guess it is fine to use the verb to cook as long as you put it in quotes ) , gives a completely different result than cooking with heat . This is because other chemical reactions happen during application of heat and because , obviously , you do not end up with an hot product !
Beans split because the seed coat is n't soft enough when the interior of the bean rehydrates . Two factors that can help ease this problem : soak your beans to make sure the seed coat is well rehydrated when the bean interior cooks . This is the big one - heavily salt your soaking water . The salt ions will replace calcium in the bean skins and soften them . You will have magically whole beans . Refer to <URL> on chili which contains this image : <URL>
Its been a while but I found this thread as I was wondering the same thing ... Not much info on raw okara but I just googled raw soybeans ... " For human consumption , soybeans must be cooked with " wet " heat to destroy the trypsin inhibitors ( serine protease inhibitors ) . Raw soybeans , including the immature green form , are toxic to humans , swine , chickens , and in fact , all monogastric animals . " From wikipedia <URL>
Dry biscuits ( American ' biscuits ' - not cookies ) , or anything other flour based quick bread that dried out - if you 're trying to replicate the bread crumbs . You may be able to get by with a modified muffin recipe as well . You 'll want to avoid fats and oils to reduce the moistness . Yeast bread develops a particular flavor and larger hole structure than quick bread though . The flavor of a quick bread breadcrumbs should be slightly different , but in many dishes the subtle difference wo n't be overwhelming unless the breading is a ' star ' of the dish . The hole structure really does n't matter luckily - as developing that is a large part of the time factor of real bread . Drying it out will be the harder part . The denser structure holds moisture better , so slice it thin and give it low , dry , long heat . Personally , anything that you 're going to make for the purpose of breadcrumbs that is n't just a substitute ( like cereal , crackers , etc in the other answer ) , sounds like it 'd be easier just to make a loaf of fast rise bread to me .
It 's not going to be nice to drink a day later , no matter what . I 'd use it in baking a chocolate cake or something like that instead , if you ca n't bear to throw it out . The problem is not just the reheating , which will further cook the coffee and affect flavour , but that it 's been losing aroma and oxidizing for a day first . If you 're serving it to anyone you like even a little bit , serve them fresh coffee !!
The California Avocado Commission recommends this ( safe but wimpy - see below for a better way ) three-step process : Start with a ripe avocado and cut it lengthwise around the seed . Rotate the halves to separate . Remove the seed by sliding the tip of a spoon gently underneath and lifting out . The other common seed-extraction method - striking the seed with a knife and twisting - requires some skill and is not recommended . Peel the fruit by placing the cut side down and removing the skin with a knife or your fingers , starting at the small end . Or simply scoop out the avocado meat with a spoon . Be sure to sprinkle all cut surfaces with lemon or lime juice or white vinegar to prevent discoloration . <URL> Source : <URL> Notes : Another ( and my favorite ) way to remove the pit is by holding the half with the pit in one hand and striking the sharp edge of the knife used in step one into the pit , then twisting to remove . This is the " pro " way to do it , but takes a little practice . <URL> , it 's not that hard . If you 're going to be chopping the avocado up , you slice it up using the tip of the knife still in the shell , then scoop the sliced avocado meat out with a spoon .
When I make a paella I never cover it , I find it keeps in too much moisture . My uncovered method is to put the fish in and cook for 10 minutes . If my mussels are small I will usually wait 2-3 minutes before putting them in , bu for " standard " mussels 10 minutes seems to work well . I use a low-medium heat on a large burner .
It 's interesting that this is your experience , since " common knowledge " is the white pepper is milder than black . White pepper is the dried ripe fruit of the pepper Piper Nigrum , and the black is the unripe , cured and dried fruit . Black is usually hotter than white , but generally they are considered to be interchangeable , with the white being used in sauces and in cream dishes for a better look ( no black specks ) . Since this pepper is so strong for some reason , I would advise that you only use it in dishes that rely on the pepper flavor to the exclusion of others , say steak au poivre , or pepper pot , or salt and pepper scallops . Other than that you can cut back on the amount or grind it now and let it sit around for a while ... pepper has its strongest , best flavor when freshly ground ; it kills me to suggest that , but I 'm trying to answer your question . If it were mine , I would try to figure out a dish that this pepper would truly enhance , as I suggested .
I usually use 1/4 cup per person for a smallish portion , and 1/3 cup per person if you 're a bit hungrier . You 'll probably want to check the instructions for your rice cooker to check exactly how much water you should add as different manufacturers vary . I believe the one I used in the past needed an equal quantity of water to rice .
I regularly store chopped onion in my refrigerator ( or at least halves &amp; quarters ) . I either use tight-sealing plastic containers or zip-top bags . You may want to double-bag in zip-tops to be sure to avoid a smell . One problem you may be having is onion-ness getting on the outside of the container . Be sure the outside is all clean and dry - no point in having a nicely sealed packet of onion when the outside can get all stinky anyway .
My bread machine recipe books come with conversion instructions to make the bread traditionally . Here is a link to a site that will do the same : <URL> Best of luck with your bread making !
Fire is typically a poor heat source for direct cooking . It fluctuates with every breeze so the heating is very erratic . It also produces a lot of soot which tastes terrible and is bad for you . When cooking on a campfire much better results are had by cooking next to the coals than above the flame . Cooking with a gas flame is more reliable of course . A couple direct cooking applications of fire in the kitchen , that I can think of are : Flambe : Lighting a sauce which contains a lot of alcohol to burn off some of the raw alcohol taste . Roasting : Putting a steaming basket over a gas flame and charring the skin of peppers or eggplant . Caramelizing : Using a blowtorch to put a crust on creme brulee or to sear the exterior of a sous vide steak . I would recommend starting with the blowtorch for several reasons : It is harder to burn your house down with a torch than with a pan of flame . Blow torches are useful for things outside of the kitchen like stripping paint or starting the grill . There is something deeply satisfying about wielding a hissing , blue , knife of fire that appeals to the caveman within . As for safety . Keep a fire extinguisher on hand . Do n't let kids or pets in the kitchen when you are playing with fire . Keep your home owner 's insurance current .
Most beans can be soaked and cooked together with two exceptions . The beans should obviously have similar cooking times . For example I would n't cook chickpeas with other , harder beans because the chickpeas would be mush . Most brand do have similar cooking times so this is n't often a problem . Second , black beans should n't be soaked with any other beans because they will stain the other beans a very unappealing gray color . Admittedly this is cosmetic but I soak my black beans separately

Will meat overcook in a boiling water pot ?
Yes . Water boils at about 212F ( 100C ) and meat is cooked from 140F to 160F . If you left the meat in there for a very long time it would eventually approach 212F and start to get tough . The time that they give you is going to be the time it takes to ensure that the meat is safe to eat . Generally I like it to be closer to the rare side as it is more tender that way .
The PH scale ranges from 0 - 14 with the lower numbers being more acidic than the higher number . Canned tomatoes are generally around 3.5-4 .5 on the acidic scale , in other words just above the half way point below neutral 7 . As long as your tomato based sauce is not left in your seasoned Kadai ( as Kristina rightly points out ) for a long timeframe and your kadhai is washed out immediately after use no damage to the seasoned coating should occur . Just remember to wash out your Kadai ( with warm water and a cloth ) immediately after use to preserve the seasoned coating .
Not in my experience . The water will spread out through the pan and meat will still cook evenly , just slower . You should n't have this problem with most meats , but it can be a problem with chicken breasts in particular , and if you also have vegetables in the pan they can release a fair amount of water . The basic problem with too much water releasing from meat ( or anything else ) when frying is that it reduces the temperature of the oil down to the boiling point of water . That kills the advantage oil has over water , that it 's boiling point is much higher . ( Higher in fact than the temperatures typically used in cooking . The bubbling you see when frying are caused by the vaporization of water . ) That 's what oil makes more efficient at heat transfer , it 's temperature is higher . This also means that it still should cook evenly , just slower , because the oil will be at the same temperature as the water . You 're basically just simmering the meat instead of frying it . When this happens the simple solution is to temporarily turn up the heat . It takes a lot more energy to convert water into steam than it does to keep oil alone at a desired cooking temperature . You wo n't have to worry about burning anything , because the water in the pan will automatically regulate the temperature , keeping it at or below 100 C ( 212 F ) . Once enough of the water has been evaporated you 'll start to hear normal frying sounds again and you can turn back the heat to normal .
Harrold McGee indicates in On Food and Cooking that soaking brown rice for 20-30 minutes can speed the cooking . However , he does n't give any specifics . In looking to what I consider highly credible cooking web sites , I have not found any definitive answers . Cook 's Illustrated 's recommended method for the fastest , best tasting brown rice ( no link since it is probably on the pay site ) is : Boiling the rice for our brown rice recipe until it is almost tender ( about 30 minutes ) , draining it , then steaming it until done ( another five to 10 minutes ) is by far the best stovetop method for brown rice . <URL> ( 50 minutes steaming , 10 minutes resting ) is quite similar . <URL> recommends baking technique which may be delicious but is almost certainly the one that will heat your house the most : putting rice in a casserole covered with boiling water , and baking at 375 & deg ; F for 1 hour . You have actually asked two different questions : What is the fastest way to cook rice ( duration ) ? What is the most energy efficient way to cook rice ( least heating of your house ) ? These are not the same thing . Something to consider : of all liquid non-metals ( and I do n't think any of us are going to cook in molten iron ) , water has the the highest capacity to transfer heat . It is going to be very difficult to find a way to cook rice that is faster ( at least for actual time cooking the rice , when not counting bringing water to the boil ) than the traditional pasta method , as often employed in some parts of India : Bring water to a boil , add the rice , cook until done , and drain . However , the energy required to bring all of the surplus water to the boil and the enthalpy of vaporization will make this fast , but not efficient . Your most energy efficient rice production method ( and this is by the very laws of physics which govern our universe is also the one that will add the least heat to your home ) is almost certainly a rice cooker , which will heat only until it senses the rice is done . ( Of course , what the rice cookers are really measuring is the rise in temperature when the water is all absorbed or evaporated , and so the temperature can rise ; therefore , starting with the correct ratio of rice to water is critical ) . The bottom line : brown rice takes time to cook . Some rice cookers , however , let you set a timer so that the pot will have the rice ready when you come home . This might be your best bet .
Foor food safety , the recommendation means that the coolest part of the meat should reach the target temperature . For something like a beef or pork roast , the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast . For chicken or turkey , it will often be where the leg joins the body . You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading . Now , because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature , the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven . How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is . In other words , a large roast will have a greater thermal mass -- more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature , and the heat will transfer into the coolest point , raising its ultimate temperature . So , the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained . To err on the side of food safety , keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature . With a little experience , you 'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts , and remove it from the oven earlier . The bottom line however , is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature .
There is no single cut of meat that is universally used in Philadelphia . <URL> is common , and it may actually be the most traditional given the sandwich 's Italian origins ( top round is what is used in <URL> and <URL> ) . It is becoming more and more common to use <URL> , though , which is what is used in some of the most popular Philadelphian establishments ( e.g. , <URL> and <URL> ) , which makes sense given its higher fat content . As <URL> mentioned , you should be able to get your butcher to slice the meat into thin ( ~ 1mm ) pieces . If that is not possible , though , you can put an entire rib-eye roast into the freezer for a half hour or so . This will harden the meat without actually freezing it solid , and will make thinly slicing by hand much easier .

Ehow has an article on the specific dangers non-stick coatings can cause to humans and pets including fumes from heating a pan to too high a temperature , which I was unaware of . Of course , if the coating is flaking or fuzzy-looking , actual coating material , which is a carcinogen , can leach into the food cooked in the pan . Link to the Ehow article : <URL>
They are technically two different pastries . Shortcrust pastry made with water is called pâte a foncer , ' lining pastry ' . Shortcrust pastry made with milk is called pâte brisée . Pâte brisée typically contains a bit more butter , and is generally lighter and flakier than pâte a foncer , which is conversely crisper and firmer . So it 's up to you really ; both are very similar . The pâte brisée is more delicate , so if you have a ' heavy ' filling , say , lots of fruits , it might be better to go with the foncer .
The shooter 's sandwich you linked involves cooked mushrooms and fried steaks . In contemporary food safety practice , this is not shelf-stable at all . It can be held 3-5 days in the fridge , or up to 2 hours at room temperature . I can imagine that hunters did take it on longer trips historically . They lived in a time when mild food poisoning ( symptoms limited to bloating and light diarrhoe ) was commonplace , and the average person experienced it as often as the common cold , if not a bit more frequently . More serious types of foodborne illness were less frequent , but still appeared with some regularity in a given population . There are two reasons we do n't eat this way today . First , our standard of living is higher . We have the possibility to drastically reduce our risk of food-borne illness by choosing nutritious shelf-stable food for situations we need it , and we have much higher expectations of our own quality of life , including the expectation that the chance of getting bloating from a sandwich should be close to zero , not close to 10 % . Second , our meat today well may have much more pathogen contamination than in the past . If you slaughter one healthy animal in your small farm , the worst you get spread over the meat are some E. coli from inside its own guts , and normal E. coli do n't cause too bad symptoms ( mutations can be <URL> , but they are also exceedingly rare ) . Today , animals are penned together by the thousands , exchanging exotic pathogens while still alive , and then are slaughtered and eviscerated in efficient conveyor-like manner , so that if one cow had some unpleasant bacteria from somewhere , they will probably cross-contaminate the steaks from hundreds of other cows slaughtered in the same shift . Bottom line : It is absolutely not safe . You are free to decide to take the risk and eat it , but by the usual standards in the food industry , this is an unacceptably high risk , and it is foolish to take it .
Use the pasta cooking techniques in this answer : <URL> Bring just enough water to cover the pasta to a boil , put the lid on and let it sit . Use less water , less energy , and it ca n't boil over if it 's not boiling .
Depending on the design , the heating coil may have collapsed and is shorting out at various points This may cause it to run hotter than intended , and result in problems you describe Measure the current with a meter and compare to manufacturers label , if much higher it 's time to scrap it . Unlikely to be easily repairable if it has a heating coil If it is running hot it is likely to fail soon and not heat at all Modern crock-pots used solid elements , not coils . They also often have physical temperature regulation systems , not just a simple element selector switch
My mother had a similarly shaped pan with a lid that she 'd use for baking coffee cake and such when camping . It was all aluminum and much less complicated ( and likely not as useful ) as what your talking about . The closest thing I found is the <URL> . It looks they may be had for about $ 50 .
In my experience , the most likely impact of a gentle boil vs. a furious rolling boil is going to be on texture of starchy foods , such as potatoes or other root vegetables , rather than flavor . I 've found that a gentle simmer of potatoes will result in a mostly intact shape and consistent texture , whereas an aggressive boil without perfect timing can result in the outer layers of the potato breaking apart , sometimes before the center has time to cook fully . I 've seen similar issues with stuffed parcels of pasta like ravioli or boiled won tons . I 've also found that open pot egg poached eggs have much nicer results with a gentle simmer than an aggressive boil , perhaps for related reasons . Since part of how we experience taste is texture , you could say that the " taste " is affected .
Yes , you can , as long as it 's a decent quality blade grinder . It 's how I fill my moka pot , which I 've been using 5 days a week for the last 4 years . You ca n't do actual espresso in a blade grinder ( it 's not possible to get the grind consistent and fine enough ) . But moka pots are a lot more flexible in the grind of coffee that they will accept . Just grind it almost as fine as you can -- this takes about 30-40 seconds of grinding in mine -- and put it in the basket .
Actually it is neither filler nor binder , but moisture retainer . Breadcrumbs in your ground meat will absorb much of the natural juices during cooking and then will release that moisture back into the meat as it rests resulting in a ' juicier ' burger , meatball or meatloaf .
Anything will cook in a rice cooker , eventually . You will need to experiment with the size of the meat chunks . When the meal is done cooking , take them out and see if they are cooked and at the correct temperature . If not , finish cooking them and cut them up smaller next time . What I would do however is cube the meat , sear it , and then throw it in to the cooker . You will end up with a better texture this way .
As far as I know , pouring hot stuffs into the meringue ( beaten egg-white ) while mixing will denature the protein , and thus stiffen and stabilize the meringue . However , I have no idea why you should pour and wait , then mix in .
It depends highly on how fresh the vanilla is when you buy it . At least here in Germany , vanilla beans from the most common super market brands are mostly parched and IMHO already out of order when you pick them up in the store . For several years , I have ordered my vanilla in larger batches from an independent importer ( current price is about 30US $ for 60 beans ) and I 've at least kept them for a year and a half or perhaps two . The quality of course deteriorates with time , but they are not going bad as in " can not be used anymore " . One problem is however that if the beans are too fresh , they are a little bit tricky to store properly . As scientifics already wrote , it is usually recommended to keep vanilla in an air tight container to prevent them to dry out . If the beans are very fresh and still moist , this will cause water to condensate and I suppose it is not good for the beans to soak in water for a longer period of time .
Silly , silly me . As Jefromi suggested earlier , the largest contributor to the fact it takes that much longer is probably the fact that the eggs are at a different themselves at the moment I put them in . I used to store eggs in a cupboard ; now I store them in the refrigerator . That is not to say the other factors mentioned by Martha and Sklivvz do n't add to that -- they most likely do -- but this seems the most reasonable , if unanticipated , explanation . Thank you all for your answers and suggestions !

How can I successfully glaze asparagus ?
Try peeling the asparagus . This would work better with <URL> . Since the outer skin of asparagus is so smooth , I can see how glaze would just slip off . Peeled asparagus will have a slightly stickier surface for the glaze to hold on to . An added bonus is that some of the glaze should penetrate if the asparagus is peeled . Be aware that peeled asparagus will cook faster than unpeeled . See also : <URL>
The easiest method , and most common in a commercial setting , would be to add a small amount of yeast in addition to the sourdough starter . You will probably have to reformulate a bit , as the dough will mature faster leaving the starter less time to develop flavor . This is usually overcome by also increasing the proportion of starter ( and adjusting the final dough 's hydration based on the hydration of your starter ) . For instance , if your original recipe included 30 % starter ( in baker 's math ) , the faster version might have 40 % starter and .5 % yeast . If you use a liquid starter , you may then cut the water by 5 % or so , and if you use a solid starter no further adjustment may be needed .
I would suggest zucchinis . They taste very good with olive oil and they will be ready at the same time as the asparagus .
I think it depends how fussy a presentation you are working on . If it has to be perfect , there really is n't going to be any fixing it . If some variation is acceptable , just wait til it is a bit softer and patch the rip back together like you would any other dough . You 'll get less nice separation of the layers in that area .
The best approach is to use most of it to make a starter and feed the mother with flour and water for the next bread . Once you have the mother , you can feed it with as much flour as you need . Let 's say you have 1 cup of mother at 100 % hydration . You should use 3/4 cups of it to make a starter for the bread ( add flour and water to form a starter your formula suggests ) . Then , feed the remaining 1/4 cup with 3/8 of both water and flour to make it 1 cup again . Then , when your starter is active enough ( it 's better to rest overnight ) , you can make the bread the same way you do with commercial yeast . Just be sure to calculate the flour and water in the starter for baker percentages . The numbers are symbolic , it 's better to use weight and not volume for correct calculations of baker 's percentages .
Bananas are imported unripe and then ripened in the country of sale . This ripening is achieved by forcing ethylene gas through the bananas in special pressurised rooms . Bananas naturally produce ethylene as they ripen , so you could just put them in a sealable plastic bag to contain that gas . Tomatoes also produce ethylene , so you could pop a couple of those in as well , but be aware that they 'll also ripen faster too .
As a rule of thumb for a whole fish , and not a fillet - the gills should be bright red the skin/scales should be bright and shiny like metal this fish should n't really smell of anything except ' watery ' the flesh should rebound quickly when pressed the eyes should be bright and clear really fresh fish is also quite slimey to touch if it 's straight out of the water . I remember being quite surprised at this from my first fishing trip a few years back .
Use a pressure cooker . Try for example this recipe : <URL> where dried hominy is cooked in a pressure cooker .
For a substance to burn , it must first reach its ignition point . For it to keep burning , it must reach its fire point . The ignition point of a 40 % ABV liquid such as brandy is 26ºC / 79ºF , and the fire point is approximately 10ºC higher than that . What this means in practical terms is that you need to heat the alcohol a little first before you add it to the ice cream . The simplest way to do this is to put the alcohol in a ladle and heat it over the hob - it wo n't need much as 36ºC is not a great deal over room temperature . Then light it carefully with a long match , and pour it around your ice cream - if you 've got it warm enough it should keep burning until the alcohol is consumed .
Some fruit juices can be heated to drive off excess water ( especially those with a higher sugar content ) but citrus does n't tolerate this well . Fresh-squeezed citrus will get bitter and acrid if reduced . Instead , squeeze your citrus as normal and freeze the juice in an open container . Once it 's set into a solid block , place it into a funnel or strainer over a collection vessel . The juice itself will run off more quickly and collect in the vessel , while the ice crystals stay in the strainer ( until they melt , at least - do n't let them melt all the way , or you 're back to the beginning ) . Once the ice looks very lightly colored , discard it and enjoy your concentrated juice . You can repeat this process if you want further concentration , though eventually there will come a point where the juice is so concentrated that it wo n't freeze at conventional freezer temperatures . Good instructions for this process <URL> - it 's really quite simple !
Yes , you can freeze buttermilk . When thawed , the emulsion will break into solids and whey . This makes no difference for baked goods ; you can also use a blender to restore it to a smooth , thicker liquid if needed for applications like salad dressing . See also : <URL> . <URL>
In a cup with water . You place them straight up in a small cup with a little water . Just like you would if you were storing flowers . You 'll want to store this in your chill chest on the top most rack ; to avoid any cross contamination from other possible food products ( chicken , etc ) . You may want to leave the rubber band on to allow it to stay tidy . If you must you can cover your asparagus cup with a zip lock bag on top . With this method we usually can store asparagus for 5-7 days . If you must keep them longer it maybe better to just freeze them in an air tight bag . after they 're dried out .
Quite often that look can be from having the temp too high on the oven . A convection oven should always be at least 25 ( and some people will say up to 50 ) degrees cooler than a ' normal ' oven . If you have n't tried it yet , knock down the temp of the oven . We used to call this ' lava tops ' , because basically the outside is baking and setting quickly , and then the insides pop out of the gelatinous surface , and they go in a funny direction ( often the way the fan blows ) . I 'm not saying that is the problem for sure , but if it were me , it would be the first thing I tried to eradicate the problem .
This is an art . Anyone who appreciates REAL tacos , can understand that this is not easy . God Bless anybody that can pull this off accurately ! I have it down to a science . I learned from my grandfather . His biggest secret was in the fork you use . We use cooking forks . 3 prong cooking forks ( most of the ones I see on google have two prongs ) . You can use regular forks too , but they arent made for cooking in high temp oil . First you must get the oil HOT . 350 atleast , preferably 400 degrees . Just before it starts smoking . You need really high oil heat . Once the oil is PLENTY hot , you hold a tortilla in one hand , and drop it in the oil halfway . It should be at 90 degrees , with your hand still holding the dry half of the tortilla . ( Note : keep your cooking fork ready for the next steps ) If your oil is hot enough , it will cook that half of the tortilla almost instantly . Let it cook until it hardens up , which should be less than a minute . Once the first half the bent tortilla is crisp , use the cooking fork to grab the tortilla half that is crisp and cooked . You will flip it here , putting the dry tortilla half ( that was in your hand ) into the oil , while the cooked half , sits above the oil with your fork . Now it should cook the other half of the taco shell . The art is using the fork well enough to create a gap at the base of the shell ( for meat or whatever you stuff with ) . And then flipping it and holding it with the fork while the other side crispens and finishes up . I would like to make a youtube video that shows this process , and it truly is an artform . Many people make great tacos but horrible tortilla shells . I grew up near Mexico , I was born 4 miles from Matamoros . I have seen my share of taco cooking , in the strangest of places . The best tacos Ive ever had use this method . And the best taco makers Ive ever seen wouldnt do this any other way ( by hand ) . It 's hard to do this without burning your hand ( s ) . Be careful . The dry tortilla absorbs the hot oil , even when your holding it over the grease in the first step . Youd be surprised how a corn tortilla will drink the oil right up to your hand . Give it practice . You will mess up a few tortillas . Dont worry about that , they make great quesadillas or nachos :)
The amount of tea you use wo n't affect the flavor of tea adversely ; the way you brew it will . This also depends on what kind of tea you 're making ( black , oolong , green , white , herbal ) . Greater quantities of tannins are <URL> , which makes the tea more bitter . TL ; DR : If you follow the instructions for brewing temperature and time , you should be able to more or less add as much tea as you want . Black teas are brewed with boiling water , typically for 2-3 minutes . Green , white and oolong teas are usually brewed at lower temp ( 180 F ) for 3-4 minutes , and herbal teas at just below boiling for anywhere from 4-8 minutes . I 've found that I can easily more than double the amount of tea leaves I use , brew it at the recommended temperature for the recommended time ( most tea packages should have instructions ) , and store the 2x concentrated tea in my refrigerator . Upton Tea has a <URL> for water temps and amounts . They also have <URL> for hot and cold brewing iced tea - they recommend double or tripling the leaf quantity when hot brewing , then diluting to taste . ( I buy a lot of my teas from here , and their instructions have never steered me wrong . ) If you 're looking for even more information about preparation of and descriptions / histories of different types of tea , I recommend the Harney &amp; Sons <URL> .
<URL> by Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page has a large section on food pairings . For carrots they mention orange , ginger , lemon , basil and mint . I think any of these could work well , if done right . My suggestion would be first to use really good , flavorful carrots -- preferably from a farmer 's market . Second , I would tone down or even leave out some of the usual carrot cake spices so that you do n't cover up the carrot flavor or the subtle flavors of your possible additions . Maybe fresh or candied ginger in the cake itself would be good . Orange or lemon curd and/or zest would work particulary well in offsetting the cream cheese icing . I 'm thinking basil and mint might be better saved for another dessert .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
Corn starch only thickens when heated to 180 F , so it probably is not helping at all with your whipped cream . I live in the US , so I can not compare to whipped cream in the UK . Whipped cream for cake fillings is often beaten almost to the breaking point to make the foam as thick as possible . I assume you are whipping the cream sufficiently , and it still is n't getting as thick as you would like . If that is the case , you might try <URL> . The link is one of many I have found on a quick search , and it specifically calls for 35 % cream . This <URL> also has some interesting thoughts and advise . This <URL> also provides an interesting method of using creme fraiche .
By maximising first the flavour of every single nut and then maximising the surface : Gently roast the cashews , then grind them finely . If the resulting " gritty " texture is not to your taste , grind them further until you get a nut butter , which should dissolve nicely especially in cream-type soups .
In the freezer , more-or-less indefinitely , depending on how good your freezer is . Certainly months to years . In the fridge , it depends on the kind of mole . Quick moles ( like various green moles ) do n't keep very long , maybe a week at most . A long-cooked mole should keep a bit longer -- up to 2 weeks -- since all of the ingredients are completely cooked . If you 're not planning to use it within a week , though , why not freeze it ? The texture wo n't take any harm from freezing and thawing .

What are the differences between a Dutch oven and ceramic casserole ?
First , fully generically : The main distinction made by The New Food Lover 's Companion ( Fourth edition , 2007 ) is that a " casserole dish " , can be glass , metal , ceramic , or any other heatproof material , while a Dutch oven is usually made of cast iron . Another distinction is that the Dutch oven may be a kettle , which typically implies the presence of an overarching handle from which the entire pot may be hung ( as over a fire ) , while no such option is offered up for their definition of a casserole . This is generally confirmed by the fact that while , yes , both we and the marketplace ( sellers ) seem often to use the terms casserole and Dutch oven interchangeably , whenever the vessel is equipped with an overarching handle retailers seem to avoid referring to it as a casserole . More specifically , when you turn to high end concerns in service to restauranteurs , such as <URL> , there 's no confusion on the matter . Casseroles invariably lack overarching handles and , unlike Dutch ovens , may come in quite small sizes and do n't necessarily require lids . So while Dutch ovens may or may not have overarching handles , they <URL> have lids and are invariably substantial in size . The compiled side-by-side photos below , as extracted from WebstaurantStore , goes to show just how severe the contrast can be between the two items . Second , to the question of browning : Here are a couple of examples which seem to speak for themselves , as far as how well ceramics or ceramic coatings can be expected to perform when baking breads . <URL> offers a Cast-Iron Loaf Pan ( photo below ) about which it says , The specially formulated black matte interior enamel contains traces of quartz , giving it additional heat resistance and a rougher surface resulting in better browning . <URL> also offers a Bread Cloche ( photo below ) , for which it makes the following claim , Duplicating the benefits of baking in a brick oven , the ceramic bread cloche turns out individual loaves with tender , moist interiors and crispy , evenly golden crusts . I 'm sure there exist any number of additional examples of bakeware , each of which possesses similar properties to these . ( The links provide a good deal more information . ) I hope this however is enough to help you take the plunge , so to speak , toward this option if that 's what you 're interested in doing .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
In a small toaster oven , using a pizza stone is likely to be a tradeoff : Toasting -- counter-productive , because it will shield the bottom of the bread ( or other item ) from the direct radiative heat from the bottom elements ; you would want to remove the stone for this use . Broiling ( or as it is called in the British parlance if I understand correctly , grilling ) -- Probably not a good idea . In a full sized oven , the stone would be left far enough from the heating elements that it would not be subject to intense radiative heat . In a toaster oven , it might be too close to the elements when the oven is used this way , so might be subject to cracking due to a higher temperature gradient and uneven thermal expansion . General baking -- will require a longer a pre-heating period for the oven/stone to come up to temperature , but once at temperature , will provide a buffering effect for more even heating . Convenience -- in full sized ovens , people often leave the stone in all of the time , and cook on a different rack if they do n't want direct contact with the stone . This may or may not be possible or convenient in a toaster oven , so you may be constantly removing or putting back the stone based on your current use Note that all of the above is just reasoning based on known facts ; I have n't tried a pizza stone in a toaster oven , and would n't do so , as they have a generally low thermal mass . I tend to think of them as tools for toasting and reheating , not for primary cooking , baking , or roasting .
Depending on where you are , the word <URL> can mean a few different things . In Mexico it refers to a flatbread made of either wheat or corn and a few other ingredients . These flatbreads tend to come in standard sizes in the United States at least , one of which might be labeled the " burrito " size . A <URL> is one use for a tortilla . A burrito consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped around a filling . Often the filling might include beans , cooked meat , rice , and perhaps vegetables .
If your question is if we can , the answer is yes . Rapadura = brown sugar tablet . The brown sugar is very similar to panela and jaggery . The difference is the source of raw material , and the origin of the country where it is processed obtain the sugar . Jaggery is in Asia , brown sugar and panela or rapadura in many Latin American countries .
I just happened across this older question and found the answers provided , including the information in the link to wikipedia to be incorrect . All Prime Ribs are Standing Rib Roasts , not all Standing Rib Roasts are Prime Rib . A " Prime Rib " is a standing rib roast , from a beef that has achieved a USDA Grade of " Prime " . Bone-In or Bone-out are separate distinctions the can be applied to any standing rib roast , regardless of grade . U.S. Prime -- This is the highest grade of beef with the most fat marbling . This meat is very tender and only accounts for about 2.9 % of all graded beef . U.S. Prime is usually reserved for high end dining establishments . Because this beef has such a high level of fat marbling , it is excellent for dry heat cooking methods . <URL> Also , technically a Prime Rib is not a ' steak ' but rather a ' slice of roast ' . If one takes a slice from a raw rib primal and grills or broils it as a steak it is a " Rib Eye " , and can also be either " bone-in " or " bone-out " . ( the use of the word ' primal ' refers to a primary cut of beef , the first cuts a butcher will use to section a beef beyond quartering , it is utterly unrelated to the word " prime " in " Prime Rib " )
While you can easily melt a foil pan over a hot campfire , yours will be filled with juicy peaches - so assuming you do n't over-cook it , you should be safe . 40 minutes directly on the coals might be pushing it though - consider using a gridiron to control the heat by elevating the pan slightly , and stick around to keep an eye on things ... Remember , dutch ovens are thick , heavy , and slow to transmit heat , and the recipes reflect this . I would avoid doubling either the pan or the foil : you 'll end up with an air gap between the two layers , which will likely just end up ruining the outer pan . Pay a little extra for the thicker " heavy-duty " foil and you should be fine . Wet sand between two pans is an interesting idea ... If you try it , report back ! My biggest worry here would be burning the peaches before they have a chance to release their juices ( no slow warm-up with aluminum - you 'll essentially be frying them ) . If you can elevate the pan , you should be fine ; otherwise , consider macerating them first ( if you have very ripe , juicy peaches , count your blessings and ignore this suggestion ) . Finally , consider that Harbor Freight sells cast-iron dutch ovens for $ 25 . The quality is n't stellar , and it 's extra weight to lug around , but you 'll probably end up with better food all the same .
You are relying on very different forms of heat . Conduction vs Convection vs Radiation <URL> <URL> <URL> What happens when you heat something ? A number of things . Proteins Coagulate Starches Gelatinize Sugars Caramelize Water Evaporates Fats Melt Depending on how you cook it , you 're going to get different forms of each of those at different rates . On a stove , you can avoid too much moisture and fat from leaving your food by cooking it extremely quickly ( in a stir-fry ) . . You ca n't sear something in an oven and you ca n't roast something on the stove . The two are simply not the same , because fundamentally the two are not the same , you are not going to get the same results . It 's really as simple as that . You ca n't take two entirely methods and argue that you get the same results .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .
In their various parts of the world , all of these words mean sauce , at least some of the time . They come from different cultures , though , and carry different connotations at least in US usage . Short answer , though : there are no absolute differences that you can count on . Salsa This is a generic term in Spanish , and in South American cuisines . It can cover everything from a thick , dark mole , an adobo , a light and piquant salsa verde , or the typical tomato , onion and pepper sauce often served with chips in the US . Some salsas are smooth ; others are chunky . They can be cooked or raw . Many people use the word to indicate the red , fresh or lightly cooked tomato salsa with onions , garlic , peppers and usually cilantro often served in Mexican restaurants in the US , but this is only the beginning of what salsas can be . Sauce The generic term . Almost any flavorful liquid put on another food to enhance it . These range from elegently smooth ( such as hollandaise ) to quite chunky such as putanesca sauce . Gravy Gravy tends to be a sauce made from meat drippings , and thickened to serve with the meat or its accompaniments . In Italian-American usage , it often covers " Sunday Gravy " or a ragu made from tomatoes and one or more ( or many meats ) that in some communities was traditionally made on Sunday ; and more generally , any sauce with meat in it . I am told that in Italian in the context of pasta sauces , the actual word is ( forgive my spelling ) accompanimento , an accent for the pasta which is the star . Chutney The word chutney derives from the India/Pakistan region , where again there are a myriad different sauces that carry the title . In the US , it tends to be used for a chunky , acidic sauce made from fruit and/or vegetables . This overlaps considerably with jam or preserves , in this sense , although chutneys tend to be much more strongly spiced , and may contain complex combinations of complimentary ingredients . Still , this does n't cover the full range such as a chutney of pureed cilantro and/or mint , which is much more thin and sauce-like than the above more typical US usage . Conclusion You can not really draw strict distinctions among these categories . You have to know what the specific sauce or item is that is being discussed to strongly draw inferences about it .
Good Answer Hobodave ... tacking onto that : Most southern U.S. brands ( White Lily , Martha White ) of all-purpose flour are bleached because southerners tend to make more quick breads ( biscuits , cornbread , hoecakes , pancakes , as well as cakes , pie crusts , cobblers ) where tenderness is desired . White Lily has just started producing unbleached all-purpose flour as well . Brands from the Northeast ( King Arthur ) and midwest are usually unbleached because those regions tend to make more yeast breads and the additional gluten forming capability of unbleached flour produces better results . National U.S. brands ( Pillsbury/Gold Medal ) often produce both types or stick with unbleached . Cake flour is always bleached ( usually chlorine gas ) . More information on differences in types of flour can be found in my article titled <URL>
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
Actually , <URL> are often white , and may be purple or other colors . . In the US , what we get labeled as yams are actually sweet pototoes . ( They were similar to the african yams that people were used to , and the name stuck , sort of like how ' pepper ' is used for chilies , but they 're not even close to the same thing . ) update A <URL>
In my experience the primary difference is that Calzones have Ricotta ( and possibly Mozzarella ) and Strombolis only have Mozzarella . In the Philadelphia area , both are folded over pizzas , basically . Growing up , my mother made Stromboli and it was rolled , not folded . I rarely see that in a pizza shop these days , but I do prefer that in a Stromboli . Edit : Just read systempuntoout 's link to Wikipedia and it confirmed something that I was going to post and then deleted . When I was growing up , Strombolis were made from bread dough and Calzones were made from pizza dough ; nowadays all of the pizza shops just use pizza dough . I remember bread stores as being the primary place to get Strombolis growing up because they were the ones that made the dough !
春卷 ( Chūnjuǎn , Spring rolls ) are julienned vegetables , sometimes with a bit of noodles , sometimes with a bit of minced meat , wrapped with a flour dough skin and pan - or deep-fried . They are a filled roll . You can see the different varieties by country here : <URL> Spring roll : 鸡蛋卷 ( Jīdàn juǎn , Egg rolls ) are many different things around the world . In Chinese communities , these typically refer to a sweet biscuit type roll , of hollow flaky egg pastry ( not filled . ) However , there is also another variety ( common in American Chinese cuisine ) where a flour dough wrap is filled with " pork , shrimp , or chicken , adding cabbage , carrots , bean sprouts and other vegetables , and then deep fried . " In the American Chinese respect , I believe it is very similar to a Spring roll really , although the flour dough looks thicker and of a different composition than a typical Spring roll ( the dough bubbles when deep-fried , with Spring roll skin it does not . ) <URL> Sweet egg roll : American Chinese egg roll :
First off , the terminology issue . So , can someone please clear up this fog ? What 's the difference between Microwave and Oven and Microwave Oven ? <URL> Both terms mean the same thing : an appliance that uses microwave radiation to heat food . Cooking food in this way is called " microwaving " . An oven , on the other hand , has a heating element which heats the air inside , which then heats the food . Cooking food in this way is generally called " baking " , though there are a lot of other things ( e.g. roasting ) you can also reasonably do in an oven . So if all you have is a microwave , then all you can do is microwave ( not bake ) . And if you have an oven , then you can bake ( but of course you ca n't microwave ) . There also exist combinations , which are capable of both microwaving and baking , i.e. they have a microwave emitter and a heating element . However , remember that in the US - and thus on much of the internet - something talking about a " microwave oven " likely does not mean this combination , but simply microwave heating . Names like " convection microwave oven with grill " , " combination microwave/oven " do refer to these combinations , though . I 've also seen " speed oven " . You may sometimes have seen people referring to these combination microwave/ovens as a " microwave oven " ( I think this may be common in Indian English ) , but that 's really just imprecise language . Some sites say that a " microwave " is only for heating or re-heating cooked food . Whereas , in " microwave ovens " , you can microwave and bake . Is that true ? It sounds like in this statement , " microwave oven " is careless language , referring to a combination microwave and oven . ( It does n't make any sense at all otherwise ; the two things are the same thing , so of course you can do the same things in them . ) So the question is really , what can you do in a microwave vs an oven , or a combination microwave/oven ? It 's true that microwaves are mainly used for reheating cooked food , and it 's true that they ca n't actually bake . However , they can do a lot more than reheat food ; there are a lot of kinds of cooking besides baking . For example , microwaves are great at simmering/boiling and steaming , and it does n't matter if the food was cooked already or not . The recipes you 're talking about are probably mostly in those kinds of categories , but if you 're interested , <URL> discusses in a bit more detail what works in microwaves . The big things that you can do with ovens but not microwaves are the things that actually need the steady dry heat of baking . You ca n't bake bread or cookies or roast a chicken in a microwave . Microwaves hold in a lot of steam and do n't get terribly hot , so you ca n't generally get things to brown or crisp up . They also do n't really hold a temperature like you need for baking , they just pump more and more heat into the food .
I would recommend a combination toaster and convection oven . While I have a regular oven in my small apartment , I rarely use it in favor of saving energy ( and money on my energy bill ) by using the toaster/convection oven . I have purchased toaster oven sized muffin tins ( just a 6 muffin tin ) and a toaster oven sized roasting rack that fits two sizes of meat . My oven came with a roasting pan . The convection features have done wonderful things for my pies . You can get them big enough to make pizza in . As long as you are n't cooking for a crowd , it will work wonders . Things I 've successfully baked in there include : Muffins Cake ( did have to do it one cake at a time for a layer cake ) Pie ( the convection feature is perfect for pie ! ) Bread Cupcakes Pitas Steak ( well , it was a broiled steak recipe - the best I can do without a grill ) Chicken breasts I had a friend who rented a place that has a convection cooking setting on the microwave . We successfully used it to make muffins once , but I have n't tried it further .
Cast iron is ideal , but any pot that can take the heat and has a tight lid will work . Like @talon8 said in his comment , it does n't even have to be metal . This article from <URL> specifically uses terracotta for sourdough , not cast iron . Just as an FYI , this related question deals with preheating ( for no-knead bread , not sourdough ) , and the differing answers are interesting . To me it just goes to show that bread-making does n't always have to follow super-strict rules . <URL>
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element . A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat , similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb . An induction stove does n't actually generate heat itself , but rather induces it the pot or pan . It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field . This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat , thus heating the food . Induction stoves are faster , safer , and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves . It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up . They are safer because they do n't actually generate heat themselves . After taking a pot off the " burner " ( glass surface ) it quickly begins to cool . With regards to differences in the cooking process , there 's not much . You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove . It does affect your choice of pans however . All aluminum pans will not work , nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones . If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine . The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface .

My sauerkraut was left with dark mold covering the surface , is it ok ?
Per NC State 's Extension 's <URL> ( some emphasis added ) : Pickles or sauerkraut mold during fermentation . Answer : Unsafe -- microorganisms are growing improperly . Possible reasons Fermentation temperature was above 75 & deg ; F. Too much salt was used , not allowing adequate lactic acid production . The cloth on top of the kraut was not kept clean during fermentation ( may need to be replaced after skimming ) . Per Penn State Extension 's <URL> ( emphasis added ) : Do not taste it if you see mold on the surface , feel a slimy texture , or smell a bad odor . Their <URL> says : To avoid surface mold growth , keep the cabbage submerged at all times by covering it with a plate just small enough to ft inside the fermentation container or with two or three clean quart jars filled with water . An acceptable alternative is to fill a large , sealed , food-grade plastic bag containing 4 1/2 tablespoons of salt and 3 quarts of water . Again , no indication of acceptable types of mold . I can not endorse the existing answers which indicate that mold is an acceptable part of the saurkraut making process , unless credible science based evidence is presented , from reputable sources such as University Extension Centers or , better yet , peer reviewed journal sources .
Sure it 's safe . You are about to char the outside at very high temperatures , nothing 's going to survive that , so cleaning it is more about flavor than safety . I would n't just wipe it though , clean it with water or you might get a dirtier steak flavor than you 'd like .
I roast them " fresh " as I need them , but my method scales up easily . I use a gas grill and turn it to high . Set the whole peppers on the grill , and turn them when the skin is black on the hot side . When they 're black all over ( after maybe 2-3 minutes per side for all 4 sides of the typical ones in my local supermarket ) , I put them into a large disposable plastic container with a tight fitting lid and let them cool in it . The skin peels off quite easily , and they can be seeded and de-stemmed quite easily . If I were going to preserve them , I 'd probably chuck them into a plastic container or zip-top bag and freeze them .
Garlic will spoil faster in the fridge actually . I do n't know how long it will last in the fridge , but I understand that it lasts longer if you leave it in a cool , dark , dry storage . I believe one reason is that your fridge is generally too humid . In my experience , garlic kept in the fridge is also more likely to develop mould ( goes soft , and dark discolouration ) . I keep mine in a ceramic thing in one of my cupboards . It lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on the garlic ( probably how long it sat before getting to my kitchen ) . If you store it like that , garlic that goes " bad " will usually start to sprout ( green shoots , will come through the top .
<URL> recommends : Cover with a plate weighted down with jars filled with water or cover with a large food grade plastic bag filled with salt water ( 6 tablespoons salt per gallon of water . )
Based on comments to the original question : It sounds like you used the wrong type of sugar . Icing sugar is also referred to as <URL> or confectioner 's sugar . From your description , it sounds like you used what we call ( in Canada ) superfine or fruit sugar ( sugar for sprinkling on fruit , not from fruit ) .
I 'm writing this so it helps someone else . I decided to freeze my fondant because I did n't have time to air dry the fondant like @Sunishtha Singh suggested . I did n't want the fondant to become too dry either by adding the tylose/CMC powder or use the gum paste/satin ice because personally , I prefer the flavour of fondant better than gumpaste . So , I found <URL> link and <URL> one and decided to follow the instructions . But I did add a bit of guess work and common sense and instead of freezing the fondant panels for 15-20 minutes , I only froze for 10 minutes and did n't open the fridge/freezer until the 10 minutes were finished . I also put the panels in the freezer at the same time and worked very quickly to attach the panels once the 10 minutes were finished . Once I attached the panels , I switched on the aircon but not for more than 15-20 minutes and it seemed to be fine , even considering that it had been raining all day . I do n't know what role does the fridge play in this but I have a frost free fridge . I also used black fondant for the panels and even though I personally find it much more moist than the white fondant , the panels attached nicely and the shoebox looked very smooth , at least from the sides . I hope this helps someone and I give the fondant freezing a thumbs up :)
I have n't been able to find any empirical data , but here are my theories : Most cookies contain butter which has similar proteins as milk and the combination of the two resonates on that level . Soy milk does not share those protein profiles , so there is no sensory resonance . Cookies are generally quite sweet and rich . Milk helps blunt that sweetness by washing away some of the sugar and coating the tongue . Many soy milks have sweeter taste than dairy milk which would make the overall sweetness of the combination excessive . ( For comparison 's sake does your roommate use soy milk on sweetened cereals or more neutral-tasting cereals ? I would suspect the latter . ) In addition to the natural " grassy " flavors that soy milks can have , they may also have other flavorants like vanilla that make them less neutral flavored than dairy milk which competes with the flavor of the cookies .
Personally , I 'd just season the pan a couple times to cover the spot ; it seems excessive to strip off all the other seasoning and start from scratch unless the pan is really deeply rusted . Other people may feel differently , of course ; there are as many opinions about caring for cast-iron as there are people that own it .
The first yeast was " just there " - in the environment , everywhere . People discovered very early on that leaving the dough ( or just a flour-water slurry ) out would lead to it getting " sour " and " bubbly " , thus leavening the bread : What we today call sourdough is in fact a mixture of yeasts and bacteria ( lactobacillae ) . The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation . ( M.G. Gaenzle : Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology ) Early sources are the Bible ( - > the explicit demand for of " unleavened " or " unsoured " bread during Passover suggesting that otherwise was the norm ) and sources from Ancient Egypt . The " modern " yeast that was explicitly added was mentioned by <URL> in his Naturalis historia as a foam skimmed from beer : In Gaul and Spain , where they make a drink by steeping corn in the way that has been already described - they employ the foam which thickens upon the surface as a leaven : hence it is that the bread in those countries is lighter than that made elsewhere . Source : <URL> . Pliny the Elder . John Bostock , M.D. , F.R.S. H.T. Riley , Esq. , B.A. London . Taylor and Francis , Red Lion Court , Fleet Street . 1855 . Sources from the 18th century describe how the <URL> ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) was used for baking , leading to the " specialized strains " of <URL> cultivated separately when the brewers switched to bottom-fermenting yeast ( S. pastorianus ) in the 19th century , which preferred cooler temperatures and was not as easy to harvest as the top-fermenting types . The use of separately cultivated yeast allowed to bake " milder " breads than the sourdough types with their typical acidic undertones but is restricted to certain flour types .
In short , using port as a substitute for red wine will not wreck the dish . Though the flavour is different ( and richer ) and will make your bolognese taste different as a result , the taste should not be bad . I frequently do this as I am not a red wine drinker , and port keeps far better in an open bottle . I would recommend using slightly less than when using red wine , but this is highly subjective .
If the wheel is intact , 2 or 3 days at room temperature will be fine . Hard cheeses like that are aged at temperatures not far below normal room temperature . If the wheel were cut , if the temperature got above room temperature or if you were asking about a longer period of time , I might be slightly concerned . But in your situation , your cheese will be fine . On the off chance that it develops some mold , cut the mold away with at least a one inch buffer .
More likely is that he used the syrup that <URL> are stored in . It 's sometimes used by those who do n't know better in things like <URL> . It is bright , bright red , very sweet , very strongly flavored of cherries ( or more properly a sort of sickly , artificial interpretation of the flavor ) . I hope it 's obvious that I 'm not a fan of this stuff . If this was his first time making the drink , it seems likely that he misinterpreted the term <URL> , which is altogether different . It 's distilled from <URL> ( which are actually quite sour and bitter , not sweet ) and has a much more subtle , complex flavor . Quite frankly , I 'd consider this a pretty dumb error - it 's like using orange juice instead of orange liqueur . If the bar does n't carry maraschino liqueur , then they ca n't make a proper Last Word . Brands like Luxardo are pretty ubiquitous at good cocktail bars in the US these days , so there 's not much excuse for lacking it . My advice is either to buy this fellow a good craft cocktail book , or stick to ordering beer and wine from him from now on .
Do n't check on it . When I lived in Virginia I used to drive up to Pennsylvania every year to this little Amish farm to buy a gallon of the best sauerkraut I 've ever tasted . They showed you how they made it , and I remember the farmer stressing two things : ( 1 ) sterilize the jars , ( 2 ) do n't touch it for 2 months .
Keep in mind that tap water is tested to ensure it 's safe for human consumption . Rainwater has no such requirement . While rainwater seems to be a happy-fuzzy natural resource , I 'd like to stress that this could be a serious safety issue . Yes , it seems unlikely , but you need an authority who knows their water . I suggest seeking out a professional opinion on how to properly filter rainwater . Possibly from the people who handle your municipal water supply .
The official answer from your health department is no , it 's not safe . After four hours at room temperature , you have to pitch it . That standard is a little on the paranoid side . Which is appropriate , since they have to protect people for whom a little salmonella is potentially life-threatening ( the infirm , babies , the elderly , etc. ) If you 're young and healthy , the odds are it will do you no harm whatsoever . Even a glass of milk out overnight is merely going to be sour rather than toxic . So , it 's up to you . I 'd say it 's a cup of tea and it will taste better if you make a fresh one , even if the risk to your health is small-but-not-zero .
Just an idea ... I 've had problems making foam because of hard/basic tap water ( a lot of chalk in the water ) - making frape though , not garlic foam :) Foam will more easily form in soft water as you can easily test with a piece of soap . If you have hard tap water you could try using boiled water ( some of the chalk in the water will react and leave a residue on the bottom of the pot ) or bottled water with pH 7 ( neutral ) . Another idea would be to add just enough acid for neutralisation but I imagine that could be a bit tricky and you 'd risk the milk curdling so I would n't recommend it .
Here is how you can find out further if your ginger has gone bad in the fridge : extra moist skin will peel off easily when touched and texture is slimy obvious blackish , dark yellowish skin aroma is no longer the fresh one , but rather a ginger aroma covered by a sharp unpleasant earthy smell/mixed smell . You can notice it 's going/gone bad . You may cut it in half and check the inside still . If it <URL> , then hard-peeling of the skin up to 2-3 mm can still leave you with good piece of ginger . But in order to store this now , you have to slice it , dry and put a zip lock . It can last for about a week . Ginger is a root and there are ways you can store it without even freezing . I have had the luxury to dig a ginger root when needed . However for the recent years we had been storing it either outside , in an indoor soil basket or in the fridge . All are proven methods that many are successfully using . Otherwise I would n't want to blabber ... Keep unpeeled ginger root in an outside rack , e.g. an onion rack , or in a dry place that has proper ventilation . You will see it sprouts and/or dries a bit , but it can last with flesh inside up to a month . You can cut the portion you need and keep it back in this place . This way it does n't get moist or turn into the texture that you encounter usually by storing in the fridge . Make sure the root is not damaged by slugs . Get some soil/sand into a bucket , and bury it in it like how you can store winter veggies . Store it in the fridge by wrapping it with a paper towel or a piece of paper or of thin cloth . Extra moisture will be absorbed by the wrapping .
Is this normal ? Yes , it is . Sinew and other connective tissues ( silverskin/fascia , ligaments ) are very tough stuff ; you need to remove as much as possible by hand before grinding . Sinew and ligaments are strong , whitish strands or " cables " connecting bones to muscles and to other bones , respectively . They 'll be in the same place on every piece of a particular cut of meat : a poultry drumstick has an easily-identifiable piece of sinew -- actually the " Achilles ' tendon " -- heading from the fleshy part to the exposed end of the bone . Silverskin is a connective boundary between muscles . It 's a thin , clingy , and annoying sheet , translucent silvery white , that you will find on the surface , and defining the divisions of , various cuts of meat . It might make it through the grinder if your blade is nice and sharp and the piece is n't too big , but it 's best to take it off ( your teeth ca n't deal with it much better than the grinder can ) . You 'll need a thin , sharp , narrow blade for this : a filet/boning knife , sometimes a good paring kife . Essentially , anything that 's not fat or muscle needs to be taken out before the meat goes into the grinder . Chicken thighs have a lot of connective tissue . Some of it is hidden inside the muscle segments on the underside of the thigh ; make sure you cut those open . Depending on the particular piece of meat you have , you may end up with what seem like extremely small bits after this process . Even a nice pork shoulder can result in 1/4 " or thinner pieces after the internal connective tissue is removed . This wo n't have any real effect on the grinding process ; the only thing to watch out for is thorough and even mixing if you end up with many different sizes and are marinating/curing the meat before grinding . You can grind without removing all the tissue ( it gets frustrating sometimes ) , but you 'll have to be prepared to stop the grinder and clean the blade and plate frequently -- the instant you notice that the meat is not coming out of the plate in clean , cohesive , and separate lines . If you see any signs of smearing or over-grinding ( the grind will start to be too fine and become pink as the fat and meat combine ) , stop and clear the blade . Otherwise , the mixture wo n't emulsify properly , the fat will melt out when you cook it , and the sausage will be dry . Does my blade need sharpening already ? It may very well , but this still wo n't help with sinew and ligaments . You should treat your grinder blade the same way you treat your kitchen knives -- maintain its edge , rather than waiting for it to become completely dull . I 'd say that I put my blade onto a sharpening stone every 50 lbs . or so . The nice thing is that it 's extremely easy -- you are grinding all the arms of the blade at the same angle : flat . The plate also needs to be maintained by grinding the surface where it meets the blade ( the edges of the holes should be sharp ) , but I 'd say that this can be done much less freqently . The blade and the plate can both be maintained quite successfully and easily with a piece of fine ( 800 grit ) wet-dry sandpaper slapped on a table .

What varieties of potato would be good for chips / french fries ?
The potato is probably not as important as the method . Simply frying them will not get you the fry you want . Basically you boil them , then double fry them . Here are the steps for <URL> : Ingredients 2 pounds russet potatoes ( about 4 large ) , peeled and cut into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch fries ( keep potatoes stored in a bowl of water ) 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar Kosher salt 2 quarts peanut oil Procedure Place potatoes and vinegar in saucepan and add 2 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt . Bring to a boil over high heat . Boil for 10 minutes . Potatoes should be fully tender , but not falling apart . Drain and spread on paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet . Allow to dry for five minutes . Meanwhile , heat oil in 5-quart Dutch oven or large wok over high heat to 400 ° F. Add 1/3 of fries to oil ( oil temperature should drop to around 360 ° F ) . Cook for 50 seconds , agitating occasionally with wire mesh spider , then remove to second paper-towel lined rimmed baking sheet . Repeat with remaining potatoes ( working in two more batches ) , allowing oil to return to 400 ° F after each addition . Allow potatoes to cool to room temperature , about 30 minutes . Continue with step 3 , or for best results , freeze potatoes at least over night , or up to 2 months . Return oil to 400 ° F over high heat . Fry half of potatoes until crisp and light golden brown , about 3 1/2 minutes , adjusting heat to maintain at around 360 ° F. Drain in a bowl lined with paper towels and season immediately with kosher salt . Cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set on a sheet tray in a 200 ° F oven while second batch is cooked . Serve immediately . Worth reading is also <URL> .

Half and half or heavy cream is a pretty good substitute . It has similar fat/water suspension , reduces and thickens similarly , and emulsifies similarly . You lose the coconut flavor , but it cooks similarly and you keep the texture . You can not substitute coconut cream , because it is too rich , which changes the texture of the sauce greatly , and does n't do as good a job of getting flavors out of spices . Incidentally , I highly suggest you pick up a box of instant coconut milk powder . It 's not as good as the canned stuff ( needs whisking ) , but because it 's nonperishable you do n't have to use the whole container at a time . This helps avoid the " oh crap , used the last can ! " moments you get with canned coconut milk .
Edit : If cooking longer softens the potatoes , then this is n't what 's happening . In that case , well , you just need to cook longer . The main variable is probably temperature ( maybe the pot is n't actually all hot for all 30-45 minutes ) , followed by variations in cut size and in the firmness of the original potatoes . But the rest could apply to some readers too ! I 'm going to take a wild stab at this . It can explain this sort of thing , but it does depend on how you cook your stew . The following is a quote from <URL> ( excellent book ! ) , one of my favorite discoveries from reading through the sections on fruit and vegetables . It turns out that in certain vegetables and fruits - including potatoes , sweet potatoes , beets , carrots , beans , cauliflower , tomatoes , cherries , apples - the usual softening during cooking can be reduced by a low-temperature precooking step . If preheated to 130-140F / 55-60C for 20-30 minutes , these foods develop a persistent firmness that survives prolonged final cooking . ... Firm-able vegetables and fruits have an enzyme in their cell walls that becomes activated at around 50C ( and inactivated above 70C ) , and alters the cell-wall pectins so that they 're more easily cross-linked by calcium ions . At the same time , calcium ions are being released as the cell contents leak through damaged membranes , and they cross-link the pectin so that it will be much more resistant to removal or breakdown at boiling temperatures . So , if you started the stew from cold ( or drastically reduced the temperature by dumping in the sweet potatoes and other things ) and had it on low heat , so that it took a while to come up to temperature , then your sweet potatoes may have been in that 50-70C range where the enzyme is active for a while . So maybe while your length of cooking time is consistent , your time before simmering is n't ; that could depend on how cold the ingredients were before adding , the pot you used , whether you got exactly the same setting on your stove , the temperature in your home , and so on . ( I know you said this is n't it , but having larger chunks of sweet potatoes could conceivably contribute to that too ; the inside would take longer to heat up , so you could end up with a firm interior , and the softer part on the outside could get rubbed off . ) Sweet potatoes do also vary some in firmness , but certainly not by that much . It could still be a factor , though , in combination with the rest ! In any case , if you want to avoid the firm potatoes , I 'd try making sure to get everything heated up quickly .
It 's not that simple . Every culture cuts their beef differently ( or not at all ! ) and therefore has different names for it Around the Belgium , Dutch , French low lands they call what the US call brisket and flank , just flank . And what other parts of France might call brisket is not always cut separately , it is just part of the chuck Confused , we are ... Many butchers in cities receive partially processed carcass parts , so parts like the chest ( brisket ) may have been removed for processed meat etc So you need to take a cutting diagram to a butcher whom displays whole carcasses and you should be able to get what you want As I understand it the brisket extends from in front on the fore legs , between the forelegs and a short way past them ? When we have a beast killed most of that goes into the salamis , yum ! Edit : Some common words used are : Flanchet Plat de côte Poitrine Tendron A popular brisket cut is a long thin ( 10mm ) strip of the full width of the brisket ( left to right ) . A serving is a single slice slowly grilled and topped with a chunky sauce
In this recipe , the nibs are being used as an accent ingredient , adding some crunchiness and a burst of chocolate flavor , as well as some bitterness . They are not essential to chemistry or overall outcome of the recipe . You may : Simply omit them Chopped or coarsely ground roasted coffee would have a similar profile , although not as fatty , and of course , coffee flavored Try another crunchy , possibly somewhat bitter ingredient like chopped nuts ; almonds , hazelnuts , and ( in some people 's opinions , although I dislike them ) walnuts have a particular affinity for chocolate .
Speaking as a Brit - we are a nation of chip lovers :) Use an oil which can cope with the high temperature such as groundnut . For that proper chip experience ( * heart attack alert * ) add some beef dripping or lard . I add a small amount to give the chips a nice flavour . Whilst heating the oil regulary dip a chip in the oil . When it starts to bubble then it 's time to cook . If the oil is too cold the chips will absorb it and they 'll go soggy . ( This is easier to achieve with a traditional chip pan or I prefer a deep saucepan ) . For the perfect chip the potato variety is important but this is personal taste . Last seasons reds will make dark delicious chips but I prefer new potatoes which make a crisper lighter coloured chip . ( The potato variety also affects the colour when cooked ) . Finally , drain on kitchen paper and a sprinkle of salt .
I 've used dark beer with good results . It just depends on what flavor you desire . I often use Lion stout , for example , which imparts a strong , intense flavor and color , which I quite like , but it would not be appropriate for all applications . Also Sierra Nevada porter has happily found its way into my bread . Keep in mind that these beers may be too strongly flavored for your taste , in which case you can add some lighter beer to balance it out ( lager or pilsner ) . Personally I do n't like to add pale ales to bread as I do n't enjoy the way the hop flavor comes through , but this comes down to personal preference . In general , the flavor of the beer will come through in the bread , but you wo n't notice all of the subtleties of flavor that you do when drinking , so I would n't put too expensive a beer in bread -- the bread will turn out fine , but you 're not going to appreciate the beer to its fullest .
Whipped vegetable shortening with powdered sugar . I can make it up a week in advance , probably even longer , and keep it in an airtight container in a cool place . And it has the advantage that it 's pure white ( if you use imitation vanilla extract , or lemon extract ) , so you can get vibrant colors on whatever you 're decorating . If you make too much , you can then make flowers and let them dry out , then store those for a year or more . Here 's the recipe I use , that I got from Jane who taught two of the cake decorating classes I took : Put all ingredients except the water into a mixer . Add 3/4 c. water , and slowly add more to make the consistancy of your choice . Mix on low speed 'til mixed , then on # 6 or 8 for 6 to 7 minutes . Consistency should be " creamy " -- like cream cheese when soft . Stiff icing should be creamy also .
It 's not a " cheat sheet " , and is rather too big to stick to your fridge , but I highly recommend the book <URL> , which is an encyclopedia of exactly these associations . What ingredients does any particular ingredient go with ? How do you cook it ? Absolutely terrific book !
I would probably use diluted white cranberry juice , as being the flavour closest to rice wine vinegar . I am not sure if the acidity would be sufficient , however ; you may need to add lemon juice . A substitute for soy you will not easily find , as the development of those sorts of flavours requires fermentation .
I found a quote from <URL> One thing you may not want to do with a press pot , especially a larger model , is use beans roasted less than 2 or 3 days before . What , am I crazy ? Nope . There 's a problem with ultra fresh beans and it is called " bloom " . When beans are only a day or two off the roast , they contain heaps of Co2 . Heaps of it , I tell you . That Co2 will translate into a massive bloom of brown suds on top of your press pot , possibly overflowing , but also making it easier for big particulate matter ( your ground coffee ) to hop and skip over the top of the filter portion when you first apply it . Bloom looks cool , but can make using a press pot more difficult . The poor filtering part sounds questionable to me , so I googled it and found a few bloom-related comments <URL> . It seems like some people start timing their soak time only after they see bloom . This seems like the real reason to me . I know for sure that the air content in ground substances can vary significantly : one cup of flour can contain double the volume of another if one is loosely sifted and the other is compacted . The above quote is accurate about that in my opinion . Apply this logic to coffee and in order to produce an accurate , general recipe for how long some compounds take to come out of coffee grounds , you need to factor out a variable between coffee grounds : how much air is in the grindings . Maybe the first small pour will saturate with coffee compounds , or drop in temperature quickly , reducing how much it can extract from the grounds . Once it squeezes out all the air , the rest of the water is poured in to do the real extraction work .
I like the first answer , but feel the need to clarify the ' pepperoni ' reference . Yes , they are slices of bagels . However , if you cut a bagel vertically in half as it rests flat and treat each half as if you were slicing a curved salumi , all of your chips will be inconsistently thick on one edge and thin on the other ( thanks to the properties of a torus ) . While that leaves them all consistently round , their thickness varies , which makes evenly toasting them a problem . The more conventional approach : take the whole bagel as it lies flat on the cutting board , and slice it vertically but thinly from one side to the other . There will be much more variation in chip shape , but it 's much easier to maintain the right thickness for even toasting . This is also why most ( if not all ) bags of chips are sliced in this manner , and you see such wild variation of circles , ovals , etc in chip shape . A Gildy 's Blade or a tightly serrated bread knife will do the job . Along with a bit of patience .
It is absolutely worth adding ground pork or veal . I usually use a leaner ground steak and compensate with a fatty ground pork ( shoulder is good ) - fat = flavour . Another tip is to take your time . Many people try and cook bolognese in half an hour , but considering ground meat is usually made with tougher cuts , you end up with tough meat and under-developed flavours . Use plenty of onions and garlic , brown your meat well , use good wine , stock , tomatoes and herbs ( thyme , rosemary and bay ) and gently simmer that bad boy for at least 3 hours . For ultimate flavour , cook it the day before and let the flavours marry overnight .
I am going to get " unsciency " as I used to make fries for hours on end at a local mom and pop shop . How thin / thick does n't really matter , you 'll just have to adjust your frying time accordingly . 1 ) Use a starchy potato 2 ) slice your potato evenly , with a peeler if you do n't have a slicer or mandolin 3 ) soak them in water for 30 mins with a pinch of salt 4 ) let them dry a bit 5 ) blanch them with vegetable oil until they are limpy but has no visible color change ( Oil should be hot enough that when you put them in , 5 seconds later there are bubbles ) 6 ) cool them completely , I throw them into a container into the fridge 7 ) refried them by putting in enough pieces in such that it will still bubble immediately ( oil should be hot enough when you drop a spot of water or chop sticks in that it bubble immediately , but you would n't hear like a crackling or have oil splashing at you ) 8 ) Take them out one piece at a time as they change color . The key is vegetable that 's pretty much the only oil that makes things cripsy at lower frying temperature , other than bacon fat , this makes a much more golden chip , and generally a easier time to control , so you can make more at the same time . Shortening , olive oil , peanut oil , butter , lard has been tested and is n't really good . Sesame oil is good too if you like the taste of it . Also , do n't attempt to drain the oil after blanching , the oil will come out when you re-fry them . Salt or season while warm .
Add cumin , chili powder and garlic powder to your salt and pepper . You might like a bit of curry powder or turmeric too , but I do n't know if you 'd call that a Mexican flavor .
While this is n't a substitute , you can get better deals on saffron and make it go further . First of all , do not buy it at a normal grocery store . It tends to be very expensive there . Instead go to a farmer 's market ( not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church , but rather the big store ) . I 'd imagine most major cities will have one or more . Atlanta has at least 4 . Saffron is much , much cheaper at the farmer 's market . Second , thoroughly grind the saffron before using it . This will help the saffron more completely flavor a dish , requiring a smaller amount of saffron to get the flavor . A quick Google suggested Tumeric , but I ca n't really imagine that working , nor did a lot of the comments on the internets .
A properly formed loaf , before it is baked , has a network of gluten strands stretched tightly around its perimeter . This network is in tension , helping maintain the shape of the loaf . There are several reasons to score the loaf : The tension in the outer network of gluten strands limits the ability of the loaf to expand , especially in the " <URL> " or final excited burst of activity that the yeast go through as the temperature of the dough rises at the beginning of baking . The score creates a slit in the network , allowing the loaf to expand , permitting more oven spring to take place . The scores provide a weak point ( due to the cut in that gluten net ) , controlling where expansion takes place oven spring proceeds . This may prevent cracks that would otherwise be unattractive . Furthermore , the score allows aesthetically pleasing shapes or patterns to created on the loaf , as the the dough exposed during oven spring will have a slightly different texture ( it is n't surrounded by the in-tension gluten network , and will have been baked slightly less as it comes to the surface of the loaf during the oven spring ) . This means it will tend to have a different ( often lighter ) color than the main crust where the in-tension network was in place . For example : ( <URL> ) Another example , taken farther for a more artistic statement : You can see the attractive pattern on the loaf from the scores ( which are also functional in the first sense ) -- the look like a leaf . ( <URL> ) . Scoring is more important and effective in free form loaves which will have good oven spring .
Coffee beans contain gases , which causes coffee to float . Fresh coffee contains more gases compared to an older ( aged ) coffee . coffee tastes best between 4 - 14 days off roast , varies depending on roast profiles Specialty coffee shops usually have a roast date on their retail bags On a coarse grind setting each particle hold more gases compared to a fine grind setting which hold less gases . Hot water causes a faster release of gases compared to cold water which causes a slower release of gasses Darker roasts hold less gases compared to a lighter roast . A lot of agitation increases the rate in which gasses release compared to no agitation . All these can be easily tested , and affect how long the coffee stays afloat . Gasses in the coffee particles must first be displaced in order for the water to enter each particle and extract a delicious cup . All in all , it does n't matter why , as long as the coffee tastes good . Late reply but thought I 'd clarify .
Consider the castiron stuff from Le Creuset ; my father-in-law has one that 's at least 50 years old and it 's still going strong . Lifetime warranty , too . <URL> They have roasting racks to fit as well .

Whats the simplest possible spicy thai curry ?
I think @roux is generally right , curries are like mexican moles , they have lots of spices and are fairly complex . But I do think there are some short-cuts . The most important components in a curry are sweetness , creaminess , heat , citrus , salt , and depth . I do n't know if by simple you also mean you want to use common ingredients , or just ' few ' ingredients . This is what I would use if I only had common ingredients : Coconut milk , cayenne pepper , onion/garlic/ginger , lemon/lime juice , salt/pepper , sugar/honey . I 'd also add basil/cilantro/jalapeno for green , tumeric/cumin for yellow , ketchup/tomato paste/chili powder for red . If you have them , the traditional ingredients you 're trying to replicate are lemongrass , lime-leaf , red or green chiles , and fish sauce ( or soy sauce ) .
There is no reason why you ca n't turn chocolate milk into yogurt . Now , much commercial chocolate milk has carrageenan added as a stabilizer . If you get issues with carrageenan separating out , you can also use Torani chocolate syrup ( intended to flavor coffees ) to add the flavor to normal milk .
I think for Indian recipes you should in general look for an unstrained , set yoghurt . There are other factors that determine the final taste and texture of the yoghurt ( the bacteria , the type of milk , length of fermentation , ... ) but you may not have much choice w.r.t. other factors than these two : Production process : Set yoghurt is yoghurt that 's made the traditional way , it 's fermented in the pot that it 's sold in . Stirred yoghurt on the other hand is fermented before being packaged ; it 's a more industrialized production process which is cheaper , but results in a more sour , thinner yoghurt . Stirred yoghurt has a smooth , pourable consistency ; whereas set yoghurt is firmer . I got a bit confused when I was using stirred yoghurt the first time I tried making <URL> and the recipe told me to whisk the yoghurt till it was smooth . The pretty sour taste of the yoghurt also did n't go well with the spices , and the juice from the cucumbers made the already-thin yoghurt too watery . You could try fixing both problems by straining the yoghurt a bit and adding sugar , but it 's better and easier to just buy set yoghurt . The yoghurt 's packaging might say explicitly what type of yoghurt it is , but if it does n't or you do n't understand the language : avoid yoghurt that comes in " milk carton " - like containers , that most definitely means it 's stirred yoghurt . A plastic pot does n't mean it 's set yoghurt though , but it 's a better bet . Thickness : Strained yoghurt ( like " Greek-style yoghurt " in Europe and the USA ) is yoghurt from which the whey has been removed . It 's pretty thick and sometimes also referred to as " yoghurt cheese . " In India it 's used for example in the dessert <URL> , but if a recipe does n't specify that you should strain the yoghurt , you should assume it 's unstrained or briefly strained . Wikipedia <URL> : " In south Asia , regular unstrained yoghurt ( dahi ) , made from cow or water buffalo milk , is often sold in disposable clay pots . Kept for a couple of hours in its clay pot , some of the water evaporates through the clay 's pores . But true strained yoghurt ( chakka ) is made by draining dahi in a cloth . " Should you really only find strained yoghurt , you can probably just thin it back with water or milk . I should maybe add I do n't have first-hand experience with what yoghurt from India tastes like , but I 've observed that the ethnic shops in my area and one Indian take-away where I could peer into the kitchen all sell/use the exact same brand of yoghurt , which is an unstrained , set yoghurt with a mild ( not too sour ) taste .
I suppose the Belgian " curry ketchup " is similar to the German varieties and no , they are usually not only seasoned with curry powder , but also other spices . There is no standard seasoning mix for curry ketchup , but common additional spices are ginger , black pepper , paprika , cayenne or other chili powders . I also think that some brands contain onions . The brownisher colour of curry ketchup is mostly because of the turmeric in the curry powder , so just adding the powder to regular ketchup will get you a colour match even without the additional spices or ingredients .
In addition to oxidation as put forward by @Stefano , you also have Slow chemical reactions between compounds . Oxidation is only one chemical reaction that happens , there are many more Concentration of flavors due to the evaporation of water will give a more intense flavor
Add cumin , chili powder and garlic powder to your salt and pepper . You might like a bit of curry powder or turmeric too , but I do n't know if you 'd call that a Mexican flavor .
Even if it is possible , it is a very , very bad idea as you do n't know what cultures or pathogens are in the already spoiled milk . Fermented dairy products should only be made from fresh milk in good condition -- and in most cases , that milk should be pasteurized while fresh absolutely as soon as possible from the source cows .
Yes , the problem will be the vinegar . Vinegar is acidic and you 'll end up with mushy meat . 48 hours is almost certainly too long . For a vinegar base , I try not to push it over 8 hours and that 's only if really necessary . A few hours is typically fine . Right now , you 've got to consider how to save the meat . I 'd freeze the meat right now . Freeze the meat with the marinade ( which seems like such a waste for 40 ' ish hours , but better that than mushy steak ) . When ready to cook , take it out and let the marinade do its business as it thaws . I 'd thaw it in ziplock under running water ( quicker than the fridge ) and let it marinade a short time and go on the grill . If you let it sit in any unfrozen stage too long , you 'll get mushy steak with a vinegar marinade .
Yes , you can cook them in about 1 " of oil in a steep sided frying pan or wok . Just turn them reasonably frequently to ensure even cooking . If you 're dubious about using a lot of hot oil , you can use less by making your bhajis a flat , patty shape and shallow frying .
I would say you could use it once , and probably just to make refrigerator-type , quick pickles . The problem is that you have no way to determine acidity or salt levels once you remove the previously pickled items . Of course it should look clean and clear . If you were previously doing a lactic acid fermented pickle , some of the liquid could be used to jump start your next ferment .
You could do it , and it would certianly cause the meat to be cooked . However , I suspect it would lead to a less-than-tasty result . There are two potential issues here that I can see : If you 're steaming , the temperature maxes out at 100 degrees Centigrade . This leads to longer cooking time , and a " washed " look . Think of how the chicken meat looks in chicken soup . You 'll be losing the Maillard reaction , which is what gives that lovely outside texture to anything fried . This is because of the relatively low temperature of steaming , and the lack of liquid ( oil ) to react with .
Allergic reaction to shellfish is typically caused by the protein <URL> . Since it is present in basically all of the muscle tissue of shellfish , extraction is not possible outside of a chemistry lab . Said lab extraction would destroy the food and likely render it inedible . Update Just found this <URL> which indicates that <URL> and <URL> ( SCP ) are also responsible for some allergic reactions .
Nutella is over half sugar by weight ; peanut butter might be more like 5-10 % depending on brand/style . That already sounds like enough that it wo n't make a good one-for-one substitution in most things , especially anything that 's not already pretty sweet . It probably also means that it 'll have a slightly different resulting texture ; nutella is already a bit less thick ( probably again affected by the sugar ) , and I believe this is pretty obvious when heated , though it 's been a while since I tried .
It 's essential to get all the debris ( seeds , large fibrous bits , skins etc ) out of the pulp . I normally add a little hot water in a bowl with the block of pulp , be careful not to add too much or it 'll end up watery - better to add more as you go , wash your hands thoroughly and break the pulp up by hand . Then strain out the seeds etc and it 's ready to use . You can buy ready to use Tamarind puree in shops but it 's normally not a good . There 's more info on working with Tamarind pulp in the footnotes here ( as well as a good Pad Thai recipe ) <URL>
1 - Oil is separated in curries normally after you have cooked spices or sauces for ~ 10-15 mins . You can tell by seeing " bubbles " appearing and the oil by making a thin layer on top of your sauces/curry . 2 - It varies , but normally after 10-15 mins the oil separates from your curry . 3 - Normally after cooking for 10-15 mins most of the water dries up which causes the curry ( mostly made of thick sauces ) to separate from the oil . 4 - It 's always good to let the oil separate from your curry because of two things :
You can just soak beans until they are ready to cook . Depending on the bean , it would have variable soak times ; but many beans left in water will come to a nice toothsome texture of their own accord ( bear in mind they will need to be either sprouted or cooked at the end ) . Assuming you have a watertight container for a serving of beans to store them while they soak ( I like small pyrex containers for portage ) , you could also toss them into the skillet or other cooking utensil to boil them . This way you could carry multiple days supply dry , which would make them light and not prone to spoilage but for the quantity soaking . Frequently , co-ops and health food stores have bulk bins with varieties of dried beans and charts detailing soak times ; you could mix your own medley by bagging a few different ones that all have approximately the same soak time .
Japanese spicy mayo is made with <URL> and <URL> . You really just mix them to taste .
The skin forms because water evaporates from the surface of the dough . The middle does n't dry out because the drier dough skin is less porous , and so the rate of moisture loss slows down as the skin forms . It 's perfectly okay to eat it , it 's just the same dough but drier . Whether it is pleasant to eat is another matter of course . It wo n't become unsafe until it 's been sitting around long enough for moulds and bacteria to grow on it to significant levels and that 's not going to happen in an hour . You can prevent it by preventing the moisture loss from the surface . You 've got some options here . For my bread dough I cover the bowl with cling film , which provides a fairly good moisture seal . Moisture still evaporates from the dough , but reaches equilibrium with the air trapped inside the bowl and so does n't continue to the point where a skin forms . If cling film is likely to touch the dough itself , it 's going to stick to it , so it or the dough need to be oiled to prevent that . You could also cover it with a clean damp towel . The water in the towel helps create a moist environment around the dough surface , thus discouraging drying of the dough and the formation of the skin . This method is also commonly seen in bread recipes .
Even though it is n't really milk ( in the dairy sense ) , coconut milk still naturally separates into a thick cream and thinner liquid like regular milk . As such , when working with coconut milk you should still follow the same procedures you would to make a milk-based cream sauce . The number one rule when making any creamy sauce is : DO N'T LET IT BOIL ! Boiling will guarantee that your creamy sauce ( including sauces made with coconut milk ) will break in some form or fashion . At most , you should cook these at a bare simmer . Other than that , there are some techniques you can use to keep your curry smooth . You could use an emulsifier like honey ( common in vinaigrettes , where it is used to make sure the oil and vinegar do n't separate ) , added toward the end of cooking . You could also use a thickening agent , like a cornstarch slurry or a quick roux . Curry paste is also a thickening agent . As a general rule of thumb , when making Thai-style curry I usually cook my vegetables in a little more oil than I think they need , then add the curry paste and sauté that until it has absorbed the oil ( along with any dry spices ) . It will act as a roux for the coconut milk and make sure there are no lumps in the final curry . Lastly , cooking the curry uncovered at a simmer , stirring occasionally , will thicken it up nicely and help all the ingredients stay together .
I surveyed many recipes available by googling " Loation sticky rice " , " Thai sticky rice " and " Viet sticky rice " . None of them mentioned kneading anything in after 30 or 40 recipes , although many mention fluffing , folding , or stirring the rice after cooking or steaming to manage the texture . Several did mention that it is appropriate for eating with one 's hands . The key may be the variety of rice that is used . Short grained glutinous rice will have the sticky texture desired .

Can I store dry ingredients ( flour , baking powder , baking soda , etc ) together ?
As long as they 're all dry ingredients , then you should be just fine -- after all , that 's exactly what a box of packaged cake mix is . Again , if it 's just dry ingredients , I see no need to refrigerate it . I would put it in an airtight container -- preferably a glass jar * . Placed in your pantry , it should have a shelf-life of a least a couple of months . &#42; Glass jars are my preference for storing dry ingredients -- they 're easy sanitize , and the twist-off cover makes an airtight seal : <URL>
The exact reason depends on the particular ingredient and recipe . Some common ones include : General temperature . By having all of the ingredients at room temperature , the time it takes to bake the overall item ( s ) is easier to predict , leading to better , more consistent outcomes . Egg whites Egg whites form the protein network that creates the foam when whipped more easily at room temperature than they do cold , so will whip up more quickly and with more volume . Butter Butter is often desired slightly cooler than room temperature , for its plastic properties ; it incorporates air for the creaming method best slightly below most room temperatures . Otherwise , it is easier to spread or incorporate when warmer . Cream cheese Easier to mix with sugar or other ingredients at room temperature than when cold .
For baking potatoes Do n't just wash them , scrub them . Otherwise you 're eating dirt . No , that 's not a joke . Potatoes grow in dirt , and are usually sold coated with dirt . Yes , really . Either salt them and wrap them in tin-foil , or simply bake them on a bed of salt . Dessication of the skin is important . You 'll probably want to bake them longer and higher than most recipes say . I find 425F for 1 1/2 hours is optimal ( and 2 hours is fine ) . That results in skin which is dry , crispy , and slightly caramelized , while this inside still is fluffy ( albeit , according to some , overcooked ) .
The spice powder clumps together because it has been exposed to moisture . Carbohydrates or proteins in the spice dissolve a small amount , becoming sticky , causing the granules to stick together . To prevent this , keep your spices quite dry : If you buy in bulk , consider transferring some to a " currently being used " container , and leaving the rest away from the stove with its steam , and any other sources of moisture , well sealed against the humidity ( and oxygen ) in the air . This will protect the bulk of your supply , even if the working container gets a little clumpy . Use good quality , air tight containers for your spices . I like to buy mine from the same vendor I buy spices from , but of course there are a myriad of options . Add a food safe desiccation packet to the container . I use the first method two methods , and have only had clumping in very old working spice jars that probably should have been discarded for having lost their flavor over time anyway . Often , the clumps are quite fragile -- banging the container on the counter a few times will often free up a bit , but it 's a mechanical process . The fork twisting is a good method to free up some for use . As nicoleets hinted at , if your spice is clumpy , it is a sign that it has been exposed to the environment , and water and air have gotten in . It may have also declined in flavor . I wanted to add the " put some rice in the container " method , as one might for sugar or salt , but I can not find any easily accessible evidence if this is a myth or if it really works . After all , why should the rice be more likely to absorb water than the spice itself , when the spice has far more exposed surface area ?
The standard test for eggs is to slowly lower your egg ( s ) in cold water . If it floats , throw it out . The smell test will only identify severely rotten eggs , while the float test will hint at how well the egg will perform as a binder in baking recipes . If it helps , the FDA standard best-by dates are normally 1 week prior to the use-by ( which is the date the food is considered no longer fit to use ) . The standard use-by date for eggs in the US is 28 days after being laid . After 28 days the chances of bacterial growth within the egg are significant enough that they 're not worth using .
Robert Cartaino 's answer hits a main point : sourdough cultures are adapted to what they are typically fed . When switching flours , it may take a while for the culture to adjust . The starter may seem a bit sluggish at first . That said , I would NOT recommend trying to start a wheat culture if you already have a healthy starter that began with rye . There are two main reasons . First , rye is particularly rich in certain sugars and food that natural yeasts tend to like , so rye starters naturally tend to look more " lively " than wheat starters , especially in the early stages of a starter . Part of what you may be seeing in your transition to wheat is simply less activity produced because the food source is less rich in nutrients , not necessarily because the yeast and bacteria ca n't digest it . Second , a lot of recipes to generate new starters recommend using rye at the beginning , regardless of what you ultimately plan to feed the starter . Because it provides a strong food source for young cultures , it 's usually a lot easier to begin with rye ( perhaps this is why you did ) . In my experience , it tends to take new wheat starters at least twice as long to get strongly established compared to rye , and there 's a higher chance of failure if you do n't use a good recipe . For both of these reasons , some people even recommend always feeding your starter with rye flour , even if you tend to make wheat-based bread . Since many people have success doing that ( and I have personally ) , I do n't think you need to begin a whole new culture with wheat alone . If your starter really is sluggish ( and not just a little less active than it was with rye ) , you can help your starter to adapt to the new food . I 'm not sure what your typical feeding routine is or what the hydration level of your starter is . But the general thing to do in these circumstances is to dilute your starter and feed it large quantities of the new food . For example , if you maintain 200 grams of your starter normally , I would discard all but maybe 40-50 grams and then add enough new flour and water to get back to 200 grams in whatever your usual proportion is . ( Some people would be even more extreme in diluting the starter and cut the starter proportion even further . ) Within a few days of feedings like this , you will have strongly selected the yeast and bacteria that thrive on whole wheat and your starter should be strong again . After a week of feedings like this , I doubt you could distinguish the performance of your starter from one that was begun on wheat . ( Note that the specific microorganisms may still be slightly different , but your starter should do a fine job raising dough and providing flavor . )
Harold McGee tackled alkaline noodles a while back . He found that baking baking soda actually changes it from sodium bicarbonate to sodium carbonate . This is a reasonable substitute for the kansui called for in alkaline noodles and can be substituted 1:1 in recipes . The noodles may not get AS yellow as they would with both alkalines present in kansui but it 's a small price to pay for not having to hunt down that ingredient . <URL> The key part : Just spread a layer of soda on a foil-covered baking sheet and bake it at 250 to 300 degrees for an hour . You 'll lose about a third of the soda 's weight in water and carbon dioxide , but you gain a stronger alkali . Keep baked soda in a tightly sealed jar to prevent it from absorbing moisture from the air . And avoid touching or spilling it . It 's not lye , but it 's strong enough to irritate .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
Enzymes which degrade proteins , called proteases , are found in many fruits . There is no simple test for it other than holding some in your mouth and seeing if it " eats " your flesh away after a few minutes Commercial test are not practical or portable as they require maceration , heating , centrifuging and using florescent dye markers . Or just make some in gelatine and see what happens :-) A quick list would be : Fig - Ficin Ginger - zingipain Kiwi fruit - Actinidin Papaya ( Pawpaw ) - Papain Pineapple - Bromelain Also to a lesser extent Banana Guava Mango It is in many other fruits , but at levels where they will not be a problem , of course at different levels depending on the specific fruit variety etc. .
You need to <URL> . Be aware that your flavors will be affected . Make sure it 's double-acting baking powder and you must replace the acidic liquid in recipe with non-acidic liquid . You could also use some heartburn medicine that contained potassium bicarbonate :-)
The author of this recipe probably happens to keep in his pantry ( or more professionally speaking , dry store ) just those two types of flour , and so has specified a mix to get a mid-level flour with moderate protein levels , tailored to his preferences . Given that the author is Jacques Torres , this is almost certainly a scaled down translation of a professional recipe , where that is not an uncommon practice ( the very odd measurements support the idea of scaling and rounding ; the weird flour measurements are probably the closest volume equivalent to a weight based scaled recipe ) . Two commercial varieties ( all purpose , and the less common pastry flour ) also have protein levels in between cake flour and bread flour , with pastry flour being somewhere between cake flour and all purpose , typically . If you happen to have all purpose ( and you almost certainly do ) I would suggest using it in the recipe for the total of both specialty flours . Very few cookie recipes are so fussy that it will actually matter very much .
You want to use baking soda . Baking powder is used as a leavening agent and does this by combining an acid and a base , so it would not make your chicken more alkaline . Baking soda , on the other hand is just sodium bicarbonate and will make your chicken more alkaline . However , baking soda , especially if used in excessive amounts , will give your chicken a bad taste . Baking soda tastes bitter , and cooking it for too long at high heat exacerbates that . From reading online , it seems that adding baking soda will indeed make your chicken look much browner ( the same way that pretzels are dipped in lye to produce their brown colour ) , but it would affect the texture/taste of your chicken . If you want to add more flavour , I would think that properly browning the chicken ( using high heat , having patience ) would be more effective than adding baking soda , which might give the appearance , but not the taste .
With kale crisps you are ideally trying to dehydrate instead of baking . This saves the chlorphyll from degradation . Depending on your green/veg chlorophyll starts to degrade between 100F-185F ( 40C-85C ) . Now , 220F-240F ( 100C-120C ) is as low as most domestic ovens go . However , if you are able to use a lower temprature , that would give you a greener result and a cleaner flavour . But it will take longer to crisp as you lower the temprature . Using a dehydrator would be ideal , running at around 140F ( 60C ) . Think of dryed fruit , herbs or even tomatoes , they are almost never baked , but rather dehydrated . You 'll also find that commercial kale crisps use a very low temprature and they are promoted by it as it keeps nutrients intact and preserves chlorophyll . A tip if you have to use your oven , keep checking and take them out before they crisp up completely . As they cool , the residual heat will dehydrate them a touch more .
Your clarification means a lot -- " baked " potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own , where the insides become fluffy and creamy , and is done with larger starchy white potatoes , or sweet potatoes work well , too . Roasted potatoes , on the other hand , tends to be ( in the U.S. ) be smaller " new " potatoes , waxy potatoes , or even larger starchy potatoes cut up ( eg , ' oven fries ' ) . The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it 's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you 're going to be cooking them with the roast as there 's going to be moisture in there , I 'd go for a waxy potato ( eg , Red Bliss ) . As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil , and if they 're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast , as you 're going to have to rest it anyway , drain the meat juices , crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F ( 230C ) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes . ps . yes , I know a sweet potato is n't a potato . And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything , as it makes great baked potatoes , and roasted potatoes ( although , not sure how well with a roast at the same time ) and they 're good in pot roast and stews if you do n't add them too early .
The short answer to your question is YES . The extra acid in the ingredients will hamper the second act of the double acting baking powder . The acids are timed/staged for reaction not the baking soda . The Magic Baking Powder ( happens to be in our kitchen , too ) is mostly a single acting formula since monocalcium-phosphate is a low temperature acid ( with apparently some double acting properties due to generation intermediate step of dicalcium phosphate ; per your link ) . High temperature acid for second acts typically include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminum phosphate and sodium acid pyrophosphate . You can try to counteract that by adding a bit of baking soda , but you run the risk of altering the taste and not having it all neuralized . If you really want to get pedantic , use a pH meter to measure the acidity of your dough . I suspect tasting the dough might give an indication as well . ( bitter alkaline , sour acidic ) Another test might be to mix your acidic ingredients in a bowl with some water and start adding measured baking soda until you see no more reaction ( bubbles ) and use that as a your basic of neutralizing your dough . All said and done , I agree with SAJ14SAJ that you 'll be just fine going with the existing recipe . There should be enough baking soda left to get something out of your double act . I also heard it from a world-class baker that most recipes can be done with only baking soda , let alone baking powder or double acting ones .
It depends on what you mean by gluten-free flour . If you are buying a gluten-free flour mix that it labeled for all-purpose use then you should be able to substitute that and get a reasonably good result . Substituting straight rice or almond flour in a standard recipe will not work well , because the mixes have a blend of ingredients designed to make it perform similar to flour . It may take some recipe/flour experimentation to get it as close to what you are used to , but will definetly make something edible . There are also various almond-flour based pancake recipes which work well .
It will definitely make a difference . Yolks contain various things like fats and emulsifiers that affect the flavor and texture of baked goods . If you want more details , then tell us what you 're baking .
From what I can tell it seems like you are asking whether a baking soda solution is a good solution for cleaning fruits and vegetables . The answer to that would be not really , you 're wasting good baking soda . <URL> shows that even purpose made commercial vegetable cleaners were no better than plain water for cleaning vegetables , it 's the soaking time and technique used that makes the difference . The only chemical tested that seems to make and difference is <URL> , which demonstrably reduced contamination on the outside of melons . However , you do n't eat melon rinds , I would n't wash vegetables or fruit that I was going to eat in a chlorine solution because chlorine is unpleasant stuff and will probably ruin your flavors . So washing your vegetables in baking soda , vinegar , or baking soda and vinegar is no better than washing them in plain old tap-water . It 's better for your flavors that you do not as well . The only use I know of for baking soda in the preparation and cooking of green vegetables is that adding a bit when boiling green vegetables helps preserve their vibrant green flavor by neutralizing the acids that break down the chlorophyll . The trouble is it also turns them to mush , so I never use that method .
You should n't have any problem . Bacteria need sufficient water to survive , a few drops wetting the sugar are not sufficient for them . As far as I 'm aware , even old-style jam ( 1 part fruit to 1 part sugar , boil some of the water out ) is shelf-stable . Even if you are close to the limit , it 's still not too concerning . The good news is that , when you preserve something with sugar , and get a bit too low on the sugar , it 's not bacteria that colonizes it first , it 's mold . The mold can be toxic on its own - but it 's nicely visible . So , as long as you do n't have a sticky mass and see mold growing on it , the sugar should be safe . It can be hard to work with though - we have an old question on getting lumped-together brown sugar out of the container , if you need it .
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .

Garlic + Oil , Why is this recipe safe ?
REDACTED . Botulism growth is inhibited at pH of 4.6 or lower . The pH of this recipe is lower than 4.6 because of the vinegars . <URL> After re-reading the recipe , I think the OP is right . This is not the safest recipe out there . For a great pickling recipe that is safe , try this : <URL>
Yes . The more finely you process your garlic , the more of the flavour-bearing liquid is released from ruptured cells .
Unless your hot water tank is very close to your hot water tap , this is a very energy inefficient . As Jefromi notes it would be faster to boil water in a electric kettle first , and then pour it into the pan . Put the pan on the heat at the same time if you are really in a hurry Hot water systems are normally hot enough ( above 55 ° C , 130 ° F ) to keep water borne nasties at bay , plus if you are on town supply water it will be chlorinated etc Normally on the first few meters of hot water pipe are copper , then it switched to normal crimped plastic plumbing . This will vary depending on your local building codes The rate at which pipes lose their heat would ensure it never sits in the danger area for long , not that I think this is a big issue for clean plain water In general , modern copper pipes are not soldered , they are crimped using special hand tools Old or non-renovated houses may still be 100 % copper pipes that have been soldered . This poses no extra safety risks with just clean water in the pipes
I 'm not sure if its dangerous , but if you are worried about the can you can get various tools , designed to cook a chicken like this .
Keep in mind that tap water is tested to ensure it 's safe for human consumption . Rainwater has no such requirement . While rainwater seems to be a happy-fuzzy natural resource , I 'd like to stress that this could be a serious safety issue . Yes , it seems unlikely , but you need an authority who knows their water . I suggest seeking out a professional opinion on how to properly filter rainwater . Possibly from the people who handle your municipal water supply .
The smoke produced from a heated oil is n't all too different from the smoke produced by a fire . You are essentially burning that oil and causing rapid , incomplete oxidation ( or rather <URL> ) . In actual fact , the peroxidation will start to occur long before you hit the smoke point ; however , smoking is an indicator that this is happening very rapidly . The net effect is very similar to that of rancidity , in that it will produce many <URL> and <URL> , and while this is n't the place to be debating whether or not that 's bad for you , I will simply point to the aforementioned link on free radicals and say that at the present time , the prevailing belief is that these free radicals have deleterious effects . It 's up to you decide what level of risk is acceptable to you . The effect may in fact be identical to that of rancidity , although I ca n't confirm that with a source at this time ; all I know is that heating an oil up to its smoke point will increase the oxidation rate ( make it go rancid faster ) , and rancidity in turn lowers the smoke point , so the two are definitely related . So what I 'd say is , if you do n't mind the idea of occasionally eating rancid fat , then go ahead and smoke it all you want ; otherwise , you might want to be more careful . <URL> , even if the actual ingestion is n't . So again , be careful . Avoid overheating oil if you can . By the way , saturated fats like coconut oil , animal fat or ( clarified ! ) butter tend to have the most immunity to this particular chemical breakdown , as evidenced by their naturally higher ( unrefined ) smoke points . Lipid peroxidation works on the double bonds , which do n't exist in saturated fats ( polyunsaturated fats have the most ) .
100 % keep going . Make sure you got cloth with something heavy on top of it to press the cabage . I do cloth , flat plate and a heavy jar filled with water to keep squeezing it down . Cloth has to be tuggen in not to let any outside matters in and liquid has to be above the cloth for about an inch or so . What ever floats above , remove together with the cloth , wipe the rims of pan , rinse the cloth in boiling water to kill unwanted bacteria and replace . You will be good . I start chewing on it in about to weeks or so ( when I wash the cloth I take some to use ) and it tastes great . Not fully fermented but still great to eat ( mind you , I make at least 20 liters per batch ... ) You will have great cabbage as long as it is submerged , salted enough and weigh down .
A <URL> perhaps ? I 've no luck finding the term for your specific description , but that seems to be an umbrella term for utensils that basically hold something so you can more easily grill it .
Oil is dry heat because oil contains no water . Wine does . The " moist " in moist heat really means water . In moist heat cooking , water acts as a solvent and actually dissolves much of the solid matter in the food - hence the reason why steaming and boiling tend to make food rather soft or even soggy . Oil , on the other hand , is very rarely a solvent . There are certain food compounds that are fat-soluble , but most are water-soluble and oil , being <URL> , actually blocks any contact with water , thus preventing any dissolution , and generally making the food crispier as well as promoting the <URL> ( which can only occur with dry heat , due to the low boiling point of water ) . It may seem counterintuitive , but oil is n't wet . It just looks that way .
Parsley is both a flavoring herb and a decorative element for plating the finished dish . By adding it during the cooking , it imparts flavor to the shrimp . By adding it to the finished dish , it provides color and flavor . The cooked parsley will have a slightly different taste to it than the fresh parsley . This is how cooks layer the flavors in a dish . TB stands for Tablespoon .

Pasteurized milk is the standard way milk is sold in industrialized countries . How it 's packaged can depend on the country but it 's perfectly safe to drink provided it 's consumed by the " use by " date . <URL> : Pasteurization ( American English ) or pasteurisation ( British English ) is a process invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century . In 1864 Pasteur discovered that heating beer and wine just enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage prevented these beverages from turning sour . This was achieved by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage . Today the process of pasteurization is used widely in the dairy and food industries for microbial control and preservation of the food we consume . Pasteurization is the reason for milk 's extended shelf life . High-temperature , short-time ( HTST ) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks , whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer , sometimes two to three months . When ultra-heat treatment ( UHT ) is combined with sterile handling and container technology ( such as aseptic packaging ) , it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months . This means that most of the microbes in the milk are killed and the milk is perfectly safe to drink right out of the carton . In fact , there are many jokes in the US about chastising teenage boys and young men about drinking directly from the carton/jug of milk . Milk in the US is regularly consumed direct from the gallon jug , see the note under Vitamin D that says " Pasteurized &amp; Homogenized " : Milk in Europe is often in <URL> cartons which do n't have to be stored in the fridge until opened and generally have a longer shelf life due to the UHT handling ( see definition above ) :
Oil and butter do n't have the same capacity to hold the sugar/sweetener used in the mix . Whatever is n't dissolved fully in the shortening will still be bound up in the final product ( or maybe end up mostly in the outer crust ) , and you 'll likely perceive the difference as more/less sweet . The main cause is that butter has quite a lot of water bound up in it , which you would n't find at all in oil . You might get a closer similarity by comparing melted , evaporated butter to oil ( 1-to-1 proportion ) , since solid &amp; melted butter have different volumes depending on how much water you 've evaporated ( 1 cup solid / = 1 cup melted ) . I 've got an answer in another question that applies more generally to different phases of shortenings and perceived/actual sweetness - <URL>
I feel the same as you Anderson . I found that too and you just made me to do some research , which I found they have different smoke points . Unrefined sunflower oil 225 ° F 107 ° C Unrefined peanut oil 320 ° F 160 ° C see the link : <URL> Also , one of the reasons food stick to the pan is the evenness of the temperature of the pan . If you use a thicker pan or copper pan , the heat will be distributed on the pan more evenly and food will stick less . The higher smoke point of oil makes me to believe the oil helps to distribute heat more evenly .
I 'd say about 1 clove for every half-teaspoon of garlic powder . There is n't going to be anything particularly scientific about this , since garlic cloves vary in size , strength and flavor but that will be in the ballpark .
I 've never made seitan , but just like when making bread , gluten needs water to activate . I do n't know the precise amount . Oil , if anything , has the opposite effect , coating the gluten molecules and keeping them from linking up , which is why we use fat in pastries to keep them from getting tough .
Black garlic is not a substitute for regular garlic , you add black garlic to get a different result . I would never say use 2 cloves of black garlic for every 1 regular or any other ratio because the changes are so fundamental that they really are totally different ingredients . The question is how much black garlic flavor you want , and only you can answer that . I 'd suggest that you taste it when it 's close to being done and if you want more add more then .
Again assuming you 're using the same recipe ... I do n't think you need to leap to different kinds of flours as in <URL> . You could be using the same type ( probably all-purpose ) and even the same brand , but purchased and stored somewhere else ; it 'll end up with a different moisture content , and perhaps fluffed differently , so your volume measurements might not actually end up getting you the same amount of flour . If you 're trying to follow her recipe exactly , there 's really no harm in simply reducing the flour a bit to get the texture you remember .
Yes , that is how browned butter or beurre de noisette ( as it is called in French ) is made . Of course , normally , you would not let it scorch to black . You want a rich hazelnut color as indicated by the French term .
There are three good reasons to oil your pan beforehand : Your pan needs to be ready as soon as your batter is . For cakes , the batter can fall apart while you are greasing the pan . This is especially true for cakes that have air whipped in , such as genoise , which can fall apart in a few minutes . Recipes containing baking soda can lose their fizz in this time too . You ca n't forget to oil up the pan . In the heat of the moment , it 's very easy to forget to apply lubrication before transferring the batter/dough ; inevitably this wrecks the recipe . Greasing the pan is part of baking mise en place and should be done before main cooking . Mise en place is a key principle of professional cooking , and means " everything in place . " The idea is that ingredients should be prepped and ovens preheated , so you can do the actual cooking efficiently .

What is 00 flour and when should I use ?
00 is extra-fine flour , the most refined grade . <URL> a useful page for more about the old flour grading system . Other than pasta I use it for thickening sauces , and I sometimes make pizza dough with it , although I ca n't tell the difference between using 00 and good quality bread flour . I 'd use 00 for Gnocci certainly as the chefs do , but most home cooks just use plain flour and seem to get good results . Basically , if you have it or can get it use it , if not plain flour is fine .
Broiling involves high heat coming from a source very close to the surface of the food . It is appropriate for thin food , or for adding color ( via caramelization/Maillard reaction ) to already ( or mostly ) cooked items . I could n't say what the temperature of the heating element itself is , but the resulting air temperature is usually upwards of 550 ˚ F ( 288 ˚ C ) . In baking , although the heating element is usually on one side or the other of the oven , * the idea is that heat is being transferred to the food more or less evenly from all sides . This is part of the reason thorough pre-heating is important -- to make the air in the box all the same temperature before the food goes in . There 's no real " default temperature " -- you use whatever will produce the desired results in your food . With lower heat , coming from all sides , baking will allow the interior of a thick piece of food to cook before the exterior has over-cooked . Putting cake batter under a broiler will likely result in a dried-out or burnt top , perhaps a layer of reasonably well-cooked cake , and a raw bottom . The heat simply wo n't transfer through the cake fast enough to allow the entire thing to cook . The appropriate technique for meat depends on the size of the meat . Steaks can do very well under a broiler -- the intense heat allows the exterior to brown and become flavorful without the interior over-cooking . A roast cut or a whole bird , on the other hand , would need to be baked ( or " roasted " ) so that the interior has time to come to the proper temperature . A very thick chop or steak might be started in the oven , then finished under the broiler to give it color . * Your oven probably has just the one heating element , used for both baking and broiling . There 's no reason that an oven could n't have multiple elements for baking -- and it might produce more even cooking -- but broiling always means heat from above .
The flavor is described as being very mild and unless the recipe calls for a ton of the stuff it is probably being used mostly for color . The color it gives is a yellow-orange . Substitutions used are turmeric , paprika , or a mixture of the two . It was often used itself as a substitution for saffron but of course saffron would be too expensive to make the substitution back . If your recipe does use a lot of annatto ( or you are serving it to people who claim to be able to detect the difference ) then your best bet would probably be to just buy it online . It is a seed so it is n't fragile and ships well . <URL>
This is the last write-up on the topic , and it 's much simpler : For hand-pulled noodles , you need : Bread flour ( wet gluten 29-30 % , protein 11 % -12 % ) 45 % added water 1 % alkaline solution kansui powder or ( Lye Water + Baking powder ) or Peng or Baking Soda Ingredients ( Alkaline solutions ) kansui powder 55 % sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) , 35 % potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) , 10 % sodium biphosphate dodecahydrate ( NaHPO3 .12 H2O ) Lye Water potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) 74.5 % in 100ml sodium biphosphate ( NaHPO3 ) 3.4 % in 100ml Instant ash Peng sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) 90 % Sodium chloride ( NaCl ) 1.15 % It is recommended to use bread flour because of its higher wet gluten content compared to normal white flour . You will also need a small amount of alkali . One recommendation is to use kansui powder , due to its ph of 11 . If kansui is n't available , the next option would be baking powder and lye water . If either is n't available , the next option would be to use sodium carbonate 1 % of total weight flour weight ( e.g. if you use 100g of flour , use 1g of sodium carbonate ) . If you 're using a lower gluten dough like all-purpose flour , then baking powder will do just fine . If you 're using cake flour , use baking soda . ( Remember to add the kansui/baking soda/baking powder/sodium carbonate to the flour and mix it in before adding water . ) Sodium carbonate vs. potassium carbonate : I 've have n't had success with bread flour , plain flour or all-purpose flour with potassium carbonate . Even though it increases the ph of the dough , it still does not give the dough its stretchability . Why use alkaline solution in the first place ?! Alkaline solution will increase the water absorption and gluten creation of the dough to enable it to be pulled sooner than normal by leaving the dough to rest at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes . The downside of the alkaline solution is that it also breaks down gluten after the peak absorption is achieved . So on one side you have faster absorption but on the other side the dough will become more resilient to pulling if left too long . For a non-alkaline solution , use <URL> . It will cover all the basics that you will need to learn , and you WILL need to use all-purpose flour or plain flour . Noodle flour works best . In conclusion : Without sodium carbonate it 's possible to have hand-pulled noodles with any flour . The downside is you will have to knead the dough for 45 minutes and leave to rest for 2 hours until you can start pulling your noodle strands . Without sodium carbonate the noodles are harder to pull and I had most success with cutting each strand and going from there from the video .
Salt is added at the beginning , because it takes long time to dissolve . Also , it 's maybe less important for bolognese , but you want your veggies to get infused with salty water , the taste is different from bland vegetables swimming in water salted late . Last but not least , salt 's chemical properties are important for the cooking of some dishes . The stuff which depends on volatile aroma molecules ( practically all fresh herbs ) is added at the end , after the sauce ( or stew ) is removed from the heat , because lots of the compounds are destroyed by heat , and while the flavour is still discernible , it is diminished . On the other hand , if you are using dried herbs , their most fragile molecules have long since disappeared in the air . The flavours which remain in the dried leaves are sturdier and not easily loosened from the plant matter . So by adding dried herbs early enough to allow for some simmering , you can leach more of these out of the leaf ( you are practically steeping it in the sauce ) . But if you cook them for too long , even these molecules can get damaged . Plus , there were some herbs which release unpleasantly bitter alkaloids after too long a steeping ( I do n't remember if your three are among those , but I would suspect the basil may be , as it is prone to producing off-tastes ) . So add them ~ 5 minutes before turning the heat off . Spices are a bit of a boundary case . Although dried spices do n't taste the same as fresh ones , grinding them still releases volatile molecules . So I tend to add them at the end , like fresh herbs , and I 'll advise you to do so too ( using peppercorns in a grinder ) . If I use spices which were bought pre-powdered , I throw them in earlier or together with the dried herbs .
For steaks I really prefer cooking butter instead of oils , I find that the flavor fits the meat better .
Since you ask about other tools , I recommend avoiding the mixer altogether and instead grate frozen butter into the flour . If you have a food processor you can use the coarsest grating blade -- chilling the bowl and grater first will help keep the butter cold will help -- but it goes quickly by hand with a coarse grater . The key is to get the butter distributed quickly and keep the butter and dough cool while working the dough as little as possible . If you do use the mixer , chilling the bowl and paddle helps . And , regardless of method using ice water and very cold liquids helps .
Of the recipes you link to only one contains paprika , another one lists " Chinese chili paste , chili oil , hot sauce or dried red chili flakes to taste " . The one that specifies paprika does n't mention a specific type of paprika . Without further distinction , that generally means the sweet , non-smoked variety . Sweet paprika is just dried , powdered pimento , the type of pepper seen most often ( here in the US anyway ) stuffing cocktail olives . It 's not hot at all . Hot paprika usually gets its heat by mixing in another , hotter , pepper . Even those paprikas are not generally overwhelmingly hot . Paprika of any type ( hot , sweet or smoked ) from any country ( Hungary is known for it , as is Spain ) is going to bring you closer to a flavor profile more reminiscent of borscht 's Eastern European roots . You may want that , but I would n't count on paprika to to provide the kind of heat you 're talking about . For Chinese hot and sour soup the best sources of heat are white pepper and chili oil . Nothing else tastes " right " in my opinion . With that in mind I lean toward those ingredients for your borscht as well . You can buy chili oil in any big grocery store , but Asian markets will have a greater variety at probably a much lower price . You can also <URL> . So I 'd recommend starting there . White pepper , chili oil and paprika . Make a batch of soup with none of the above and add each spicy ingredient to samples of soup until you hit the combo you like . For best results , once you got the ratio of spicy ingredients figured out , scoop out a bit of your broth and simmer the spices for a good 30 minutes or so ( the pepper and paprika especially , it does n't matter so much with the oil ) , and add the simmered spices into your cooked soup . They 're just better cooked a while . Next time you make the soup you can add the spices in the beginning , since at that point you 'll know what you like .
Do n't take anything that costs much : You may have it taken away from you by border controls . In some parts of the world being able to confiscate nice things is a perk of the job . You want to enter ( or leave ) the country , you part with the knife . It could also be illegal to bring in knives over a certain size Hostels are famous for being rife with theft . Having some nice folding knife just begs for someone to take it Traveling is hard on equipment It does n't really matter anyway : who cares about the knife , anything will do . Ingredients and technique are what matters If I were you I 'd get a cheap , short cooking knife from some hardware store . Also make sure it looks like a cooking knife , you do n't want anything that could be mistaken for a weapon ! If you lose it , or it gets stolen , or broken , or you give it to someone who needs it more than you do then you just buy another cheap knife at a market somewhere . If you have an expensive piece of equipment it 's just another worry .
Compound butter is a very nice accompaniment for fish . " Compound butter is a mixture of softened butter and at least one other ingredient . Some ideas for compound butter are : herbs , spices , citrus zest/juice , honey , fresh mint , soft cheeses ( like goat ) , fresh or dried peppers , and nuts ... you get the idea -- this list could be endless ! " You can cook the fish on its own and then put the compound butter on top to melt over it . While soft the butter can be put into a piping bag and piped as rosettes and refrigerated until ready to use . Makes for a nice presentation . Another common accompaniment to fish is mango salso or a combination of tropical fruits ( mango pineapple for example ) . This seemed like a good link for ideas for sauces for Haddock : <URL>
There are a few consideratons that I can think of : How durable the device is . Generally , this is going to mean that you want something metal &amp; heavy , but I 'd really look at reviews of any model that you plan to buy online , particularly from something like Amazon which lets you see those 1 star ratings , and you can see why people rated them so poorly . How it clamps down to the work surface . I do n't care how heavy it is , if it 's a hand-crank , it 's going to walk all over the place unless it 's well secured to your counter . If you do n't have a counter that 's got a lip that you can clamp to , and you do n't have a table that you 're willing to possibly mar from the clamps , you might have to look for something else ( or bolt/screw it down to a large board ) Size ( width ) of the feed . There are some that are larger , which might be useful for making some pastries as well as pasta . ( and then there 's dough sheeters , which are huge and expensive , but are 18 " or wider , typically ) . How many different thickneses the dial has , and what the min/max thickness is . Again , a thicker one can be used for other pastry applications , but it also makes it easier to work the ball through that first time . ( I 've only ever used one where the thickest size was a pain ... so it 's not a common problem . All I remember was it was a friend 's , and it was n't an Italian company ) Hand crank vs. motorized -- almost every hand crank roller can be converted ( as the handle detaches for storage , so the motor just connects there ) , but the difference in cost is significant . ( ~ $ 50 vs. ~ $ 150 . If you already have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer , they sell an roller kit , but it 's in that $ 150 range . ) Even if you got a motorized roller , I 'd look to make sure that the motor detaches and it had a hand crank ... as it lets you keep working should the motor go into thermal shutdown , but it also means typically means that the company sells the roller and motor individually should one part die down the road . ( you should try to verify that , though ) Accessories -- so , other than an add-on motor , the two main accessories you 'll see are cutters ( fettucini and something thinner are typical ) , and ravioli stuffers . Personally , I 'd say the raviolli stuffers are n't worth it . If you want consistently sized ones , get one of those little forms that you run a rolling pin over to cut , as the cleaning of the attachment ones means it 's not worth it unless you 're making a huge batch . ( which you can do , then freeze 'em , but I never have ) . I think the cutters are worth it ( and are typically included in even the $ 40-60 models ) if you 're going to make fettucini . For the thinner strand pastas , I actually prefer extrusion over rolling . ( although , I think capellini/angel hair may need to be rolled vs. extruded , but I 'm not a fan of that size of pasta ) . For wider noodles , it 's generally not a big deal to hand-cut 'em . As for the question on price ... not really . There are a few major price bands for the good motorized vs. non-motorized , and most stores keep 'em in those ranges . The really cheap ones are going to break , or jam , as they just have a lower build quality . If you see something much over $ 150 , I 'd question it . Unless it had an exceptionally wide roller ( and that was a feature you wanted ) , I ca n't think of a reason to shell out that much . I 'd try to stick with a model that I could find well reviewed ( with at least a dozen people having reviewed it if it 's purchaser-submitted vs. something like Consumer Reports or America 's Test Kitchen ) , and preferably , a model that 's been on the market for years , as there 's very little innovation -- a brand new model was likely made to trim costs , or because it 's something the company never made before ( and thus , untested ) .
Yes , you can save it and add it to soups such as Minestrone for additional flavor . Once the soup is done , remove and discard the rind . For extended storage , keep it in a bag in the freezer until you have need for it .
I wo n't offer any suggestions on what type of herbs you should use in your recipes - that is entirely up to you and what you like . Experiment with different flavors and combinations from a basic base , or there are plenty of recipes freely available on the <URL> for savory breads . The technical answer is , generally dried herbs are preferable when baking because they contribute no moisture to the recipe , and because they generally have lots of time to infuse their flavor into the dough . Fresh herbs are nice ( and it sounds like you have plenty of them available ) but you need to <URL> : Dried herbs have a more concentrated flavor , so you will need to need to use a larger quantity of fresh herbs when substituting them for dried in recipes . The most common rule of thumb seems to be about 3 times the amount of fresh herbs for dried , maybe a bit lower if you 've got really nice and fresh herbs with intense flavor . Certain leafy herbs ( basil , mint ) will retain and contribute some moisture . It 's doubtful that you 'll be using enough in any recipe to throw off its water balance , but beware of using large amounts . if you want a strong flavor for these herbs it 's best to use dried . Also , these items can get really bitter when bruised or otherwise mistreated , and that bitterness will wind up in your bread . Not so tasty . Particular herb flavors will stand up very well to baking , and others will not . I find that some savory flavors like thyme and oregano mellow out when baked but still retain their character . Rosemary will work well in baked goods but has a very intense flavor , so you 'll want to use a bit less than other herbs . Other delicate flavors like mint do n't do well when baked , both because of the bruising problem noted above and because they 're so delicate . Also note that it 's pretty easy , if a little time-intensive , to <URL> , which is a great idea for extended storage .
I 've been making rum-based vanilla extract successfully at home for years . Here are my recommendations . Your basic ingredients are 80 proof rum , sugar and vanilla beans . At the recommended proportions , the rum and sugar are plenty effective preservatives . You can use either light or dark rum , but it should be a good " call " 80 proof rum and not a bargain bottom shelf rum . I most often use Ron Rico . If you use a golden rum , your extract will have a warmer taste suitable for spicy treats such as pumpkin pie or spice cookies . If you use a silver rum , your vanilla will have a purer taste suitable for whipped cream or custard sauces . I get rum that is bottled in glass , because I think plastic imparts an off flavor . Your basic recipe will use a fifth less about a 1/2 cup of rum , four vanilla beans and 1/2 cup of organic sugar . We 'll go through that first , and then talk about variations . Place your vanilla beans on a clean , flat cutting surface . Using a small , sharp knife , cut them first in 1/2 crosswise at the middle . Then take each 1/2 bean and insert the knife tip just 1/2 to an inch below the uncut end and carefully slice lengthwise to the send . Repeat this process gently and carefully on each piece unti each piece has four lengthwise quarters attached at the uncut end . Some recipes will tell you to scrape some or all of the paste out of the beans , but this is not necessary . The simply split beans will infuse the rum just fine . Pour out about a cup of rum from your fifth and set aside . Put your sliced vanilla beans into the rum . Use a funnel to add 1/2 cup of organic sugar . Use the reserved rum you set aside to top the bottle back up . Recap the bottle and give it about 20 shakes to encourage the sugar to dissolve . Set aside in a dark cabinet or pantry . Take it out and give it a few shakes every week or so . Your vanilla will be usable but not fully extracted in about two months . It will continue to strengthen in flavor out to about 6 months of age . Once you are satisfied with your extract , you can decant some and bottle it up in smaller bottles . It 's a very popular gift for bakers . Once you have tried vanilla extract made this way , you will never want to go back to store-bought . The difference is indescribable . You can vary the type of rum you use , silver or gold , and you can vary the sugar . I mostly stick with light organic sugar , because I think the taste is better . I like the combination of dark rum and brown organic sugar very well . You can also increase the sugar up to about 2/3 cup in a fifth bottle , but I would n't go above that . Sugar gives the extract more body and mellows the flavor . Check out Wikipedia to learn more about the various kinds of vanilla beans available . I use the organic ones from my food coop , but different kinds can be ordered online or found at specialty food stores . A number of cooking blogs have instructions on making extracts or tinctures of other spices . There is no reason not to create combination flavors .
Cutting bacon into cubes was a regular prep task for me when I was cooking professionally , so I got very fast at it . Here are the tricks I found : Fully cooked ( baked ) bacon cuts MUCH faster and cleaner , and you can make perfect cubes Do n't use a serrated knife . It 'll be easier to cut with , but it will shred and fray the bacon as you slice , eventually making a mess . Use the sharpest knife you have , especially for uncooked bacon . There 's already a tendency for it to slip and slide around , and a sharp knife cuts with less back-and-forth motion . You want a deep-bellied knife such as a santoku or Chinese cleaver , because you can slice through multiple stacks of bacon at once . Stack slices of bacon so you can cut multiple pieces at once . Try to work with 4 " by 4 " blocks of bacon , so the pieces are n't big enough to slip around as much . With this size you 're still able to do a lot at once , but it 's fast Organize your cutting board . Pick one corner for whole chunks of bacon , then cut into strips and move to another spot , then finally into cubes which goes in another spot . Now if I were a culinary school , you 'd have paid a few hundred bucks to learn what I just told you .
I have to admit that I have n't tried a lot of free-form jerky experiments so take what I say with a grain of salt . ( see what I did there ? ) Jerky is a double action meat preservation method . You soak the meat with way too much salt and then dehydrate it . Bacteria do n't stand a chance . As Alton says in that episode " Club med becomes club dead " . Not one of his best puns but it gets the point across . Salt ( or soy sauce , same thing ) is n't required for the drying process but it is important for long term preservation . I have seen recipes that try to reduce it but I would never leave it out altogether . I would expect a reduced salt recipe to not have the longevity that most jerky has - If stored in an air tight container it will last nearly forever . The non-salt ingredients do n't really matter as long as they wo n't oxidize or pick up bad flavors during dehydration . The type of sugar also does n't matter - although the recipes I prefer do n't include any . I honestly do n't know about viscosity - I would expect it to need enough liquid to carry the salt into the meat . That would take some experimenting . It is very important that there be as little fat as possible . The leaner the meat the better and do n't add any to the marinade . Fats will go rancid quite quickly when exposed to so much air . Lastly - I think I 've posted this recipe before as the answer to some other question but it bears repeating . This family recipe is my favorite by far and I use it as a starting point for any experimenting : Auntie Fern 's Beef Jerky 3 lbs . deer meat or beef , sliced thin 1 T salt 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder 1 T pepper ( I like coarse ground ) 1/4 c. soy sauce 1/3 c. Worcestershire sauce 1/3 c. liquid smoke ( hickory flavor ) Combine and marinade 12 hours . Drain . Dry .
It should be firm , not mushy , but not rock hard either . The most important thing , however , is smell . An unripe pineapple wo n't smell like anything . An overripe pineapple will smell vinegary . A ripe pineapple will smell sweet .
This article , from the <URL> , indicates : Garbanzo bean flour ( a.k.a. gram flour , chana flour , besan , chickpea , or cici flour ) should be a pantry staple . Unlike other bean flours , garbanzo bean flour does not have to be combined with other flours ( although you can do it if you wish ) . Garbanzo flour is high in protein and gives a slightly " beany " flavor to baked goods . However , they are not focused on food issues , and may not be the most reliable source . According to <URL> , you can use chickpea flour as a flour substitute , but they recommend no more than 75 % replacement ( garbanzo bean is another name for chickpea ) : Garbanzo bean flour - I know this gluten free flour does n't sound appetizing , but it is delicious , healthy and is a wonderful primary gluten free flour that you can use up to 75 % in a recipe . And ... ... ... ... . . NO , I know what you are thinking ... ... ... it does n't taste like beans ! ( I thought the same thing ! ) Again , not the same as a university extension center , but at least a practicing individual who tries these kinds of things . Given that cookies are made from a structure of starch rather than gluten , the lack of glutens from wheat flour should not be an issue . However , chickpea flour also contains less starch One brand of garbanzo bean flour indicated that it had 18 grams of carbohydrates per 30 grams of product on its nutritional information ; that same brand 's pastry flour ( a wheat flour ) had 27 grams of per 34 g of product . As you can see , chickpea flour has significantly less available carbohydrates ( mostly starch , some sugars ) to form the structure of the baked goods . This will change the texture and structure development . In general , gluten free baking experts recommend using a mix of flours to substitute for wheat flour , depending on how it is being used , in order to get the best possible outcome . If your goal is not to be gluten free , only substituting for 50 % of the recipe amount may provide good compromise on the outcome . Bottom line , in a cookie , you would expect when substituting 100 % chickpea flour for wheat flour : Different texture , due to less starch and more protein . My best guess is that it will be a little more fragile , due to less starch structure , but I have never tried this . Different flavor , due to the fact that beans taste different than grains Update after the question was edited to talk about the effect of leavening : In a cookie , the structure of the final product is based on gelatinized starches . With the reduced quantity of starch in the chickpea flour compared to wheat flour , there is simply less of a starch network present . This may reduce the capacity of the cookie to retain the gas generated by the baking powder or baking soda , and thus a flatter , less airy product .
I give my coffee maker an internal cleanse with vinegar and water once a month to avoid scale build-up . I use 1/2 cup of white vinegar plus water to make a full pot , run that through my maker two or three times , and then run five or six pots of plain water through the maker until there is no longer any scent of the vinegar . I clean the pot and its basket and insert once a week in the dishwasher , and wipe down the case and heating element daily . I 've been using the same drip coffee maker ( with its glass , dishwasher-safe pot ) for about five years . On those occasions when I 've run out of white vinegar , I use a tablespoon of citric acid dissolved in the first few cleaning pots of water , and then run five or six pots of plain water through the maker . Citric acid is just as effective as white vinegar for descaling but does n't smell as strong ; it 's also inexpensive .
Generally that sort of treatment is to get rid of any moisture the stone may have taken on during storage/handling -- if it were n't kept dry , there could be moisture deep in the stone that would not be an issue in normal home use . I would expect the instructions were also that you should put the stone in the cold oven then turn it on -- that would be the safest way to do the whole process , avoiding thermal shock , etc. . There might be some proprietary reason to do this also , but my vote goes to driving out deeply absorbed moisture .

How to add fresh fruit chunks to ice cream ?
To expand michaels answer ( assuming that you want strawberry icecream and not pieces of strawberry mixed in ) . If you are making a custard ice cream , leave the amount of egg yolks the same , because you want the lecithin from them . Reduce the sugar somewhat , because fruit is sweet . Then decide how much fruit puree you want ( maybe 1/3 the volume of the dairy part ) . Adjust the volume of the dairy so that the liquid is correct . Adjust the fat of the dairy so that the fat content is correct . Example , you start with the recipe for vanilla ice cream French ( = custard ) style by Lebovitz . 1 cup ( 250ml ) whole milk ; A pinch of salt ; 3/4 cup ( 150g ) sugar ; 1 vanilla bean , split lengthwise ; 2 cups ( 500ml ) heavy cream ; 5 large egg yolks ; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract This recipe has 185g fat ( I calculated with 30 % fat in the cream ) , 460g dry matter ( this is both fat and non-fat ) and yields 990g ice cream ( rounded a bit ) . Let 's say that you decide to use 200g strawberry puree . 200g strawberry puree has 10g sugars , 18g dry matter and no fat . A mixture of 5 yolks , 140g sugar ( if you want , you can look at the fructose sweetness coefficient and change the sugar accordingly , but I think this is n't so much of a problem if we just substitute the 10g from strawberries ) , 200g strawberry puree and some salt and vanilla has 25g fat , 225g dry matter and weighs 430g ( rounded ) . You could create two equation systems , the first for the total volume of the dairy mixture needed , and the second one for the ratio of cream to milk , and solve these to get to a mixture with the original ratio . fatamount/total = fatpercentage liquidamount/total = liquidpercentage fatpercentage + liquidpercentage + nonfatdrypercentage = 1 where you know fatamount , liquidamount and nonfatdrypercentage is around 0.1 ( actually 0.08 for milk only and 0.12 for cream only , but we do n't need so much precision ) . Solve for total , then calculate fatpercentage . 0.3 * cream + 0.04 * milk = fatpercentage * ( milk + cream ) milk + cream = total I will take a shortcut here . I specified almost as much strawberries as milk . They have no fat ( unlike milk ) , but a similar ( actually higher ) amount of dry mass . So let 's see what happens when we keep the 500g cream and turn the 50g difference between strawberries and milk into cream too ( because we suspect we want some more fat ) . Then we have 190 g fat , 290g dry matter and 980g ice cream base . At 19.38 % fat , we are above the ratio given in the article , but close to the original ratio ( and I suspect that the article might be about Philadelphia style ice cream , which has less fat ) . The 29.59 % dry matter are again outside of the article recommendation , but close to the original recipe . In fact , I assume that well emulsified fat can prevent ice crystal creation , so the higher liquid content does n't create problems here ( also note that McGee gives a 10-20 % range for fat in ice cream , not 7-12 % ) . Long story short : do n't add fruit puree , it is mostly water . Substitute puree for milk , calculate the new percentage of fat and dry matter ( use the 7-12 % fat and 37-42 % liquid for a recipe without emulsifiers , you can be freer if you have emulsifiers ; egg yolk counts as emulsifier ) . If you are still not there , try the calculation with less puree , or increase the fat and/or dry matter until you are in the recommended range . Or just start with the equations . NB # 1 I did n't check my calculations , could have a mistake there . But the principle should be correct . NB # 2 I calculated with cream density of 1 . This was somewhat surprising , but the nutrition data for cream I found insists that a cup of cream ( 240 ml ) weighs 238 g , so the difference is small enough to not go to the trouble to convert . A recipe given by volume probably ( hopefully ) has some leeway , so this should n't skew the results into a bad recipe .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
Thinking about this from first principles , a banana is about : 75 % water 20 % carbohydrates ( mostly sugar and a small amount of starch ) Less than 5 % combined fiber and protein Trace amount of fat ( generally considered to be zero ) . The anti-crystallization effect of guar gum works on the water component , so adding a small amount of guar gum actually should be of some benefit . The hard part is getting it all dispersed ; you do n't want to over-process the banana ( you 'd lose the creaminess ) but you also need to hydrate the guar gum in order for it to work its magic . You also need to avoid over-thickening , which might be difficult even with the very small starch content in a typical banana . Bananas convert more starch to sugar as they ripen , so I suspect you 'd have more success trying this on very ripe bananas that are , essentially , little more than sugar and water to begin with . Incorporating and maintaining air is something that I just do n't think you 're going to be able to do . Proteins and fats can both participate in foaming ( egg whites being an example of the former , and heavy cream being the canonical example of the latter ) , but bananas have neither of those . There 's simply nothing to whip , and thus nothing to stabilize , so neither xanthan gum nor any other emulsifier/stabilizer is going to do you much good here . If you really want to incorporate air then you 're going to need more than one ingredient . My instinct would be to say coconut milk , which has relatively high fat and pairs well with banana ( and obviously is also vegan / non-dairy ) , but I can say from experience now that coconut milk just does n't have enough fat . You could try cooking it down first to get the fat ratio up , or using coconut oil , but I 'm not sure how it would taste . Traditional ice cream is about 60 % water , which means the amount of guar gum that most people seem to get the best results with ( about 1 tsp/qt ) is about 0.87 % of the total water . For a small ( 100 g ) banana , that 's about 75 mL of water corresponding to very close to 1/8 tsp of guar gum . So , I 'd give this a try with 1/8 tsp of guar gum , forget the xanthan gum . Try adding it after you 've frozen the banana for the first time , when you first pop it into the blender . No guarantees , but , you can probably afford to waste one banana in the attempt . Update : I thought I 'd give this a try myself since ( a ) it seemed pretty easy and ( b ) I can always use more non-dairy dessert recipes . Here 's how it came out with 1/4 tsp of guar gum for 2 bananas , after being frozen for two days : You can see that ice crystal formation is pretty minimal , and although some parts did harden a bit ( much like ordinary homemade ice cream with low overrun ) , they returned to normal consistency within just a few minutes . Of course it still tastes like frozen bananas , so if I were to do this again I think I 'd probably try adding a few other flavours . Also note that even though the texture is decent , the colour is getting dark , and I have no doubt that this would eventually turn black after enough time in the freezer - and the lemon juice trick does n't really work so well when the whole thing has been blended up .
Well , yes and no . A lot of recipes for semifreddo are n't truly semifreddo because they are hard frozen . Recipes like that can be fried just like ice cream . The key to fried ice cream is to hard freeze the scoops of ice cream . By definition , that is n't semifreddo , but definitions do n't seem to matter much to writers of recipes . So , if the " stuff " is hard frozen , it can be coated and fried like fried ice cream . Perhaps after being deep fried , the name " semifreddo " is more apropos .
The wine will bring several things to the breadmaking party : Acidity Alcohol Water Flavoring Color ( especially if it is red wine ) The biggest of these is the alcohol which is a yeast byproduct -- they do n't like it in their environment , and it inhibits their growth . The acidity can do the same . Proofing will be retarded , and you may need a larger starting quantity of yeast than for a wineless loaf . You would also have to adjust the amount of liquid in the formula to account for that from the wine . Your bread would probably take on a strange mauve color , after being baked , and may have some hint of winey flavor . I think the lack of well known wine-loaves in the world 's baking traditions indicates this does not generally work out very well , although there are some recipes for yeast raise breads containing wine such as <URL> from The Fresh Loaf .
Yes , actually , there are two magic ingredients : <URL> and <URL> . Guar gum is a thickener , but in small quantities can also prevent the growth of ice crystals which would cause the ice cream to harden into icicles . Xanthan gum is a stabilizer which helps keep air ( called overrun ) in the mixture . Air is generally churned into ice cream by ice cream machines , but it wo n't stay that way without the stabilizer .
In meatballs or meat loaf or even burgers , breadcrumbs are sometimes added with egg . The bread , if unseasoned , does n't change the flavor much except to dilute it . The texture is definitely different . It is smoother and spongier . The breadcrumbs also soak up liquid so the product does n't lose as much and stays moister . Purists often decry the use of breadcrumbs in things like burger patties . For myself - I will add breadcrumbs when I am in the mood for the breadier texture - often when I will be adding extra liquid flavorings like Worcestershire or liquid smoke and want to strengthen the structure a bit .
Cranberries have a ton of pectin - which is one reason why cranberry jelly is so prevalent . Just simmer the cranberries , sugar , and orange juice together for a while and they will eventually gel . I do n't know how the liqueur will behave but if it was supposed to be served raw then you probably would want to add it after boiling so the alcohol would n't boil off . Of course - you wo n't be able to call this a " raw fruit relish " anymore - it would become a pretty standard cranberry sauce recipe . If you want to keep the berries raw then I would recommend combining the sugar and orange juice with some other thickener such as corn starch or gelatin .
In professional smoothie/frozen youghurt/fruit shake shops , you 'll usually see the fruit frozen in small pieces for easy portioning . So raspberrys and blueberrys are fine , but you 'd wnat to quarter strawberrys and cube mangoes or apples or kiwis or whatever before freezing them . The freezing process itself is important to the strucutral integrity of the fruit , and will affect its texture . However , if you only want them for smoothies/blended drinks , that is n't very important . As a usage note , remember that a home freezer compartment is usually at -4 degrees Celsius , whereas a chest freezer ( deep freeze ) would more commonly be at -18 degrees . A good blender wo n't mind either way , but your lips might find it a bit cold . Also , you might find you can buy the fruit pre-frozen from the same vendors the shops get them , in which case it will be prepared for you , and all you need is to defrost and blend . Aside from saving you the work of peeling and chopping , their freezing process may be better , and it 'll probably end up being cheaper too .
I think isolating the fudge could be a good way to fix this . It might complicate your dish , but it might add both to the presentation as well as to the texture of the ice cream . Try getting hold of or make your own biscuit rolls ( I do n't know the name ) . Fill these up with hot fudge . The biscuit will act as isolation keep the texture of both the ice cream and the fudge . In this way the only time the two will get in contact with each other is when one breaks up the biscuit to eat it . If biscuits does n't cut it , chocolate tubes or similar could do the same trick .
The only trick I know of is to use a <URL> -- some will turn to complete mush , while others stay firm . Unfortunately , unlike potatoes , they do n't tend to be marked at the super market as to which variety they are . Now , I 'm not familiar with Bramley , but from what I 've found , it 's compared to Granny Smith , which tends to hold up well in pies . I 'd recommend blind baking your crust , if you are n't already , so the filling is n't in there as long , and possibly going with a thicker slice of apple when you 're cooking , in hopes they wo n't break down as quickly . update : in checking <URL> , there 's a comment in the apple pie recipe that " briefly sautéing and poaching apples softens them slighly before the sugar , which prevents cells falling apart and preserves texture , is added "
Main reason that comes to mind is , for the same reason compound butter 's flavour improves over a couple of days : infusion . Fat can be infused with flavour , and holds flavour incredibly well , but it needs a little time ( viscosity of fat vs water ) . Otherwise the fat in Serrano Ham would taste just like it would on day one . By holding your mix/custard overnight you are allowing the coffee or vanilla flavours get infused into the mix . You can somewhat accelerate this by letting the vanilla sit in hot ice-cream mix for 1hr as suggested by many pastry chefs ( e.g. Simple French Desserts , Jill O'Conner ) . I suspect the acceleration is due to the lower viscosity of fat at higher temperatures . The taste does follow the physics here were the higher the viscosity the longer infusion ( read equilibrium ) takes . Serrano ham : two years . Hot deep fryer oil : seconds . By the way , when it comes to ice-cream , they also recommend aging your mix/custard for up to 48 hours . It may be worth the experiment to sous-vide your ice-cream batter/mix at say 55C for a couple of hours and compare taste with the over-night version . Although mouthfeel may play a role in this case , the ' flavour improves over time ' effect is present even when crystallization is not happening .
In examining sponge cake recipes , I 've noticed that some call for adding the melted butter with the flour . Some call for adding it afterwards . The important thing is to fold in that butter in a way that preserves the network of bubbles that was created while whipping your eggs ( unsure if your recipe called for whipping whole eggs with sugar or yolks with sugar and egg whites separately , but both will be creating a bubble structure integral to letting your cake rise ) . <URL> mentions that folding in flour helps to preserve that network ( as long as you do n't overhandle ) . If you over handle while folding - and you may have tipped it over the line when adding butter - you will destroy that bubble network and your cake wo n't rise as you 'd like . It 's also possible to under-handle , which will result in only a thin layer of sponge on top with a thick buttery cake underneath .
The vast majority of recipes I find call for marshmallows to be added at the last second , and cooked only long enough for them to melt . Usually then a heavy frosting is added to top the whole thing , giving the illusion of marshmallow inside the brownie . Find an example <URL> . I 've also seen really " wet " brownies with lots of included chocolate chips and butterscotch , which contain non-disgusting looking marshmallows . I 've never personally tried these because they seem overly sweet , but they 're the only ones I 've seen that contain marshmallows that seem to retain elasticity after a normal baking period . See examples <URL> and <URL> . For my money , I 'd probably just sprinkle some marshmallows over the top of regular brownies during the last 3-4 minutes of baking . Quick , simple , not overcooked .
similar to what julio said , the main reason is that typical wheat-based noodles release a lot of starch into the water , which changes the consistency of the soup . the starches can add a dirty colour to the water , but more than that , they can also thicken the soup undesirably ( think of making a roux ) . Finally , if there are leftovers , the noodles can sometimes become completely water logged , making eating it the next day a bit of a soggy experience . That said , with all these considerations there are times when you might add the noodles directly in -- non-starchy noodles ( eg . like rice noodles ) seem to do ok . also parboiling regular pasta before hand seems to help a lot with the starch and can still help you achieve the flavour integration you mentioned .
Fresh herbs should , generally , be added closer to the end of a recipe . Dried herbs should be added fairly early on during the cooking process so that they have time to " develop " and more fully release their flavors . Fresh herbs and spices , however , will generally have more subtle flavors , and they are usually best used for seasoning at the very end of the recipe , rather than actual cooking . You can check out more details about how to use different kinds of spices in <URL> . For your specific case , I would say to definitely add the basil in at the end -- maybe five or ten minutes before the sauce is finished , as you said . It may even be a good idea to remove the pot from your heat source after you have added the basil so that the herbs can infuse their flavor without actually cooking into the sauce . You have to be careful not to cook too much of the flavor out with fresh herbs . If they simmer too long with the rest of the dish the subtle flavors can be easily overpowered by other ingredients .
When I buy hot chilies , I look for firm , uniformly bright ( or dark , depending on the type ) green specimens . Unless I 'm in a big hurry , I pick through the pile and choose them individually . I avoid any that are soft , discolored ( including the ends ) , missing caps ( the part that attaches to the stem -- they spoil faster after this is removed ) , wrinkly or otherwise look damaged or old . If your store does n't have any that look bright green , crisp and plump , try to find a new place to buy them , or just buy them in smaller quantities and get the least disreputable specimens and use them immediately . You want to buy chilies from a place that has a high turnover on them and most supermarket produce sections do n't really do that much business in hot peppers , so they tend to sit for a while . My favorite place to buy green chilies is at Indian markets ( the busier , the better for turnover ) , second favorite is other Asian food markets , then other specialty markets from places that like spicy food , then farmers ' markets , then a long way down the list , regular grocery stores . When I get them home , I clean them off by hand ( remove any stray leaves or any bad ones I accidentally missed , etc ) and put them in the fridge in a lightly closed baggie . If I bought a large amount ( or if I happen to be growing them and have a lot ripe at once ) , I will sometimes freeze them . I have a small bag of frozen habaneros at home right now . The texture is most definitely affected by freezing , but the flavor is n't ( unless you keep them so long that they get freezer-burned ) , so if you are planning to cook with them , freezing is perfectly fine . I usually do n't wash them before storing , just pick them over . I wash them just before using them , whether I get them from the garden , the store , the fridge or the freezer . If I have chilies I 'm not sure about , I do smell and taste them to see if they are ok . If they feel/smell/taste weird , I do n't put them in the dish . I 'd rather replace green chilies with red pepper powder instead of using something iffy .
The quote in your question is clearly aimed at eggs that are mixed ( ie omelettes , scrambled eggs etc ) before cooking , not for whole eggs sunny side up . The benefits of adding more water is to slow down the cooking of those mixed eggs . If you add a liquid , water or milk , you 'll be poaching the eggs rather than frying them in fat or oil as most sunny side up eggs are cooked . If poaching is what you want to do , there 's plenty of instructions on how to do this out on the web . Poached eggs are equally as good if not nicer than fried ' sunny side up ' ones in my opinion .
Dust the fruit with a little flour before adding to the cake . It will act like a glue and prevent the fruit from sinking .
In sum : YES , sugar DOES really help to extract fruit flavors . The answer quoted in the edit does NOT imply that " absorption is slowed down " in general . It merely states that in a sugar solution , sugar will generally not move out of fruit ; it does n't say anything about what else happens . Osmosis is simply a process by which the stuff on both sides of a barrier tries to come to equilibrium . Increasing sugar content in a solution will only decrease the amount of sugar that comes out of the fruit , but it will often simultaneously increase the water that diffuses out ( along with many things dissolved in that water , like fruit flavors ) . In other words , in a plain water solution , sugar will diffuse out of fruit to raise the water 's sugar concentration . However , in most cases when a sugar solution is used , it is deliberately higher in concentration than the sugar content within the fruit cells ( as in the strawberry example mentioned in the question , where there is basically no water at first outside the fruit , so water is forced out to bring the system into better equilibrium ) . Sugar is very <URL> , which basically means it attracts water . If the sugar solution has a higher sugar content than the moisture within the fruit cells ( as is true in most recipes using this technique ) , water will diffuse out of the fruit . Anything that is water-soluble , such as various flavor components , will come along with it to some extent . Meanwhile , sugar will also be forced into the fruit , changing its texture -- when done in excess over a period of time , such a process can actually preserve the fruit by lowering the water content substantially ( driving it out into the solution ) while raising the internal sugar content of the fruit , resulting in <URL> . You may note that candied fruit generally lacks many of the flavors of fresh fruit . This is because many flavor components were extracted along with the water by the sugar solution . Regarding questions that were raised in comments , the same process occurs with alcohol in a solution . There 's almost no alcohol inside the fruit , so alcohol 's presence outside the fruit will force water out of the fruit , carrying flavors along with it . Alcohol also tends to dissolve certain flavor components that water does n't dissolve as well , so it will gather different sets of flavors than water alone . Note also that different flavor components will come out of the interaction of this osmosis process with the cell membrane compared to , say , simply crushing the fruit , again partly because some flavor molecules are more soluble in alcohol .

Does adding olive oil in pasta while boiling make it sticky ?
Some people think adding olive oil to pasta water will keep the pasta from sticking , but in reality it does absolutely nothing . Adding a tablespoon of oil to pasta water wo n't affect the outcome in the slightest , doing that is a waste of a good ingredient . Adding olive oil to pasta after it has been drained on the other hand will keep the pasta from sticking . It will also make it oily , which may not be what you want .
Yes , it is true that we do n't add oil to the boiling water . I 'm not aware of any good reason to waste extra-virgin olive oil that way ! Some oil is always added at the end , over the sauce , when the pasta is already in the plate ! It has to be raw , so that it retains its fruit nuances and texture . If you are doing cold pasta salad and want to avoid sticky pasta , adding oil in advance wo n't help . You have instead to wash pasta under cold water to wash the starch away ( you can put the pasta in the colander directly under the running cold tap ) .
I surveyed many recipes available by googling " Loation sticky rice " , " Thai sticky rice " and " Viet sticky rice " . None of them mentioned kneading anything in after 30 or 40 recipes , although many mention fluffing , folding , or stirring the rice after cooking or steaming to manage the texture . Several did mention that it is appropriate for eating with one 's hands . The key may be the variety of rice that is used . Short grained glutinous rice will have the sticky texture desired .
There certainly are differences . Specifically regarding lemon there are differences not only in taste , because the lemon olive oil is flavored using the zest of a lemon , but also in acidity . Lemon juice is very acidic , olive oil is not . There are plenty of times where it is completely inappropriate to add an acid . A better comparison would instead be lemon infused olive oil compared to olive oil and lemon zest . There would still be a difference , but it would be less noticeable . The infused olive oil has had more opportunity to capture the fat soluble flavor compounds in the lemon zest , however the flavor compounds that are n't fat soluble will be forever lost . That is generally the trade-off when it comes to any infused oil . You will get lots of the fat soluble flavor compounds , but you will lose the non-fat soluble flavor compounds . As for difference of use in the olive oil and lemon juice case , yes , definitely . You ca n't always add acids to foods . In the lemon zest case , apart from the slight flavor difference , there 's also a texture difference . Of course , if you want something very smooth , pieces of zest would n't be a good thing . Apart from those though , not really . All of these differences still apply both in uncooked as well as cooked preparations .
You need 1.1 x as much water as pasta for al dente ! I measured this myself , cooking penne rigate ( in water , not sauce ) - 200g of pasta weighed 420g after being cooked and thoroughly drained . The estimate below from the nutrition facts is 1.4 x , which probably corresponds to typical American overcooked pasta - a surprisingly large difference from mine . I 'm guessing you 'll be somewhere between , maybe 1.25 x . You can also ballpark it from nutrition facts . <URL> has 31g carbs per 100g pasta , and <URL> has 75g carbs per 100g pasta . So 100g dry pasta turns into 100g * 75/31 = 242g of cooked pasta , meaning the added water was ~ 1.4 x the weight of the pasta . So for a pound of pasta , that 's 1.4 pounds or about 2 2/3 cups of water . Given people 's tastes , this might be a little past al dente , so I would personally start with maybe 1.25 cups of water then add a little more if necessary . ( I 'll also try cooking pasta normally and weighing it if I get a chance . ) Note : if you have a significantly different variety of pasta , it will obviously behave differently . This is for pasta that 's 13 % protein and 75 % carbohydrates . For the standard 2oz/56g ( dry ) serving on the package , it 'll say 7g protein and 41-42g carbohydrates . I checked Barilla , De Cecco , Ronzonni , Garofalo , Safeway store brand , Trader Joe 's store brand , and those nutrition facts , and they all matched . If you 're branching out to other styles like whole grains or egg noodles , things will obviously change , but things are very uniform in the US .
Butter is at most 82 % oil and the rest is water . So , you 're going to need to add more butter for the same amount of oil . Besides , you need to adjust the liquid content accordingly since you are going to have more water than you planned . If you are going to use the same amount of oil , then it will not make any difference other than the taste . Just make sure they are of same state ( i.e. melted butter instead of vegetable oil or vice versa )
Salt ( Sodium chloride ) is salt . As a topping , flakes are commonly used purely for presentation purposes only . The taste is the same , but gets more intense as the salt particles get finer , so use less if the salt is in powder form As an ingredient , use any form you are happy with , and is economical to use . Once salt is dissolved into water it will be identical to any other form of salt For health reasons , finely powdered salt is preferable as much less is required to impart a salty taste
A surprisingly good way to remove oil stains ( even that have set in and gone through the dryer ) is using dish soap . Rub it in , let it sit for a bit , and then wash it out .
Disclaimer : I 've never tried to make a ganache with olive oil , so take that into consideration as you read the following . First , I have to assume that you 're trying to use olive oil to replace the cream that 's normally used in making ganache , perhaps to make a non-dairy ganache . If that 's not right , please clarify your question . Ganache is essentially an emulsion of cocoa butter ( usually from chocolate ) and cream , plus vanilla and/or other flavorings , that is allowed to cool to the point where the cocoa butter solidifies . It 's the solidified cocoa butter that gives ganache it 's firm texture . The greater the ratio of cocoa butter to cream , the firmer the ganache will be . If you want to replace the cream , you 'll need to make sure that you replace all the components that have an effect on the emulsion . Harold McGee 's <URL> explains the structure of ganache : The continuous phase of this mixture , the portion that permeates it , is a syrup made from the cream 's water and the chocolate 's sugar . Suspended in the syrup are the milk fat globules from the cream , and cocoa butter droplets and solid cocoa particles from the chocolate . He does n't say it , but I 'd guess that the milk proteins from the cream might act as emulsifiers to help stabilize the emulsion , much as they do with <URL> . The melting point of olive oil is obviously different from that of butterfat , but since you heat the cream in order to make ganache anyway , olive oil might still work . Given what McGee says , you 'll need to make sure that you add an appropriate amount of water so that there 's enough syrup to suspend the butterfat , cocoa butter , and solids . How much is an appropriate amount ? Cream is usually 20-40 % butterfat , so starting with a 1 part oil for 2 parts water seems reasonable . You might also need to add something that 'll act as an emulsifier , like lecithin .
Use the pasta cooking techniques in this answer : <URL> Bring just enough water to cover the pasta to a boil , put the lid on and let it sit . Use less water , less energy , and it ca n't boil over if it 's not boiling .
Oil definitely changes the crust , and whether or not it 's " better " depends on what you 're going for . Oil in the dough tends to give a softer and thicker crust , while a lean dough tends to give a crisper and thinner crust . Other dough ingredients that tenderize include milk and eggs , and there are plenty of web pages listing " dough enhancers " that give various effects . Again , it all depends on what type of crust and crumb you want .
You have basically made tea-flavoured vodka . The <URL> ( for essential oil ) is unrelated to the <URL> for the beverage . Commercially , tea tree oil is produced by <URL> , specifically <URL> . Though possible to obtain leaves and perform the distillation , it 's probably not practical on a small scale outside of the tea tree production regions . For completeness , <URL> is toxic ; you do n't want to eat it . What you used was conventional tea leaves . The tea beverage is made by steeping ( soaking in hot water ) leaves of the <URL> , which have been dried or otherwise prepared ( e.g. , fermented , roasted , etc. ) .
Al dente cooking is a transitional state that lasts for a very short amount of time ( one minute longer in boiling water makes pasta too soft , one minute shorter and it 's still crunchy ) . For this reason , authentic Italian pasta packages state a precise cooking time , which is very reliable to make a good al dente pasta . A cooking time interval ( e.g. " 7 to 10 minutes " ) is usually given to accommodate to other countries taste , who may prefer a softer pasta , and therefore its presence could be a good indicator of an Italian look-alike pasta brand . In this case the lower figure indicates the al dente cooking . Lacking this information , a good cooking time can be figured by cross section size , length and shape of pasta : obviously , thicker and squat formats require more time . Complex shapes , such as farfalle , can be trickier because a thick core could reach the al dente cooking while the thinner edges are already too soft . As a rule of thumb , cooking times for common pasta formats are : Long and very thin ( spaghettini , bavette ) : 6 min Long and thin ( spaghetti , linguine , bucatini ) : 8 min Short and thick ( maccheroni , rigatoni , fusilli ) : 12 min Small and thick ( farfalle ) : 8 min Small and thin ( pasta usually boiled straight into broth ) : 6 min These cooking times apply only for dry durum-wheat pasta ; other types ( such as fresh egg pasta ) usually have a shorter cooking time . After straining the boiling water , pasta continues to cook by its own heat ; for this reason it has to be eaten as soon as possible . Only for some Italian regional recipes ( typically pasta boiled straight into a thick vegetable juice , e.g. pasta with beans , pasta with potatoes ) you may want to let it rest for up to 5 minutes after straining to let the juices coagulate . Also , for recipes where pasta has to undergo a second cooking after boiling ( e.g. stir frying in a pan with vegetables , shrimps , mushrooms , etc. ) a better result is obtained by boiling pasta just one minute less than the cooking time given on the package .
The air pressure is lower at higher altitudes ; when you add extra flour to your baked goods , it prevents them from rising too quickly or too much . ETA ( about the water ) : Water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes , so the extra water called for in high-altitude baking is to compensate for all the water turning to steam faster than it would at sea level .
The actual action of soaking is what does most of the work . Most legumes have complex oligosaccharides , a type of complex sugar . Digestion of this complex sugar is what causes flatulence . By soaking your beans will help remove some of this excess sugar . Be sure you discard the soaking water . Though it is often said that adding baking soda helps I 've yet to see any verifiable evidence that it would help . Also , do n't forget that baking soda is n't tasteless , it could easily add a salty or soapy flavor to your once pristine beans .
It should be reasonably dense , firm and only a little sticky on the outside - a bit like modelling clay . You should be able to knead it easily and cut shapes out of it without too much trouble . The absorptive potential of flour varies by brand and even batch , so recipes involving it always require a little improvisation - in this case it sounds like you need a bit more .
You do get some reflection of microwaves off a glass or plastic cover ( <URL> ) Do n't use metal lids . Neither glass nor Plexiglass plastic absorb much of the beam . The question then becomes : Does reflection off a lid slow heating more than retaining heat in an enclosed vessel speeds it ? Anecdotal , but experience tells me that using a plate over a bowl or a casserole dish cover routinely gives hotter , more uniformly heated food . Probably true for plastic wrap too , but I do n't use that in a microwave since I had a piece of it melt on me .
In the pastas that I have made the structure of the noodle is built out of protein - usually entirely from gluten from wheat flour . In fact the base of my pasta is just flour and water ( or juice or pureed vegetables , etc. ) Egg noodles , obviously get structure from the egg . Quinoa has no gluten and will impart no structure to a typical pasta . You could easily add it to a normal pasta recipe as long as it was not in so high a concentration as to compromise the gluten structure . Without experimenting I do n't know what ratio this would be . A cursory google search found several quinoa pasta recipes . The ones I looked at were similar in that they relied on a variety of starches and egg for structure . I imagine these would taste fine but they would be more like dumplings or egg noodles than al dente Italian pasta . The results of the quick search : <URL> <URL>
Ah , so the question is " Why does boiling the tofu change its texture ? " . Answer : it does n't . Try doing this recipe without boiling the tofu , I think you will find it is pretty much the same . I think if the boiling serves any purpose at all it is to remove any last remnant of taste from the tofu . I do n't mash tofu often , but when I do , I never boil it and I 've never had a problem .
No , it is not a good idea at all . It will be worse , not better . What you are missing here is that cocoa powder does not dissolve at all , never , it just disperses in water ( or milk ) . So there is no reason why methods for dissolving stuff would work with cocoa powder . You will need to use a method created for colloid-producing powders like cocoa powder , which is mostly starch with fat . This is why the answers to the other question recommend the slurry method . When you are dispersing an absorptive powder like starch , you always run a risk of clumping , and the slurry is designed to work around that problem . But starch also thickens much more under heat , so if you were to not just forego the slurry , but simply drop the cocoa powder into hot water , this would be the worst choice possible , leading to instant unbreakable clumps . The slurry method would n't work with hot water either , you 'll get clumps before you have created the slurry . So , the short answer is : if you try it , it wo n't " dissolve automatically " , it will produce an ugly undrinkable mixture of clumps .

How can I rescue an undercooked pastry cream ?
When this happens to me , I am distrustful of a simple reheat . It is possible that it was undercooked , but also possible that it was maybe overcooked/understirred and that most of the binding proteins solidified on the bottom and too little of them remained in the milk , or maybe that the ratios were simply wrong . Your specific recipe also contains starch , so if you truly undercooked , then it 's very probable that the yolks dissolved your starch , so you are left without any starch binding power . The most secure way is to throw it out and make another batch , this time boiling so that it blubbs for at least a minute . If you really want to save it , just use another thickener . In pure custards , I tend to add starch if they do n't turn out . If there is already starch in there , I prefer another thickener such as xanthan . First , I do n't know why the starch did n't work the first time , but repeating it somehow feels wrong . Second , it can get too much of a starchy/floury taste . The " other dish " is not something that can be answered on a Stack Exchange site . You have limitless possibilities to do with it whatever you want , starting with drinking it as it is . Anything which you can make with a custard which was made thin on purpose can be made with your failed custard too .
Normally , you would not be doing a final proof overnight -- that is , the proof that you have done to form the loaf . Instead , you would do the first ferment or proof overnight , then form the loaf , let it have its final proof , and then bake it . The dough wo n't be wasted , but you do n't want to bake a formed loaf that has over-proofed and fallen . This is because the gluten network will have collapsed and you will have a very poor structure and strange texture . You will need to reknead the dough , form the loaf , and reproof it : Per <URL> , you can almost certainly just punch the dough down , and let it proof again . It may actually have an improved flavor . <URL> concurs : Using your fingertips , gently punch down the over-proofed dough and reshape it into a ball , then allow it to proof again for the recommended amount of time although it warns your final loaf may be about 20 % smaller .
You want to make a " mint infusion " . Googling this will give you many recipes . Basically you brew the mint like herbal tea : Remove stems , Bruise the leaves a little , Add the leaves to a cup of very hot water , Let steep for a few minutes , strain and throw away the mushy leaves and use the liquid for your flavoring . The liquid will be brown as you are destroying the chlorophyll that makes the leaves green . In most applications I add food coloring to fix this . As you are making chocolate mint ice cream this should not be a problem . Save some of your mint leaves to use as a garnish . I love chocolate mint and I am very excited for you having a bumper crop of it .
Unless there is something seriously wrong with your stove , you should not have any negative effects from using it to make choux pastry . Simply melt the butter into the water over medium then adjust the temperature to high . The purpose of boiling the water and then cooking the pastry over low heat is to gelatinize the starches in the flour . Your recipe likely adds emphasis to the point of bringing the water to a boil quickly so that you do not simmer the water away . Doing so can have negative effects on the finished product because it will throw off the water : flour ratio and you will not be able to completely gelatinize the starches . If your stove heats up so slowly that you think this might be an issue , you can simply place a lid over the pot as you bring it to a boil , making sure to add back to the pot any condensed vapor on the inside of the lid .
I do n't believe you will be satisfied with any cookies you roll out and cut from this dough . That said , there are three options that may allow the dough to find a tasty future . Make a ' Mega Cookie ' : roll the dough out and fit it onto a pizza tin and bake . This can be decorated as one large cookie/pizza . Make ' Brownies ' : work the dough into an 8 " x8 " or 9 " x13 " pan and bake . ' Cupcakes ' : scoop a spoonful of dough into each compartment of muffin tin and bake . Of course you will have to watch to get them done enough as the standard bake time probably wo n't apply . If your recipe does n't include eggs ( or you are not concerned with the risk that raw eggs may pose ) adding it to homemade ice cream would be a fourth option . Good luck .
I think it depends how fussy a presentation you are working on . If it has to be perfect , there really is n't going to be any fixing it . If some variation is acceptable , just wait til it is a bit softer and patch the rip back together like you would any other dough . You 'll get less nice separation of the layers in that area .
Generally speaking when speaking of " stew beef " , the meat will break down more the longer you cook it . I often make shredded beef for tacos out of that cut by simmmering it for a few hours or more . At 1 hour , I 'd say it was undercooked . For example : <URL> In there he recommends using stewing beef , browning it first and then " ... stew until the meat is tender and can be cut with a spoon . This will take at least an hour and a half . "

Freezing affects the texture of avocados rather poorly . Freezing a whole one or chunks will result in a mushy avocado on refreezing . Its not recommended apparently . <URL> , it should be washed , pureed ( not just mashed ) and frozen with a bit of lemon juice ( or other applicable acid ) to prevent browning .
Because of the dairy products , you should n't leave it un-chilled for more than 4 hours . It 's always best to cover your food to prevent dust ( or cat fur , for example ) from covering it . Unless the frosting is really wet and gooey ( which might run into the cake ) , it 's OK to frost now .
This site say you can use it again , just make sure you strain it before you store it <URL> This site says you can store it for a couple of days in the fridge <URL> As for how many spheres can be produced - I 'm afraid that would be completely dependent on how large you make your spheres .
You can substitute one to one . Many brands of " light sour cream " ( Which is an oxymoron . Cream without the cream ? ) have a lot of gums and starches to stabilize the liquid as the fat would have done . Brands that do n't have gums dilute the fat with skim milk and are basically just yogurt anyway . Regular yogurt is fragile . It is a delicate mesh of proteins filled with water . When it is blended the water washes out . However , greek yogurt has already had this done ! So there is less water and it stays creamy and loses relatively little extra liquid even when blended .
Heston Blumenthal has brought his unique scientific approach to bear on this recently . The main pointers for a perfect poached egg are as follows : The egg must be fresh . A fresh egg has a thicker , more gel-like albumen . As it gets older , this becomes watery , and so just disperses throughout the water when you add it . To test if your egg is fresh , place it in a jug of cold water . If it floats , it 's not fresh - the egg has had time to absorb air through its shell . A fresh egg sinks and stays sunk . The water temperature should be 80ºC / 176ºF exactly . You can measure this with a sugar or probe thermometer . The egg should be at room temperature . The egg should not come into contact with direct heat , so put a plate or small bowl on the bottom of the pan , bottom up . Once the water ( in a medium to large saucepan ) is up to temperature , carefully add the fresh egg and cook for 4 minutes exactly ( for a large egg of the domestic chicken , Gallus gallus domesticus ) . Drain and serve - the white should be set but not rubbery ( a drawback of using vinegar ) and the yolk should be creamy and rich .
You can use a solution of vinegar and water to descale your kettle ( unless , as hobodave mentioned , the manufacturer advises against using vinegar ) . Fill your kettle with water until it 's half full ; add about 1/2 cup of vinegar to the water , and then allow it to boil for about 10 minutes . Allow the water to cool and unplug your kettle . Gently scrub away the scale with a non-metallic pad ( do n't scrub the heating element if it 's exposed ; wipe that with a sponge ) . Rinse your kettle several times after removing the scale , and then boil one or two fillings of water in it to ensure that you remove all traces of the vinegar .
Well , if it was a boat , you 'd swab it every few days ( " swab the desk " ) so it stayed wet and swollen . You could also treat the bucket with a food-grade mineral oil . You can find it in most kitchenware stores for protecting cutting boards . The oil will evaporate much slower than water will , but it will still evaporate . You might try putting the whole thing in a large plastic bag or similar container , so whatever moisture evaporates stays in the air surrounding the bucket , slowing further moisture loss ... but moist , stagnant air is n't good for long periods of time , either , as you could end up with mold that would be even more annoying to deal with . Or , as the bucket 's only touching the ice &amp; salt mix , and not coming in direct contact with food , you could always use wood treatments available from any hardware store . update : I was reading up on walnut oil , and wikipedia linked to a woodworker <URL> for finishing wood that would come in contact w / food , but that you should re-coat each year . I assume the beeswax would give it longer durability as compared to straight mineral oil sold for cutting boards .
This can be a hard one to get right . There are three important phases of baking these : An brief initial high heat phase A longer lower heat phase A brief slow cooling phase For the initial phase I go with 400 ℉ for 15 minutes . The high heat provides a rapid rise with a hollow center . For the second phase I reduce the heat to 350 ℉ for 30-40 minutes . This phase allows the shells to firm up and dries out the center . At this point you should cut one of them in half and see how moist the center is . It 's important that the center of the dough be as dry as possible here , having an undercooked center is what causes the dough to deflate . A little bit of moisture is ok . For the final phase , turn the oven off and let them cool with the door ajar for 10-15 minutes . With the door fully open the rapid cooling can also trigger deflation .
For protection against heat , you can stabalize the milk with starches . ( eg , a white sauce made with milk wo n't curdle , even if you boil it ) . I unfortunately do n't know how much you 'd have to add , and of course , it 'll end up affecting the texture of your soup ) . For soups , you 're likely better off making a corn starch/milk slurry before adding the milk , so you do n't have to cook it like you would flour to get rid of the raw flour taste . You may also want to consider the heat that you 're cooking the soup at -- you likely want a low simmer , not a full boil .
Corn starch only thickens when heated to 180 F , so it probably is not helping at all with your whipped cream . I live in the US , so I can not compare to whipped cream in the UK . Whipped cream for cake fillings is often beaten almost to the breaking point to make the foam as thick as possible . I assume you are whipping the cream sufficiently , and it still is n't getting as thick as you would like . If that is the case , you might try <URL> . The link is one of many I have found on a quick search , and it specifically calls for 35 % cream . This <URL> also has some interesting thoughts and advise . This <URL> also provides an interesting method of using creme fraiche .
It sounds like the only thing you can do is use an interface disk - basically a piece of metal that is compatible with the induction cooktop , which will then transfer the heat to the espresso maker . You can also potentially use an induction-compatible pan as an interface - see <URL> . Unfortunately either way , you 'll lose the fast-response benefit of the induction cooktop , because you 'll now have to wait for the interface to heat .
If you 've baked your puff pastry in the past at 375 then it 's probably not a temperature problem , however I usually bake it between 400-425 degrees ( 400 convection or 425 in standard oven ) . Lower temperatures are n't a problem for the baking aspect as it will still cook through . The problem lies in the fact that the heat wo n't be significant enough to generate the steam needed for expansion . Egg wash could be a culprit as it should only be used on the top and not allowed to run down the sides where it will seal the edge together and keep it from rising unevenly .

What is the best way to re-serve day old meat balls ?
My preferred method by far would be heating them in a pot along with some kind of sauce . Failing that , I think I might try putting them in a tightly covered pot in the oven along with just a little water ( just a tablespoon or so ) -- that would gently heat them and also keep them moist .
Restaurant supply stores carry degreaser , which will remove the brown baked on oil . However , that oil is n't hurting your cooking at all . It is the same thing that forms on cast iron skillets , but it is n't objectionable because you do n't notice the color against the black of the cast iron . If it works I 'd continue to use it . If you are thinking of changing , you might want to consider the cast iron Dutch Oven route . They hold their heat better than consumer deep fryers and a Dutch oven can do more than just deep fry . And they are easier to clean .
In Ireland boiled or glazed ham is a staple . Traditionally it 's had with cut up cabbage ( ideally you would cook the cabbage in the same water the ham was boiled in as this gives it lovely flavour ) but you could just cut it up and pan fry it with a little butter . Normally it would be served with boiled floury potatoes . Traditionally ( in Ireland ) you would n't have a sauce with it but a parsely sauce ( as stated in the other reply would be lovely ) or simply serve with some strong mustard or a brown sharp sauce such as HP . You could also shred the ham and serve it with noodles in a hot broth with some shredded cabbage and other vegetables . The ham is going to be centre of attention - salty , rich with a sweetness . The cabbage and potato are happy bedfellows as the cabbage cuts through the saltyness/sweetness . You do n't want strong flavours competing with the ham and neither cabbage or potato will .
It is not only sane , it is safer than any other packaging you can make . At least here in Germany , meat from the supermarket is not just wrapped in celophane , the celophane is glued to the tray . The packaging is air-proof . And the air inside the packaging is not normal air , it is a mostly sterile atmosphere with a composition different from normal air , which hampers bacterial growth ( I think it has lowered oxygen content , but I 'm not absolutely sure on that detail ) . This means that 1 . no bacterial contamination is possible after the meat has left the packaging plant , and 2 . the bacteria already present in the meat when it was packed grow slower than normal . So if this is your type of package , do yourself a favor and leave the meat in it . I have n't frozen such packages , so I do n't know how big a problem they have with freezer burn . But it may become a problem in the long term , as the moisture from the meat will sublimate on the inside of the celophane . If this is not the type of package you get , and you have just plain clingy film wrapped around meat and a styrofoam tray ( I 've seen other products wrapped this way , but not meat ) , there is still no problem to freeze in it . The pad full of meat juices ( this is not blood btw ) is a good feeding place for bacteria , but the meat itself is as least as good as the pad , so you wo n't be reducing the risk if you remove it . By leaving the meat in the original package , you reduce the risk of additional bacterial contamination during transfer . And no other container will offer better food safety . You can still consider a transfer for reasons other than food safety . First , you can portion and/or preshape the ground meat before freezing , and then you 'll have to repackage it . Second , if the package is not tight enough , you risk freezer burn . But if these do n't apply , it is probably best to leave it in the original container - this is convenient , and not dangerous at all .
The truth is , there really is no good way to reheat such sandwiches . The bread will have gotten soggy while the sandwich was in the refrigerator , and the densest part ( which requires the most energy to get hot ) is on the inside . The option which is probably the least poor is to use the microwave , as more of the energy will be transmitted to the filling directly than with other heating methods . This is still likely to leave the bread kind of mushy and rubbery . Your best option is to only buy the size of sandwich you want to eat , or to split one with someone . Note that you mentioned store bought subs . If the sandwiches are homemade , there is a good answer : do n't assemble them until you want to eat them . You can then toast the bread , and heat the filling separately , and then combine them , and thus have a very fine sandwich .
In professional smoothie/frozen youghurt/fruit shake shops , you 'll usually see the fruit frozen in small pieces for easy portioning . So raspberrys and blueberrys are fine , but you 'd wnat to quarter strawberrys and cube mangoes or apples or kiwis or whatever before freezing them . The freezing process itself is important to the strucutral integrity of the fruit , and will affect its texture . However , if you only want them for smoothies/blended drinks , that is n't very important . As a usage note , remember that a home freezer compartment is usually at -4 degrees Celsius , whereas a chest freezer ( deep freeze ) would more commonly be at -18 degrees . A good blender wo n't mind either way , but your lips might find it a bit cold . Also , you might find you can buy the fruit pre-frozen from the same vendors the shops get them , in which case it will be prepared for you , and all you need is to defrost and blend . Aside from saving you the work of peeling and chopping , their freezing process may be better , and it 'll probably end up being cheaper too .
<URL> Freeze Brazil nuts , or soak them in water for several hours before cracking . Stand frozen nuts with the point facing up and hit with a hard object , such as a hammer , to crack . Crack soaked nuts with a nutcracker . Place the nut in the grip of the nutcracker so that the seam of the shell is subjected to the direct force . Use minimum force necessary to split the shell when squeezing , in order to avoid crushing the nut kernel inside . Rotate the nut while squeezing so the shell cracks slowly . Extract the kernel from the shell . Allow the kernels of soaked nuts to dry for a few hours after cracking . Read more : How to Crack Nuts | eHow.com <URL>
Garlic flavors are soluble in oil , simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well . I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes . Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal . How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste . 5 tbsp of rice is n't much , for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough . With the garlic I grow I 'd add a few slices from a clove at most . Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards , The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain .
If you want to cure your fish ( basically a brine without moisture ) it is dependent on the thickness of the meat mostly . If it 's as thin as 1/4 " , it will take approximately 1-2 hours . If it 's more around 1 " thick , it could need 3-8 hours . If you use a dry-cure method you do n't have to worry about having too much salt because once you 're done , you just wipe it off . If done incorrectly ( ie . not enough time ) , you should notice a difference in the colour between the edge and the interior . Typically , the colour becomes more pale . The main purpose of the salt is to dehydrate the meat , not necessarily drying . If you use a brine , it obviously wo n't become dry .
Very high fat , thoroughly marbled ribeye is a good start , but there 's a fair amount of variation . The extremely thin slices are also not something that every butcher is accustomed to producing , but that should get you to the right beginning .
That 's the same method I would use . If you have a salad spinner you could try giving them a gentle spin in there first . They are sturdy enough ( unless they 're over-ripe ) that they should handle a gentle pass through it .
When making the slurry , stir cornstarch into cold water until it has the consistency of cream . This can be set aside until it 's needed , but be sure to stir it briefly before you pour it into the sauce to redistribute the starch granules in the water . You should pour it into your sauce toward the end of its preparation . According to McGee you should use roughly 2/3 as much starch as you would flour . If you are n't using a recipe , add your slurry a bit at time until it 's a thick as you like it . Also remember that the sauce will thicken a bit as it cools , so it should be a little bit thinner on the stove than you intend to serve it .
My preferred method by far would be heating them in a pot along with some kind of sauce . Failing that , I think I might try putting them in a tightly covered pot in the oven along with just a little water ( just a tablespoon or so ) -- that would gently heat them and also keep them moist .
An oven is the way to go . Toasting on a frying pan is a pain because you have to stand there shaking it for so long and it is far to easy to scorch if you pause . I have seen some recipes call for low oven temps but I use 350F ( 175C ) for 10 to 15 minutes stirring a few times . Some sources online recommend as low as 5 minutes but I personally have not ever had them done that quickly . They still have to be checked or they will burn . I like to use my toaster oven because it heats up faster and is cheaper to run . I have used an air popcorn popper with good results . Do n't overfill it and remove them when they smell nutty . It goes very fast but you have to do them in batches if you have many . For a pie or other sweet applications , I like to toss the nuts in butter and brown sugar and let them candy in the oven . The fat makes it harder to burn them . Obviously this wo n't fit for all recipes . I personally have not had good results using the microwave . Some people swear by it but it seems to me to make them a little gummy .
Fine mesh sieve is the usual way , but the way you describe it , yours is not fine enough . Look in professional stores for a " chinois " , this is the kind of sieve you need . But yes , it will take a long time . In classic restaurants , the stock will be cleared before going through the chinois . This is done by floating a rack of eggwhite which bounds the stray proteins . It is at least as slow as the cheesecloth , but more nerve wracking , because you have to do it manually , and it is rather finicky and can easily go wrong . I remember reading about a modern trick of clearing which used gelatine and freezing the stock without a mesh or a rack , but do n't know any more what it was . Maybe somebody else has read it and can supply the details . Edit I returned home and looked the freezing method up ; it is listed in the book " Cooking for geeks " . It contains the sentence As the water in the stock freezes , it will push the impurities into the gelatin The book also has pictures . They show that you do n't end up with fine protein sediment clogging your sieve and finest slit in the stock . The first picture shows the drip-freeze filtered stock compared to the same stock filtered at 100 microns , the difference is large . The second picture shows that after the procedure , what stays in the sieve are cohesive pieces of gelatine with the particles trapped inside , not a film of the scum . So it seems that there is a reason for freezing first . For home use , I just do n't bother clearing my stock , I just use a tea sieve to remove the worst of the protein . When simmered without allowing it to boil , this produces reasonably good stock without all the fuss .
Do you have a large plastic container ? Something like this : . Use a non-permanent marker on the outside to mark the initial volume . A small diameter will make it easier to monitor the volume .
Room temperature for sure ! Eating something like salami chilled detracts from its flavour . Obviously you want to be a bit careful about leaving it out for a really long time , but I usually take anything I want to eat out of the fridge well before consumption .
There are two main types of charcoal , briquettes and hard lump . The first comes in preformed pieces , so they are all the same size and include a filler material . They will sometimes also have lighter fluid in them already and be " easy start " or something similar . Hard lump is just charcoal from hardwoods with no filler . These will usually be in all kinds of shapes and look like " natural " pieces of wood ( albeit in charcoal form ) . Hard lump is easy to light , burns hotter , and leaves much less ash than briquettes . It also has a better flavor . I strongly recommend hard lump charcoal . Wood is usually used to provide smoke as a primary function rather than heat . Smoking on your grill gives a lovely smokey flavor ( d'uh ) . The standard way to use wood is to soak it in water for a period of time prior to cooking . Packages will often say to soak for an hour , and that 's ok with wood chips which are very small ( but I recommend longer ) , but it is n't good for anything larger . I generally soak wood for at least 18 hours . Wood also comes in various sizes , from very small chips ( slightly larger than a coin ) to large chunks bigger than a fist . The smaller the chips , the less heat they provide and the faster they burn up . These are generally better for shorter smoking times . Large chunks can smoke for 12 + hours if they are properly soaked . In both cases , I put the wood on to already burning coals to get them going . You can also use just wood to create your heat , in which case you do not soak the wood . When you hear about woodfire ovens , this is what they do . However , I think this is a hassle as it 's harder to get the wood lit than charcoal and does n't provide as much smoke since you have n't soaked the wood . So it 's really sub-par in my view . The exception is if you are doing low and slow smoking on some types of charcoal grill , you can use a small bed of coals to light large chunks of soaked wood . Once they get smoldering , this becomes the only source of heat as the coals go out . They smolder hot enough to get new wood going if you find you need more . Great for 12 hour smoking at 200F for Boston Butt or Brisket . In terms of wood , you want hard woods with low amounts of resin / sap . No glue , nails , etc. . It wants to be natural . This is a <URL> of types of wood and the smoke they produce . Common woods for BBQ in the SE US are hickory , mesquite , and cedar . I 've used old wine barrel chunks which have a really nice flavor , and also bits of rosemary branch ( thick from a large plant ) which did n't turn out as well as I 'd hoped . You can even use the shells of nuts like pecans . This is really a question of seeing what 's readily available and experimenting with your own personal taste . You can also use wood with a gas grill by putting it in a smoking box or tin foil with holes in it , and placing directly on the heating element . Wood chips work best for this . I 've never had much luck with this though . It 's hard to get the chips smoking and , more importantly , gas grills do n't have the airflow through them to properly move smoke over the food . I switched to charcoal pretty quickly and a <URL> about two years ago , and I 've never looked back .
Cut the sprout end off . Place the cut end on the board , slice the onion in half vertically ( i.e. place your knife on the root and cut down ) If the outer skin layer is nice and thick , pull it off from one corner . Repeat on other half . If the outer skin is papery , pull it and one layer of onion flesh off from one corner . Repeat on other half . If the first layer of onion flesh is slightly dimpled or has a kind of matte finish , it 's probably turning ' skinny ' . Strip that off too .
I would think that USDA would err on the side of conservative when it comes to safety , especially with no financial interests in the equation <URL> Perishable foods should never be thawed on the counter , or in hot water and must not be left at room temperature for more than two hours . Even though the center of the package may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter , the outer layer of the food could be in the " Danger Zone , " between 40 and 140 ° F -- temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly . When thawing frozen food , it 's best to plan ahead and thaw in the refrigerator where it will remain at a safe , constant temperature -- at 40 ° F or below . There are three safe ways to thaw food : in the refrigerator , in cold water , and in the microwave . They 're all covered in the above link , but here 's the fastest one since it best meets your requirement of reasonably quick results : Microwave thawing When thawing food in a microwave , plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during the thawing process ( bringing the food to " Danger Zone " temperatures ) . Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present would n't have been destroyed and , indeed , the food may have reached optimal temperatures for bacteria to grow . After thawing in the microwave , always cook immediately after , whether microwave cooking , by conventional oven , or grilling . Foods thawed in the microwave should be cooked before refreezing . And when all else fails : Cooking without thawing When there is not enough time to thaw frozen foods , or you 're simply in a hurry , just remember : it is safe to cook foods from the frozen state . The cooking will take approximately 50 % longer than the recommended time for fully thawed or fresh meat and poultry . From personal experience , I prefer the cold water method to microwave for fast thawing , but I rarely if ever use a microwave anyway so others on here might have techniques that minimize the flavor/quality downside of it . The factors that make the microwave method less safe are what also lower the quality , taste and texture of the food -- the unevenly thawed parts , over-cooking some of it while undercooking other areas , etc. .

Cooking peanut butter cookies , is there any adjustment using crunchy vs. creamy ?
Nope . For peanut butter cookies it 's just a matter of taste , and it 's 1:1 .
It means the butter is made from cream that has n't been fermented . Butter made from fermented cream is known as " cultured cream butter " , and it has distinct sour , lactic acid notes . Sweet cream butter tastes , well , sweet , and if it is from really good fresh milk you may be able to taste grassy notes . Both are good in their own way .
Crepes were made long before teflon was invented . I use a quality steel pan and non stick spray . I reapply the spray every 3rd or 4th crepe to avoid sticking . Everything else is temperature control . If your temps are too high then the crepes will toast and burn before they set on top . If the temp is too low then they are more prone to sticking . It takes some trial and error and the first few are usually wrong - I eat those . The temperature is always very low though - between low and medium-low on my stove .
If you want something storebought , just get pumpkin puree - it is squash puree , not really even a substitute . Pumpkins are squash , and " pumpkin " is a pretty broad term , covering a lot of winter squash . In fact canned pumpkin is often made with things more similar to butternut squash than what you 'd think of as pumpkin ( jack-o ' - lanterns and all ) . Just make sure you do n't accidentally get some kind of pumpkin pie mix that has spices and maybe other things added . I suppose if you ca n't find that either , you could also look at baby food , since squash is fairly common there . If you really ca n't find anything in the store , though , do n't just give up on the recipe . It really is incredibly easy to make - just cut squash in half , throw in the oven cut side down , bake until it 's soft , scoop it out and mash up a bit . The actual active working time is only a couple minutes , and you 'll probably get much better flavor than you would from canned goods .
While all of these are large pots ( or may at least come in large sizes ) they have different purposes , which lead to differences in typical construction . Saucepans are intended for general purpose cookery , and usually have solid construction , and permit searing in the pot , reducing , and a variety of other tasks . They are the most difficult to characterize as there is tremendous variation in quality levels and design among the products available . Stock pots are purpose built to make large quantities of stock . Since they are not used for searing typically , and liquids circulate via convection making hot spots not a priority , they are typically constructed from thinner metals ( steal or aluminum ) and do n't have good general purpose cooking qualities . The main virtues in a stock part are low cost , size , and light weight . Dutch ovens ( at least real Dutch ovens ) are a legacy from the time when cooking was done in hearth or campfire . They are designed to be nestled into the coals or embers , with more coals or embers placed on top of the lid , creating a hot oven like interior -- thus the name . True quality Dutch ovens will be fairly thick , usually cast iron , possibly enameled , and may have little legs to help nestle it into the fire above the coals ; similarly , a the lid may actually fit into the pot , allowing coals to easily be piled on top . Dutch overs are actually fairly versatile cooking implements , and can serve for searing , roasting , braising , stewing , biscuit making , soup making , and even some bread applications even in the modern kitchen . Many are large enough to make stock in for home purposes , although they are not absolutely ideal for the task . You will have to ask yourself , given your own cooking patterns , would the general versatility of a dutch oven , or the size of a stock pot serve you better . None of the sets you linked to has a true dutch oven , however ; the one that purports to be a dutch oven has a glass lid ! It might be an okay pot , it is not one I would ever choose . For stainless steel products ( without the specialized legs and concave lid to nest coals in ) , there is very little difference between a dutch oven and a very large sauce pan .
Sure , just roast them in a pan with oil for few seconds , not long enough to darken , and remove the nuts . As soon as you remove the cashews from oil they are sticky , then you need to sprinkle salt on it . Do n't add much -- add slightly , checking the taste , and then mix according to the taste you require .
The only way that the butter could be incorporated without creaming would be to melt it . Melting butter , or allowing it to get too soft , even if just left at room temperature too long will result in what I call " pancake cookies " ... those that just spread out and run all over the baking sheet . This is also the reason that butter should NEVER be softened in the microwave . Creaming butter and sugar aerates the butter with tiny little air pockets . The reason it becomes lighter in color is due to the air that has been incorporated . The moisture inside the air pockets from the butter itself to eggs , milk , etc. turns to steam and the steam ( aided by any leavening that might be called for in the recipe ) helps the cookies to " puff " . If you do n't cream the butter and sugar you 'll most likely have very poor results . The expense of the wasted and ingredients and your time would be enough to pay for an inexpensive hand mixer .
The answer , quite simply , is no . Even advanced laboratories have difficulty making the determination for certain . This is also a complex problem that gets more difficult as various standards are used and then fail . Before 2000 , a common solution was to simply use microscopic analysis to look for pollen and and other vegetable matter . Since then , many honey processing plants have been developing increasingly advanced filtering techniques that will remove the characteristic markers ( deliberately or unintentionally ) . [ ** See detailed note below . ] Various chemical or basic physical markers also have proved insufficient , since the sugar composition of honey can be faked quite well with various sugar syrup blends . The accepted standard these days , as mentioned in the question , seems to be to use a mass spectrometer to determine the <URL> in a rather specific lab procedure . ( Obviously most people do n't have a mass spectrometer at home . ) The current procedure for this test was adopted after previous lab tests were shown to <URL> in some batches of honey . The isotope ratio method is the only one specifically listed in the FDA 's <URL> to determine the possibility of adulteration : FDA laboratories do not have the instrumental capability to analyze honey according to the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International , AOAC Official Method 991.41 , which requires an isotope ratio mass spectrometer . Ironically , in order to avoid the previous false positives for the New Zealand honey mentioned above , the new testing process <URL> , a process which has also been used to hide the origin of honey and to confuse analysis : To eliminate a false positive C ( 4 ) sugar test for Manuka honey , prior removal of pollen and other insoluble material from the honey is necessary to ensure that only the pure protein is isolated . But even a refined isotopic methodology is flawed when it comes to detecting various types of adulteration , specifically beet sugar . As <URL> notes : [ Using isotope ratios from a mass spectrometer , ] adulteration using C4 sugar syrups ( HFCS and GS ) could be detected to a certain extent while adulteration of honey using C3 sugar syrups ( beet sugar ) could not be detected . Adulteration by using SS ( beet sugar ) still has a serious detection problem , especially in countries in which beet is used in manufacturing sugar . So , what 's the alternative ? Well , the other general method that could detect various adulterating components is <URL> ( DSC ) . <URL> gives a good summary of the process , which essentially looks at how a material behaves as it undergoes thermal changes . At certain temperatures when crystallization or something occurs , there will be excess heat absorbed or given off compared to at other temperatures . And at other points there will be minor changes in heat capacity ( i.e. , the amount of heat it takes to alter the temperature of a substance by a specific number of degrees ) . Honey , for example , displays a glass transition temperature ( Tg ) around -40 ° C ( -40 ° F ) near a certain point in crystallization . Other sugar syrups may not show this , but they may show changes at slightly higher temperatures ( still below freezing ) , due to water crystals freezing or thawing . ( Water is included in the sugar network in honey , so it does n't show the same characteristics . ) There are other thermal properties that can be measured at various temperatures . As <URL> summarizes in its conclusion : Used concomitantly with the second enthalpy of fusion ( occurring between 40 and 90 ° C ) , the glass transition temperature , Tg , is one of the most potentially useful parameters for characterizing honeys and syrups and for distinguishing between them . The Tg value , being strongly dependent on the amorphous phases of the sample , will respond to modification of the chemical composition and the implicit structural modification caused by the addition of exogenous material . Thus , adulteration of the honey will cause inevitable changes in both Tg and [ delta ] H2 values . Under laboratory conditions , adulterations by industrial sugar syrups can be detected from 5-10 % additions depending on the measured parameter . I would pay particular attention to this final sentence -- the differences can only be detected " under laboratory conditions " where precise temperatures and amounts of heat can be measured . To replicate such a test at home , you 'd need to be able to add a certain precise amount of heat to the honey at subzero temperatures , all the while keeping it isolated from other sources of temperature fluctuations and observing where the heating " stalls " briefly . Then , you 'd have to calibrate your homemade test against some known samples ( syrups , 100 % honey , etc. ) just to be sure you 're actually observing the same things as in the article cited here . You 'd need to confirm that by observing a more subtle difference in heat capacity changes that would occur in hot temperature ranges
I would store them outside , not inside the fridge . Fridge temperatures make anything containing flour go stale quickly . Of course , sometimes people have to live with it , such as when they have made a cake with perishable icing or filling . But cookies are not perishable , so they are better stored outside of the fridge . As to whether to put them in a sealed container or not , it depends on the cookie . The harder type does all right in the air , and can get flaccid in a sealed container . If they are soft , they are probably better off covered . It is still preferable to not isolate them completely , a canvas bag or a bread box with ventilation slits does better .
As Sobachatina said , it 's cooked like many grains , and behaves very similar to rice . You could try continuing the steaming method , and if it does not get done by the time all the water has turned to steam , start it with a bit more water . Sobachatina 's suggestion of a tight lid is also worth considering , but pay attention to the pot then , so you do n't get it boiling over . An alternative is to use a boiling method . With or without toasting it first , add 3.5 parts of water to 1 part quinoa . Cook until soft , and put through a sieve to discard the superfluous water . The upside is that , unless you are using too high a temperature , there is no way to burn it .
There 's limp and then there 's limp . As the celery ages , it will get more and more limp ( and more bitter ) , and eventually neither delicious nor safe . If you 're sweating the celery and it 's a little less than crudité crisp it should be fine . Just sample it first to make sure it 's not too bitter .
With chicken and turkey , the most important " trick " to cooking it is to make sure the dark meat gets done before the white meat dries out , and to make sure the skin crisps up somewhat . Duck is all dark meat , and has a thick layer of fat that must be rendered out . There is not a lot of danger in drying out the breast meat like with a chicken . Like Martha said , it 's best to make a few shallow cuts in the skin over the breast ( do n't go all the way through to the meat ) to help the fat render out . A simple ( western ) roasted bird would be cooked at 350 & deg ; F for about 1 hour 45 min , with the oven turned up to 500 & deg ; F for another 15 minutes to crisp up the skin . There is a LOT of fat rendered out , so it 's best to roast in a sturdy roasting pan , on a rack ( so it does n't sit in the fat ) , and drain the fat about an hour into cooking ( save the fat , though ; it 's delicious ) . Personally , I think duck is easier to cook , but it 's definitely different from roasting a chicken .
I am answering my own question with information I have gathered after doing some of my own research . Several hand mills claim to make peanut butter , but the mill that seems to have the best public following and reviews for flour making , the <URL> , does not claim to make peanut butter in their marketing literature . I contacted the manufacturer , and got this reply : We do not recommend doing nut butters in our mill . However , we are applying for patents on a nut butter attachment for the Country Living Mill that does a superlative job . . We hope to have it available by this Fall . We have noticed that other grain mills on the market claim nut grinding ability and even show butter coming out of their mills . We have purchased these mills and tested them and quickly realized that it was an arduous task at best to produce anything resembling nut butter ... we can do the same with out mill but feel that it is misleading and certainly unfair to make such claims . Hope this helps . Of course their answer has every reason to be biased , and not tell me if there is a good peanut butter hand press available on the market . Another popular press , the <URL> claims to make creamy peanut butter with their stainless steel burrs , and one Amazon <URL> agreed it was possible , but too messy to be worth the effort . Reviews of two different griners at <URL> seem to agree with the general consensus that hand-made peanut butter is n't the state of the art ( yet ) : The nuts would n't feed , so I had to mash them into tiny bits . At this point the bits began to feed into the grinding plates . Unfortunately , those bits never exited -- even when I loosened the grinding plates . The only peanut butter that I managed to produce was the goo stuck between the plates . -- <URL> And : My test with peanuts resulted in the grinding plates clogging almost immediately , and I produced only a few flecks of peanut butter during the five minutes of grinding . Many companies claim their handmills will grind nutbutters and oily seeds , but I 've yet to see one that was n't a miserable failure in actuality . -- <URL> I have not been able to find a single first-hand account of making peanut butter with a hand mill that said it was worth it . As already mentioned , the amazon review mentioned above said it was far too messy . Many other reviews I 've found have said the end result only vaguely resembled peanut butter -- and never creamy peanut butter . In an effort to directly answer the question at hand , though , the only feature I so far have been able to find that is required specifically for peanut butter is that the mill have steel burrs , as opposed to stone which are desirable for finely ground flour , as the stone will absorb oil from nuts , causing the system to clog . EDIT : I got an additional reply from the Country Living Grain Mill manufacturers , explaining ( in no great detail ) what is required for a nut-grinder : There are a number of factors such as the mill must reduce the nuts to a manageable size prior to grinding , and propel them with enough pressure to be squeezed out between appropriately designed grinding plates . It sounds simple , but the reality is that it 's a very tricky thing to manage .
Many people have strong opinions on when to apply a rub -- some say to allow at least a few hours and preferably overnight . Others literally apply it as they are putting them in the smoker/oven . Since people do it both ways and both claim to end up with terrific , moist ribs , whatever effect this might have is probably small . It may change aspects of the " glazing " effect that a rub might give , depending on what is in the rub . A rub left on for a longer period will become more mushy and more like a paste or a glaze/sauce , while a rub put on fresh before cooking wo n't have time to become as moist . You will get slightly more flavor penetration with a longer rest , but there are diminishing returns there too after the first hour or two . I do n't have experimental evidence to back this up , but I think the " early rub will dry things out " argument is pretty flimsy from a food science perspective . It is true that rubs which contain significant amounts of salt , sugar , or other hydrophilic substances will cause some moisture to come out of the meat . On the other hand , most people tend to cook ribs for quite a few hours anyway ( and some smoke them for many hours ) , so the rub will have plenty of time to draw out that moisture regardless of whether you put it on ahead or time or right before cooking . It 's not like you 're salt-curing the meat and leaving the salt on it for months . Once the salt ( and/or sugar ) draws out the moisture from the outermost thin layer of meat , it generally takes much longer for moisture to migrate from inner parts of the meat . That surface layer of meat will release most of its moisture within an hour or so after you put salt or sugar or whatever on . So , even if you put your rub on immediately before putting it in the smoker , that moisture will tend to be drawn out in the first part of the cooking time . Adding a few more hours or even overnight to the rub should n't result in significantly more moisture loss from the meat 's interior -- and the exterior will always dry out a bit as it cooks anyway . Moreover , you are n't generally draining away moisture from the surface . With ribs , you often have them wrapped up to rest , which means the meat sits in that moisture . And guess what ? About 10-15 minutes in , the brine produced by the moisture combined with the salt in the rub will begin to break down the outer muscle structure of the meat and cause it to absorb more moisture than usual , so much of that liquid lost will be reabsorbed back into the meat within an hour or so . ( Note that the <URL> with some of the other spice compounds which are in the rub , so there is perhaps some flavor advantage to applying the rub at least a little in advance . On the other hand , again this mostly affects only the outermost layer of meat , so more than an hour or two probably wo n't make more significant changes in the flavor . ) If you 're talking about searing a steak , when you salt it might have some impact , since you generally <URL> at the point at which moisture is being released at the maximum rate . But for ribs or anything with a long slow cooking time ? It 's really not a big issue . As mentioned above , the larger effect will generally be what happens to the rub as it sits on the meat for many hours . You may find that the change in texture there may change the final appearance or texture of the outer surface . But the idea that the interior will dry out significantly ? It does n't seem likely .
Paneer butter masala , malai kofta gravy and matar paneer are part of the North Indian cuisine where the base is mostly the same with some minor variations ( like excluding cumin seeds ) . So essentially , you have a common base gravy for sweeter dishes like these and then you have a spicier gravy for other dishes . Many Indian cuisines have this pattern for example , Gujarati cuisine will have red chili powder , turnmeric , garlic-ginger , mustard seeds , cumin powder , fenugreek , cliantro and jaggery , etc. as a general base with some additions-substractions as per the vegetable ingredients . Similarly , you 'll be able to find common base gravies across Indian recipes and cuisines . But when you say : " In addition - It seems to me that the same thing could be said about aloo gobi , channa masala , baingan bharta , and many other dishes - Basically the same frying of onions , ginger garlic paste and tomatoes , but with a different ingredient added at the end ( for example eggplant for baingtan bharta ) . " You are making a gross generalization which will not help your cause . As per the regional tastes these recipes will vary too much , specially Baigan ka bharta , this dish is signature dish and needs a seasoned hand to deliver it right . So , you are right when you say there is a common pattern across recipes . But beware of certain dishes like aloo gobi which will exist in different forms across the country . But rest assured Malai kofta , panner butter masala and matar paneer have only the north indian style of preparation .
I 'll bet the rent that they were n't baked completely dry . Moisture made it to the crust overnight as happens with crunchy bread crust going leathery .
Ca n't comment on the nutritional side of things , but the main reason I can think of for not always including it is that it has a slightly different flavour . A much more intense lemon flavour is provided by the zest while the juice has the more tart elements ( and of course water ) . If you 're just interested in avoiding waste , you can freeze the zest .
The only one that could feasibly handle it would be the grinder . However , in the manual <URL> on page 5 it states " Note : Very hard , dense foods such as totally dried homemade bread should not be ground in the Food Grinder . Homemade bread should be ground fresh and then oven or air-dried . " If dried , dense bread is too much for the grinder then peanuts would definitely be to much as well . My recommendation is to use a food processor .
A few things that can help , if it 's not an issue with fat like @Aaronut suggested : Tomato paste . Yes , I know it 's a sacrelige , but it 'll act as a thickener . Take the pasta out before it 's gotten to al dente , and finish cooking it in the sauce ; the pasta will absorb any extra liquid , and help to thicken the sauce . Do not rinse off the pasta after you drain it . Way too many people do , and it washes off the starch that you want for the sauce to bind to the pasta properly , and may introduce extra water .
Authentic flour tortillas use lard . For an authentic taste , use that , or consider using shortening or butter since they are solid at room temperature like lard . You also might want to consider increasing the fat in your recipe . Fat will coat the proteins of your flour and keep the gluten network from forming so easily . I was also taught when making tortillas to let the dough rest for an hour after kneading and before rolling/pressing . This helps everything relax . After cooking each tortilla , put them in a pile with a clean towel over them . The tortillas will sweat liquid , helping them to soften up . You can also put them all in a heat-safe bag ( paper or microwave safe plastic ) for sweating . When storing your tortillas , make sure to store them in a bag and not in the open air . If your tortillas are too small , you should be able to roll out a larger piece of dough . Part of the texture issues might actually be from you rolling them too thin . If you are used to working with dough your ideas of thin might be different from the overstated ones found in recipes . Try rolling to various thicknesses .

When smoking is temperature consistency more important than exact temperature ?
When you approach the low end of the low-and-slow cooking methods , a concern that is normally not an issue in faster cooking methods starts becoming important : how long will it take the food to get to safe temperature ? You want the food to be above 140 F ( 60 C ) for the entirety of the cooking process , for safety , although having that happen instantly is not possible . Therefore , you want the temperature to get to that threshold as quickly as reasonably possible , especially for the surface of whole cuts of meats where the greatest risk of pathogens are . Therefore , I would urge you to err on the side of caution and safety , and use the extra coal at the beginning of cooking until the food reaches at least 140 F . Once it gets out of the danger zone , and into the safe zone , you have much more freedom . However , barbecue is far from exact . I would not worry about a 10 or even 15 F disparity . Your final outcome will likely be indistinguishable . Still , once the food is safe , if you wish to allow the temperature to be somewhat lower , that is the time to do so .

This question is a little vague , but probably your temperature probe is lying to you , or you 're not accounting for resting your meat . I would suggest a legit thermometer rather than one that gives you hints about the meat -- you 'll have more control over the final product . Temperature Guide : Medium Rare Beef has an internal temp of 145F / 60 Celsius Medium Beef has an internal temp of 160F / 70 Celsius Well Done ( ruined ) has a temp of 170F / 75 Celsius Remember that on resting your beef will rise roughly 10F / 12C in the middle as the heat distributes . So , if you pull the beef out at 160F / 70C , it will be well done by the time you eat it . If you want Medium Rare , pull it out at 135F / 55C .
The texture and yield is governed two factors : developing the gluten completely and washing out the bran and starch effectively . To develop the gluten , combine the flour and water into a workable dough and give it 50 light strokes . Cover the bowl and let it rest 10-15 minutes . It is during this time that water chemically combines with the flour and the strands of gluten form . After resting , return to the dough and you will notice it has a different feel . It is because the gluten has formed . Knead the dough 100 times . Immerse the finished dough in ice water or at least very cold water for at least 30 minutes . An hour is better . To effectively wash out the bran and starch it is essential to work the dough under alternating hot ( as hot as your hands can take ) and cold water baths with 30 minute rest intervals each time you change the water . Start with hot , work the dough with a spreading motion for a few minutes . Pour the water into a bucket ( not down the sink ! ) , cover with very cold water and let it rest 30 minutes . Repeat and cover with hot water . Let it rest 30 minutes each time . Usually during the third round the dough will very soft and your hand technique should become one of gathering instead of spreading . If it feels like you are on your way to pancake batter , pour it through a fine colander to gather the gluten and give it a cold water bath . In the last couple rounds it will become increasingly firm and the strands of gluten are evident . Finally you have a ball about 1/3 the size of the original dough . I divide this into baseball sized pieces and drop them into a boiling pot . Return to boil and cook until the pieces float to the surface . Remove and put in cold water . The shape of the pieces is now set but they are n't yet fully cooked . From here cook in a broth seasoned to your liking . I simmer them for 2 hours in a simple kombu , tamari and water broth . I use fine ground whole wheat flour . Stone ground will work but yields are lower and texture is inferior . My dough formula is 2600 gr fine whole wheat flour and 1900 gr cold water which produces 2000 gr finished seitan . Hope this is helpful !
The consistency of royal icing depends on many things , including the size of your eggs , but also the humidity/weather . So if you know what stiffness you want , it 's perfectly valid to add sugar until it " feels right " . ( I usually make royal icing with meringue powder rather than fresh egg whites , which removes one variable from the equation [ the size of the eggs ] , but I still have to adjust the sugar to get the right consistency . ) As far as troubleshooting , if you 've been whipping away and it 's still gloopy , by all means add more sugar . If you overdo the sugar , you 'll know immediately : it 'll be too stiff to mix . ( In which case , depending on the quantities involved you can either just add a teaspoon of warm water , or you can whip up another egg white separately until soft peaks form , then fold it into your icing . )
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
The collagen in the ribs needs to get to a temperature of about 160 F to start breaking down into water and gelatin . If your oven can be set as low as 175 or 180 F on a normal bake or convection bake setting that is probably a better alternative unless you have access to an oven thermometer and can measure what temperature the warm setting on your oven attains .
The purpose of using a low simmer during stock-making is to avoid agitating the liquid . You want the fat to settle on top , but a rapid boil will simply disperse the fat and other impurities all throughout the stock , resulting in - as you 've hinted at - a cloudy texture and possibly an inferior taste . The other reason to avoid boiling is simply to prevent the stock from reducing too much . If you 're simmering for 6 hours , you could lose all the water . If you leave the stock unattended during that time , and the water level drops too low , then you 're not getting anything out of it ; the water needs to be covering the bones in order to break down the collagen . All that said , once you are finished with stock , you should have skimmed it and strained it through a fine sieve and probably a few layers of cheesecloth as well . If you 've made your stock correctly , it will be clear and have ( almost ) no fat . Boiling it briefly at that point is n't really going to harm it ; there 's not enough fat left to cloud the stock and you 're not boiling it for long enough to really reduce it . So I would say go ahead and do n't worry about the temperature . As far as I know , nothing magical happens at 180 ° F , that 's just a rough temperature guideline for " low simmer " .
Seconds , not minutes . Just the act of pouring the water will cool it slightly . At sea-level pure water will be 100C at a full boil , the temperature will drop immediately when it 's no longer being heated . This is unscientific at best , but just for giggles I put an accurate digital thermometer into a room temperature mug , and brought a couple of cups of cups of filtered ( not distilled ) water to a boil in a saucepan . I poured the water into the mug and held the thermometer in the center of the mass of water . In the time it took for my thermometer to stabilize on a reading ( 30 seconds ) , the water was at 92C . I repeated the mini-experiment using a hot mug that I had heated by boiling some water in the microwave , and pouring it out just before I poured in the boiling water from the saucepan . This time after the 30 seconds it took my thermometer to stabilize , I got 96C . I 'd say that just by doing this ( with a warmed ceramic teapot ) , you 'd have your 96C if you moved quickly .

The ideal temperature for whipping cream is between 35 degrees F and 50 degrees F ( 1 2/3 degrees C to 10 degrees C ) . In order to maintain this temperature , you may want to chill your bowl and beaters in your fridge until cold , but you should be able to whip cream just fine as long as you do not let it rest once you remove it from the fridge . Above 50 degrees F ( 10 degrees C ) you wo n't be able to whip your cream .
I 'm culling a lot of information from one of my <URL> for this one . Yes , limes have a slightly higher acid content ( on average ) than lemons do - about 6 % for limes , compared to 4.5 % for lemons . More importantly for their flavor , lemons have about 2 % total sugar , while limes have somewhere between 0.5 % and 0.75 % . Sugar/sweetness has quite a suppressive effect on the perception of sourness , so lemon juice will most likely taste a bit less sour than lime . The composition of acids in the two also differ . The acid in lemon juice is almost entirely <URL> , which also makes up most of the acid in limes . However , limes include about 10 % each of <URL> and <URL> which have an effect on their flavor . Malic acid is most recognizable as the sour flavor from tart apples and rhubarb . About succinic acid , Wikipedia states : It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness , bitterness and acidity . Personally , I think the difference is perceptible in beverages , but less so in cooking . Culturally , lime would most certainly be the traditional choice for Latin American cuisine . Lime is much more readily available in Central and South America ( three of the <URL> are located there ) . How the difference in acid content would contribute to the browning of avocados is more questionable . EDIT : Here 's <URL> , suggesting that <URL> ( vitamin C ) is more effective at preventing avocado browning than citric acid . Which is an interesting wrinkle , because lemons contain significantly more vitamin C than limes do ... EDIT 2 : And along comes Jolenealaska , with <URL> that seems to undermine the entire assumption that acid reduces browning of avocado at all ! Seems like the real secret may just be keeping your avocados either uncut , or refrigerated and tightly wrapped if you have to cut them ahead of service .
What happens to bread when it is done Yes , there is something particular what happens at a temperature in the mid-90s . Not all details of it are proven , but the major outline is , and the hypotheses about the details are solid enough to make it into textbooks . Starch is contained in tiny granules , a few micrometers in diameter . When heated in the presence of water , there is a specific temperature at which these granules burst . The molecules of starch come in contact with water and the water molecules get lodged in the nooks and crannies of the much larger starch molecules . This process is called gelating . You can observe it easily on the macro level . Just cook a bechamel or starch pudding on stovetop , stirring constantly . The liquid will stay rather thin until all will thicken at once , just before you see the first bubbles of boiling . This is when the starch gelates . The same thing happens in bread too . This is why you want to heat the bread to this temperature . If you do n't , you will have raw starch inside , which does n't taste well . The exact temperature at which this happens varies a bit with the type of starch . It is not the same for rice and wheat , for example , and I think that it is also a bit different between different wheat cultivars . But the range within this variation occurs is not so wide , all references I have seen move somewhere between 94 and 98 degrees Celsius . So the recipe author just picks a temperature he knows to work for the flour used in the bread , maybe also accounting for some additional heat transfer after taking out of the oven . Can you use temperature as an indicator for doneness The theory says yes . My personal experience also says yes . Why did you feel that your bread was too doughy ? There are different reasons why this could have happened . You could have measured it wrong ( with the probe being too close to the surface , where the temperature is higher ) . You could have cut it too early . ( Bread is always doughy before the first starch retrogradation , which occurs maybe 1 hour after baking ) . It is also possible that the bread was actually done in the sense of gelled starch , but that the recipe produced a rather moist bread and that you have grown accustomed to dry breads if you normally bake your breads for a very long time , so your brain perceived the unaccustomed texture as " not right " . Or it is possible that something went wrong with the leavening , making the bread too dense . Dense bread is always doughy , you can not bake the moisture out of it . technical criteria for bread doneness There are two big chemical changes which happen to bread while baking . The proteins in bread ( the gluten ) have to harden . Before that , they are soft and pliable . At some temperature , they become rubber-like . The hardened gluten gives the bread structure . The second change is the starch gelation I explained earlier . When this happens , the liquid part of the dough ( dough consists of a liquid phase suspenede in the elastic gluten mesh ) thickens . Gelated starch gives bread a fluffy , soft body . As the starch gelates at much hicher temperatures than proteins denature , bread is taken out of the oven when the starch is done . The third step is the starch retrogradation . In retrogradation , starch loses the water which it took during gelation . There are three big stages of it , after each the texture changes drastically . The first happens at about an hour after getting out of the oven . This is when the bread is considered done by textbooks . In practice , there are many people ( including myself ) who like the taste of the moist hot bread just out of the oven , and they consider it done at the previous step . The second happens after about 24 hours ; after it , the bread is considered stale . The third step takes several days , and after it , bread is considered inedible , because it becomes hard as wood . So technically , bread is considered done after it has been baked to gelation temperature and then left alone for 1 hour .
Iron is simply an element , so it can not be destroyed by cooking ( or generally temperature changes ) , as vitamins and other organic structures potentially can . Cooked spinach inevitably has a much lower water content , thus the relative density of all other components must increase . So gram for gram , it makes sense that cooked spinach should have a higher concentration of iron ( and possibly some other things ) than raw . However , the actual process of cooking does nothing to change the amount of iron .
The limiting case would be a pot that is only emitting energy via thermal radiation , because it is ( in the imagination ) perfectly insulated and so not losing heat into the air via escaping vapor through the lid , or conducting heat through the pot material into the air . In that case , the energy loss from the pot is only that of the black body radiation , which is a function strictly of temperature . Energy radiates away at a faster rate at higher temperatures . Even if you relax these stringent imaginary conditions , all heat engines are based on a temperature difference . All of the heat loss mechanisms on the pot ( such as losing heat to vaporization , or conduction through the surface of the pot into the air ) are also driven by temperature difference between the contents of the pot and the surrounding air . The larger the difference , the faster the transfer on an absolute basis . So yes , maintaining a higher temperature in equilibrium requires more energy per unit time than a lower one . But you would need someone far better at physics than me to give you the absolute mathematical models .
When you 're determining the doneness by time , you 're doing it wrong :) There are too many differences between individual fish to go just by weight , thickness , oven temperature , and time . The best way is to measure the internal temperature ( stick a thermometer into the thickest part of the fillet ) ; I like about 120 F ( 50 C ) for salmon ( carryover cooking raises the temperature a little higher after taking it out of the pan ) , but then it has to be good quality fish . You need to check early and often , because it can go from undercooked to overcooked fairly quickly . Now , like zanlok says , my experience is mostly with pan frying , and I 'd expect using the oven would be a bit slower than using a pan because of slower heat transfer ; so you should be a bit safer . If you do n't have a meat thermometer , an easy way to test fish for doneness is to look for translucency . Salmon can still be just a little translucent in the middle . Also , properly done fish flakes along the natural " seams " . Another nice trick ( which does n't work for boneless fillets - sorry ) is to find a bone in the thickest part of the fish : if it comes out fairly easily , then the connective tissues have mostly dissolved and it 's done . That leaves the temperature for your oven . I would go with very high - that way the fish gets the least possible time to dry out ( which is going to be a big risk with this cooking method , I would think - unless you wrap your salmon in bacon or something like that ) . At a guess , I 'd try 450 F ( 230 C ) .
I 've done it before without problems . Even if they 're peanut butter &amp; jelly ( something that 's typically stored in the fridge ) , it has so much sugar in it that it 's inhospitable to microbes . If you want to play it extra safe , and the sandiwiches wo n't be easten shortly after you leave , you could place them in the freezer and then let them thaw in your bag . ... all that being said , if you 're in the US , the TSA considers peanut butter to be a gel , so wo n't let you fly with a container of it . I have no idea what their rules are in sandwich form . ( I 've never tried it , as I typically fly w / cold cut sandwiches , and just take them straight from the fridge before I go ) .
I do n't think you are looking for a specific temp ( i.e. ; crack or soft ball stage ) after adding the citrus since you have already " contaminated " the syrup . My preferred recipe is from Epicurious.com ( <URL> ) . I have used it twice with great results and am going to be making again very soon for the holidays .
First off , there 's not a lot in the ingredients you list that is likely to pose a hazard anyway . ( It is possible for flour to be contaminated with bacteria , and if the bacterial count is high enough , it could pose a risk in raw dough . ) However , pasteurization to safe levels at 160F does n't take more than a few seconds in most foods , and it 's likely the interior of your loaf was above 130F ( where bacteria will gradually start dying off ) for quite some time . I 'd definitely consider it safe to eat right after baking , though it may not be particularly pleasant . However , underdone bread sometimes is prone to earlier spoilage , since it generally has a higher moisture content that might promote some mold , bacterial , and yeast growth after baking . The chances of it becoming actually hazardous without noticeably spoiling are probably rather low , but it 's possible , particularly if the moisture content is high enough . It 's much more likely that the bread would just spoil normally through the appearance of surface molds , etc. , though . If you wanted to be extra cautious , you could store leftover bread in the freezer or fridge .
The USDA recommendation for a safe internal temperature is 165 degrees for chicken . The breast , being leaner , should n't be cooked to any higher than that or it will dry out and be tough . The thigh can be cooked to a slightly higher temperature ( 165-175 ) . That is the Kitchen Network 's preference for taste and texture ( <URL> ) . Getting the thigh to a slightly higher temperature ( and keeping it there for longer ) helps the collagen break down , which will make it more tender and taste more moist .
Go for 145 . 2 hours . Salmonella dies even at " low " temperatures ( from 135 ) as long as you cook it for longer . 135 for at least 87 minutes , will kill salmonella . However , I like it best when cooked at 145 for 2 hours .

Can I store extra pizza dough in fridge ?
Yes , you can store it for about a day in the fridge . Let it warm up again before you cook it though .
What Tim said . Eggs just do n't hold very well , and they are very sensitive to temperature -- reheating them basically will mean re-cooking them . I would never store eggs in this manner , because the texture and flavour degradation will make them unpleasant to eat . However , to actually answer your question -- and again , I urge you not to do this because stored and reheated eggs will taste like garbage -- cooked eggs should keep for up to 72 hours in the refrigerator . Remember to chill them as rapidly as possible after cooking , and you may wish to undercook slightly in order to minimize problems when reheating . I would use 72 hours as an absolute maximum , particularly if you are undercooking . 48 hours is probably wiser .
Your metal bowl sitting in your 70 ° F room is 70 ° F ( at least , if its been sitting there for a bit ) . Your plastic bowl , or glass bowl , or ceramic bowl , or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70 ° F. They 're all actually the same temperature . Now , given , when you touch the metal bowl , it feels cooler than the plastic one . This is because your finger is n't 70 ° F , and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than ( say ) plastic . If the dough is room temperature , it wo n't matter -- heat is n't flowing out of it . The dough itself does n't generate much heat . If your dough started above room temperature , it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl . But , if you wanted to keep it from cooling , putting it in a warm place is much more effective . A stainless steel bowl is fine . I 'd avoid aluminum ( and copper , if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing ) due to them being reactive , especially if you 're making sourdough .
make waffles ! that 's what we do with ours , besides bread . sourdough waffles with syrup have this great sweet/sour balance going on that is really wonderful .
I ended up skipping the parchment paper . I had 6 small-medium pizza worth of dough , and padded all pizza-dough with semolina , as well as padded peel with semolina prior to each slide-in-to-oven . Prior to first pizza I put some semolina on the steel in the oven ( though it might 've been unnecessary ... yet to confirm ) All 6 pizzas turned out great , with quality crust . It was n't really messy , might 've been two three burnt spots , simply before the steel cooled off , I grabbed a wooden cooking spoon , lightly scratch , and pushed it out onto another plate . Update Confirmed you do n't have to add anysemolina flour or anything to the steel , pizza wo n't stick .
Apples are best stored at 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) at 90 % humidity . If you do n't have a cellar , you 'll have to try to recreate that environment as best you can . The closest you can come in most small apartments is actually a plastic bag with some holes poked in for ventilation ( to prevent excess moisture from building up ) . Then put that in the refrigerator to get close to the correct temperature ; the best location is the vegetable crisper where you have control over the humidity . Do n't overpack them , though - about 80-90 % full is the densest you should go . Also be sure to pick only the best apples you can find if you plan to store them long-term . Over-ripe apples will obviously not last as long , and any bruising or piercing will speed up the decay significantly . Edit : If it 's a large number of apples then you can store them in a crate , which provides adequate ventilation , but good luck getting that into the refrigerator . I would still separate them into plastic bags , put whatever I could in the crisper , the rest in the fridge " proper " , and put out any that I intend to consume within a week or two in a regular fruit bowl out in the open . If that 's still not enough , then you probably need to accept that small apartments are n't very well-suited to storing very large amounts of fresh food ; just because they 're easy to get , does n't mean it makes economic sense .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
My guess is that you do n't have real cheese in your sandwich . I 've seen this before with things called cheese that were really types of <URL> . It happened when then product was exposed to moisture that it seemed to absorb , which then caused it to turn soggy and glue-like . If you 'd have said that you had tomato in your sandwich , I 'd have been sure this was what was going on .
If you make the base neutral - a typical Neopolitan dough would do - you could use white chocolate shavings to give an appearance of cheese as well . I would keep the amount light . While looking to verify this idea , I found a <URL> that gave me a few more pieces of inspiration . Instead of carmelized sugar banana slices , try dried fruits ( strawberries , sweetened cranberries , raspberries , etc. ) for your toppings . These will look like sausage bits or pepperoni . You can also use pineapple and make it look like a Hawaiian pizza . You could also use <URL> as a white sauce or as some of your cheese for a richness that is not too sweet .
The USDA recommends storing hard boiled eggs , whether peeled or not , for 1 week . I personally have kept &amp; eaten them after 2-3 weeks . I have also cracked one open that was no longer edible &amp; believe me - You will know when that happens ! The egg will will smell rotten &amp; you will have no question as to whether or not to eat it ! Some additional Info on storing eggs : Eggs should be stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees F , mainly to reduce the chances that any bacteria on the shell will multiply and cause a risk of illness . Buy refrigerated eggs and store them in the refrigerator as soon as your get home . However , even under refrigeration , eggs slowly lose carbon dioxide , which enlarges the size of the air cell and causes the yolk to flatten and the white to spread . Fresh Egg - Refrigerated raw shell eggs will keep without significant quality loss for about 4 - 5 weeks beyond the " sell by " date or about 3 weeks after you bring them home . Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days Fresh egg yolks ( unbroken and covered with water ) - 2 to 4 days Deviled eggs - 2 to 3 days Leftover egg dishes - 3 to 4 days
Unless your fridge is above 40 F ( 4 C ) , it wo n't go bad . I 've had large frozen turkeys take 4 days to thaw before . Just use it once it is fully thawed , do n't let it sit around thawed for several more days . There 's no food that I 'm aware of that goes bad in the time it takes to thaw it . The stilltasty link below shows 3-5 days for refrigerated meat , and 4-6 months for frozen . Transitioning from frozen to thawed though , I generally count on defrost time + 2-3 days . If you want to thaw it faster you can always use the cold water method . Simply place it in a sink full of cold water ( submerged ) and change the water every 30 minutes . The rule of thumb for turkey is 30 minutes of thaw time per pound . I imagine pork shoulder would be similar , maybe a little longer ? Additional Info : <URL>
Yes , store them individually . First , wrap them tightly in plastic wrap , preferably one that says it 's specifically for freezer use . Then wrap this tightly in aluminum foil . They 'll keep for months without freezer burn this way .
Phyllo dough , in particular , comes in several thicknesses , from the thinnest which is used for baklava up to horiatiko ( country ) style which is used for rustic pies . You can substitute , but there is definitely a noticeable difference and I think you 'll appreciate why a good traditional recipe calls for a specific type . Saveur has a <URL> . Also , keep in mind that although phyllo is very thin and tends to tear , in many cases a small amount of tearing is no problem . You are making multiple layers and any small imperfections will disappear . Just be sure to keep the pieces you are n't currently working with covered so they do n't dry out too fast . For wonton wrappers , they are also often available in at least two thicknesses in good Asian groceries . Again , there are traditional uses for each . When using them in a non-traditional context such as ravioli , you 'll have to decide for yourself which you prefer .
Since my pizza dough recipe makes three 12 " pies and I usually make two at a time , I regularly freeze extras just as you did . To thaw , I have used both the countertop and refrigerator method . Thawing on the countertop produced the best results . The dough rolled as usual and the crust ( a thin one ) was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside after baking .
I 'd say your problem is that the yeast has exhausted the food in the dough before you even get the leftover dough in the fridge . When you pull it out the next morning , the yeast does nothing or very little because there are no more sugars left for it to eat . And not only will this prevent rising , it will also limit browning because it 's at least partly the sugars that brown in the oven . You could work some more flour ( and water , to maintain hydration ) into your dough as yeast food -- maybe even a little sugar if you want -- and then rise/form/rise and bake . But at that point you 're doing what @tmow suggests -- just using your pizza dough as a starter for new bread .
Short answer : storing food in an open can is normally safe for a short period , but inadvisable . Longer answer : There are three main issues with storing foods in an open can . They are metal oxidation , contamination , and funk . Oxidation . As commenters have observed , cans used to be made of tin , which is toxic . Modern cans are made from either steel or aluminum . If the contents of the can are acidic , cans are lined with a polymer ( plastic ) inner layer . If that layer is broken -- say , by a major dent in the can or by using a knife to scrape out contents -- then the acid can get to the metal and , over time , corrode it , and some of the now-oxidized metal will dissolve into the food . As far as we know , the oxidized metal is not toxic , but it tastes horrible . Contamination . Any open container of food can become contaminated when an airborne water droplet ( tiny -- microns wide ) containing a nasty microbe drips or settles into it . The major biological culprit here is Listeria , which can grow in any moist environment , including spaces refrigerated below 40F ( 5C ) . Also , if juices from your raw meat drips onto an upper shelf , which later gets wiped inadvertently into your container of ready-to-eat food , you are likely to get Salmonella or E coli . This risk can be mitigated if you keep your raw meats on the lowest shelf , but not eliminated . Also , it is worth noting that contamination through this pathway is a relatively rare event -- but even so , it is not worth the risk . Funk . Have you ever put an ice cube in your beverage and notice your beverage tastes strange ? The chemical compounds that give food their flavor tend to be volatile ( meaning they will readily leave the food into the surrounding air ) . Also , the mustiness of a refrigerator/freezer is due to volatile compounds produced by mold and mildew . Foods that are wet and/or fatty can be molecular velcro to these compounds .
Since it is a custard , you should probably refrigerate it as soon as it is cool . A very sugary or acidic custard may be able to resist bacteria for a couple days ( see Bismark donuts ) , but unless the recipe was specifically developed to be stable at room temperature , then there is some risk of it going bad . If you have a fridge , there 's no reason not to use it . It may make the dough a little soggy , so you will want to find a way to store it to reduce condensation . Better yet , make just as much as you are going to eat/serve at one time , and do n't worry about this problem . <URL> <URL>
You can use small amounts of cheddar mixed with the other cheeses . But you 'd be disappointed in the results if you tried to use it as the main or only cheese on the pizza . Cheddar cheese does n't tolerate sustained , high heat as well as some other cheeses . It can scorch , which tastes and smells bad , and/or the fats can separate from the solids as a yellowish oil . The sharper the cheese is , the less well it will tolerate heat .
For a chewy pizza base , use bread flour . Do not use oil . Bread flour has a higher protein content that will help gluten form . Gluten makes the connections that keep dough together . Fat inhibits gluten formation . A recipe of just water , flour , salt , and yeast mixed , kneaded , allowed to rise until doubled , and then rolled out will get you what you want . Make sure to roll out quite thin . Preheat your oven absolutely as high as it goes with a stone inside . Put your toppings on maximum one minute before they go into the oven so that the sauce does not make your dough soft . Place pizza on preheated pizza stone - cooking time at high temperatures will be quite short ( max 10 minutes ) .
There are 2 ways of looking at it ; how long it will be safe to eat ( ie from food poisoning ) and how long it will still be appetizing and taste alright ( ie not gone rancid ) . As you 've taken it from the tin it wo n't get that tinny flavour but as time goes on may absorb other flavours from the fridge so make sure you keep it away from anything that is strongly smelling . Also as around 87 % of the coconut milk is fats it will soon go rancid , so keep that in mind , ( you 'll know when it does by giving it a quick sniff ) . In terms of food safety , if it 's UHT which most are , then it could probably last for a long time ( as long as UHT milk ) so about 2 1/2 weeks I 'd say . Otherwise if it 's not UHT then not as long . I would say about the same time as fresh milk so around a week as it contains sugars and fats and so is a very compelling proposition for any bacteria .

What are the types and pros/cons of electric and manual spice and nut grinders available ? What qualities should be looked for while purchasing them ?
No one device , manual or electric , is ideal for all of the tasks that you have enumerated . Many cooks will have more than one tool , depending on the job at hand . Some spices , particularly cinnamon , are very difficult to grind effectively at home without leaving fibrous bits that may give an unpleasant mouth feel . Of course , when infusing flavor from a whole stick of cinnamon , this is not an issue . Bottom Line I would recommend having at least a Microplane type grater for ginger , garlic , and so on , and a rotary type electric grinder for most hard spices . For the specialty task of making peanut butter , a blender is probably your best tool . Morter and Pestle Also known as a molcajete , is probably the most versatile , but most labor intensive spice grinding tool . Can grind , mash , or mix both dry or wet items , so it is suitable for garlic and ginger ; still it is most effective on very hard , frangible spices which can be crushed , or soft items like garlic which can be mashed . Fibrous spices like cumin can be very difficult to do . Lots of work Only suitable for small quantities Microplane style grater A grater with very fine , usually etched , openings is suitable for some tasks including : Garlic , gingner , galangal and the like Nutmeg Nutmeg Grinder A specialty item , just for nutmeg . Most nutmeg grinders actually make very fine shavings , but it is essentially the same thing . They also have storage for nutmegs . Blender Electric blenders are suitable for some grinding tasks : Making peanut butter Grinding soft spices or making wet spice mixtures , as with garlic , ginger , capiscum type peppers Some high quality blenders may also do a decent job with softer seeds like cumin seeds . Electric rotary grinder These are often marketed as coffee grinders , but they are extremely effective as spice grinders -- however , due to lingering flavors , you want to devote one to either coffee or to spices . Suitable for dry spices , such as cumin , black pepper , allspice , mustard seeds , and so on . Not very effective for the hardest spices , such as cinnamon . Note that clove oil ( also found to some extent in nutmeg ) can cloud plastic parts over time . Pepper Grinder As the name implies , ideal for black pepper , but also effective on other small spices that can fit through the mill such as mustard seeds . Also provides a small quanitity of storage . Most permit the grind size to be adjusted . Specific Questions Which kind of grinders allow water in them for making a paste of the spices ? Mortar and pestle , and blenders are suitable for pastes . However , you can also grind your dry spices , and then add them to a wet mixture to create a paste . Is there some maximum and minimum capacity for each of the type of grinders ? Most home style devices are suitable only for very small quantities . The nutmeg and pepper grinders are good for teaspoon type quantities , and rotary grinders up to a few tablespoons . Blnders have much higher capacities , but may not be effective except with very soft or frangible items . Peanut butter is one application that they do well with in larger quantities . What are the types of manual grinders which do not require too much amount of manual power/effort ? They all require significant effort . For spices used in very small quantities , such as black pepper , that may not be noticeable . Which kind of grinders allow us to have a fine powder of spices rather than bits ? None of the home methods will produce the very fine , even powder that you might expect from a commercial spice house . They have extremely high quality , sometimes specialized equipment , and they also sieve or screen the resulting product to ensure it is uniform , and to exclude larger bits . Some spices are more suitable for home grinding than others . Ones that you should have little trouble with include black pepper , nutmeg , allspice , mustard seed . Spices that are very difficult to grind at home include cinnamon . Cumin , one of the most popular spices , is easy to grind , but difficult to get a perfectly smooth and uniform powder . It tends to have little threads and fibrous bits . In many applications this is not noticeable .
From a food safety perspective , the most important thing is that you get your leftovers cooled as quickly as possible , so that they do n't spend too long in the <URL> . This can be tricky , because you essentially have to move from cooking temperatures to refrigerated temperatures within two hours ( generally less because the time is cumulative , and includes time that the ingredients spent in the danger zone before you cooked them ) . Here 's what I do at home : Separate into smaller portions . For me , this usually means individual servings , but you can package 2-3 servings together ; the point is to avoid having a single large mass of food . I do this for a couple of reasons . First , it makes reheating convenient ; rather than heating up more portions than you 're going to be eating , or scooping out a single portion for separate reheating ( dirtying some extra dishware in the process ) you can simply grab as many portions as desired and go . Second , by separating the portions you are increasing their surface area , and therefore how quickly they will cool ( another reason I like individual servings is that it maximizes this effect ) . This is a basic trick from my restaurant days ; experienced professional cooks will know that to cool a large batch of soup safely , you need to either get the whole thing into an ice bath , or break it down into smaller portions . ( A thrifty tip here : you can use dedicated plastic or Pyrex food storage containers , but commercial containers are cheap and effective as well . There are all kinds of <URL> and <URL> containers intended for food service that are microwave-safe and which can be safely cleaned in the dishwasher . You 'll often have to buy them in bulk , but per piece they 're very inexpensive , they tend to stack very well , and if you 're lucky you can find a decent local takeaway or delivery place that uses them instead of styrofoam . Save whatever you get , wash them , and reuse . It 's possible to ruin these with excessive heat , but they 're so cheap that it 's not too much of a loss . ) Allow to cool on the counter , uncovered , for 10-20 minutes . The goal here is simply to let steam escape ; water carries a lot of thermal energy with it ( which is why you can easily burn yourself over a pot of boiling water ) and letting it get away will cool your food rapidly . The portions do n't need to cool completely at this point ; if they 're warm but no longer actively steaming , that 's fine . Put the portions in the refrigerator . As @Jefromi notes in comments , <URL> , and a lower external temperature will help your portions cool quickly and safely . Where possible , it 's ideal to leave these uncovered and spread out into a single layer so that they will cool quickly . Quite honestly , this is n't always practical , so if you need to cover and stack the portions due to space constraints , cool them a little longer on the counter before putting them into the fridge . Freeze the portions if you 'll be storing them for more than a couple of days . <URL> ; if you need to keep them beyond that , the freezer is your friend . This does n't work well for everything , but hearty foods like pastas will often freeze reasonably well . Reheat thoroughly in the microwave . For all that serious cooks might discount the microwave , it 's a very effective and efficient reheating device . ( Especially if you follow my advice about using microwave-safe plastic containers ; if you use something like Pyrex that 's oven-safe , you could certainly use that too . ) Make sure you heat everything so that it 's evenly hot ; this may mean stirring a couple of times . Overall , it 's most definitely possible to safely store leftovers , so long as you cool them quickly and reheat them thoroughly . Not only that , but I heartily endorse the practice . Leftovers can be practical , tasty , and a serious time saver . There 's no reason to be paranoid about them if you embrace a few simple rules .
A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element . A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat , similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb . An induction stove does n't actually generate heat itself , but rather induces it the pot or pan . It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field . This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat , thus heating the food . Induction stoves are faster , safer , and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves . It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up . They are safer because they do n't actually generate heat themselves . After taking a pot off the " burner " ( glass surface ) it quickly begins to cool . With regards to differences in the cooking process , there 's not much . You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove . It does affect your choice of pans however . All aluminum pans will not work , nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones . If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine . The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface .
The problem is , the mass produced chicken most of us are used to does n't taste like chicken . The expression ' tastes like chicken ' is therefore used for most anything that 's not particularly assertive . There was an episode of Food Detectives , <URL> where they served a few different meats to professional chefs ( Alex Guarnaschelli and Aarón Sanchez ) , who had problems identifying all of the meats they were being served ... I ca n't remember exactly what all of the results were , and I ca n't find a transcript ; I remember Alex being distraught when she realized she was eating guinea pig ) . And the cooking show <URL> had a regular segment of ' name that meat ' , where he 'd have hot dogs , or jerky , and try to have people guess what they were . ... Part of the issue with substitution is going to be something that has similar cooking characteristics , but that you do n't have a reaction to . ( I 'm actually surprised that you 're allergic to chicken , but then listed other poultry ) Turkey 's likely the closest of the stuff you listed , particularly if it 's the mass produced stuff , it 's going to have a similar lack of flavor that most chickens sold in the US has ; duck tends to be richer . I have n't had any game birds recently , so ca n't comment on the pheasant . Alligator I 've only had a few times , and the only time in the last decade it was deep fried , so the meat did n't come through . ... For substitutions , it 'd depend on how you 're cooking it , and what part of the bird . For instance , in place of chicken wings , I might consider frog legs . ( although , it 's probably been 25 years since I 've had 'em , but I seem to recall them being chicken-like ... I just ca n't remember if they were like white or dark meat chicken ) ... but they 'd be closer in mass than turkey wings . For chicken breasts , I 'd go with turkey breast cutlets , so they 're closer in size . For ground chicken meat , ground turkey will work , just check to see if a recipe calls for a leaner or fattier mix , and get the appropriate turkey . Chicken thighs and legs are a little more strongly flavored ... rabbit might actually work , or duck or pigeon if you have a source .
In the U.S. biscuits are made with chemical leavening , they use baking powder to cause them to rise . Rolls ( or dinner rolls ) are yeast bread . There are obviously other differences in the recipe ( s ) but baking powder vs. yeast is the essential difference .
The care of bamboo cutting boards is extremely similar to that of traditional wood cutting boards : Prime them with mineral oil , and refresh it every month or so . ( Wipe with oil , let sit for a while , perhaps 15-20 minutes , wipe off ) . Wash only with mild soap , and rinse and dry immediately . ( Wipe off and let air dry . ) Do n't put in a dishwasher . If using for raw meat , you can sanitize with a very dilute bleach solution ( about a teaspoon of liquid bleach per quart of water , 5 mL per liter ) . Rinse thoroughly afterwards .
Having taken a look around some recipe sites and taken the intersection of what most of them consider the " core " spices ( and leaving out the ones that showed up on too many ' variations ' lists ) , it looks like the canonical ones are : basil marjoram oregano rosemary thyme
I do n't think roasting spices " improves " them or rejuvenates stale spices but it certainly does change the flavor profile in ways that may be desirable in some cases , for some spices , less so for other spices in other cases . This is common sense to me and also what I got out of the article . I think the heading of the article is too absolute for the content . Whether or not dry-roasting is " better " depends on which spices and what you are doing with them - how long they will be in the recipe , what else is going in , etc , and what flavor profile you are looking for . I think the article goes into a lot of detail about this and has some good references ( it looks like an interesting blog , thanks for sharing . ) For example , fresh , dried coriander seeds do n't taste the same as toasted coriander , and fresh , untoasted , whole cumin does n't taste like toasted/dry-roasted cumin . If you add it raw vs dry-roasted , in general you are going to impart a slightly different flavor profile to the dish . Some recipes are complex and/or delicate enough that this matters , and as the article notes , this will be specified in recipes from trusted sources . If you are making an uncooked chutney that you want to season with coriander seeds or fenugreek seeds , you need to toast them before grinding them if you want them to taste cooked . Or if you are seasoning your raita or lassi with cumin , it will probably taste better ( or more like what would be expected ) if you toast it . But " better " really just depends on what you are looking for . The author of the linked article talks about what flavors she wants to impart to her squash soup , and that is great . If it 's her recipe and her tastes , she should make it how she will enjoy it . But if you are trying to replicate a traditional recipe , you may want to follow the traditional methods for that dish at least the first time you do it , which may or may not use the spice how you are used to using it , it 's even possible that the traditional way wo n't taste as good to you as using them how you 're used to . So again , that 's fine , adapt the recipe , with the understanding that it may be a bit less traditional . That 's how we end up with fusion cuisines , like Indian-Chinese , or British-Indian or American-Italian , adapting traditional methods to new ingredients or to differing tastes and preferences . For the most part , in my Indian cooking , I rarely toast spices before adding them in unless I 'm making something where it is n't going to be cooked further . I had n't heard or been told that you " always " should roast all spices before grinding them . In fact , most of the Indian cooks I 've learned from use pre-ground spices for convenience , and I sometimes get weird looks from people in my generation when I make things less convenient and start from fresh , whole spices instead of spice blends . My point here is that there is sometimes a difference between what is ideal for a dish vs what is ideal for daily cooking . Both the daily " easy " method and the for-special-occasions-only multi-step preparation can be equally traditional for what is ostensibly the same dish .
The simplest way to remove kidney cores is to cut the kidneys in half ( horizontally ) then snip the cores out with a pair of sharp scissors . With practice this can be done in two or three quick cuts .
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
If you need the eggs raw , you could submerge them in boiling water for 5 sec . That would kill any bacteria on the shell and the egg would still be raw inside . Put the eggs in cold water right away to prevent the egg from heating up by the residual heat in the shell . I have tried this many times and the eggs do not cook . If you are serving the eggs to very young children , pregnant women or someone who are sick , you should buy pasteurized eggs instead . But normally it 's safer to eat eggs from chickens you raise , than the ones from a factory , because they are more healthy and their immune system is well developed enough to kill the salmonella itself .
The primary purpose is for flavor . If it 's the expense of a large bottle for a few tablespoons here and there you should be able to buy the mini bottles ( as are served on airplanes ) from a local liquor store . If you do n't want to use or have it around due to issues with alcohol then look for other items that have as similar flavor to substitute . Sherry has a sweet nutty flavor to it and apple juice can often work suitably well . Keep in mind you 'll probably not find an exact flavor match but it can be close . A small amount of orange extract could be used in place of grand marnier . Depending on the item , you might also try flavored syrups that are used for coffee drinks . Remember that these have a lot of sugar in them so you 'll need to compensate by cutting back on sugar elsewhere in the recipe and obviously do n't use them where the sweet flavor would n't be welcome .
Id ' say availability , like others have commented on . If you have access to sea , seafood is an easy choice . You can not keep cattle high up in the mountains , that 's why goats and sheep are more popular in e.g. , Greece , where there are no plains for cattle to graze on . Chickens and doves are easy to keep and were cheaper than pigs or cows . Pigs are omnivores . On the one hand , they are happy in forest regions eating acorns ( which cows would n't like ) . Pigs also eat kitchen trash like potato peel and leftovers . On the other hand pigs compete with humans for food ( potatos , fruit ) . Other animals were primarily work animals ( dogs to guard , cats to catch mice , horses to pull carts and ploughs ) and were hence not eaten ( there are exemptions to this rule like Sauerbraten which was made from horse meat of horses that were too old to be used as work animals ) .
Consider what the " no cheating " version of the ingredient is , and get the closest thing to that , that 's convenient enough for you . For things like garlic , ginger , etc. , the " no-cheating " version is to get the fresh ingredients and crush/grate them - what you end up with is a paste . The paste you can buy in jars is this stuff , with preservatives added to make them last . Some flavour will be lost . To make powder , the paste is dried , and more flavour is lost . But the powder will keep for a long time in the cupboard . Note that some spices take on different , desirable flavours when processed . Paprika powder has its own properties when compared to fresh paprika peppers . You 'd use fresh ginger in many curries , powdered ginger in many cakes , candied ginger in some other sweet dishes . Recipes will specify what to use . For things like black pepper , cumin , turmeric , coriander seeds , the " no-cheating " version is to get whole seeds , roast them and grind them in a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar . So buying the ready-ground version is only one step away from the ideal . Try grinding your own at least once . The extra depth and complexity of flavour is striking . But for convenience , ready-ground spices are fine . " Roasting " , for small quantities of whole dry spice , involves briefly heating them on a hot dry pan . It brings out spice flavours you do n't get from just frying or boiling the spice . Of course , it 's optional . Ground spices have a shorter shelf life than whole dry spices . If you open a jar of powdered spice and it does n't have a strong aroma , throw it away -- you might as well use dust . Whole spices have the aroma " locked away " , to be released when you grind . To make a paste , these are sometimes mixed with wet ingredients ( like garlic and ginger ) , water and oil . That 's the basis of the jars of " spice mix " you can buy in supermarkets . It 's also the first step in many curry recipes -- grind your spices , mix with oil to make a paste , and gently fry before adding the onions .
I think Doug and yossarian both touched on the main points , but to summarize , there are four reasons why you might not want to use a meat thermometer for candy : Range A meat thermometer might go from 140 F to 220 F or something like that , which is plenty for meat . Candy often requires a range from about 75 degrees ( chocolate ) up to 400 + degrees ( hard candy ) . The range on most thermometers is simply not sufficient for most candies . Accuracy When you temper chocolate , 88 F degrees is an ideal working temperature ( for dark chocolate ) . Some people would consider 91 so high you might want to think about starting over . When you make caramels , the difference between 235 F and 240 F can be the difference between wonderfully chewy caramels and a sugar-flavored rock . If you ca n't read one degree increments at a glance , you need a real candy thermometer . Speed Meat thermometers often take 30 seconds to a minute to get an accurate result . When you are making candies , you have to be able to tell what the temperature is right now . Contamination I do n't want the thermometer that goes in semi-raw meat anywhere near my chocolate .
Agaricus bisporus is commonly found in two varieties a brown and a white variety both of them have a variety of aliases as you have already found out ... and the name portobella is used for mature fruiting bodies of both varieties . So you can find the brown variety in all sizes from tiny " button " mushrooms over closed and open small and big non-mature fruiting bodies to the big open mature portobellos . The brown-capped variety will be ( at least somewhat ) brown through all stages and the white-capped one will have a white cap through all stages . While maturing the gills will turn from white to brown in all varieties , as brown is the color of mature spores in this mushroom species . Anyway , your assumption is correct - that the chestnut mushroom is in fact a baby ( = immature fruiting body ) brown-capped portobello mushroom .
This is called fruit leather . But I have never made it and can not comment on how to make it less chewy . I have eaten it though , and if my memory serves me right it was quite chewy and it most definitely got stuck in my teeth . Maybe it can not be avoided . Also , if you are cooking it at a low temperature ( I assume you are well below the boiling point ) the sugars will not caramelize . ( EDIT : Apparently , sugars will caramelize at low temperatures , but it will take a long time , see the comment by jkadlubowska below ) For that , much higher temperatures are needed . You are simply drying out the purée to the point where it becomes " leathery " . From a bit of googling it seems that 140 degrees F is the correct oven temperature to use .
They are not equivalent cuts and ' should not ' be used interchangeably . Stir Fry meat is cut from the more tender cuts of beef ( tri-tip , sirloin , rib-eye ) and do n't require much time cooking to be ' ready to eat ' . Stew Beef is from less tender cuts ( the Chuck or Eye of Round ) which will become tender after a ' significant ' time braising ( cooking in liquid ) . That said ... the food police wo n't show up at your door if decide to interchange these , and using stir fry beef for stew is n't a terrible thing to do ... but you will likely not be happy if you try to switch the other way .
The good thing about Cumberland sausages is that the meat is supposed to be coarsely chopped and in of itself has a very high meat content . However , all good sausages have this quality also ! So in essence look for a sausage with a high meat content ( 80 % + ) and you ca n't go too far wrong .
Not too surprisingly given where you found it , it 's called an <URL> in most parts of the world . In Israel , it 's just called a chopped salad or ( according to the wiki article - I never personally encountered this ) an Arab salad .

Is there a difference between preheating temperature and baking temperature ?
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
They 're rather different . Gyros are Greek in origin . They are simply meat , tomatoes , onion , and tzatziki sauce on pita . In Greece the meat is typically pork ( never had one ) . In America , specifically here in Chicago ( their local origin ) , the meat is a combination of beef &amp; lamb . Shwawarma is Middle Eastern in origin . The possible toppings are much more diverse , and can include : tahini , tabouli , fattoush , cucumber , and hummus . Tzatziki is n't typically used , at least not in America . The meat is also never pork , it can be lamb , beef or chicken . They owe their similarities to their common Turkish ancestor the <URL> . See also : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Greek yogurt has more fat than a " normal " yogurt , about 10 % . Further an original Greek yogurt is made from sheep 's milk since there are n't many cows in Greece . This might taste a bit odd for people used to cow 's milk though ... When buying Greek yogurt made from cow 's milk I recommend you look out for the native brand <URL> .
In my experience the primary difference is that Calzones have Ricotta ( and possibly Mozzarella ) and Strombolis only have Mozzarella . In the Philadelphia area , both are folded over pizzas , basically . Growing up , my mother made Stromboli and it was rolled , not folded . I rarely see that in a pizza shop these days , but I do prefer that in a Stromboli . Edit : Just read systempuntoout 's link to Wikipedia and it confirmed something that I was going to post and then deleted . When I was growing up , Strombolis were made from bread dough and Calzones were made from pizza dough ; nowadays all of the pizza shops just use pizza dough . I remember bread stores as being the primary place to get Strombolis growing up because they were the ones that made the dough !
Normal double-acting baking powder makes CO2 ( thus giving a rising effect ) in two ways : when it gets wet , and when it is heated . Baking soda only makes CO2 when it gets wet . From Wikipedia : The acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting . [ 6 ] A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven . Baking powders that contain both fast - and slow-acting acids are double acting ; those that contain only one acid are single acting . By providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical , and this is the type most widely available to consumers today.to consumers today .

春卷 ( Chūnjuǎn , Spring rolls ) are julienned vegetables , sometimes with a bit of noodles , sometimes with a bit of minced meat , wrapped with a flour dough skin and pan - or deep-fried . They are a filled roll . You can see the different varieties by country here : <URL> Spring roll : 鸡蛋卷 ( Jīdàn juǎn , Egg rolls ) are many different things around the world . In Chinese communities , these typically refer to a sweet biscuit type roll , of hollow flaky egg pastry ( not filled . ) However , there is also another variety ( common in American Chinese cuisine ) where a flour dough wrap is filled with " pork , shrimp , or chicken , adding cabbage , carrots , bean sprouts and other vegetables , and then deep fried . " In the American Chinese respect , I believe it is very similar to a Spring roll really , although the flour dough looks thicker and of a different composition than a typical Spring roll ( the dough bubbles when deep-fried , with Spring roll skin it does not . ) <URL> Sweet egg roll : American Chinese egg roll :
The problem is , both Sarge 's and Carmi 's answers are right depending on who is using the word . Some people use the word seasoning to just mean salt , some mean salt and pepper , and some mean " anything you want to use to bring the flavor to the desired point , including salt , pepper , lemon juice , spices , herbs , etc. " If you are dealing with someone in person , it is best to ask . With a cookbook , sometimes you can figure it out from context or from other recipes . Otherwise , you 'll have to make your own best call . In my own recipes , I will generally write " taste and adjust seasoning , adding salt and/or more lemon juice as needed " .
I 've only heard of massaging kale . If you rub the greens together they get softer , darker and more tender and useable in a salad . Never done it with anything else . Wilted is steamed or blanched greens . Wilting definitely changes the texture and can make the greens more palatable and less bitter . I wo n't eat raw collards . I also always salt and squeeze my cooked spinach before using as it knocks out the bitterness .
The USDA recommendation for a safe internal temperature is 165 degrees for chicken . The breast , being leaner , should n't be cooked to any higher than that or it will dry out and be tough . The thigh can be cooked to a slightly higher temperature ( 165-175 ) . That is the Kitchen Network 's preference for taste and texture ( <URL> ) . Getting the thigh to a slightly higher temperature ( and keeping it there for longer ) helps the collagen break down , which will make it more tender and taste more moist .
The person who wrote <URL> , agrees with you on the 80-100 ° part . However , in his salmon recipe , he advices to smoke below 85 ° . So my guess is that it depends on the food you 're smoking .
Potato pancakes are held together , usually with egg , sometimes flour as well . Hash Browns are usually just the potato , maybe onion and seasonings .
When you are making blueberry muffins , frozen and fresh blueberries will give different end results . Frozen blueberries will almost " melt " when you bake the muffins , because the skin becomes more fragile after freezing . If you use fresh blueberries , they will be more intact after baking and will sometimes still " burst " when you bite into them . Which of these outcomes you prefer is entirely subjective ( though obviously frozen are better ) . As for the taste , some blueberries will have more taste than others . If they are grown out of season , they will most likely be flavourless . This goes for both fresh and frozen blueberries . I 've found a brand of frozen blueberries that I use for muffins that give a have a nice taste year around : others may be terrible . For the remark your wife made about frozen blueberries being rotten : I do n't know where you live , but that is most certainly forbidden in the US and Europe , and probably most places where frozen blueberries are available . That is the only part of her argument that was most definitely wrong . Everything else is subjective or depends on the specific brand of blueberries or even the time of year .
Jolenealaska 's answer provides the basics -- internal temperatures over boiling inside baked goods just do n't tend to happen under normal conditions . The reason is because most doughs and batters contain a lot of water . The final baked goods generally still retain a lot of that water , too . When the dough is hot and in the oven , however , that water will be heated and will gradually evaporate from the dough . Assuming you get to close to 212F/100C , at normal atmospheric pressure , water will actually be " boiling " out of the dough . For the external surface of baked goods , that moisture can leave rapidly enough that the surface rises to higher temperatures ( forming a crust ) . But internally , the moisture keeps boiling out , maintaining a temperature below or at boiling . Unless you have a weird situation where you are somehow cooking your baked goods under pressure , water will continue evaporating out of the batter/dough at 212F/100C until the dough/batter has pretty much turned into a dry cracker internally . That 's the only way you 'll ever achieve an internal temperature much over 212F/100C : to bake things until they are basically dried out inside ( which is not a desirable feature in most baked goods ) . As for the maximum useful temperature , that depends on the baked good and the ingredients . I have to disagree with Jolene slightly here and say I have a number of bread recipes that recommend an internal temperature of 205F or so . Temperatures over 200F are only generally for lean crusty bread doughs ( like baguettes or something ) , which often start with a fairly moist dough . The high internal temperature means that more moisture has been removed , which will keep the crust more firm and , well , " crustier . " The more enriched your bread dough , generally the lower the desired final temperature . Basically , above 175F or so , the gluten coagulation is complete and the dough structure is formed . So , bread can be " done " anywhere from 175F to about 210F . If you have a very rich sandwich loaf or brioche or something , you might find that a temp of 180-190F is sufficient . Large loaves may also need different temperature handling than small buns , for example , since residual heat will continue the baking process outside the oven longer in larger loaves , but it also takes longer for moisture to migrate out of the center of a large loaf . As for other baked goods , similar advice applies . Cakes and quickbreads are generally done once you get to around 190-195F , though the ingredients will really affect this . A " drier " style cake without lots of " stuff " in the batter ( e.g. , pound cake ) might go to 205F or even 210F before it 's " done " according to normal criteria , while a quickbread made with loads of fruit might " get stuck " in the range around 190-195F for a long time because there 's just so much moisture . ( And it 's basically done there anyway . ) For cakes or other baked goods which are meant to be excessively moist ( with a fudge interior or something ) , 175F might be sufficient , since again that 's roughly the temperature when baked goods get a final " set " structure . ( Of course , there are also things like " lava " cakes where the interior is not actually fully cooked ; in that case , internal temp should be determined by food safety criteria sufficient to cook the eggs , which might be a little lower . ) And again , shape and size are often important for these numbers , because residual heat will lead to further stabilizing of the structure in large things after they come out of the oven . So , a particular cake might be " done " at 195F , but making cupcakes with the same batter might require 200 or 205F to get the same texture . It 's hard to specify a generic all-purpose desirable maximum temperature , because various changes continue to happen to baked goods after the structure gets set at 175F or so . Between 175F and 195F , the starches continue to gelatinize and some enzyme activity will continue . Above 195F , it 's mostly about drying things out to the desired final texture .
In today 's modern culture and cooking style , the difference is likely unobserved . I would consider a stew less constructed than a casserole , however . While the stew would start with generally uncooked ingredients ( perhaps except for browning the meat , and likely be mixed together while cooking to give a single-dish of meat , vegetables and sauce . A casserole might include some cooked ingredients , often be more properly layered and probably not mixed while cooking .
It depends greatly on how hungry I am . :-) 350F for about an 60-90 minutes , depending on how many are in there . 425F for about 40-60 if I 'm hungry and impatient . Microwave on high for a few minutes ( few holes poked in it with a fork ) if I 'm really hungry and really impatient . They 're done when a fork goes in easily .
When you approach the low end of the low-and-slow cooking methods , a concern that is normally not an issue in faster cooking methods starts becoming important : how long will it take the food to get to safe temperature ? You want the food to be above 140 F ( 60 C ) for the entirety of the cooking process , for safety , although having that happen instantly is not possible . Therefore , you want the temperature to get to that threshold as quickly as reasonably possible , especially for the surface of whole cuts of meats where the greatest risk of pathogens are . Therefore , I would urge you to err on the side of caution and safety , and use the extra coal at the beginning of cooking until the food reaches at least 140 F . Once it gets out of the danger zone , and into the safe zone , you have much more freedom . However , barbecue is far from exact . I would not worry about a 10 or even 15 F disparity . Your final outcome will likely be indistinguishable . Still , once the food is safe , if you wish to allow the temperature to be somewhat lower , that is the time to do so .
If I remember correctly , flautas are made with a softer flour tortilla while taquitos are made with a harder corn tortilla . Both are filled with similar fillings and then wrapped and deep fried . However , you can oftentimes find taquitos made from flour tortillas and flautas made from corn tortillas ... so what 's the deal ? There is another differentiation : size . Flautas are often longer than taquitos , as taquitos are made from taco sized tortillas , while flautas are made from burrito sized tortillas . Another little tidbit if you go to a fancier Mexican place : flautas are often narrower on one side to create a funnel shape . But this is not common in your standard places . TL ; DR ; They 're oftentimes the same thing
There is a difference beyond just the price . All-Purpose flours are not the same : Southerners tend to make more quick breads , pies , cakes , etc. where tenderness is the primary quality factor . Southern brands of all-purpose flour such as White Lily , Martha White , Red Band , Adluh and others are typically milled from wheat that naturally has a lower gluten percentage . They also blend it to achieve an overall lower percentage . In addition , southern all-purpose flour is usually bleached , often with chlorine gas which weakens the gluten structure of the gluten in it and creates an acidic nature in the dough . Gluten does n't develop as easily in an acidic environment . On average , people living in the northeast/midwest tend to bake a lot more yeast-based products ( dinner rolls , cinnamon rolls , pumpernickel bread , rye , wheat , white , french bread , etc. ) which benefit from a higher gluten percentage . Northern/Midwest brands such as King Arthur , Hecker 's etc. tend to use wheat that has a higher gluten content for the milling of their flour and they typically leave it unbleached which allows the gluten to better develop during mixing/kneading . National brands such as Gold Medal and Pillsbury are being distributed across the country so they blend their flour to fall within the mid-range of gluten content . As for store brands , those that are national ( such as Kroger/safeway ) are probably being milled by the national flour mills and should probably perform about the same . If it 's a regional store brand ( such as Piggly Wiggly here in the south or Wegman 's in the Northeast ) I 'd be willing to bet that it probably falls within the scope of those regional types of milling practices . For a chart showing the range of gluten content for various types of flour from cake flour to bread flour ( including the all-purpose brands mentioned above ) see <URL> .
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
The <URL> page has an entry on this very topic . Basically , the color of the egg does not affect the egg 's flavor , nutritional value , etc. . It simply depends on the particular breed of chicken that lays the egg -- white eggs from white hens , brown eggs from brown hens . It 's also worth noting , as the ENC points out : Generally , brown hens are larger and require more feed and therefore their eggs may be slightly higher priced .

How to properly cook a kid ?
Older goat tends to have a very strong flavor , hence why many suggest braising in strong flavors . You can braise your kid following these recipes - just remember to use 3/4th the amount of strong seasonings as you would for a regular goat . As for grilling the meat , you could try to marinate the meat overnight with herbs and spices . Unlike chicken , which is a fairly blank canvas taste-wise , goat has a strong taste ( even kid meat has a slight gamey/goat-y flavor ) . As I said , if grilling , marinate . If you 're braising or stewing , toss in a beer , some mint or basil and a few other herbs . For the ribs - you could french them to get rid of some of the connective tissue and then marinate and roast them at low heat for a few hours to break down some of the connective tissue . Good luck and great eating !
If your chicken burns , the issue is likely not that you cooked it too long , but that you cooked it too hot . How long to cook it depends on the total amount of meat , the size of pieces that it is in ( anything from bite sizes pieces for a stir fry up to an entire chicken ) , and how you 're cooking it - oven , saute pan , braising ... Roasting in the oven or braising in a stew are generally the most ignorable techniques - if you overcook a roast it may dry out , but wo n't burn , and if you overcook a stew the meat ( especially chicken ) may dissolve into shreds but burning is less likely . Since undercooked chicken can be unsafe , you should choose cooking techniques that are sure to fully cook the chicken without burning it .
If you are intent on cooking the bird whole ( as opposed to butchering it into pieces which you can fry in a pan ) , then your only option would be to braise the bird in a large pot , preferably a <URL> . There are myriad recipes online ; <URL> or <URL> . As <URL> , the only other option to keep the chicken whole would be to use a barbecue/grill .
Eye of round is an excellent cut for braising . You can braise it in stock or red wine . An example recipe would be the classic Beef Bourguignon . It 's also a perfect candidate for slow-cooking in a crock pot , as well as simply roasted in the oven . If cooking it in the oven , use a thermometer and do n't cook it past medium . An overnight marinade can be used prior to roasting for additional flavor as well .
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
If you are looking to fry veggies then yes it is nessassary to pre heat . If you put them in a cold pan and oil you start ' sweating ' the veggies not frying them . For example : a sliced onion put into a pan with hot oil will cook and have a nice golden brown color as it caramalizes . Put that same sliced onion in a cold pan with cold oil and then add heat the onion first turns translucent and looses moisture . Both of these cooking methods have their uses , but they are different . How do you know when the oil is ready to cook ? It will start to shimmer a little before it reaches the smokeing point . put the vegies in when you see this shimmer , or at the very fisrt wisp of smoke .
I often use this technique at home to cook proteins . It shortens cooking time by using steam as a heat transfer medium to cook the top of the item at the same time as the bottom . You can also use this method on frittatas , dumplings , etc. . You can also use flavored liquids to impart flavor as well . I particularly like hard cider with chicken and pork .
Restaurants quite often cook pigs cheeks ' sous vide ' , but unless you have , or fancy investing in a water bath , you can do things the old fashioned way . How you prepare the cheeks for cooking will , to some extent , depend on which part you 're cooking . If you 're going to cook the whole cheek , you really should think about soaking in a brine of sugar , salt , vinegar and spices for 24 to 48 hours . If you 're just cooking the ' pad ' that part can be skipped . The thing to remember with cheeks , is they are quite a fatty meat and the muscle fibres are very dense , so whichever method you choose , it 's going to take time . One classic method is braising the cheeks with a variety of vegetables and something slightly sweet and sharp as a counter for the fat and cook in the oven for 2 to 3 hours at around 180c ( 350f ) Basically dust the cheeks in a little flour and season , then brown in some olive oil . remove form the pan and lightly sauté your vegetables , use leeks , baby onions , carrots , apples , garlic etc. add the cheeks pack to the pan , add some stock or stock/cider mix and cook . You could also do this on the hob ( cooker top ) in a heavy bottomed pan , but cook for 4 hours on a low heat .
Harrold McGee indicates in On Food and Cooking that soaking brown rice for 20-30 minutes can speed the cooking . However , he does n't give any specifics . In looking to what I consider highly credible cooking web sites , I have not found any definitive answers . Cook 's Illustrated 's recommended method for the fastest , best tasting brown rice ( no link since it is probably on the pay site ) is : Boiling the rice for our brown rice recipe until it is almost tender ( about 30 minutes ) , draining it , then steaming it until done ( another five to 10 minutes ) is by far the best stovetop method for brown rice . <URL> ( 50 minutes steaming , 10 minutes resting ) is quite similar . <URL> recommends baking technique which may be delicious but is almost certainly the one that will heat your house the most : putting rice in a casserole covered with boiling water , and baking at 375 & deg ; F for 1 hour . You have actually asked two different questions : What is the fastest way to cook rice ( duration ) ? What is the most energy efficient way to cook rice ( least heating of your house ) ? These are not the same thing . Something to consider : of all liquid non-metals ( and I do n't think any of us are going to cook in molten iron ) , water has the the highest capacity to transfer heat . It is going to be very difficult to find a way to cook rice that is faster ( at least for actual time cooking the rice , when not counting bringing water to the boil ) than the traditional pasta method , as often employed in some parts of India : Bring water to a boil , add the rice , cook until done , and drain . However , the energy required to bring all of the surplus water to the boil and the enthalpy of vaporization will make this fast , but not efficient . Your most energy efficient rice production method ( and this is by the very laws of physics which govern our universe is also the one that will add the least heat to your home ) is almost certainly a rice cooker , which will heat only until it senses the rice is done . ( Of course , what the rice cookers are really measuring is the rise in temperature when the water is all absorbed or evaporated , and so the temperature can rise ; therefore , starting with the correct ratio of rice to water is critical ) . The bottom line : brown rice takes time to cook . Some rice cookers , however , let you set a timer so that the pot will have the rice ready when you come home . This might be your best bet .
Dilute heavily by using a very small portion of peppers per dish Allow cooking time for the pepper flavor to permeate the dish before adding more . It 's not like black pepper where the taste spreads instantly . Remove the seeds and membranes holding them , as this reduces spiciness considerably Cut peppers very finely or puree so there are n't any large pieces to deliver a shocker in the final dish Wear gloves when handling the peppers If you do n't use gloves , wash your hands well before touching your eyes , mouth , or other " sensitive regions . " AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY , DO NOT FRY OR SAUTE THE PEPPERS . No , seriously . The last one is a mistake you only make once , and should be on a warning label with all store-bought chilis . The capsaicin somehow becomes volatile when heated enough , and the result is like filling your entire domicile with pepper spray . I am ashamed to say that the last two cautions are drawn purely from personal experience . It 's not the kind of " hot date " you want to share with an ( un ) lucky person , believe me .
The oil needs to be slowly added to the egg , vinegar , and lemon juice base while being vigorously whisked . Only add more when the previous amount has been fully incorporated . I generally add the oil 1/4 cup at a time , dripping it very slowly into the base . Once the initial 1/4 cup has been added and emulsified it becomes a lot easier to incorporate the rest , and you can add it slightly faster , but still 1/4 cup at a time . This is vastly simpler in a food processor . I have a <URL> which has a little white pusher piece with a drip-hole in it . You can simply add the oil into this 1/4 cup at a time , it will slowly drip into the mix . Use the metal blade attachment .
Your primary defenses against cross-contamination include proper planning in the order of what you 're cutting and proper cleaning between uses . In the case of your stew , simply cut the vegetables first and then cut your meat . Doing so in this order you wo n't need to wash the board between the vegetables and meat . If you want to expedite the cooking process , then either use a separate board for the meat first so that you can start browning it while cutting the vegetables , or simply wash and re-use the board . A good scrubbing with hot soapy water is fine for your knife and board ( including wood boards ) . As mentioned previously , if you 're still concerned about bacteria you can rub the board with lemon juice or vinegar which will kill any residual bacteria . Using separate boards that are relegated to specific meat vs. vegetable duty is n't necessary as long as you 're properly cleaning your boards . A board only used for meat items is just as liable to transfer bacteria to the next item being cut on it if it is n't properly washed between uses . That being said , if you 're properly cleaning them then it 's fine to cut vegetables on a board that 's also been used previously for meat . As for cutting boards , your best bet for the care and maintenance for your knives are either wood or composite materials ( usually a laminated product of paper and resin - " Epicurean " being a prominent brand . Never use a tempered glass cutting board or other hard surface ( granite , marble , Corian , etc. ) as these are heavily damaging to the edge of your blade and unsafe for you as there is nothing for the knife to bite and grip into and it 's much more likely to slip and cut you . Plastic cutting boards and mats are n't very good on your knives and the boards in particular are either too hard and dull your blade prematurely or are soft and end up with lots of cuts and grooves which then trap food . People often have a false sense of security with plastic boards believing them to be " non-porous " . As the board is used , food material ends up crammed into the cuts and grooves and while the boards can go into the dishwasher , that only removes the surface grime , not that which is impacted and over time you increase the potential for bacterial growth to occur . Wood boards ( including bamboo ) are much better on your knives but to maintain them in good condition you need to properly maintain them . Periodically , when they look dry ( kind of like chapped skin ) you need to oil them with mineral oil . The mineral oil you buy at your local drugstore or grocery store pharmacy is fine , no need to buy fancy " block oil " in gourmet shops . Do n't use vegetable based oils as they will go rancid and transfer the flavor to your food . I like to give the cutting board a heavy coating at night , let it soak in overnight , and then buff off anything that did n't soak in . This will keep your wood fibers soft and supple so that the board wo n't split and crack , the fibers will swell back together making it more " self-healing " as you cut on it , and the oil in the wood will repel liquids that would otherwise try to soak in . When a wooden board gets marred and nicked up you just need to take it to the garage and give it a good sanding before dusting off , rinsing and re-oiling . Do n't use bleach on boards ( plastic or otherwise ) as it will typically leave a distinct smell in the board .
<URL> Papyri from Ancient Egypt in 1555 BC classified coriander , fennel , juniper , cumin , garlic and thyme as health promoting spices ( 3 ) . Records from that time also note that laborers who constructed the Great Pyramid of Cheops consumed onion and garlic as a means to promote health . The <URL> appears to give history/origing for a large selection of spices .
Sausages are pretty forgiving . As long as you do n't burn them or leave the center raw , they should come out OK . Since they 're pretty fatty ( at least the good ones are ) there 's little chance of drying them out , so when in doubt , cook them a little longer . They 'll feel firm , not squishy , when they 're done . The easiest way to cook raw sausages is in the oven ( at 350-375 ° F , 180-190 ° C or so ) . If you 're doing it on the stove , I 'd brown them first in a little ( very little ) oil , then add some water , or beer , or wine , or whatever you happen to have ( not much - just enough to cover the bottom ) , cover , reduce the heat , and simmer until done . Feel free to cook some vegetables in the pan along with the sausage .
I believe it is kind of like the difference between broiling and baking . " Open top grill " only cooks from underneath ( kind of like broiling but not from above ) . Baked or " covered " grill will distribute the heat more evenly . For more information see : <URL> That 's where I double checked my assumption and got the metaphor of broiling and baking .
Given your lack of tools , we 're going to have to get <URL> on this roast . You 'll need some sort of flavorful liquid ( or a combination of them ) . Chicken stock or beef stock would work . I 'd normally also recommend using something acidic like red wine or tomatoes , however , using this method ( which is based on tinfoil ) , acids can react with the aluminum to produce off flavors . If you want to cook with wine or tomatoes , you can transfer the meat to your casserole after you brown it . ( More on this below . ) You 'll also need some type of mild tasting oil . Vegetable , corn , canola/rapeseed , peanut , light olive oil , will all work . Salt . That 's it in terms of software . Hardware : Paper towels . Tinfoil ( preferably the big , wide kind , and heavy duty ) . An oven . That 's it . Algorithm : This is basically the same technique that <URL> proposed , just using different tools . Adjust your oven 's rack to about 6 inches from the broiler . Turn on your oven 's broiler on its highest setting . Lay out two layers of tinfoil on your counter . Make sure the tinfoil is big enough such that if you were to place the roast in the middle of it there would be a border of tinfoil around the roast that is at least as wide as the roast itself . Optional : Put the tinfoil on a large sheetpan or cookie sheet . This will help you in transporting the device to/from the oven , and it will also ensure against spillage in your oven . If you do things right you wo n't have to wash the sheet . Pat the meat as dry as you can get it and put it in the center of the tinfoil . Pour a bit of oil on top of the roast and rub it all over . You only need enough to barely coat the entire roast . Generously salt both sides of the roast . I prefer using kosher salt , because it is less saline by volume , so you can more evenly distribute it without over-salting . You 'll probably use a good tablespoon or so . Put the roast under the broiler . Wait about 5 minutes , but that number is n't exact . Use your eyes . Just wait until it looks good and brown and crusty and delicious . Just do n't blacken the entire thing . When the top side is browned , flip it over to the other side . The best tool for the job here is a pair of tongs , but a fork will do . Brown the second side . Remove the roast ( which is hopefully on top of some type of pan for your convenience ) . Turn off your broiler and reset your oven to 275 degrees F. Fold up the sides of the tinfoil around the roast to make a sort of pan around it . Try to leave as little room around the roast as possible . Alternatively , if you want to use acidic ingredients , you can transfer the roast to the casserole at this point . The reason why you could n't use your casserole from scratch is that it is probably not broiler-safe . Pour in enough of the beef/chicken stock to just barely cover the roast . It should n't require very much liquid . Once the liquid is in , fold the tinfoil on itself to seal the top , such that you end up with a tinfoil package containing the browned meat and the stock . Try and make it airtight . Stick that in the 275 F oven . Just let it sit in there for ~ 3 hours . You do n't need to touch it . After ~ 3 hours , take it out . Hopefully the tinfoil did n't leak . If you did this correctly , all the cleanup you need to do is crumple up the foil and throw it out . You can also experiment with adding other vegetables ( e.g. , thinly sliced onions or whole garlic cloves ) . You can even add them from the very beginning . As I mentioned in a comment on <URL> answer , bottom round roasts have a lot of tough connective tissue which needs to be cooked low and slow ( < 300F ) in the oven in order to become soft and tender . However , if you were to cook the beef the entire way at that temperature the meat would end up being gray and tasteless . The reason is that the <URL> ( which are what turn the meat golden brown and make it taste more meaty and delicious ) do n't really occur below ~ 300F , which is the purpose of the initial sear .
The PH scale ranges from 0 - 14 with the lower numbers being more acidic than the higher number . Canned tomatoes are generally around 3.5-4 .5 on the acidic scale , in other words just above the half way point below neutral 7 . As long as your tomato based sauce is not left in your seasoned Kadai ( as Kristina rightly points out ) for a long timeframe and your kadhai is washed out immediately after use no damage to the seasoned coating should occur . Just remember to wash out your Kadai ( with warm water and a cloth ) immediately after use to preserve the seasoned coating .
You ca n't ( or at least I ca n't ) tell without a lot of experience with teas of that sort . Generally , a sufficiently fresh tea will have a decently strong fragrance when you smell the dry leaves . As it grows stale , the fragrance will be replaced gradually by mustiness . But which fragrance to expect varies dramatically by the tea . For instance , pan-fried greens like dragonwell ( longjing ) tend to smell vaguely nutty , while a sencha will smell more grassy . Dragonwell will also be more yellowish while the sencha will be more greenish . But these are two of many different varieties of green . Also , there 's a continuum of oxidation from green to black , so " too oxidized " is really a matter of taste . If you buy a Darjeeling ( black ) , it 'll tend to be lightly oxidized for a black tea ; if your green is darker than that , maybe it should n't be called green . I 'm sure with appropriate analytical chemistry equipment you could determine some aspects of tea " quality " -- but this would be complete overkill unless you 're running a major tea business and you want to ensure quality . And even then , you 'd probably be better off hiring a number of taste-testers . There is one test ( but it 's not definitive ) : brew the tea , then leave the cup out for a day . If it does n't get dramatically darker by the end of the day , it 's already mostly oxidized . In any case , if you like the tea , why do you care so much about the quality ? You can find some outrageously expensive teas -- I 've noticed some South Korean greens in particular -- that start getting into the price ranges of fine wines , but unless you 're doing this to impress people , you 're better off trying a variety of samples and then getting the one/ones you like . ( Hopefully you wo n't find that you really like those South Korean greens ... )
Just treat them as you would corned beef . I like the pressure cooker method
You probably misread the recipe . It 's suggested that dry beans soak overnight so that they cook in a reasonable amount of time the next day ( unless you use a pressure cooker . ) There is no need to soak barley , pearled or not . It 's my guess that you mistook the bean soaking for barley in the recipe . That , or it 's a typo .

How can I know how long home-cooked food will stay good in fridge ?
Food tends to become unpleasant before it becomes actually dangerous . I would try to eat things within 3 days of making them , though that 's just my personal guideline and is n't based on any scientific data . If you are n't going to eat it that quickly , freezing it after it 's been cooked and thawing it the day you want to eat it is probably a better idea .
When I have mixed thoroughly I then put it in mason jars with lids and keep it in fridge for about 1 and 1/2 weeks . I have not found the tomatoes to get mushy at all . When I take a jar from fridge , I have to break seal as it does tend to seal when we put cap and seal back on . I hope this helps ! ( In case it 's relevant , mine contains tomatoes , red onion , lime juice , cilantro , jalapeños , peperoncini , salt , and pepper . )
Leaving any sort of sugar confection in the fridge ( as it will out of the fridge also , but to a lesser extent ) will soften the sugar after a prolonged period due to the moisture in the air . However , putting it in the fridge for a short period of time will simply speed up the cooling process as you put in your question .
Not all turkeys are the same , and personally , I would not risk letting an entire turkey go rancid in the refrigerator . There is so much you do n't know about this turkey : How was it butchered ? In particular , how long was it sitting on the block and was it packed immediately afterward or left sitting out for a long time ? How quickly was it cooled down to " transporting " temperature after butchering ? Was it transported immediately , or was it stored for a while before transport , and if so , what were those storage conditions ? How specifically was it transported ? What were the environmental conditions , aside from temperature ? Was it exposed to air ? Could it have picked up any other contaminants ? Just how cold was the refrigerator at Trader Joe 's ? Are you sure that it 's consistently that cold ? What if the turkey was shifted around ? For example , what if some other customer picked it up , tossed it in a shopping cart , then after an hour of shopping decided to put it back ? How did she transport it ? I 'm guessing in a non-temperature-controlled trunk ? How long was it in that condition/environment before finally making it into the fridge ? Was the temperature in the fridge turned down as far as it can go long before putting the turkey in there ? If not , how long might it have taken to get down to the desired temperature , especially with a massive slightly-warmed-up turkey in there ? How cold does her refrigerator get ? Is it a new refrigerator ? Are you both certain that it gets as cold as the rep at TJ 's is assuming ? Have you actually stuck a thermometer in there to measure the environmental temperature around where the turkey would be stored ? I 'm not expecting you to answer any of these ; my point is just that there are so many variables , so many things that can go wrong , and the quoted 10-day storage period ( as well as the sell-by date ) is for storage under ideal conditions . I 've seen turkeys go rancid in the fridge after just 2 days . I 've seen others take longer , but still far less than 10 days to go rancid . It 's an incredibly frustrating and completely avoidable experience . Just put it in the freezer ! She just needs to make sure she gives it a couple of days to thaw in the fridge , due to the size of the bird . A half-frozen turkey on Thanksgiving day is almost as useless as a rancid one .
Unless your fridge is above 40 F ( 4 C ) , it wo n't go bad . I 've had large frozen turkeys take 4 days to thaw before . Just use it once it is fully thawed , do n't let it sit around thawed for several more days . There 's no food that I 'm aware of that goes bad in the time it takes to thaw it . The stilltasty link below shows 3-5 days for refrigerated meat , and 4-6 months for frozen . Transitioning from frozen to thawed though , I generally count on defrost time + 2-3 days . If you want to thaw it faster you can always use the cold water method . Simply place it in a sink full of cold water ( submerged ) and change the water every 30 minutes . The rule of thumb for turkey is 30 minutes of thaw time per pound . I imagine pork shoulder would be similar , maybe a little longer ? Additional Info : <URL>
The dates you have are probably brahi , whereas the ones you remember eating before are medjhoul . These are different types of dates , and have slightly different flavour profiles . As for storage , they should be fine for a few days at room temperature . For anything longer than that , they should be kept in the fridge , particularly if you live somewhere hot/humid . I also vaguely remember an old Israeli habit of eating yellow dates frozen , or after a few minutes out of the freezer .
<URL> gives you 3-5 days on cooked onions in the fridge - after that , tightly wrapped and airtight into the freezer .
In general the FDA recommends that you consume leftovers within 3-5 days ( See their website for specific foods ) . In this case , I do n't think the garlic is what 's holding you back . While garlic and herb infused oils do present some botulism risk , I think what they are getting at is the can of preserved garlic you 've had in the fridge for 9 months .
There 's too many factors to have a set percentage of oil that will stay , but lets cover a few common things that determine the oil in your final product . Heat of the oil : Your oil needs to be plenty hot enough to actually fry in . For fries , you 'll typically want to shoot for between 350-375 F . If you do n't have a thermometer , then get one ! If you really do n't want to get one , a white bread cube will fry brown in about 60 seconds at the right temp - but a thermometer is best . If the oil is n't hot enough to fry in , it will start to absorb the oil . So before you ever fry anything , get that oil up to temp ( and make sure its that way between batches ! ) . Coating of the fry ( or other fried food ) : A batter coating is just going to hold more oil than a plain french fry . If you 're trying to be health conscious about french fries ( but then again , why are you eating french fries !?! ) , avoid batter coating them and go with a ' plain ' fry . Post frying treatment : Shake , shake , shake ! Give the basket a good vigorous shake . Do n't have a basket ? Use a strainer or at least a cooling rack with a mesh-type grate . You 're trying to physically shake as much oil off the fry as you can . Additionally , I like to lay them on paper towels and then fold the paper towels on top . See all that oil ? Simple math , if its on the paper towel , its not in the fry anymore . Crowding the pan : If you crowd the pan you fry in , you 'll lower the temperature of the oil and give the oil not enough circulation . This means longer to fry and more time not at the right temperature . This means more oil in the final product . Its better to do some smaller batches than to try to cram it all in one batch . The right oil : The main thing here is that you need an oil that can fry hot enough without smoking . This goes back to the right temperature . ( In case it had n't sunk in yet , temperature is important ! ) If you ca n't get it hot enough , then you 're going to absorb a lot of oil . Olive oil is a bad choice . I usually use peanut or canola oil .
Surely you figured something out by now , but here is what I would do . First , look closely and carefully for surface mold . Look around the rim of the container . If that is clear , smell the oil for rancidity . If it stinks , throw it out . At this point , it looks good and it smells good . I ca n't imagine a dish where the roux is not thoroughly heated , so unless you are pioneering some kind of cold ingredient , cold roux dish , I think you are good to go . The sealed roux in the fridge should behave like a confit and retard spoilage for a while . If you did a dark roux ( like a cajun style ) it should last a really long time . They sell it in jars in New Orleans supermarkets , and if memory serves , the jar said something like 90 days in the fridge after opening .
The USDA recommends storing hard boiled eggs , whether peeled or not , for 1 week . I personally have kept &amp; eaten them after 2-3 weeks . I have also cracked one open that was no longer edible &amp; believe me - You will know when that happens ! The egg will will smell rotten &amp; you will have no question as to whether or not to eat it ! Some additional Info on storing eggs : Eggs should be stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees F , mainly to reduce the chances that any bacteria on the shell will multiply and cause a risk of illness . Buy refrigerated eggs and store them in the refrigerator as soon as your get home . However , even under refrigeration , eggs slowly lose carbon dioxide , which enlarges the size of the air cell and causes the yolk to flatten and the white to spread . Fresh Egg - Refrigerated raw shell eggs will keep without significant quality loss for about 4 - 5 weeks beyond the " sell by " date or about 3 weeks after you bring them home . Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days Fresh egg yolks ( unbroken and covered with water ) - 2 to 4 days Deviled eggs - 2 to 3 days Leftover egg dishes - 3 to 4 days
Depending on what it is I am transporting I use different methods , and I use the same methods for both hot and cold transport . The easiest is the towels in a box ; lay four towels down in a shallow box , hanging the other ends of the towels out each side of the box , then put your dish or bread or pot or whatever in the box and fold each of the four towels over the food . If you have hot food , lay some more insulation material over the top , as heat rises . If you have cold food , put the box on the seat , not the floor , as the floor will conduct heat from your vehicle up into your food . I always have a sleeping bag in my rig and I will sometimes wrap food well with towels and then open the sleeping bag and shove the food into it , wrapping the rest of the sleeping bag over the top if hot food and under the bottom if cold . This has worked a lot for frozen foods when I go bulk shopping in the city , holding food frozen food for 4 hours and more .
I feel the same as you Anderson . I found that too and you just made me to do some research , which I found they have different smoke points . Unrefined sunflower oil 225 ° F 107 ° C Unrefined peanut oil 320 ° F 160 ° C see the link : <URL> Also , one of the reasons food stick to the pan is the evenness of the temperature of the pan . If you use a thicker pan or copper pan , the heat will be distributed on the pan more evenly and food will stick less . The higher smoke point of oil makes me to believe the oil helps to distribute heat more evenly .
Two problems : Hot or warm food will briefly warm up the air and therefore to some degree the food already in fridge , especially items immediately near it . Cycling temperatures does not help fresh food quality or life . Modern fan forced fridges may suffer this problem less . It is very power inefficient to do this . Just let it cool on the bench until it reaches a cooler temperature and then place it in the refrigerator . Use any of the well-documented and appropriate techniques to cool food quickly and safely if it is going to longer than 2 hours to cool .
Up to 7 days ( homemade mayo as well ) . Egg whites/yolks out of the egg ( but not combined with the acid ) can last 3-4 days refrigerated , and eggs in-shell are good for 2-4 weeks depending on processing .
Ground beef cooks quite fast . It does n't need more than 5 minutes ( depending on the base of your pan and the amount of meat of course ) . Just take a piece and rip/cut it open . If it 's brown inside , and not red or pink , it 's fully cooked .
Keep it airtight in a cool , dark place and it should remain good infefinitely . You 'll certainly be fine 1-2 years .
Truffles are a low acid food , and they grow underground , so they are at risk to have botulism spores present . Vacuum packing creates a low oxygen environment , which is what the botulism bacteria requires to grow and produce its toxin . Unless the truffles have been salted ( to 5 % by weight ) , acidified ( to a pH of 4.6 or lower ) , or frozen ( at all times after being vacuum packed ) , they are at risk for the growth of botulism . Some strains can grow and produce their toxins at refrigerator temperatures ( and most refrigerators have a temperature cycle that peaks in the more general growth range ) . While the growth is slow , it can occur . The risk is increased if the truffles have not been continuously refrigerated since they were vacuum packed . For this reason , mushrooms and truffles should never be vacuum packed and stored . You should discard these truffles . In the future , obtain your truffles from a reputable source ( which does not vacuum pack ) and use them fresh , or freeze them as botulism is not active at freezer temperatures .

Well of all your listed ingredients the only two that can really ' spoil ' are the fresh basil and fresh mint . Honey never goes bad , and nearly any dried spice can last for a long time with just a degradation in flavor . I 'd say that if you washed and dried ( sanitarily ) your basil and mint before addition to this mix that you could get at least 1-2 weeks out of it unrefrigerated , and at least 1-2 months out of it refrigerated . Please note that this is just a ballpark estimate and you may have to do some trial and error to determine a more specific window . That said , I would n't be surprised if you could get a significantly longer shelf life out of it than my estimates . Update - I think the presence of salt does enough to " extend " the life of it . Another Update - Some Googling has informed that honey is in-fact a preservative . Apparently honey is a rather hostile environment for bacteria due to the production/presence of hydrogen peroxide . I still think my estimates are accurate , albeit a little conservative now . The best thing you can do is trial and error . Sources : <URL> <URL>
My answer to the other question still applies : vacuum packing will not prevent most foodborne pathogens from multiplying . In the case of chicken , it will stop campylobacter ( which needs small amounts of oxygen ) but will not stop salmonella or listeria . Here 's how you can determine if thawed , previously frozen chicken is still safe to eat : When freezing , marking the freezing date on masking tape and stick it on the package When thawing , mark the thawing date similarly To determine if it 's still good : subtract the freezing date from the original expiration date , and see if it 's been that many days since you thawed it This method works because spoilage is halted by freezing ... but not reversed . Once you thaw , the process picks back up where it left off . A few days in the fridge after thawing should be fine , assuming you do n't wait until right before expiration to freeze the chicken .

Should I keep the meat boiled off of bones when making beef broth ?
Taste the meat and if it still seems edible to you then there is no reason to throw it out . When I make stock , I keep it on a simmer for much longer than three hours and any meat is completely tasteless by the time I 'm done . Three hours , however , is about how long you would cook meat to make a stew , so it 's quite possible that you could eat it . On the other hand , not all cuts of meat stew well and I 'm not familiar with this cut . If the meat has plenty of connective tissues ( i.e. collagen ) to gelatinise it should n't dry out too much . But the proof is in the pudding : taste it .
I assume you are making a brine ? Such as pastrami , corned beef , pickled pork , etc. . If so , you probably want to go with kosher or pickling salt . Both are pure salt , and pickling salt is ground more finely to facilitate mixing with cold or lukewarm brines . You can use iodized , table , or sea salt , but there are additives in them to prevent sticking that can affect the curing process or leave sediment in your brine ( i.e. pickles or pickled meats stored in brine ) . Sea salt may not have additives , but it may contain other trace minerals that could affect the finished product . Here are some links on the subject : <URL> <URL>
Yes , they will ripen off the vine ( and gain capsaician in the process ) because they are a climacteric fruit . They do this best in a paper bag , like most peppers . However , there is a limit to this because they will eventually wilt .

People choose to eat vegetarian diets for a number of reasons . Not only might the flavor offend your guest , but it may cause them to be physically ill . You can substitute vegetable stock or broth for the meat products you are accustomed to using . Mushrooms lend a meaty flavor to dishes they are used in and could potentially be used to replace your meat . I would suggest cooking them separately first to draw out the moisture , then adding them to the beans near the end of the cooking process so they soak up some of the flavors and have a chance to marry . Remember mushrooms are little culinary sponges . They will take flavors and run with them , adding their own earthy notes in the process . Search for vegetarian rice and beans dishes to get an idea of the possibilities here . From an etiquette standpoint , you may want to avoid the temptation to apologize to your other guests for having to make a veggie substitution as that would be a quick ticket towards alienating your vegetarian pal . I only mention that because some people do n't think about things like that and I have a few friends who are on restrictive diets . They are sometimes embarrassed when people go out of their way to make menu changes for them . Another alternative altogether is to find a way to prepare two versions of the dish . Meaning , you could use meat as you are accustomed to but leave a portion of the food vegetarian . When it 's practical I like this option a lot . It just comes with the downside of increased cleanup and stovetop logistics issues .
Generally with baking you mix all the wet ingredients , then all the dry , then incorporate the latter into the former . This prevents clumping and helps make sure everything is mixed uniformly . In some recipes , adding the eggs ( often un par un , or one by one ) also contributes ( via the yolk 's supply of lecithin ) to emulsifying e.g. butter and milk together . The best way to find out , of course , is to experiment . Next time you 're making these cookies , make a double batch . Do one according to the recipe , and the other your way . Honestly with cookies I doubt you 'll see much difference ; they 're basically foolproof ( I have , when in a hurry , made chocolate chip cookies by dumping everything in the mixer , whacking it about with the paddle attachment , and then folding in the actual chips . Worked fine , basically ) . When it comes to baking things that are more finicky -- cakes etc -- I would follow the recipe directions .
I 've been making rum-based vanilla extract successfully at home for years . Here are my recommendations . Your basic ingredients are 80 proof rum , sugar and vanilla beans . At the recommended proportions , the rum and sugar are plenty effective preservatives . You can use either light or dark rum , but it should be a good " call " 80 proof rum and not a bargain bottom shelf rum . I most often use Ron Rico . If you use a golden rum , your extract will have a warmer taste suitable for spicy treats such as pumpkin pie or spice cookies . If you use a silver rum , your vanilla will have a purer taste suitable for whipped cream or custard sauces . I get rum that is bottled in glass , because I think plastic imparts an off flavor . Your basic recipe will use a fifth less about a 1/2 cup of rum , four vanilla beans and 1/2 cup of organic sugar . We 'll go through that first , and then talk about variations . Place your vanilla beans on a clean , flat cutting surface . Using a small , sharp knife , cut them first in 1/2 crosswise at the middle . Then take each 1/2 bean and insert the knife tip just 1/2 to an inch below the uncut end and carefully slice lengthwise to the send . Repeat this process gently and carefully on each piece unti each piece has four lengthwise quarters attached at the uncut end . Some recipes will tell you to scrape some or all of the paste out of the beans , but this is not necessary . The simply split beans will infuse the rum just fine . Pour out about a cup of rum from your fifth and set aside . Put your sliced vanilla beans into the rum . Use a funnel to add 1/2 cup of organic sugar . Use the reserved rum you set aside to top the bottle back up . Recap the bottle and give it about 20 shakes to encourage the sugar to dissolve . Set aside in a dark cabinet or pantry . Take it out and give it a few shakes every week or so . Your vanilla will be usable but not fully extracted in about two months . It will continue to strengthen in flavor out to about 6 months of age . Once you are satisfied with your extract , you can decant some and bottle it up in smaller bottles . It 's a very popular gift for bakers . Once you have tried vanilla extract made this way , you will never want to go back to store-bought . The difference is indescribable . You can vary the type of rum you use , silver or gold , and you can vary the sugar . I mostly stick with light organic sugar , because I think the taste is better . I like the combination of dark rum and brown organic sugar very well . You can also increase the sugar up to about 2/3 cup in a fifth bottle , but I would n't go above that . Sugar gives the extract more body and mellows the flavor . Check out Wikipedia to learn more about the various kinds of vanilla beans available . I use the organic ones from my food coop , but different kinds can be ordered online or found at specialty food stores . A number of cooking blogs have instructions on making extracts or tinctures of other spices . There is no reason not to create combination flavors .
Marrow bones add a marrow-y flavor . That flavor is very thick and rich , but can taste of innards . Have you ever eaten marrow ? ( It 's delicious , as far as I 'm concerned . You can <URL> . ) I would say that it sounds like you 've got a lot of marrow bones in your stock . That could cause problems , since even a few marrow bones will make the stock fairly greasy . Marrow is almost all fat . The ox tails have lots of bones in them . They 'll give you the deep flavor and gelatin of bones . ( Neck bones give you the same thing , as you can see from the picture below . ) The only thing marbled meat would have added is extra fat , which is n't necessary for stock -- you 'll end up skimming the fat off anyway . You want both the bones and the meat for stock , as you would for chicken stock . It 's true that marrow bones are fairly clean , but they 're used for a different flavor . Another option for adding lots of flavor is to add what are known as <URL> ribs . This is short ribs that are cut across the bone . They 're also used in Korean Short Ribs . They give you some of that marbled meaty flavor , along with the bones from the ribs .
I would n't make the layers fully in the freezer . It will be hard to seal up and may dry out . Also , frozen layers are easier to work with . The freezer will dry out unsealed cake extremely fast . I 'd bake all the cake , trim and level them , wrap tightly and freeze on Thursday . Make the sauces and creams on Friday and put them in the fridge . Assemble all on Saturday .
To my knowledge wasabi paste is just wasabi powder that has had the water added to it by the factory . So if you are looking at paste vs powder I would go powder . The question to me would be to make it a paste before you add it to your ice cream base or to add the powder directly to the ice cream base . I would venture to say you should be just fine adding the powder directly to the ice cream base . Now , for the ugly truth . Pretty much all you wasabi powder sold in the US or Japan for that mater is n't really wasabi ( or contains very little wasabi ) . It is horseradish , that is colored green and has some sort of mustard or turmeric added . And really not what I would want to try in an ice cream . Plus the flavor of the pastes are not like fresh ( even with horseradish ) . If I were doing an ice cream , I would want to stay away from the powder all together . I would visit my local specialty food market or online specialty market and see if I could source real wasabi . But cost might be prohibitive for you as it is very expensive . Next the good news is , there are some powders out there that are actually dried ground wasabi powder such as <URL> . It was most likely something like this that your friend used if she did use a powder . Anyway , I hope this is helpful to you . And good luck .
The okara has some unextracted protein and sugar but it also has a large quantity of fiber . That fiber will prevent the protein from properly coagulating . If you leave in all the okara you get soybean porridge . I imagine you could leave in a portion of the okara and you would get a fragile but hearty tofu . The problem with this is that , with most tofu recipes , the beans are not cooked long enough for the okara to be palatable . With all that sugar it would also give rise to much more flatulence . You do n't have to throw the okara out . There are many recipes that make use of the okara for its fiber . It is pretty straight forward to use it in baked goods . Toasting it gives it more interesting flavor . If you want to look into tofu-like products that use the entire bean you could research tempeh . The whole beans are fermented so you get a meaty product with all the nutrition of the whole soy bean .
You need to strain the stock and cool it until it 's 40 degrees F. or below before you refrigerate it . Leaving it to cool overnight on the stove is going to create a bacteria cesspool . The temperature danger zone is between 40 and 140 degrees . This is the range that is prime for the growth of bacteria . Food safety guidelines require that it cool to 70 degrees or below within 2 hours and then below 40 degrees within another 4 hours time . Total maximimum time that it should take to get to 40 degrees is 6 hours . Even if you get it cooled down now with all of the vegetbles and bones in it , the problem will be that you have to heat it back up in the morning to strain it as it 's going to gelatinze overnight ( provided it 's been cooked long enough to extract a good amount of gelatin - usually about 4-6 hours for a good chicken stock and 12-16 hours for veal/beef stock ) . When it 's reheated you 're running the risk that the carrots and other vegetables will break up into smaller bits and end up clouding the stock . Strain it and cool it down tonight before putting in the refrigerator . To cool quickly , either divide amongst several pans ( greater surface area is better than depth as it will dispel heat quicker ) or if you do n't have a BIG pot of stock , strain it and put it in an ice bath ( water and ice cubes ) in your plugged kitchen sink . If you make stock a lot , you can save plastic milk jugs and fill them 3/4 with water and keep in the freezer . After straining the stock you can place one of those inside the pot of stock to also help cool it from the inside out . In the morning you can then skim the layer of congealed fat from the top . If it 's chicken stock , save the fat for frying potatoes with extra flavor !
If it 's pure silver , it 's fine . Silver is n't toxic . Well ... if you get some colloidial silver , and you dose yourself with it every day , you 'll have some disturbing symptoms . The same is true of almost all metals . Iron pills , for example , are worse , but we commonly cook with cast iron . Metallic silver is sometimes used as a chelating agent , so it can purge your body of other metals you may have absorbed . If its heirloom electroplated silver , it 's probably still fine . If it 's heirloom pewter , coated in copper , then electroplated with silver , its still fine ( because pewter does n't tarnish , so the tarnish is either silver or copper ) but I would n't eat anything acidic with it , because it 'll leech lead into your food . Note : There is no way you have pewter . That was a joke .
The basis for any sort of Japanese soup dish is going to be dashi stock , a stock made of fish and seaweed . It has a much lighter flavor than chicken broth , so you might not have identified it easily . You can buy it in a powder form for convenience , and it can be sprinkled into other liquids rather than reconstituted . <URL> is for soba with a dipping sauce , but it 'll give you a good idea of the flavor profile you 're looking for : Dashi stock plus <URL> , which is made of soy sauce , mirin , and sugar ( and simmered so it 's not strongly alcoholic ) .
I found a quote from <URL> One thing you may not want to do with a press pot , especially a larger model , is use beans roasted less than 2 or 3 days before . What , am I crazy ? Nope . There 's a problem with ultra fresh beans and it is called " bloom " . When beans are only a day or two off the roast , they contain heaps of Co2 . Heaps of it , I tell you . That Co2 will translate into a massive bloom of brown suds on top of your press pot , possibly overflowing , but also making it easier for big particulate matter ( your ground coffee ) to hop and skip over the top of the filter portion when you first apply it . Bloom looks cool , but can make using a press pot more difficult . The poor filtering part sounds questionable to me , so I googled it and found a few bloom-related comments <URL> . It seems like some people start timing their soak time only after they see bloom . This seems like the real reason to me . I know for sure that the air content in ground substances can vary significantly : one cup of flour can contain double the volume of another if one is loosely sifted and the other is compacted . The above quote is accurate about that in my opinion . Apply this logic to coffee and in order to produce an accurate , general recipe for how long some compounds take to come out of coffee grounds , you need to factor out a variable between coffee grounds : how much air is in the grindings . Maybe the first small pour will saturate with coffee compounds , or drop in temperature quickly , reducing how much it can extract from the grounds . Once it squeezes out all the air , the rest of the water is poured in to do the real extraction work .
Costs to consider when making jam : One-Time Costs Pressure canner Water-bath canner Large pot for making jam in Strainer ( can use a colander-type item or something like a Squeez-o ) Jar rack that goes inside the canner Jar lifter Funnel Jars Freezer-safe containers Jar rings Recurring Costs Jar lids Fruit ( you can often get pretty cheap fruit in bulk from an orchard ) Pectin Sugar Spices Energy usage ( stove ) Compare costs for freezer jam ( no canner required ) , pressure-canned jam ( pressure canners are expensive ) , and water-bath canned jam . Also compare for recipes that do vs do not contain pectin . If you can get a lot of the one-time cost items free ( from grandma 's attic , most likely ) , and if you can get the recurring cost items on sale ( or from your own garden ) , then you can probably come close to commercially priced jam . Personally , here 's what I look at : A ) The cost of the item I would normally buy at the store - generic , cheap brand . Let 's call that price X. B ) The cost of the item I wish I could buy at the store - the really good stuff . That price is usually about 2x to 3x . Then , my goal is to be cheaper than 2x . Another Cost Consideration If you give homemade jam as holiday gifts , spending less than you otherwise would on a gift , there 's additional savings for you .
No , this is n't normal . A little flaking , perhaps , when you go over 600 ° F , but 500 ° F should n't do anything . It should n't even smoke . Something is wrong with the seasoning on your pan . From the fact that its smoking , I 'd guess its not sufficiently baked on . Alternatively , maybe the pan was n't clean when you applied it . If its just not baked on , I 'd remove all the flaking bits ( with some harsh scrubbing , sand paper even ) , clean it thoroughly , then bring it to around 300 ° F ( stovetop or oven ) . This will make sure it is completely dry . Spread a thin layer of high-iodine value oil ( flax seed is great , soy is pretty good and cheap and easy to find : look for the bottle that just says vegetable oil and check the ingredients , it 's probably soy ) . Spreading is easy with a paper towel . Next , toss into a very hot oven , 400 -- 500 , smoking is expected . Bake for 90 minutes , then turn the oven off . Allow pan to cool with oven . Once its cool , touch it . If its at all tacky , put it back in the oven , and bake for another hour ( once again , allowing to cool with oven ) . It should be a shiny black at this point , and not at all tacky . You can repeat the process to add more layers . Two should be reasonably non-stick to start cooking on . If it still peels off after this , you 're probably going to need to strip the seasoning and re-season the pan , after stripping it to bare metal . See <URL> to season it from bare metal .
I ca n't speak specifically to the shelf life of salami , especially considering all of the factors that come into play ( source , type , age , storage , etc. ) , but when dealing with meat in general , you should never eat it if it smells or tastes " off " . Smell is really the most reliable means of determining whether or not meat is still good - far more reliable than the use-by date . It 's unusual for meat to smell or taste sour as a result of foodborne bacteria ; sourness is more likely to be due to rancidity of the fats , which is of course equally dangerous , albeit in a different way . Oxidation is very likely if the meat was not properly wrapped and/or stored in an airtight container . Of course , many people have trouble telling the difference between spoilage due to rancidity and spoilage due to bacteria , and so what you 're perceiving as rancid ( sour ) may really be bacterial spoilage . Either way , if it tastes off , it 's spoiled ; do n't eat it .
Cakes are where sifting can make a significant difference . See <URL> book , she goes into it in detail .
The resting period is not generally done by an absolute temperature -- you would have measured for ( near ) your target temperature before before taking the piece out of the oven or off the griddle or whatever . Traditionally , it should be proportional to the size of the cut or roast . 5-10 minutes is good for a steak or individual chicken pieces , depending on their thickness Medium size roasts and smaller poultry , say 10-15 minutes Large roasts and large poultry ( like a turkey ) , up to 30 minutes . If you do want to measure by temperature for more precise results , Kenji Alt of <URL> recommends based on practical experimentation , for steaks : Ideally , no matter how well-done you 've cooked your meat , you want to allow it to cool down until the very center has reached 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) . At this stage , the muscle fibers have relaxed enough that you should have no problem with losing juices . He also reviews some of the science , and various explanations for why the resting works . Cook 's Illustrated 's <URL> performed an experiment with several roasted pork loins , cutting them with no resting , or resting of 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 minutes . They found that even a 10 minute rest cut down on juices expressed by 60 % compared to the unrested roast . They found far less difference in the roasts that were rested for longer periods , although there was continued improvement in the juice retention . They summarize ( original emphasis ) : So what to do ? Curb your enthusiasm and let your meat rest . But not for too long . The most dramatic decrease in moisture loss for these pork loins took place during the first 10 minutes of rest . Additional time helps -- but not if that means your dinner will be cold . If you 're cooking a big roast , you can wait longer -- about 30 minutes . Thin steaks should only wait 5 to 10 minutes before you dig in . This shows that the traditional advise on resting times is actually fairly effective . Note : Thanks to <URL> for sharing this reference .

Why does soymilk take longer to expire ?
What do the dates mean ? On their website <URL> , the Silk manufacturer describe the date on their package : Our refrigerated beverages and creamers will stay fresh in your refrigerator until the date stamped on the carton . Once opened , they need to be consumed within 7 to 10 days . It is not unusual for our products to remain good past the 10-day mark ; however , we only guarantee that they will be good for 7 to 10 days once opened . If the milk is labelled best by , that is an indicator of quality , not safety . However , normally milk in the US is labelled with a Sell By date , and should be good for a week or so after that date , or for about a week after being opened , whichever comes first . What are these milks ? Now consider what these two different products are . According to the <URL> column published by Cornell : As with all other animal-based foods , it 's a complete protein ; that is , it supplies people with all the necessary amino acids to form proteins . Cow 's milk contains 8 grams of protein and 12 grams of carbohydrates per 8-ounce cup . Cow 's milk is a rich source of other nutrients as well . One cup provides adults with about 30 percent of their daily calcium needs and about 50 percent of their vitamin B12 and riboflavin requirements . Often , milk is fortified with vitamin D to facilitate the absorption of calcium . Vitamin A is usually added to milk as well . Depending on the selection , cow 's milk can have a significant amount of fat . [ ... ] One cup of unfortified soymilk contains almost 7 grams of protein , 4 grams of carbohydrate , 4 1/2 grams of fat , and no cholesterol . Although soymilk supplies some B vitamins , it 's not a good source of B12 , nor does it provide a significant amount of calcium . Since many people substitute soy beverages for cow 's milk , manufacturers offer fortified versions . These varieties may include calcium and vitamins E , B12 , and D , among other nutrients . If you do choose to use soymilk instead of cow 's milk , read labels carefully to be sure you 're getting enough of these important nutrients or consider getting them from alternative food sources . Milk is a complete food for a growing animal ( or human ) . This makes it an ideal growth medium for microfauna of all types , as it contains everything they need -- including easily available sugars to jump start their growth . Soy milk on the other hand , while derived from the seed intended to grow a full plant , is has a very different profile . It is almost devoid of sugars are readily accessible fats , making it a less ideal growth medium for micro-fauna . This is not say they wo n't grow , but they may not colonize as readily and grow as quickly . Conclusion Therefore , you would expect soy milk to have a longer unopened shelf life than milk as it simply is not as ideal a growth medium . Silk implies it may last longer after opening as well , but being conservative they do not promise that . Milk will have a shorter shelf life before opening ( it is not sterile , and will go bad even in the refrigerator ) , and definitely will last less time after being exposed to the environment . They are simply two different products , with very different contents ; the fact that both are named " milk " is not an indicator . See also : <URL>
I 've used yeast that was even older than yours and although the taste of the resulting bread was fine , and it foamed up properly when tested , I found I had to use about 50 % more of it to get the same density of the bread . In the end , I threw it out because it was too much trouble to experiment with it every time .
Before being cooked , vegetables are like a wall built from tightly filled water balloons . Each cell has is filled with water ( well , technically cytoplasm , but ... ) which is essentially incompressible . One of the components in the cell walls is hemi-cellulose , which dissolves into the water when the vegetable is cooked . This allows the individual cells to partially deflate , expressing water and making the overall vegetable wilt . Think a blown up beach ball . Although the wall is soft and flexible , the air holds it rigid . Of course , air can be compressed , so a beach ball can be squeezed ; but water for all practical purposes is not compressible , so there is no almost no give in the individual plant cells . Once the cell walls loose their integrity , however , it is like the beach balls that comprise the plant have sprung a leak . They loose their shape or rigor , and at the large scale you see wilting or softening . Note that the presence of acid in the cooking medium can inhibit the dissolving of the hemi-cellulose , and permitting vegetables to better maintain their shape . This is one reason why , for example , canned vegetables have acid added to the canning liquid ( another being that acidity above a certain threshold inhibits the growth of certain dangerous food born pathogens . )
The ripening itself is caused by ethylene gas released by the food , which is trapped by any kind of bag . As far as I know , there 's nothing inherently special about a brown paper bag , other than the fact that it 's porous and thus still allows some air to get in and out . Plastic ziplock bags have no ventilation , so they do n't work nearly as well .
The crystalization is to be expected , that 's what inverted sugar does . It is the same thing as with honey , which is chemically nothing but a contaminated inverted sugar . So , you are not doing anything wrong . In an inverted sugar at sucrose ratios , you will get sucrose crystalizing back out of the solution , just as you are observing now . If you really need it smooth , you can try changing the ratio by adding some fructose , as such a mixture is less prone to crystalizing . The one thing that puzzles me in your description is that you can not get it back smooth by heating , this should in principle be possible . Maybe try adding a bit of water to the syrup itself during heating , so it can dissolve again .
There are a variety of factors at work here : Freezing foods " improperly " ( i.e. not flash-frozen , not vacuum-sealed ) causes ice crystals to form within the food , damaging the molecular structures . This is what causes many frozen leftovers to become " mushy " or change in texture . Again due to the formation of ice and the movement of water when the food is reheated , tiny particles such as spices can be lost in steam and/or runoff water . Extreme temperatures ( both hot and cold ) can denature enzymes in the food , changing their flavor , texture , etc. . As food sits , flavors in the food may blend together in different ways , causing the food to have less distinct flavors . If your freezer is n't especially clean and your food not well-sealed , your food may be absorbing other odors which are again " masking " the original flavor of your food . Hope that gives you some ideas .
From what you 're describing , I think the cheese ( or cheese-like substance , in this case ) ' broke ' ... that is , the oil separated out of it . I 'd recommend : Do n't melt it at full power Stir it multiple times during melting Melt the cheese ( or " cheese-food " ) seperately , then add the tomatoes , so the tomatoes do n't get hot , causing uneven heating . I 'm not sure if there 's a good way to recover cheese once it 's broken . Some starch will help keep dairy from breaking in the first place , but I do n't think it 'd help you in this particular case .
The term " bad " , when applied to cheese , can actually refer to a <URL> ( p. 14 ) , several of which are caused by improper or over-aging and only some of which are dangerous . The issues that you most likely need to worry about are : Moisture loss applies primarily to soft cheese and is probably the first negative effect you 'll see . In a sealed package , it will " sweat " as Ivo points out , caused by water evaporating and then condensing again on the packaging , forming little droplets . Unsealed , it will simply dry out and become hard . This is not spoilage , and the cheese is still perfectly good to eat , it just might not have as pleasant a texture and might have a slightly flat flavour . You can just cut off any hardened edges . Oxidation gives a slightly metallic taste but more importantly leads to rancidity - discoloration and a sour smell/taste . This is caused by light and is why you should store cheese in a dark place . If you left it in the car during the afternoon , it may have been exposed to a good deal of light . However , <URL> and wax paper in particular is an oxidation inhibitor ( that 's why cheese is often wrapped in it ! ) . Light exposure also would have been minimal at night . You 're probably fine in this respect , but use your nose . If it smells sour , do n't eat it . The chemical process itself results in peroxides and free radicals , which are obviously not good to eat , although there seems to be some debate about just how dangerous they are ( some say it raises the risk of cancer , although I 'm unable to find an authoritative source , and this might just be an urban myth ) . Mold is the most obvious form of spoilage and usually also the last . Although most mold is technically aerobic , many strains are capable of growing with very little oxygen , and I personally have seen mold growing on an unopened package of cheddar that I 'd forgotten about for several months . I 'm sure I do n't need to tell you that mold is n't safe to eat ; however , by the time there 's enough mold to be dangerous , you 'll be able to see it . Contrary to what Ivo 's post suggests , the mold you 'll see growing on spoiled cheese is not the same as the mold that the cheese was made with - some cheeses , like parmesan , are n't made with any mold at all , although they can certainly grow mold later on . The molds used in cheese-making are typically some variety of <URL> , which is safe to eat . The mold that grows weeks later could be anything , and is not safe to eat . Ivo is also partially correct in saying that the packaging does not prevent mold growth ; however , it does slow it down by restricting the available oxygen . On the whole , I tend to agree with the other answers that your cheese will almost certainly still be good after only 1 day . Keep in mind that cheese is thought to have been popularized as a <URL> before refrigeration existed - the whole idea is that it lasts a long while , usually well over 24 hours before food safety becomes an issue .
Most freezers are frost-free , which means that they occasionally cycle above freezing to prevent formation of frost on the walls of the freezer . This makes them easier to maintain but it shortens the storage longevity of the food . This makes products stored in them vulnerable to freezer burn , which is a loss of moisture . It can also cause ice and IQF products like frozen fruits or vegetables to solidify into a single mass . If you have ice cube trays , you may even notice them becoming empty after a few months of sitting unused . Freezer burn is a loss of quality , though , not a health issue . The food is n't spoiling . If you have a " deep freeze " or a non frost-free freezer that you only access occasionally , you can certainly keep foods for nearly indefinite periods of time without worrying as much about freezer burn . You can also reduce the likelihood of freezer burn by following better freezer practices . Resources available <URL> and <URL> and <URL> .
Do n't take anything that costs much : You may have it taken away from you by border controls . In some parts of the world being able to confiscate nice things is a perk of the job . You want to enter ( or leave ) the country , you part with the knife . It could also be illegal to bring in knives over a certain size Hostels are famous for being rife with theft . Having some nice folding knife just begs for someone to take it Traveling is hard on equipment It does n't really matter anyway : who cares about the knife , anything will do . Ingredients and technique are what matters If I were you I 'd get a cheap , short cooking knife from some hardware store . Also make sure it looks like a cooking knife , you do n't want anything that could be mistaken for a weapon ! If you lose it , or it gets stolen , or broken , or you give it to someone who needs it more than you do then you just buy another cheap knife at a market somewhere . If you have an expensive piece of equipment it 's just another worry .
Caffeine is bitter , tea is n't too bitter because as you mentioned it 's only got 40mg of caffeine . If you then triple the amount in there it 's going to taste that way . Try adding 3 tea bags to your cup and I 'm certain it 'll taste just as bitter . Energy drinks have copious amounts of sweeteners added hence why they do n't taste like caffeine . If you are hell bent on more caffeine without the associated bitterness but not adding sugar maybe a sweetener like stevia would be the way forward ...
Your question : is it good to use . My answer : yes . You say it smells and looks normal . That 's an important clue . We are talking about a dry product . No moist means no growth , no toxins ... Best before date . <URL> : Most shelf life dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling and exposure to temperature . Use prior to the expiration date does not necessarily guarantee the safety of a food or drug , while a product is not always dangerous nor ineffective after the expiration date
First off I want to point out the term " fresh " . While some containers might keep milk from spoiling for longer , it may not taste as nice . Several things might be why : 1 . ) Plastics leach flavor and odor into the milk . <URL> , not wax since about the 1940s . I would say this is likely the biggest impact -- I 've always found plastic containers make drinks and food taste downright funky . <URL> are made of <URL> . The FDA considers this material safe , but just because something is safe does n't mean it does n't impart a flavor . <URL> showing glass having least effect on taste : " ... overall , the development of water off-taste occurred least in glass containers and most often in high density polyethylene containers ... " 2 . ) <URL> Ice cold milk tastes better ( fresher ) to most people . The thing is , it 's not actually colder while in the fridge . <URL> That means heat can transfer through it faster than plastic . The <URL> demands equilibrium , so while your hand makes the milk hotter , the glass of milk makes your hand colder . Because of glass 's higher thermal conductivity , it does this faster than plastic and we sense the glass as being colder . So while it 's not - actually - colder and would n't keep the milk from spoiling for longer , it would affect our perception of how cold it is and therefore also the taste . Packaging of milk varies so a thicker glass bottle might also keep the milk colder while it 's sitting on the counter vs most thin plastic milk jugs . There are a lot of variables with packaging so it really depends on what you 're comparing . 3 . ) <URL> Permeability : <URL> Starting in 1937 the <URL> used to be one of the main statutory tests for checking if milk was bad by checking how much oxygen is present in the milk . This lets you know how much aerobic bacteria is in the milk ( bacteria that requires oxygen ) . <URL> While we do have newer , better tests for handling milk in bulk refrigeration these days , it 's important to note for a long time this was a large part of measuring milk quality . 4 . ) It just takes time to process , test , and ship milk . You mentioned it yourself -- usually to get a glass bottle you have to get it from a dairy , something local and closer to home . So it has n't traveled as far . Also , while it 's not legal everywhere , some people will sell raw milk in glass bottles so there is n't even time wasted <URL> or testing the milk . <URL> . Still , some people might prefer the taste while it 's still good . Processing is done to kill bad bacteria ( so it 's not a bad thing ) , but it does take time that eats into shelf life . Milk delivered to you may only be a few hours old . The processing itself can effect the flavor of the milk . Processing plants can hold milk for up to 3 days . 5 . ) In many areas , the companies that bottle with glass are the ones that are making higher quality milk in the first place . Glass is expensive , and usually only people who are willing to pay more for higher quality milk are going to be the same ones who pay for a higher quality bottle . Glass bottles are good for the environment and so some people are willing to pay more for that . <URL> uses about half as much energy vs plastic counterpart . Note here that glass does n't automatically mean " better milk " . 6 . ) <URL> In a 1980 study , subjects were blindfolded and asked to tell whether the beverage they were drinking was flavored orange . Only one in five could . But when they were allowed to see what they were drinking , each of them identified the orange flavor . And when a lime-flavored drink was colored orange , nearly half of respondents thought it was flavored orange You also see this with high-end restaurants -- they put a lot of value in how the food is plated , going as far as using a ruler to get a perfectly straight line , and wiping up small drips to make the food look perfect . Our vision influences our taste . Since most glass is translucent and most plastic containers are not , there 's a good chance this influences taste as well .
The most likely culprits are : Steeping too long : 1-3 minutes , depending on the type and grade of tea . Using water that is too hot or too cold : Again , this depends on the type and grade of tea . <URL> is an excellent resource for getting these factors right : On Steeping Time : Green tea does not require much time . Too long a steeping time will result in more bitterness and a less balanced flavor . We recommend experimenting with a range of 1 - 3 minutes . Japanese green teas generally taste best at 1 - 2 minutes while Chinese green teas seem to prefer 2 - 3 minutes ( the smaller leaves of Japanese teas will extract faster than the generally larger leaves of Chinese teas ) . Steeping time should be balanced with water temperature : the lower the temperature , the longer the tea can be steeped . On Temperature As a general guideline , green teas taste best when brewed at temperatures between 140 ° F - 185 ° F ( 60 ° C-85 ° C ) . The grade of the tea and the time of its harvest will also influence the appropriate steeping temperature . Green teas picked earlier in the spring will benefit from lower temperature brewing due to their overall higher levels of amino acids . ... The most accurate way is to use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water in the kettle . One approach is to heat the water in your kettle to the desired temperature and then pour it into your teapot . Another approach is to heat the water to boiling and then let it cool down a bit before pouring into your teapot . <URL> for further background .
Basic Physics of the System Bread rises ( as you probably know ) due to microorganisms , primarily yeast , converting sugars into CO ₂ + byproducts . The CO ₂ forms bubbles , stretching the gluten in the flour . In order for the bread to rise , the microorganisms must produce CO ₂ faster than it can escape from the dough . Graphed over time , the amount of CO ₂ produced would start at 0 , fairly quickly rise to its maximum ( as the yeast , etc. come back from dormancy ) , then slowly decrease , eventually to 0 ( as they run out of food and/or are overwhelmed by byproducts such as alcohol ) . The amount of gas escaping from the dough also changes over time . It must obviously start at 0 , and probably increases over time ( after all , there is more to escape ) , and eventually of course its all escaped and thus it must be 0 again , but I 'm not sure of its exact shape . So , a diagram : That 's the basic physics of the system . At some point , the bread must fall . ( Well , maybe in a 0-g environment it would shrink instead of fall , but ... ) How the Environment Matters The microorganisms are very sensitive to fairly small changes in their environment . In particular : Temperature . If your kitchen is 70 ° F and the author 's is 80 ° F , it could easily take twice as long . The lower the temperature , the slow the microorganisms go ( up to a point , once it gets too hot , they 're not happy either ) . Hydration . If your bread dough is lower hydration ( drier ) than the author 's , it 'll be slowed down again . The recipe is written in volume measures ( cups ) , as you know flour packs down . That leads to huge variations in how two different people measure it . Make sure to measure it how the author says to ( hopefully it specified somewhere in the book ) . Scoop-and-sweep vs. sift-and-sweep can easily be 25 % different . Preferably , spend $ 25 on a kitchen scale , and do your baking by weight . Salinity . Salt slows down yeast . If you happened to substitute table salt for kosher salt , and still measured out 1 1/2 tablespoons , you 've used more salt than the author wanted . A fair bit more . Age of your yeast . If your yeast is old ( and sometimes the packets in the store have been sitting for ages ) , it may not have the same potency as a fresh packet would . It 'll probably take longer ( but as long as it rises , it 'll likely be fine ) The times in the book could just be nonsense . Authors and editors do sometimes make mistakes . Other times they 're in a rush , and just take a guess . " Yeah , it was about two hours ... " The book could just be wrong . Also , generally speaking , slower leads to better flavor . So its not a bad thing . Summary Give it longer . Provided you 've covered it in plastic ( so it does n't dry out ) , it 'll eventually fall . Keep in mind that " fall " does n't mean it 'll return to its original size , just that it 'll fall back from its maximum size . The " or flattens on top " comment in your book is a pretty accurate description of what it looks like . Normally , while its rising , there is a dome shape on top , with the center as the highest point . When it starts falling , that dome vanishes , and may even invert ( as in , the center will be the lowest point ) . I 've made preferments that take upwards of 20 hours to fall . It will eventually happen . And when it takes forever , it 'll probably taste better .
Way too many variables . If you knew how warm the chicken was before cooking , how hot the cooking area is ( and whether that will change during the cooking time ) , how thick the chicken is , whether you 're cooking white or dark meat , and more , you might be able to make a good guess . I would not recommend cooking just thawed , thick pieces of chicken on an uncovered grill . Too easy to make it hard on the outside and dry on the inside . I would n't estimate lower than 20 minutes , but it will almost certainly be longer . Edit : Here 's a " Good Eats " video about doing chicken on a grill . <URL> It 's better to go ahead and cut the chicken up the rest of the way for grilling so that each type and size of meat can be on it 's own cooking schedule .
Ripening of the avocado is slowed down greatly by refrigeration , so it is usually a good idea to let the avocado ripen fully at room temperature . Once it is ripe , it can be stored in the refrigerator for at least a week . This way , it is ready to use whenever you want it . Fortunately , there is a day or two when the avocado is ripe , but not too ripe , so if you check on it everyday when ripening , you will be able to save it at the correct ripeness without worrying about it too much . Putting an unripened avocado in the refrigerator may prevent it from ever ripening completely . Once cooled to near freezing ( 40F in most refrigerators ) , it seems that some avocados ( maybe it depends on the type ) do n't ripen anymore , even when removed to room temperature .
The reason you 're seeing conflicting opinions is because there are a number of factors ( including steel composition , grind angle , grind profile , and usage ) that contribute to a knife 's edge-holding ability . German/European knives are made of a softer steel than Japenese knives - they need sharpening more often but are easier to sharpen because of the softness . Since the steel in Japanese harder , it needs to be sharpened less often . The other factor is the angle of the edge - the German/European angle is flatter than the Japanese knives . This means the German knives take ' abuse ' better on the edge and requires less sharpening because of that . You can see below that there are two different angles : As far as which requires sharpening less , I 'd say it depends on how general purpose your knife is going to be . If its going to be going through bone and all sorts of things , the German edge will probably stay a bit better and the softer steel will re-hone better . If you 're mainly cutting veggies , breads , cheeses , and other soft items - the Japanese knife will last longer because the difference of edge does n't matter as much as the steel here .
Lactobacillus is the genus of the bacteria responsible for making yogurt . These bacteria consume sugars and excrete lactic acid . The acid denatures the proteins in the milk , causing them to coagulate into a delicious gel . Lactobacilli can consume sugars other than just lactose . <URL> The reason they eat lactose when making yogurt is because that 's what they have . There is more than enough lactose in milk to make yogurt . There 's no reason to add other sugars . Lactobacilli are also responsible for the fermentation of pickles . In that case , even though they still produce lactic acid , they are consuming the sugars available in the vegetables , not lactose .
It 's my opinion that the " proper temperature " is a number set by lawyers , not by chefs . The government standard for a roast bird is 180 ° F ( 83 ° C ) ! Are you kidding me ? HTST pasteurization is 161 ° F ( 72 ° C ) for 20 seconds , but my turkey has to get to 180 ° F for safe human consumtion ? What the hell kind of bacteria do they think live in there ? 165 ° F ( 74 ° C ) is a common number , and a pretty decent one , though I always take mine out before that for the reason below . You need to remember that the internal temperature of the bird will continue to rise for a while after you take it out of the oven : the heat on the outside is still migrating inward . If you wait to take it out until the internal temperature is the " right " temperature , by the time it peaks , it 'll be 10 ° F ( ~ 5 ° C ) HIGHER than the right temperature , and that 's in the dry zone . We 're talking 190 ° F ( 88 ° C ) thanksgiving football . Blech . Dark meat almost always handles being overcooked better than lighter meat . The breast is the hardest part of the turkey to cook correctly . If you haggle with the temperature , and your white meat is still on the dry side , you might try brining the bird for 24 hours or so . It makes a big difference in terms of juiciness .

How do you cook quinoa ?
Quinoa naturally contains a bitter compound on the outside of the seed . Usually you have to rinse the quinoa to remove the bitterness but most commercial quinoa seems to have already been rinsed . So , I no longer rinse my quinoa . If you have time , it 's nice to heat a pan and add the quinoa and toast it a little ( for a nutty flavor and fluffier texture ) , then add water and salt . I typically bring the water to a boil ( 2 cups water to 1 cup quinoa plus 1/4 tsp salt ) , cover and reduce the heat to a simmer for 10-20 minutes ( or until the little tails release ) . Lately I 've found that using a rice cooker is a no-fuss way to prepare quinoa . I usually just do quinoa , water and sea salt but you can add spices while cooking it if you want to enhance the flavor . I would add vegetables afterwards . Quinoa is so quick-cooking I would n't see the need for a pressure cooker .
Also , I would add that I tend to cook in batches , rather than overfilling the pan . So using a large deep skillet put enough in to cover about 2/3 of the base , and cook on high heat til browned etc. . Then I put it into a warmed bowl as I cook the next batch , until I have a full bowl of cooked mince , which I can then put back into the pan to simmer and turn into whatever the end dish is .
Breathe through your mouth . The tear-causing chemicals in onions are absorbed through the nasal mucous membrane . By breathing through your mouth , they do n't get much contact with the fumes and wo n't absorb nearly as much .
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
There are many dishes where chicken and rice are cooked mixed together in the same pot . Look at Arroz con Pollo for example , it 's an easy classic and there are loads of recipes . There 's also some types of Biryani , Jambalaya , and other traditional recipes from across the world that would work . Chicken pieces and rice cook in about the same time as you say , if you want to get vegetables in there it 's a bit more complicated as you want the vegetables to be cooked , but not overcooked . I 've generally made them separately to put put as a side as it 's more attractive , however large carrot chunks cook about the same time , and you can put in pureed vegetables or even vegetable juice . One my mother makes uses crushed tomatoes instead of water to cook the rice in . As for having the chicken mixed in or on top there 's no right answer , I like to brown the chicken and lay it skin side up on top of the rice as the rice will cook up around the chicken and the visual effect is good when the pot is put on the table . Visuals aside there 's little difference in the method .
White pre-cooked corn flour , water , pinch of salt and cooked in the pan is the traditional way of making and cooking arepas . However , cookery is a living and evolving subject and very much a matter of personal taste . I strongly recommend you experiment with the different flours , milk or water or half and half , cooked in the pan and in the oven and decide for yourself which you prefer and which comes closest to the ones you 've tried and liked .

The true aficionado would claim that you actually do n't store cooked pasta , but for those cases where this is n't viable , you have a few options : Pasta that will be cooled and re-heated later , e.g. left overs Drain well , cool , refrigerate . The pasta will stick , but you can dump it in hot salted water foe a bit to re-heat where it will unstick again . Not perfectly al dente , but probably ok . ( Slightly undercooking pasta can mitigate this a bit . ) Pasta that should stay warm , e.g. on a buffet Add a bit of fat ( olive oil , butter ... ) to coat your pasta . Keeps it from sticking . Critics claim that it also keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta . Adding the sauce can have a similar effect , but you risk soggy pasta . Pasta that should stay cold , e.g. pasta salad The only case where rinsing pasta is kind of allowed . Side effect : cool pasta ( well drained after rinsing ) can be mixed even with heat-sensitive dressings right away , avoiding stickiness issues again .
I can imagine a few ways of doing it based on the texture you 're looking for , and what you have to work with . Remove the meat from the casing and fry the meat in a pan . You 'll basically be cooking ground meat which will allow you to easily seasons it and also integrate it into other foods . This method also allows you to season the actual meat if you want to . Cut the sausages into disks and fry them in a pan . This will leave you with more body than the first method , and also allow you to really get some good color on the flat parts of the cut sausage . Leave them whole , poke holes in them , and cook them on anything . I would n't do this for the application you 're looking for . You will eventually be cutting them up , and if you cut them after cooking , you wo n't have the browning that you could have had .
When cooking Chinese ribs , they are usually boiled down ... ( I am a cook from Hong Kong ) We usually cut the ribs bone-attached into small cubes before cooking , quite unlike the western cooking style . stir-frying : Usually we stir-fry the rib with a sauce of choice ; black bean and chili is my favourite . One can also use the sweet-sour ( sometimes with the ribs sort of diced with bone attached , fried with a flour dip ) , and chinese preserved vinegar ( This is often an unpleasent flavour for most foreigners who are n't familiar with it IMHO ) steaming : You can marinade the rib , either with black bean and chili or sometimes plum-sauce and a little bit of salt to taste . Then just throw it in there and steam it done . The resultant meat is nicely done and we mix the sauce with the rice to make it great tasting ( sort of a good idea when i 'm out of money and need to eat more rice , and less meat ... The sauce is then quite rich in pork fat though , unhealthy , pardon me ... ) braising : this one is often done with five spice , sometimes red preserved-tofu ( nam-yu , as we call it in cantonese ) . or you can make your own homemade marinade by using different amount of ( 1 ) soy-sauce , ( 2 ) salt , ( 3 ) pepper ( white ) and ( 4 ) sugar . Then stir-fry it , or saute it , then optionally you can add little bit of starch-water to get the ' sauce ' thickened , and serve . Sometimes we use the oyster sauce to marinade the food as well , but mind you that the quality differs , if you want the best , I would suggest ' lee-kam-kee ' premium , old-style oyster sauce for this purpose , for best result , add sugar .
No you do not need to remove them , unless you 're talking about very large squid . Good to eat ? I prefer the flesh and not the tentacles , but basically anything that is n't what you remove when cleaning ( the internal ' bone ' and assorted goop attached to it ) is fine . Best method for cooking is very , very fast -- squid needs fast nigh heat , usually no more than 40-60 seconds depending on size . Dust with cornstarch and deep fry very fast , or sautee in butter very fast . Too long and you will be chewing rubber .
Tomato paste is just tomatoes with the water removed , essentially . I 'd slice the tomatoes in half and roast them ( cut side up ) at 350 degrees F for an hour ( this will concentrate the flavour nicely and you can add s &amp; p/olive oil/herbs/garlic if you want ) . Then mash them through a sieve or food mill to get a smooth consistency . Then put that tomato puree in a pot and just boil them down until it 's as thick as you want . As it gets thicker , you 'll need to stir it regularly to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning .
Cook 's Illustrated recommends storing lemons in the fridge in a tightly sealed ziptop bag with the excess air removed . I would imagine that the same applies to limes . As I understand it , the idea is to prevent air circulation in order to reduce the rate of dehydration . <URL>
It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container . If the moisture is at a safe ( low ) level , then mold wo n't grow . See for example , <URL> , which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8 % for retail storage/shipping , although if you look at their data table , it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5 % range ( which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool , dry place ) . Honestly , cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities . Most likely what you 're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats ( the process which causes rancidity ) without actual full-blown rancidity . Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure . If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer ( sealed , to prevent contamination or off-odours ) . Although most ( all ? ) nuts are considered shelf-stable , they do keep longer in the fridge or freezer .
Funnily enough I made some of these just a week ago . They 're not at all difficult to make and you can use any rind , which your butcher should be able to supply . Depending on your health considerations , you can oven cook them or you can part oven cook part fry . Oven cook method : Cut the rinds into 4 by 4cm pieces Place in a pan of boiling water for 10 minutes allow to cool , then place in the fridge until the skins feel ' dry ' approx 2 hours Preheat the oven to 220c ( 425f ) and place the rinds on a baking sheet . Season and place in the oven Turn the oven down to 180c ( 350f ) and cook for about an hour . You will need to drain the fat a couple of times . Let them cool and add more seasoning , if needed . The Oven/Fry method Cut the rinds into pieces that will fit on a rack over a baking tray ( not small pieces ) Half fill a baking tray with water and place the seasoned rinds on a rack over they tray Roast these in the oven at 220 to 230c ( 350 to 450f ) for 10 to 15 minutes . When they 've changed colour and start to bubble they 're done . Remove form the oven and cut into 4 by 4cm strips In a pan half filled with very hot veggie oil or a deep fat fryer , cook in batches until they ' puff ' up around 2 to 3 minutes . Remove and let the oil be taken-up by paper towel . Season and you 're good to go . I tried both methods and I preferred the second , something about frying them just ' felt ' right :)
Most dishes require a chopped leek in any case , but for an uncut leek you will have to separate by hand and wash each leaf separately . If you want the leek in an untouched form I think you 're out of luck . You could try reassembling it after separating and washing :) Depending on the form you want your leaves in there are different ways . If you want them in strips you just cut lengthwise from above the root - keep the root on for now . Then you can rinse the leaves as they should be easy to separate . After rinsing remove the root . For ' chopped ' leaves cut the leek lengthwise and chop crosswise , removing the root in the process . The leaves will separate , and you can then wash the dirt from them in a colander . Skipping the lengthwise cut will usually make the leaves stay together , trapping the grit you want to get at . If you want to make doubly sure , you could first place the cut leeks in a bowl and swirl it around . The dirt will separate to the bottom . You can then take out the leeks and finish rinsing in the colander . Do n't pour the bowl into the colander as this just pours the grit over the leaves .
This recipe for <URL> has instructions for cleaning them . You can either cut off the heads , or if you choose to retain them : Make a shallow cut along the head , being careful not to cut too deep and puncture the innards . Carefully but firmly pull out everything inside . Cut the head off , turn it inside out and use a knife to scrape away the innards . In both cases , if a small black , triangular beak does not come out along with everything else , then push your finger up through the middle of the body and the beak should pop out . As explained in <URL> , you will want to cook octopus very briefly so it does not get rubbery , or for a long time , to move past the rubbery stage . If , as mentioned in the question , you wish to fry them , the cooking time may be <URL> . Some recipes suggest <URL> per side . For specific recipes , you can google " baby octopus recipe " .
I suggest using a brine . Lots of brining details can be found in the answers to this question : <URL> Alton Brown has a really great recipe for <URL> . You can watch the <URL> on YouTube in which he covers brining turkey . I also suggest reading <URL> ( PDF ) from Cook 's Illustrated .
I have had the same issue when cooking lots of quesadillas , and have found the following combination of techniques to work quite well . The obvious answer has been hit upon already , lower the heat . But I think that 's missing an important aspect of the issue . What 's happening is most likely that you are turning on the heat and then cooking your first omelet before the pan has actually reached temperature . Depending on the type of pan , it can take up to 5 mins for the pan to reach temperature . So , as you continue to cook , the pan is getting closer to temperature . Of course , each time you add more cold egg , the temp decreases again . So your heat is too hot , but it does n't really become apparent until the last omelet . Rather than just starting at a lower temperature though , start at the same temp you tried and then turn down the temperature as you continue to cook . The pan can also heat rapidly between omelets . Take the pan off the heat , swirl your butter or oil through it , add the egg , and then put it back on the heat . If it seems really hot when you add the egg , you can cook it for a second with just the radiant heat of the pan before returning to the burner . This will stop the pan from getting too hot between omelets .
That is simply caramelized sugar that coats the dish before the custard is poured in for baking . As the flan is chilled , the moisture from the custard liquefies the caramelized sugar and results in the sauce . If you 're wanting to make it for other desserts and are n't making flan , then simply caramelize sugar and then add water to it . Be careful as the steam can easily burn you if you 're standing over it . The sugar will seize up and then as it continues to cook the crytallized caramelized sugar will liquefy . You will then have caramelized sugar syrup .

Non-alcoholic substitute for brandy ?
It depends what the recipe is , but I 've successfully replaced brandy with orange juice or apple juice in the past . It 's not a direct replacement for the flavour , of course , but gives a similar strength of flavour , if you see what I mean .
well veggie/cheese wise , i would recommend either of : Chickpeas drained in salt water and paprika and grilled in the oven for about 10 minutes Portobello mushrooms cut into large chunks fried halloumi large chunks of celery sauteed in salt pepper , and chili
I 'd say about 1 clove for every half-teaspoon of garlic powder . There is n't going to be anything particularly scientific about this , since garlic cloves vary in size , strength and flavor but that will be in the ballpark .
US Jalapeno and Anahiems ( red jalapenos ) are usually under 2,500 . If you cook them a little bit , it will also reduce the spiciness , while maintaining the flavor .
Sort of . If you have sesame seeds on hand , grind some up . You could also use toasted sesame oil , and even combine it with the ground seeds . You can also use all-natural peanut butter . Do n't use mass market crap with sugar and other additives . The ingredients should list only : peanuts , salt . Obviously , this will taste like peanuts . It will still taste good in a hummus , but it will be a distinctly different hummus than with tahini .
I would n't attempt to substitute . I 've read somewhere that you can use regular lime leaves , but I 've never seen those anywhere . Even Googling for lime leaf turns up kaffir lime leaves . They can be found easily enough online : <URL> . They freeze well for months in just a zip-lock bag . The flavor profile is best described as a bright floral aromatic . It 's similar in function , not taste , to a bay leaf . Thai cuisine uses kaffir lime leaves much as we do bay leaves . If you decide buying online is n't worth the hassle , then <URL> suggests the following substitute : 1/2 a small bay leaf 1/4 tsp of lime zest 1/8 tsp of fresh lemon thyme
I would halve the amount of icing sugar and substitute in cocoa powder . As long as you sift the cocoa powder well you should still have a smooth icing at the end . Provided your chocolate is n't milk chocolate you should still have a ' proper ' chocolate flavour as well .
Oxtail would be your most likely substitute , but you have indicated you can not obtain it . The next best choice ( of those widely available ) is probably chuck , which is the shoulder muscle , and is well worked and flavored . It requires low and slow cooking for best results , much like shanks and tail do . Some stores -- even the chain grocery stores -- will special order for you if you ask them to , so you might be able to get shank . Depending on where you live , you may also try butchers at farmers ' markets , Dutch markets , or similar .
Any of those will work , but you want a rim to prevent any drippings from making a mess in your oven . In general , the lower the sides , the better for overall air circulation around the roast , but it is not essential . If you want to be able to deglaze the pan , avoid the ceramic or glass pan , as they can not be used stove-top . Using celery ( and carrots ) as a make shift roasting stand is very effective . They will add their aroma to the pan juices , which is often a good thing . ( Note that by the time the roast is done , they are usually spent and not worth eating . ) IF you do n't want the flavor from vegetables , any small rack which will fit will work . If you do n't have one , you can improvize one by crumpling up aluminum foil into a long snake shape , and coiling or zig-zagging it on the pan just large enough to fit the roast . For a slow roasted pork shoulder , you could also go without any rack or elevation , at the cost to some small amount of crust development on the bottom . Depending on your desires , this may or may not matter -- when I do an indoor pork shoulder for pulling , I do n't bother with a rack .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .
Given the science as Kenji Alt explained it in his article , the key fact of the vodka is that it is 80 proof , or 40 % alchohol . So beer , which usually is on the order of 4 to 6 percent alcohol ( yes , there are outliers ) will not have the same level of inhibition of the gluten formation . The vodka is not the only factor in the recipe leading to crispiness and good crust , so you will probably still get very good results with the beer , assuming you like the flavor profile it brings to the wings , but it wo n't be quite the same . If you use another liquer that is on the order of 80 proof , again assuming you like the flavor profile , you should get quite similar results . This would include mixing grain alcohol with water or orange juice or whatever to the appropriate ratio . Other than some white wine for cooking , though , I do n't buy spirits so I do n't what would be more economical -- and that might vary from region to region .
Decent port is not necessarily expensive ; you may find yourself spending more on the meat . For example , Sandeman 's Founders Reserve 750 ml runs about US$ 15 before taxes , Dow 's Fine Tawny 750 ml is about US$ 13 , and Graham 's Six Grapes Ruby 750 ml is about US$ 8 ( and this is just the start of the list ) . These are , perhaps , not the connoisseur 's choices , but they are hardly undrinkable . Depending on the laws where you live , you ( or your favorite wine shop ) can order any of these online from a variety of sources . Port has a unique character that is not easy to replicate with any other wine or fortified wine . If you are trying to replicate a result , do not substitute . If you really want something else that will serve the same role even if it will taste different , I would look to a Madeira , a cream sherry , or sweet Marsala ( depending on your tastes ) .
Short answer : no , you can not without radically changing the recipe until it is something completely different . See my answer here for more information : <URL>
Fenugreek seeds are intensely aromatic and go quite nicely in curries , and any dish where such a flavour is required . In the middle-east they use it quite a lot , often as a condiment . Highly used in spice rubs , pickles , marinades , anything where a strong spice flavour is required and often in puddings as an aromatic like nutmeg is used in English cooking . The leaves have a similar flavour , but not quite the same , you could use the seeds in their place adding them in to the spice mix if there is one , but the leaves I prefer personally . The flavour of methi leaves in thepla or in curry is wonderful in my opinion .
I found a highly rated <URL> on food.com . I have n't personally tried it , but it 's highly rated on that site , and is ridiculously simple . 1 16 oz block of cream cheese 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream Blend until smooth Try it and let us know ? :)
Dupe , but a good question . See Satanicpuppies answer here : <URL> I know you asked re : cranberry sauce specifically , but this is a great article regarding the differences in sugars , generically , which might help in the future : " Sugar can be a single molecule made up of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen -- like glucose and fructose . Other sugars , like sucrose , or white table sugar , are made up of multiple molecules ( in this case , one glucose and one fructose ) , tied together with chemical bonds . Now , when sucrose is heated with an acid , it breaks back down into the two smaller sugars , glucose and fructose , resulting in something we call invert sugar . This small chemical change makes a big difference : While sucrose is hygroscopic , invert sugar is even more water-loving . And this can make a tremendous difference when , say , you want to bake a chewy , rather than crunchy , cookie . " <URL>
The most widely-accepted substitute seems to be various sauces made from mushrooms . I do n't want to say " mushroom sauce " because most products do n't have that exact name . For example : Here you have " Vegetarian Mushroom Flavored Stir-Fry Sauce " on the left , and " Premium Shitake Mushroom Flavored Soy Sauce " on the right . I 'm actually not familiar with the one in the middle and not sure what the whole label says - it might be the same as the first . If you go to a specialty Asian food store , you might actually find a product called " vegetarian oyster sauce " , which is pretty much the same thing . Failing that , you can always substitute soy sauce , or hoisin sauce if you want a less watery texture . They wo n't be exactly the same , but it 's the same general idea ( dark , fermented , salty sauce rich in glutamates ) . " Fish sauce " will be very close to oyster sauce in taste , but may still contain shellfish , so be careful .
Since dietary fiber is made mostly of cellulose that is n't broken down during cooking I do n't think it should be an issue . The browning that occurs is from the proteins and sugars already in the onion . <URL>
On first blush , you will probably want a fat or oil with similar qualities as the " vegetable " oil you 're replacing , such as olive oil . Butter has a much lower a smoke point , however , cornbread recipes exist that use butter or lard . I 'd be willing to experiment , particularly if you 're used to cooking with butter . ( Just be careful with heat . ) As far as quantity , I 'd use a bit less than 1/3 of a cup , but that 's me being defensive as I do n't know the recipe you 're using .
You could whip your own cream . Use 1/3 of the amount of heavy cream as cool whip , and whip with a splash of vanilla extract and a pinch of sugar to taste , either by hand or with a mixer . If a recipe calls for 1 cup of " whipped topping " , you would start with 1/3 cup of heavy cream which whips up to 1 cup .

How can you judge when a non-stick pan is the correct temperature for pan frying ?
You should n't heat a non stick pan without the oil , because it is too easy to overheat it and ruin the coating . So , I put oil inside first , and tell by the state of the oil . It smells , looks and flows different when it is hot enough . You can also learn to judge if there is sufficient heat when you hold your palm at a given distance above the pan , but in my experience , you learn to judge by the oil before you have gotten good enough to keep the same distance and to distinguish " enough " from " not enough " heat . If you do n't have enough experience to know when the oil is ready , you have to do it repeatedly until you learn it . It takes a few less-than-great meals if you do it purely by trial and error , and goes better if you use an infrared thermometer . You can also try floating cubes of stale white bread and watch their browning behavior , but I find this method too involved logistically - you have to have the bread , cut it , then deal with messy pieces of oily bread , and end up with slowly charring crumbles in your pan .
Pan frying means letting the food sit in the pan and occasionally stirring or flipping . It tends to be done with larger pieces of food , and at a medium to medium-high heat . Sautéing means shaking the pan back and forth - making the food " jump " , if you 're translating directly . It 's done at a high heat , for a short time , usually with thinly-sliced or finely-chopped ingredients . Shallow frying , according to some references , refers to the food being partially ( halfway ) submerged in hot oil and flipped once , as opposed to deep-frying where the food is fully-submerged the whole time .

A couple things : make sure you 're removing enough of the fat from the pan . Too much fat will keep the sauce thin ( and will also tend to separate out afterwards ) . Also , fat will not evaporate -- if your remaining liquid is fat , the temperature will rapidly rise , and very quickly things will burn . depending on what you 're adding , you may need to use a thickener . There is a reason three of the five mother sauces have roux . ( Hollandaise has egg , which thickens , Tomate has tomato which has lots of pectin , which also thickens , so those two do n't need it ) . A good stock or broth has plenty of gelatin , which will thicken especially upon cooling . When you add your deglazing liquid , you need to thoroughly scrape up the fond and stir it in . Keep stirring , especially towards the end when its somewhat thick . Also especially if your pan has hot spots . Turn down the temperature . This should go without saying when things are burning . Some heat helps with deglazing , but after that you do n't actually need anything more than a low simmer -- higher evaporates faster ( important , since the meat is often resting &amp; cooling ) but not burning the sauce is more important .
Deglazing removes caramelized bits ( the " browned " bits ) from the bottom of your pan or skillet after cooking meats or vegetables . It is usually accomplished by putting stock , sauce , wine , or even water ( or really any liquid ) in the pan over heat after the pan has been emptied of whatever was cooked into it and any rendered fat and scraping the browned bits into that sauce with a spatula . The browned bits dissolve into your liquid to create an excellent sauce for whatever you just cooked in the pan .
I use bleach to remove mold and mildew stains from my bathroom and while the process would be gross , I would think that once thoroughly washed the bleach would n't cause any harmful effects to the pan or to future snacking humans .
In general places that do this with pancakes do not cut-out , but indeed use a mold or the like . The scrambled eggs would likely look fine " cut " , but part of a pancake is the edge , even if it is modified by touching the edge of the mold . So long as the mold is metal , your dollar-store purchases should be fine . You will likely need to oil/butter them in some way so that the product - batter or egg - does not stick to the metal itself . I have myself used clean old tuna tins to make round " self-contained " fried eggs for a home version of a McMuffin .
Greasing and lining with paper is something of a belt-and-braces approach to simply ensure the cake does n't stick to the bottom of the tin . I have several recipes that go one step further and suggest greasing the paper as well afterwards . As you suggest , greasing the tin first also stops it from curling up .
The way to make a proper griddled hamburger : Start with beef that is between 70/30 and 80/20 . You need to use a fatty beef because you are going to be doing a few things that will restrict the amount of juice in the burger and the extra fat will mitigate that . Season your beef and roll into balls less than 1/4 of a pound . Let the size of your patties be determined by the size of your pan , you need them small enough that once you smash you wo n't be touching the sides of the pan . You then want to preheat your pan . You want your pan to be as hot as possible . A commercial griddle can range in heat between 375 F and 650 F , so the temp here can vary quite a bit between places , I find hotter aids crust formation and allows the interior stay closer to medium . Do not use oil . I ca n't stress that enough . Your beef will put out plenty and oil will fry the burger instead of allowing a seared crust to develop . Place your balls of meat on the pan and smash them flat with a spatula . You might need a second spatula to remove the patty from the smashing one , as you lack the space space to heat it like you would on a griddle to prevent sticking . Allow it to cook about two to three minutes , then flip and top with cheese , if desired . Two more minutes and remove . As an added bonus , you can toast/fry some bread in the beef juices to create a patty melt style burger that will be oozing beefy goodness . You can drop the bread in right after the flip and it will be perfect by the time the patty is done .
You have to make sure to buy a heavy duty , preferrably professional grade pan . Thick base . Most important . I have owned my pans for about five years , and nary a warp . Completely flat . I also have a glass top stove . Note to the wise , do not use a dishwasher to clean good cookware . Always clean pans , pots , knives , etc. by hand . Any good restaurant supply house will have good quality non stick pans . Also , I ' m not sure where you live , but many large department stores ( JC Penny in the States , the Bay here in Canada ) have good quality wares . Be aware , they do not come cheap , but they will not have to soon be replaced .
A metal pan will not crack simply from cold liquid . If you heat it up to a very high temperature and submerge it in cold water , that 's not such a good idea . But deglazing is just a tiny amount of liquid . Now , aluminum is another story - if it 's hot enough and you pour cold water ( or cold anything ) on it , it can warp , even with a relatively small amount of liquid . And for Teflon and other " coated " cookware , you can ruin the coating that way . But heavier steel or cast iron - no way . If you 're really concerned , just keep the deglazing liquid at room temperature . Deglazing is usually done with vinegar and you keep that at room temperature anyway , right ? I deglaze my CI all the time with cider vinegar and have never experienced even the tiniest crack in 10 years . I 'm pretty sure it 's safe . It 's great , actually ; CI deglazes very easily , you just need a small splash of vinegar .
I see no reason that a cast iron waffle pan should be treated differently in regards to seasoning than other cast iron . Since it wo n't be cooking anything with significant fat in it naturally , if anything it may be more important ! Seasoning is both for non-stick reason and non-oxidizing reasons . Season it well on your own , then use it with some fat ( of some kind ) very lightly brushed on to keep it well . Only brushing right before use will keep one good likely , but would take a long , long time to naturally season since a large portion of the fat will immediately get used by the food . Cast iron gets gummy if you either 1 ) season with a spray like Pam consistently or 2 ) do n't cook your seasoning long enough and/or high enough . Use a fat , bacon fat , would be great here and season away - properly . In regards to seasoning , I recommend checking out <URL> , as its unneeded to replicate detailed information elsewhere in the site .
I suggest getting a quality stainless clad saute pan or saucier . For years I made risotto in the <URL> shown here : Unless you 're serving huge portions this is plenty of room for 6 servings of risotto . There are larger options available though , including a mammoth 14 " 6 quart one . This pan easily does 90 % of the work in my kitchen , so at any price it carries its weight in the kitchen . That said , this past Christmas I got the <URL> shown here : It 's a very close matchup , but this pan is perfect for making risotto . The higher sides are a definite benefit , but you do n't sacrifice much in flat surface area . The copper core is amazingly responsive , noticeably more so than aluminum . It 's obviously rather expensive , so if you 're uncomfortable spending that much on a pan I 'd suggest getting one of their regular 3 qt sauciers -- you 'll spend at least half as much . If I only had one pan in my kitchen though , I think I 'd still go back to the saute pan above . Its versatility is just unmatched . Regarding your concerns that a wider pan wo n't heat as evenly , this is generally true for a cheaper pan . However , All-Clad pans use magic to bond a layer of aluminum ( or copper ) between a layer of magnetic stainless ( exterior ) and 18/10 stainless ( interior ) . The end result is a very even heat which you can actually confirm with an infrared thermometer .
Boiling the milk in the microwave is the only way to do this " unattended " , and that requires a lot of trial and error to get the time just right . It also wo n't work with many recipes that involve stirring anything into the milk while cooking . Out of the microwave , I use a non-stick pan , but even that requires scraping the bottom from time to time a bit to prevent solids from forming . ( I use a rubber spatula for this . ) I usually boil the milk on its own and and combine it with the rest of the recipe later .
As others have said , the issue is the hot oil and water interacting . You need to reduce or eliminate one in order to prevent the splatter or find a way to mitigate the damage . Remember the basics - allow the meat to warm up to room temperature before cooking and pat it dry before you begin . That should allow you to use less oil without it turning into a charred lump with a raw center . You can use a lid or a screen to prevent splatter ( you might need to adjust cooking time with a lid that will trap more heat ) .
As you suggest , there are a number of factors , but the best rule of thumb I 've found for pan-frying is to use just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan by swirling it around . In general , you do n't want puddles ( you 'll get splashed with hot oil ) , but if the pan is n't covered then your food might not get cooked evenly . These days I mostly just eyeball it , and err on the generous side . Using slightly too much is n't likely to hurt your dish - unused oil just wo n't get absorbed - but using too little will result in under-cooked or inconsistently-cooked food and probably a lot of gunk stuck to the bottom of your pan . So if you 're not sure , just add a little more than you think you absolutely need .
Per the information on <URL> , there is no mention of the pan being pre-seasoned . But there is also no mention of needing to do so . From the maintenance tab on the linked page : Before you cook Remove all labels and packaging materials . Before using your new cookware , wash thoroughly in hot soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge . Dry completely . General cooking tips Prior to each use , it is recommended to add a teaspoon of cooking oil for better cooking results . Never heat an empty utensil . Be sure there is oil , butter , liquid or food before placing the cookware on the range or burner . It is not recommended to use high heat . Cooking on excessive heat can cause permanent damage to the surface and utensil . Never cut anything in the cookware or use utensils with sharp edges as to avoid damaging the surface . Add salt to water only after is has come to a boil . Salt grain deposit on the cookware bottom will attack the metal as the heat melts it down . There is also other information about cleaning and oven use . All said , I do n't follow a set rule about seasoning non-stick cookware even though I 've often seen it recommended . But when I have heated oil in a non-stick pan it does seem to do better afterwards , especially with older pans . And I always hand wash non-stick cookware . To sum up , I do n't see how you could cause any harm by pre-seasoning the pan and occasionally reseasoning , even if it does n't need it . But this is based on my experience and I have n't used this brand . The only other thing I can suggest is to contact the company and see what they say . Since they do n't mention pre-seasoning , I suspect they will say it is n't necessary . If you do contact them , we 'd be interested in what you find out . And welcome to Seasoned Advice ! EDIT : I was assuming that the OP knew about seasoning a non-stick pan , as the question is about how to tell if a non-stick pan is pre-seasoned when new . To be very clear , seasoning a non-stick pan is NOT the same thing as seasoning a cast iron or other bare metal pan . Should you ( or anyone ) decide to season a non-stick pan , please make sure to follow a recommended procedure .
I have never made madeleines myself , but looking at the recipe and reading Elendil 's concerns about the batter running , I would think you could fashion an impromptu " madeleine pan " out of aluminum foil . It wo n't be the easiest thing in the world , and you 're not going to get the perfect shell look , but I think you 'll be able to get the right general shape and depth with a little craftwork . These look like something I would love to make , so I did a little research and a few people said they poured the batter into a sheet pan ( in a very thin layer ) and then cut them into squares after . Not exactly the same final product , but if you 're dying to use the batter I think it would still taste great . As Elendil suggested , the people who said they were able to make them on a cookie sheet found that they were very flat and crispy ( though still tasty ) .
I agree with everything rumtscho said in her answer . I would add the " crowding " may be a little vague because the density of food in the pan may vary significantly depending on what the ingredients are . It 's also worth noting that definitions of things like sauteing and sweating can vary a bit from person to person , and there are cooking techniques that seem to fall " in the middle " between these or ca n't really be classified under strict definitions of one or the other . They may be less effective in producing specific results , but they are often more practical for those who want to cook reasonably quickly without many stages for a single recipe . For example , take your <URL> . The quantities of chicken , onions , and mushrooms added will not make this a " strict " saute , which should generally allow all food to be in contact with the pan so conduction is the primary heating method . On the other hand , it 's not really a " strict " sweat either , which is usually done with lower heat ( not " medium high " as in the recipe ) and is n't generally done for browning ( unlike the recipe , which states to " brown the chicken well " ) . Some might call it pan-frying , given the bacon grease and large pieces of chicken , but the veggies will make this mixture more moist than typical frying in the first few minutes . So what is this recipe doing ? I 'm sure different people would have different opinions , but it 's a very common technique too . Often one throws a lot of ingredients in a pan that initially release moisture ( " sweating " ? ) over high heat , but after that initial burst of moisture evaporates off , the ingredients will begin to brown ( " sauteing " ? ) , though they might require periodic stirring to keep changing the food in contact with the very hot pan surface . To try to answer your question -- if you want Maillard reactions and browning , you either need to get the temperature of the food surface significantly above boiling or potentially cook for a much longer time . What amount of heat and the amount of acceptable " crowding " will depend on how quickly the food releases moisture and how long it takes for any released moisture to evaporate off . For example , if you 're cooking hamburgers in a skillet , they will often release a lot of moisture quickly . To avoid " crowding " and get acceptable browning you not only want all of the burgers in contact with the pan surface , but you also want to have significant gaps between the burgers to allow any water that might be released and pool around the burgers to evaporate as quickly as possible . Density of food pieces here is quite low with large gaps on the pan surface . But in other cases you might have much smaller gaps and even food piled up a few layers thick and still achieve browning . For another example , if you 're trying to create caramelized onions , you often do n't want to just brown the surface of the food ( as in burgers ) , but also cook them thoroughly for a long time to get adequate Maillard browning throughout . In that case , you might not want to saute in a strict sense where all food is in constant pan contact , since that might burn the onions prematurely . So , you can pile up the onions a bit more in the pan without it being " overcrowded , " since after the first 10 minutes or so of cooking , the liquid release starts to slow down significantly and the temperature of the food will rise . Periodic stirring will allow enough pan contact to encourage browning . Bottom line : In most cases , if you want browning , you need to avoid crowding so much that liquid pools in the pan . Then you 're really steaming or sweating or even simmering/boiling ( if enough liquid appears ) . If the liquid is evaporating fast enough that the food in contact with the surface can get above boiling , it 's easier to get browning . While it 's often more effective to do a " strict " saute or sweat or fry or whatever for very specific effects , recipes often combine such steps together to make the cooking easier -- for example , as in the recipe above , starting with a " crowded " pan that sweats and softens the food , but then cooking over high heat long enough that the food will eventually dry out and/or be in prolonged pan contact and allow for some browning . Other recipes might deliberately use an " overcrowded " pan with food that does n't release a lot of moisture but piled high over high heat ( and stirred frequently , like stir-frying ) , which effectively combines some of the sweating and sauteing effects and may allow you to get your cooking done more quickly and efficiently ( i.e. , without various stages and multiple pans ) .
I 'm going to take a wild guess at what 's happening , based on what I know of thermodynamics , ( but I could be wrong about the whole thing ) When a cakes and bread bakes , it bakes from the outside ... as it forms a crust , it can no longer rise . ( for yeast breads , this is why we slash the top , so it can get a little extra rise out of it ) With a cake , as the sides set , it 'll continue to rise in the middle , creating a domed top . With a metal tube pan , the heat from the outside of the pan conducts to the middle of the pan , so the middle will set shortly after the outside . ... With the silicone pan , you 've actually got an insulator ... the heat 's not going to conduct to the inside , so it 's going to be able to rise longer than around the inside -- basically , the domed cake , but you 've got something for it to stick to , so it does n't fall back down as it sets . As I do n't think the issue is distribution of the batter , I 'd recommend trying other techniques to reduce the domedness of the cake -- cook it at a lower temperature ( try 25F / 15C lower ) for a longer time . You ca n't remove the problem entirely , but you might be able to reduce it . I 'd also look at the instructions that might 've come with the pan -- it 's possible that they have reommendations on how to deal with the problem . ( and it 's possible that this might not be as significant a problem in convection ovens , but replacing your whole oven for a set of pans is kinda silly )

How long can fish be left out ?
A quote from the below link ; " Do not thaw frozen seafood at room temperature . Thaw in the refrigerator or defrost in the microwave oven . If thawing in the refrigerator , allow one to two hours per pound of seafood " . <URL> &amp; Another quote from the link below ; " ... If food is allowed to remain at room temperature for two hours or longer , bacteria can multiply and cause food poisoning . - Even a tiny amount of contaminated food can cause severe illness . If you have any doubt about the safety of the food , throw it out ! " <URL>
A mixture of flour and water at room temperature is a very hospitable growth medium for many bacteria , yeasts , and molds ; and indefinitely is a long time ... Even if you are extremely vigilant when it comes to kitchen hygiene , the mixture will eventually start to grow some form of microbes . This process could take a week or more to become obvious . If you use the batch up within a week or so it is unlikely to cause any problems . For longer storage you should refrigerate the dough and/or add salt ( in the proportional amount you would use for bread ) . If it develops an off smell or visible mold you are better off throwing it away . Keep in mind that hydrating flour , especially whole grain flours , activates amylase enzymes that break down starches into simple sugars . This process , called autolysis , improves browning and flavor , but if allowed to go on too long it leads to a gummy crumb or poor overall structure .
i have found that a lampe berger works well to eliminate strong scents after cooking ( http://www.lampeberger.us/ ) -- after all , they were originally invented to help reduce the odors in hospitals and mortuaries ! ( you can read about their history at wikipedia : <URL> ) . i use mine after a night of deep frying food to get that smell out . i 'm pretty certain it would work on fish just as well .
First of all , if you 're seasoning tilapia , you 'll want to add some oil to it , since tilapia has almost no fat . So , here 's the steps : Drizzle oil over the tilapia ( both sides ) . Sprinkle it lightly with the spice mixture , all over Let sit 10-15 minutes . Sprinkle with starch ( e.g. flour ) at this point if you 're frying them . Optionally , you can also add some lemon or lime juice ( just a little ) in step 1 . You also want the tilapia sitting on something flat , with the filets in one layer , like a large plate or baking sheet , not heaped up in a bowl . For spicing small filets , you want a finely ground , moderate-flavor spice mixture . Unlike beef or pork , you 're not marinating the fish for a long time , and you 're not cooking it for along time . So the spicing on the fish is n't really a " rub " ; it 's spicing to eat . I recommend against using rubs designed for meat on light fish like tilapia .
<URL> , generally on the very safe but a bit paranoid end of the spectrum , says : After eggs are refrigerated , they need to stay that way . A cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat , facilitating the movement of bacteria into the egg and increasing the growth of bacteria . Refrigerated eggs should not be left out more than 2 hours . ( They also say some very sad things about Easter egg hunts . ) So if you 're being strict , three days would be way too long . In reality , you 'd probably be okay . The chances of getting salmonella are definitely higher , but are presumably still small ( though I ca n't say exactly how small , of course ) . Personally , given the price of a dozen eggs , I 'd probably play it safe . Another answer mentions that in the UK eggs are stored at room temperature . That 's true in quite a lot of places , but I 'm guessing that they 've avoided the large temperature swing issue mentioned by the FDA , so if your friend 's eggs were refrigerated in the store , the situation 's not quite the same as in the UK .
To decrease the bitterness , bring out the sweetness in the carrots by cooking for longer . The best technique I 've found to do this with carrots is frying and steaming them at a low temperature . Make glazed carrots : per 200g of carrot , peel , cut into ~ 2cm thick diagonal cuts and add 40g butter , a half teaspoon of sugar and season with salt and black pepper . In a large lidded pan over a low heat , spread the carrots out in a single layer , add the lid and cook for 25-35 minutes . Shake the pan occasionally . Push the cooking time as long as you can without letting the carrots become overly soft . This should give deliciously sweet fragrant carrot . Another thing to keep in mind is that salt is better than sugar to reduce bitterness so add as much as you can without oversalting the carrots .

There are charts for when bacteria and parasites die . You will just have to check the internal temperature of the meat with a thermometer . Once it has reached the minimal temperature which makes you feel safe , you can remove it from the heat . It does n't matter if you are steaming or using any other method . This is a safety-oriented chart from Jeff Potter 's book <URL> . And this is a detailed protein chart from McGee 's <URL>
A few fly traps can help matters tremendously . Take a plastic bottle , like for water or soda , and slice it in two just below the neck . Now take the neck of the bottle , invert it , and place it inside the base of the bottle . Add a few centimeters of " bait " . When I had a terrible fly problem last year , I learned that flies really like the energy drink " Rock Star " . Go figure . After a couple of days with three traps in my kitchen , I no longer had a problem .
This depends on a lot of things . The idea of preheating is that you want to get all the surfaces inside your oven ( walls , floor , door , racks ) up to the desired cooking temperature . This makes for more even temperatures throughout the oven , and gives a little thermal mass so you do n't lose ALL your heat when you open the door for a few seconds or put something cold in there . Then there 's the question of what you 're putting in the oven . An aluminum sheet with a few room temperature cookies on it wo n't pull the temperature in the oven down like a 25 pound turkey that 's 40F/5C inside . You want to be more careful to do a complete preheat if you 're going to be soaking up a lot of your starting heat . Our oven , which has a large baking stone in the bottom all the time , takes a while to get uniformly up to temperature , even after the oven says it 's preheated , because the stone does n't heat up as fast as the rest of the surfaces . It takes at least 20 minutes after the " I 'm fully heated " beep before the stone is fully up to temp . We have problems with things baking poorly if we do n't preheat for quite a while , but on the upside , if we put a cold roast in or open the door a lot , the temperature in the oven stays pretty high . If your oven is lightweight , flimsy or drafty , it may be as hot as it 's going to get the moment the preheat alert goes off . 45 minutes is probably a lot more preheat than you 'll need in almost any case . In some cases even 15 minutes is more than you need . It really depends on your oven and what you 're putting in .
What Tim said . Eggs just do n't hold very well , and they are very sensitive to temperature -- reheating them basically will mean re-cooking them . I would never store eggs in this manner , because the texture and flavour degradation will make them unpleasant to eat . However , to actually answer your question -- and again , I urge you not to do this because stored and reheated eggs will taste like garbage -- cooked eggs should keep for up to 72 hours in the refrigerator . Remember to chill them as rapidly as possible after cooking , and you may wish to undercook slightly in order to minimize problems when reheating . I would use 72 hours as an absolute maximum , particularly if you are undercooking . 48 hours is probably wiser .
I have had some success with this recipe : <URL> The fish should keep for a couple of weeks once pickled , but I always tend to eat mine in the first few days .
Food tends to become unpleasant before it becomes actually dangerous . I would try to eat things within 3 days of making them , though that 's just my personal guideline and is n't based on any scientific data . If you are n't going to eat it that quickly , freezing it after it 's been cooked and thawing it the day you want to eat it is probably a better idea .
The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick , which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold ; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2 " , maybe a little more than 1/4 " . The other " trick " is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets , which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich ; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you do n't have tension trying to pull the top piece away . Just do n't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak ; if you 've pounded the breast to 1/3 " thickness , then your cut should be no more than about 1/8 " . If you do it this way , you should n't even need to use toothpicks ; I never do , and I have n't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations .
Heavy cream can be frozen but only if intended to be used in its liquid form ( soups , sauces , etc. ) It will not whip properly once frozen . I agree with Pointy that there 's really no point in freezing it because it 's usually dated about 2 months out from the time I 'm purchasing it . Additionally , if kept cold and not left out on the counter unnecessarily ( as with most dairy products ) it will keep well beyond the date on the carton . I 'm not a milk drinker but use it baking/cooking . If I have a recipe that requires milk I use a 50:50 ratio of heavy cream and water and have n't had any issues yet . If I was using milk it would be whole milk so it 's kind of like making your own version .
There are two levels to this question . If you are using modern whipping cream as a starting point , then the trick for a longer lasting whipped cream is stabilization . If this is some farm bought milk you are skimming the cream from , then you have the additional problem that your cream is not fatty enough . Modern creams are concentrated with a centrifuge . To get good whipped cream , whip it cold until it <URL> . Stabilize the whipped cream by hanging it in a cheese cloth in the refrigerator or by adding gelatin.To use the gelatin , dissolve 2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin into 2 tablespoons of cold water . Work out the lumps . After the gelatin expands , mix in a quarter cup of cream and heat the mixture to dissolve the gelatin . Cool over ice and mix a bit . Complete 2 cups of cream and proceed as you would to finish your whipped cream .
Eggs will last two to four days in the refrigerator . Source : StillTasty ( <URL> &amp; <URL> )
There are 2 ways of looking at it ; how long it will be safe to eat ( ie from food poisoning ) and how long it will still be appetizing and taste alright ( ie not gone rancid ) . As you 've taken it from the tin it wo n't get that tinny flavour but as time goes on may absorb other flavours from the fridge so make sure you keep it away from anything that is strongly smelling . Also as around 87 % of the coconut milk is fats it will soon go rancid , so keep that in mind , ( you 'll know when it does by giving it a quick sniff ) . In terms of food safety , if it 's UHT which most are , then it could probably last for a long time ( as long as UHT milk ) so about 2 1/2 weeks I 'd say . Otherwise if it 's not UHT then not as long . I would say about the same time as fresh milk so around a week as it contains sugars and fats and so is a very compelling proposition for any bacteria . Other sites discussing this : <URL> , <URL> and <URL> . Hope this helps !
From <URL> There 's a difference between bubbles formed from under-proofing versus over-proofing . Bubbles from under-proofing tend to be flat but large in diameter . If unpopped , they can blow up an entire pizza . This is the process by which pita or pocket bread is made . Bubbles from over-proofing tend to be high but smaller in diameter . They rise up like little ping-pong balls and eventually form a hole at the top , at which time they stop expanding . They almost always burn . Most pizza bubbling problems are of the under-proofed type . To resolve a bubbling problem , dough fermentation must be adjusted accordingly . To stop bubbling caused by under-proofed dough , increase the amount of fermentation . To stop bubbling caused by over-proofed dough , reduce the amount of fermentation . In addition to proper proofing , it has been found that reducing the amount of water in a dough formula can help with reducing bubbling when dealing with the under-proofed type . The reduction in moisture aids in creating the pinpoint holes in the cells walls . In addition , you want to make sure you properly knead your dough . Some people poke tiny holes in the dough to prevent overly large bubbles . As a final resort you could observe your pizza in the oven and poke bubbles as they form .
Imitation vanilla extract is meant to be used in place of the real stuff , and most recipes probably assume you 're using the fake stuff anyway , so you would use 1 tsp . You only need to adjust the amount if you 're using something like twofold ( 2x ) extract .

Cooking Ramen noodles in broth or not ?
Usually it 's best to cook dried noodles in boiling water , and drain and rinse them in cold water when they are done . This does a couple of things : helps ensure that the noodle is equally cooked all the way through ( instead of getting overcooked on the outside by the time the centre is cooked ) . by using separate water , you do n't fill your broth with starch , which would adversely affect the taste , colour and consistency . If you want to add the noodles directly to the broth , I would recommend rinsing them in cold water first ( like you would with rice ) until the water runs clear . This will prevent excess starch from being added to your dish . You could also try adding a stock cube to the water that you boil the noodles in , if your goal is simply to make the noodles more flavourful .
I like to use the 15 % rule . To convert a recipe from convection to conventional : Multiply the cook time by 1.15 . Multiply the heat by 1.15 For example , your recipe would become : " Each loaf should bake at ( 300 * 1.15 = 345 ) degrees Fahrenheit in convection/steam oven for approximately ( 40 * 1.15 = 46 ) minutes or until the loaf reaches 155 degrees internal temperature . " You can convert back by multiplying by .85 .
Just because the recipe calls it an " omelette " does n't make it one . An omelette starts and ends its cooking in a pan . If you finish it in the oven , it becomes a frittata . ( There are a couple of historic differences , but let 's just stick with that . ) If the egg mixture both starts and finishes in the oven it would probably be a crust-less quiche . The benefits of cooking in the oven is the ability to get more even cooking of the eggs to get a more consistent texture throughout .
People generally wash fruit and vegetables ( organic or not ) to remove surface contamination , and the bacteria it may host , from the farm and supply chain This includes soil ( ground based animal faeces ) , compost ( rotted vegetable matter ) , airborne dropped bird faeces , road dust ( often high in animal faeces ) , and other surface contamination that can host bacteria A short and simple wash by hand in a bowl or sink of cold tap water will remove large amounts of these surface contamination from most fruit and vegetables . Some may require light brushing or scrubbing . And for best results rinse in running cold tap water after washing . Shaking water off usually works better than trying to blot it off with a tea towel Gentle washing will NOT remove any significant flavour or aromas . Think about what happens when it rains :-)
Based on your description , you seem to be measuring the rice and water in a measuring cup and adding them to the pan . Having used the same Zojirushi rice maker for 8 years , I can testify that relatively small variations in the water/rice ratio can produce large changes in the final texture of the rice . In your case , it seems to be that you 're using too much water . Adjusting the ratio to 1:1 should give you a chewier baseline to work with , and adding water in 1 oz . increments should allow you very fine-grained control ( no pun intended ) over the texture of the rice . That said , I believe that the most reliable results come from using the 3/4 C / 180 mL " cup " provided . To use it , you scoop a number of " cups " of rice and add them to the cooking pan , washing in the pan . After pouring off the wash water , fill the pan with water to the line on the inside face corresponding to the type of rice used and the number of " cups " of rice you added to the pan . In my experience , using this method produces essentially perfect results every time . Adjusting the water level to very slightly below the line will yield chewier rice , while adjusting slightly above will yield mushier rice .
Folding is almost always done when you have one ingredient like whipped cream , egg whites , meringue , or similar which has had a lot of air whipped into it , and you are incorporating that with another ingredient . The folding motion is meant to disturb the whipped ingredient is little as possible , in order to retain the whipped in air , and thus the volume of the mixture . If you simply whisk , or beat , the air would be beaten out . Whipping the egg whites or whipped cream alone forms a foam with nothing but the air and the fat in whipped cream , or the protein network in egg whites . It us unstable much like the bubbles we used to blow as children . If you add another ingredient , like flour , it can act as an abrasive , popping the little bubbles and deflating the foam . Ingredients which can dissolve fully , and so wo n't be abrasive to the buddies , can still dissolve into the foam walls , and change their chemistry to the point where they do n't hold air any more , again collapsing them . So even though the motion still might be called whisking or whipping , the result is not the same . There are only a few ingredients , such as sugar for whipped cream or egg whites , that can dissolve into the foam walls and not disrupt it , and these ingredients are best incorporated in the original whipping phase where the air is incorporated . Even with folding , there is some volume loss ; the goal is to minimize it .
It really depends on what you are looking for in a cooking class . I can give you some thoughts from my own personal experiences , but I am sure there are many factors that you must consider , so you will get a variety of answers . I am assuming you are talking about recreational ( that is the industry term , as opposed to professional ) classes ; I do n't claim to have good advise for choosing professional programs to become a line cook or patisserie on a career path to being a chef or pastry chef . Facilities The cooking school should tell where their class is taught . A local community class in a high school home-ec room or in a community center will usually offer basic facilities ( although I imagine some will stun you ... ) Commercial cooking schools or businesses should have photos of their classroom for you to peruse , and will usually brag about the equipment they offer ( such as Viking stoves ... ) Look at the pictures , and ask if the environment will be comfortable for you . Level How advanced is the class ? If you already know how to temper your own chocolate , and own three dipping forks , you do n't want to take a basic workshop in chocolate . On the other hand , if you have never made a biscuit , you might not want to take an advanced pasty course where croissants and puff pastry the order of the day . Choose a class that is at the level you desire -- the course guide should make this very clear . Cleanup Find out if the school has interns , or other staff who do the cleanup . Commercial schools tend to -- otherwise , you might expect to be helped police and do dishes , especially in a community program like one hosted at a community center . You should be comfortable with the expectation . Curriculum or Menu Good cooking classes list exactly what dishes or items will be taught in the class in their class guide or curriculum . They should also specify the lessons learned or techniques applied . Often there is a theme , like " Valentines Dinner for Two " or " Pastry Intensive " Select classes that teach the techniques you want , and dishes you like . Duration Is it a one evening class , where you are in and out , and little is at risk , or a week long adventure where if you do n't enjoy the format or the instructor , you have lost a week 's tuition and a week 's enjoyment . I once did n't come back from lunch on the 2nd day of a five day course because I did n't like the instructor 's style . For longer classes , you might ask for guarantees of a partial refund if the instructor or style or presentation is not to your liking , before signing up . For day long and longer classes , find out if lunches or other relevant meals are provided ( at commercial schools , they often are , either cooked as part of your curriculum , or done by staff or interns for your enjoyment ) , or whether you bring your own . Often there is not enough time to go out for lunch . Presentation and Participation There are several main ways cooking classes are taught ; you want to be sure the style is one that you enjoy . Presentation only -- the instructor prepares dishes at the front of the room , and the students watch . Kind of like a cooking show on TV , but live and in person , so you can smell ( and maybe taste afterwards ) , and ask questions . Each person ( or group ) prepares some -- the class is broken up into groups or individuals , each of whom prepare one or more dishes from the menu . You might not get to do the dish you wanted from the curriculum , but you will get hands-on for something . Usually , the groups will share afterwards , so you get to taste everything . Every person ( or group ) prepares everything -- you will get to prepare everything listed in the curriculum , and usually eat it . Choose a format you are comfortable with , especially if you want to be sure you get to try a specific dish hands-on . Pacing When you evaluate the curriculum or menu , the manner of presentation , and the overall duration of the course , you should have some idea of how fast it goes . Make sure you are comfortable with the pace . If you like a slow and pleasant pace , you do n't want to be a in class where folks are expected to knock out their dishes fast -- although those are often more the advanced classes at commercial schools . Ingredients Find out whether you bring your own ingredients , or they are supplied . ( Most commercial cooking schools supply them , but community programs may not . ) Cost Cost counts . Need I say more ? General Talk to the folks at the school 's customer service line ( if they have one ) if you have questions . Take a short class at the school to evaluate the facilities and their general style before splurging on a longer or more expensive class . And bring your patience . By the nature of the beast , you often sit through things you know , or repetitions , or have to wait through lectures and demos before the hands-on portion . If you can , bring a friend to share the experience , gossip with , and generally have a good time , should you be so disposed . Bon
Butter and milk will add fat and water which will definitely change the consistency of the dough . You will have to adjust the ratios if you add them ( surely more flour if you add milk ) . If you want sweet noodles my best bet would be to add sugar , although I would n't do sweet egg noodles ... maybe sweet rice noodles ? Why do n't you just do plain noodles and then make a sweet condiment instead ?
If you defrost in water , by all means keep the plastic on . If it were n't wrapped , you 'd put it in a baggie anyway and not dump it directly into the water . The instructions to unwrap are for defrosting in the fridge and to allow the water to run off . Fish is often covered in a thin protective layer of ice , which you want to be able to drain instead of staying on for a long time . For the relatively short time in a defrosting water bath , you will be fine . Just pat the fish dry before frying or you get a lot of spattering . From a food-safety perspective you should be using cold water , btw , it works just as well and you can be sure your fish stays out of the danger zone .
When in doubt , throw it out . It 's cheaper than a hospital visit . If you are wanting to save money , be proactive and find out the best way to store each food , and how long it can be stored . Some things lose taste and texture as they age ( even in the proper environment ) , while some things begin to grow dangerous kinds of bacteria or molds . For example , hard dry bread gets turned into french toast . Moldy bread gets thrown away .
I 've been told that the shiny side should go on the inside for cooking , and the outside for freezing . In other words , do you want to reflect the heat into the food , or away from the food ? However , common sense ( which fails very often ) tells me that with the temperature ranges involved , any benefit is marginal , if it exists at all . The only time it might matter , is if you were trying to warm something up in the sun . Then it might make a difference . EDIT : From The Straight Dope : The truth is that the shiny side is not treated with a dangerous chemical . Mineral oil is used as a lubricant during the rolling process , some trace of which may remain on the finished foil -- but it 's not dangerous . The shiny side is shiny because of the way foil is made . During the last pass through the rolling mill , a double thickness of foil is run between the rollers . The side of each sheet that comes in contact with the polished steel rollers comes out shiny . The other side has a matte finish . <URL> ALSO The official word from the Reynolds aluminum people is as follows : " It makes little difference which side of the Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil you use -- both sides do the same fine job of cooking , freezing , and storing food . There is a slight difference in the reflectivity of the two sides , but it is so slight that laboratory instruments are required to measure it . "
So , there 's no method to get sugar out of milk , as far as I know . You can look for milk products where some of the sugar is used up ( fermented , like Chris H mentioned ) , but this will significantly change taste and texture - sugar is a major part of what milk is , fats and sugars and proteins , and you 're removing most of the actual substance . You 're likely to do better with an unsweetened nut milk or rice milk , especially if you make your own so you can tweak to taste . These may have more fats , depending on your choice of recipe , but will likely have sugar closer to your desired range One thing you might try , if you 're really determined , is to dilute your milk ( maybe up to half ) and add artificial sweeteners . You 'll still get some of the flavor components from the added milk , and some sweetening to make up the difference in taste , but there will be less sugar because the actual amount of milk is less . Hopefully the added artificial sweetener might make it taste less watery , but maybe add just a half a pinch of salt if it still tastes too thin . in the end , ~ 6g sugar per cup , I guess ? Another possibility is to use unflavored whey powder to flavor the diluting water ( again , probably no more than half of your " milk " ) , then adding artificial sweetener to taste . The whey should have some of the flavors from the proteins in milk , and at least from the powder I checked it does n't have much of the sugar or fat you 're objecting to . It might help the diluted milk taste less watery . ~ 7g sugar , because I think the whey powder has a gram and a half per serving . Final possibility I thought of - you can maybe grab some creamer powder and use that to flavor your diluted milk ( again , not more than half and sweeten to taste ) . Or even use it on its own , if the flavor works for you . The amount of sugar is n't stated , but it has to be under 1g because that 's all the carbs there are per serving - though it does add a half gram of fat back in .
Red cabbage is usually braised , not boiled . Following the instructions listed in your recipe , you 're going to lose the flavor of the caraway as well . For German-style sweet and sour red cabbage I typically saute some diced onion and apple in sugar and butter until just golden , add the shredded cabbage and then cook a little until the cabbage is glazed . Add some beef stock along with red wine vinegar , bay leaf and salt and then braise lightly covered until cabbage has softened . Sprinkle some flour over the top and add add ' l beef stock and red wine to this . At the end , remove from heat and stir in a couple of tablespoons red currant jelly just to mix in and balance the sweet/sour flavors .
I very quickly found nutritional information for storebought ( Swanson ) <URL> and <URL> . As you 'd expect , neither one contains all that much protein . The stock does contain substantially more : 4g per cup compared to 1g - this should also be expected , since stock has some gelatin in it , and gelatin is mostly protein . Of course , it 's commercially made ; I imagine you 'd be hard-pressed to find good nutritional data for homemade stock and broth .
Depends on the apple . Apples with softer skins will bake to a more even consistency , but apples with tough skin ( the ' shiny ' kinds like McIntosh or Red Delicious ) tend to get caught in your teeth and throat , and are generally a pain to eat . If you do make a pie with the skins on , use smaller pieces of apple or slice around the apples to create shorter pieces of peel . These are easier to eat and do n't get caught in your mouth as much .
Baking turns bicarbonate of soda into a weak form of lye - sodium carbonate , as you said . It basically makes it a stronger alkali . The actual baking process is safe , but the resulting lye is an irritant and you should avoid getting in on your skin , and definitely avoid it getting it in your eyes . The difference in texture and colour is noticeable after baking . The texture will be finer , and it will be whiter .
Actually , there are really only a few oils you can substitute for each other , at least without any significant side effects . The oils which generally are used interchangeably are peanut oil , canola/rapeseed oil , and sunflower oil . These oils have similar smoke points , do n't impart any really noticeable flavour , and tend to be used primarily for high-heat cooking ( pan-frying , deep-frying ) , so if you 're paranoid about saturated fat for instance , you can substitute sunflower oil for peanut oil . Corn oil is in the same group , but I rarely see that used anymore . You can also use the " light " olive oil , but that will change the flavour of the dish . I believe walnut oil has similar properties , but it 's considerably harder to find . But keep in mind that oils are used for far more than frying . Many have highly-specialized uses : Extra virgin olive oil is most commonly used in sauces and salad dressings ( " oil and vinegar " almost always means olive oil , there really is no substitute ) ; Chili oil is really more of a condiment than a cooking oil . Even if you could cook with it , the result would be inedible due to the heat . Toasted sesame oil is used as a flavourings in Asian dishes . It 's useless as a cooking oil ( and cooking with it would be a terrible waste ) . Regular sesame oil , on the other hand , is often bought in a refined form and is generally used as a cooking oil . There are a lot of other more esoteric types of oil such as palm oil and coconut oil , which you really do n't want to use unless you know what you 're doing ( you can ruin the flavour ) . I could go on , but for now I 'll refer you to the <URL> as a starting point . Cooking oils really are n't freely interchangeable in all situations ; even if you 've accounted for smoke point and flavour , sometimes a significantly different fat content ( i.e. grapeseed oil which is mostly polyunsaturated vs. canola oil which is mostly monounsaturated ) can seriously mess up a delicate recipe . It 's better to be asking which oils you can substitute in a specific situation than to assume everything goes and list the " exceptional " circumstances .
It 's definitely a sign that the oven is cooking too hot somewhere ; the under-done tops and middles are the give-away . I suspect your oven has a malfunctioning thermostat , which is quite common . Try setting temperatures 50 degrees below suggested , and see if it solves the problems . Failing this , purchase an oven thermometer to check it . Another possibility is that there is poor airflow within the oven . In this case , hot air is heating the bottom of the pan , but can not get around the edges of the pan to heat the top of the baked good . The solution to this is usually to use a smaller pan , and ensure only one pan at a time is loaded into the oven . My oven has problems of this nature when I try to bake in both racks with half sheet pans .
With enameled cast-iron , I do n't bother to heat the pot before adding the oil . For something that 's open-pored , like plain cast-iron or carbon steel ( like an old-school crepe pan ) , it 's better to preheat the pan . I ca n't see any chemical advantage to preheating enameled , as it 's inert and non-porous . Of course everything DOES need to be properly hot before you add the meat . I can take or leave letting my roast get to room temp when doing a braise . It 's going to be in the oven/pot long enough that it 's going to be cooked to 200 + degrees all the way through no matter what . The only possible advantage of letting it warm up on the counter is that it will take marginally less time to cook . And by marginally , I mean you probably wo n't even notice , on the scale of pot roast cooking time . For a steak or a rib roast where you want the middle warm without the outside being totally dry and charred , room temp helps a lot . The only real tip I can give on pot roast is to use the right cut of meat . You want something from the shoulder , which usually means chuck . It has an excellent mix of rich meaty flavor , collagen/connective tissue ( which makes that gelatin thats critical to the silky mouthfeel of pot roast and BBQ ) , and fat . You can also use something from the leg ( shank ) or tail , which also have loads of connective tissue , but they 're usually a little low on actual meat . If you get the right cut of meat and cook it low and long enough to get that collagen rendered , it 's pretty hard to mess up the rest of it .
Microwave ovens by their nature heat unevenly . The actual microwave radiation produces wave patterns with more and less amplitude within the cooking chamber . ( From a physics standpoint , these are " standing waves " produced by internal wave reflections . ) This is sort of the equivalent of " hot spots " and " cold spots " in a pan . Most modern microwaves contain some sort of rotating plate or other moving part to mitigate this unevenness by keeping the food in motion ( and thus aligning different parts of the food with the " hot spots " ) . Over time , some parts of the food will also become very hot , and the heat from those portions will gradually distribute to the cooler portions of the food around them . The reason I bring all of this up is that the primary advantage to cooking at a " lower power setting " in a microwave ( whether it truly can change wattage or whether it merely cycles between 100 % power and off , as dpolitt 's answer notes ) is to allow time for those hotter portions of food to distribute their heat to the cooler portions during cooking . If you 're heating something that has easy heat circulation ( e.g. , boiling water or other thin liquids ) , it does n't much matter what setting you use , so use higher power for time efficiency . But in many foods using a lower setting can : Allow time for the food to heat more gradually and more evenly Prevent parts of the food from getting overcooked ( which could lead to sections being dried out or otherwise changed to an overcooked texture ) For longer cooking times , it may also allow the " cold spots " more time to " catch up " and spend more time at a cooking temperature , which may be desirable for texture ( e.g. , if the food has to soften ) or other reasons Sometimes prevent undesirable " behavior " of food in the microwave when overheated : e.g. , exploding or " popping " of some parts of the food , boiling over of some liquids , etc. . In general , I 'd say that there 's rarely much harm in using a lower cooking setting in a microwave , other than potentially wasting some energy . As long as you lengthen the cooking time to compensate and cook the food completely , a longer time is fine . So , that 's what I 'd recommend if you 're at all concerned about the power setting . The only time to avoid a lower power setting is generally in foods where longer cooking times would also be avoided in other cooking methods . For example , when steaming vegetables , a longer cooking time will often result in mushiness , which may be undesirable -- whether done in a pot on the stove or in a microwave on low power . ( Some cooking requires a minimum temperature to achieve normal results too , like frying . In that case , you might need to use a higher power setting . I do n't tend to use my microwave for such things , so I do n't have a lot of recommendations for that . ) All of that said , the primary reason to use a microwave over other cooking methods is generally speed . That 's why most people tend to just use full power on microwaves for the vast majority of tasks anyway . If you 're heating a food where the things listed above are unlikely to pose a major problem , using higher power may be fine . Lastly , in many foods interrupting cooking by periodic stirring is actually more effective to distribute heat evenly than a longer microwave time at lower power . Thus , I mostly tend to use a lower power setting myself only in foods that ca n't be stirred or where I do n't want to be bothered to take the food out and stir periodically over a longer cooking time .

Why does dark chocolate turn white after being in cold for some time ?
Its called chocolate <URL> . There are two types : Fat blooming - cause is not known for certain , but probably the type VI chocolate crystals are more thermodynamically favored , so spontaneous conversion ( and exit from the surface of the solid solution constituting the chocolate body ) may be possible . Sugar blooming - the sugar in the chocolate is dissolved by humidity , and the precipitates on the surface . Fortunately , there are no safety problems with bloomed chocolate , and it can be remelted with no inherent loss of quality . So bloomed chocolate is perfectly useful in recipes where it will be melted ; or it can be melted and <URL> if desired .
As baka has said , more volatile components of the wine will be released with more wine surface exposed . Also , this not only releases aroma but also helps the wine to " breathe " and oxidize , which is why you open the red wine bottle half an hour before serving it ( so that this process starts ) , and why you might pour the wine into a decanter . This process accentuates the flavors and aromas of the wine . It is not very much necessary with younger , colder served wines ( e.g. vinho verde ) . In young , sparkling wine , a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster , as well as warming it . This is undesireable , hence the smaller , narrower glasses . Aged white wine should behave similarly to aged red wine , although it does n't need to breathe as much .
Yes , it is normal for pulses to develop froth when soaked . I 've seen it at lower temperatures and shorter soaking times . They can feel slimy too . This is n't a sign of bacteria development in itself . Chickpeas , as well as other legumes , contain lots of saponins . Saponins are a type of detergent , and they form a foam when dissolved in water . An example is found in Saponin content of food plants and some prepared foods by D. Fenwick and D. Oakenfull , published in Journal of the science of food and agriculture , vol . 34-2 ( no free version available ) . Chickpeas , soy , lucerne , and other legumes all had significant amounts of saponin , 56 g/kg in the case of chickpeas . Note that soaking dissolves also lots of other molecules contained in the beans . Some recommend to soak and throw out the soaking water in order to remove the oligosaccharides contained in most legumes , because bacteria breaking down these indigestible sugars produce gases as a side product , which is felt as bloating . McGee reminds us that this soaking also dissolves many of the micronutrients contained in the beans , and advices against the practice . If the beans are soaked ( for shortening of cooking times ) , the soaked water should be used for cooking . If the eaters experience bloating , the beans should be cooked for a longer time , to give oligosaccharides time to break down under temperature . This was about the general case , but now a note on your current situation . The conditions of your chickpea soaking were risky . Your chickpeas can have developed bacteria independently of the froth . In temperate regions , soakers are n't a problem , because bacteria growth in them is not especially quick ( the 2 hours rule is made tight enough to cover things like meat , and a soaker does n't even have enough hydrated bacteria food initially ) . But I have noticed that food I would have had no problem with at 22 ° C goes bad in short time at 28 ° C . The relationship between bacteria growth and temperature is not linear , and with growing heat , bacteria growth can speed up a lot . So I do n't know if I would eat the peas - not because of the froth , but because of the conditions you had them in . I would recommend that you soak in the fridge next time - you do n't need any fermentation to take place , so the low temperatures are n't a problem .
It 's a simple matter of viscosity , when eggs are cold the white is less runny . When eggs are warm the white is much more runny . As for whether it is easier to separate eggs when cold or warm it depends on your method . If you use the shells to separate the white , by cracking them in half and then transferring the yolk back and forth between the halves , then I 'd say cold is a bit better because once the white starts to drip out it tends to go as a whole . With warm eggs more white will stay in the shell with the yolk . However , if you use your hands to separate the eggs , by letting the white drip between your fingers ( or using an egg separator which does the same thing ) , warm eggs work much better because the runniness allows them to flow easier . This method works fine for cold eggs too , but warm is faster . Of the two methods I prefer using my hands rather than the shell for a few reasons : Less broken yolks : It 's easier to break a yolk when using shells It 's faster : especially if your eggs are room temperature you can separate eggs twice as fast this way You can whip the whites right away : Most of the time the reason you are separating the egg whites is to whip them into peaks , and warm whites whip better than cold whites . If your eggs are warm already then you can whip them right away , if they are cold you have to wait for them to warm up A handy trick if you are separating a lot of eggs is to separate each white into a separate bowl , then putting the white into a larger bowl with the rest of them . This is so if you get a bad egg , or a yolk breaks into the white you can discard the egg and keep the rest of them .
To answer this question we should turn to the oracle : <URL> The relevant quote is : " Nothing affects a cookie 's texture more than the melting characteristics of its fat . Butter has a sharp melting point meaning that , uh , just a few degrees difference between a solid and liquid states . So since conversion occurs at a relatively low temperature , the resulting batter spreads prior to setting . " The problem is that shortening melts at a higher temperature than butter and so cookies made with shortening typically rise more than butter made cookies . Thus your rising problems are probably not caused by the type of fat . I suspect that the temperature of your fat might be causing the problem . If your butter came from the fridge and the shortening was room temperature then the shortening cookies would melt faster and rise less .
This often happens when the tomatoes used are not fully mature . Although apparently are completely red , the parties less red lighten the sauce . Alternatively , depends on the quality of tomatoes . The Native Americans tomatoes were yellow ( hence the Italian name " golden apple " = " pomo d'oro " = " pomodoro " ) . Through the selections have become red . But remaining mixed colors , which are " not red " but " reddish " . Or yellow - orange . In the United States , the orange tomatoes are sold seasonally in the markets of agricultural producers : it is " heirloom tomatoes " or " tomatoes tradition " ( heirloom tomatoes ) , ie those that were cultivated before 1800 and which for centuries delighted the palates of our ancestors . The study conducted by the chemist Betty J. Burry and biologist Betty K. Ishida has shown that orange tomatoes contain more lycopene ( an important antioxidant molecule ) of the common red tomatoes . The difference is due to the chemical form of lycopene in red tomatoes that occurs in the trans form while in the orange tomatoes in tetra-cis form . Research conducted in California and in Ohio ( USA ) have shown that the form of the tetra-cis lycopene is more efficiently absorbed by the body compared to the trans form . The research group has also assessed the oxidative damage : lycopene and other antioxidant molecules , in fact , may protect both the cells and the essential fatty acids from oxidation . Using a procedure known as " TBARS assay " the researchers noted that oxidative damage is decreased by consuming tomato sauce and tomato sauce red orange , but the damage reduction was greater in the diet that included the consumption of orange tomatoes . ( * ) <URL> Data di pubblicazione : 05/07/2012 Autore : Emanuela Fontana Copyright : www.freshplaza.it Personally I can say that in the diets of very young children less red tomatoes ( fresh , peeled and seeded ) are preferred , because they are more digestible and light . PS A very prolonged cooking of the sauce , on the contrary , gives a very dark and indigestible sauce ( tomato paste ) which is used more as a seasoning for cooking of regional recipes . Is never used on pasta , as the taste is altered and too strong . EDIT Yes it happens very often , and we all start with deep red tomatoes , san marzano and so on . But often the salsa comes oranges . <URL> that it comes from blending tomatoes after mixing with oil . But I never put so much oil to think that it could depend by oil . And it happens to me too . And the other persons disagree too . Everyone does buy san marzano tomatoes ( or similar ) , very mature and red . But when you cut them , inside they can be hard and a bit pale , not really red . And flavonoid and lycopene are into any tomato , just in different or more or less visible quantity . ( flavonoyd becomes from latin : flavus = yellow or blond / leukos is from greek = white ) . To me , since the original DNA is yellow , it could be that some genetic trait has remained , not limited to only one quality but in general the whole botanical species , and sometimes emerges . The major dietary source of lycopene is represented by the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) from which it takes its name , and its derivatives , in which represents 60 % of the total content in carotenoids . The lycopene content is influenced by the level of maturation of the tomato , has been calculated that in fact red and ripe tomatoes are present 50 mg / kg of lycopene . But of course , i can wrong . <URL> / <URL> <URL> " The date of his arrival in Europe in 1540 when the Spaniard Hernán Cortés returned to his homeland and brought the specimens , but its cultivation and propagation waited until the second half of the seventeenth century . Arrives in Italy in 1596 but only later , finding favorable climatic conditions in the south of the country , you have the color change of its color from the original and distinctive gold color , which gave its name to the plant , the current red , thanks to selections and subsequent grafts . " EDIT II @ MandoMando Yes , I agree . What you say agrees with my experience . I must say that it is false that " many often " happens , it just happens sometimes . Normally remain red . But I never use electrical equipment , only hand devices , like these : The first is precisely for the tomato sauce . The second pass any cooked vegetables . But if you want , you can tray the ancient recipe , that I use only when I have guests and I want to offer some pasta with a fresh made sauce . You must blanch the tomatoes in boiling water until the skin breaks down ( usually 20-30 seconds ) . Then remove the tomatoes from the water and peel them right away , still intact and hot . This is the method used by our grandmothers who were canned . After removing the skin , you can put the whole tomatoes into the jars and sterilize them . Or you can make a sauce with olive oil , salt and herbs ( as I do ) or with other ingredients such as carrots , celery or whatever . I do not think that modern industries for storage of tomato sauce stil
Hot gasses such as steam and CO2 trapped inside the dough by the crust are important to help properly bake the bread , as well as to give it form and structure . If you cut a slice off the end of the bread before the bread has finished baking , you completely change the conditions under which the bread finishes baking : steam will escape rather than building up , the internal temperature probably wo n't rise as much , and the bread will tend to dry out rather than cook . If you 're not sure whether your bread is done , you should take its temperature . An instant-read , digital thermometer with as fine a probe as possible is best because it compromises the crust the least . For the same reasons , you should let bread cool as @justkt suggests before cutting into the loaf . Bread smells great when it 's hot , but it tastes best when it has cooled somewhat .
Do n't Rinse You should not need to do more than shake the excess marinade from your chicken , or if you want to be very thorough , pat it down with towels lightly . If you rinsed , you would be washing away from of the flavor developed by your marinade , and the seasoning at the surface of the chicken . Cook on The goal is to not put the chicken on the grill with so much left over marinade that it fails to cook through and dry . By the time you are done grilling , the chicken should be essentially dry at the surface with nothing left to curdle . The other goal of the grilling ( or putting in the tandoor , I imagine , if you have one ) is to develop the nice browned and delicious flavors , and that wo n't happen if there is still liquid yogurt on the surface . Type of yogurt The particular type of yogurt you use should not be a factor , since it should be fully cooked in the grilling phase . However , in general , very high fat dairly products ( like cream , or a yogurt made from full cream ) .
Harvest time can have a large effect on the quality of the tea . First off , whether it was the first harvest of the year or a later one will greatly change the character of the tea . The dates can also be used similar to the vintage dates of wine . If you got a tea from a specific region and know the date of the harvest , if you find another tea from the same region and same date , it will have been grown under similar conditions . Also , since black and oolong teas have been oxidized , the oxidation process will continue to some extent as the tea ages , further changing the flavor . The date can be used to predict freshness , and also to find a tea that suits your tastes better ( for instance , I know that I like many black teas better after they have aged for a year or two ) .
White sugar was commonly used as a preservative in the past , in much the same way as salt . It 's wildly hygroscopic ( like salt ) , and an excellent desiccant , so if you packed something in it , it would accelerate the drying process . This is actually the origin of fruit jam and fruit preserves , which are still common today , even after better methods of preservation are available . Salt was more common simply because many things like eating/living in WET sugar , so you had to be careful with how much water was in the thing you were trying to preserve . But as long as the sugar was dry it 's an extremely hostile environment for bacteria and little crawly things . Kept dry , it will last forever .
Most freezers are frost-free , which means that they occasionally cycle above freezing to prevent formation of frost on the walls of the freezer . This makes them easier to maintain but it shortens the storage longevity of the food . This makes products stored in them vulnerable to freezer burn , which is a loss of moisture . It can also cause ice and IQF products like frozen fruits or vegetables to solidify into a single mass . If you have ice cube trays , you may even notice them becoming empty after a few months of sitting unused . Freezer burn is a loss of quality , though , not a health issue . The food is n't spoiling . If you have a " deep freeze " or a non frost-free freezer that you only access occasionally , you can certainly keep foods for nearly indefinite periods of time without worrying as much about freezer burn . You can also reduce the likelihood of freezer burn by following better freezer practices . Resources available <URL> and <URL> and <URL> .
Assuming your roux is flour based , the original recipe mixture was able to be a sauce because the proteins in the flour formed gluten and created that lovely thickness we enjoy ( your seasonings sound like a nice combo ) . The water from the other ingredients are trapped in the gluten . Unfortunately , when you freeze it , the water molecules form sharp shapes like knives and cut your gluten strands . This is n't a noticeble problem until your defrost it . It does n't matter how quickly or slowing you defrost . The damage was done when it was frozen . To work around this issue , you have to freeze it faster ! Professional establishments can super freeze things super fast . Freezing faster will make smaller knife-shaped ice crystals and that reduces the damage . TIPS : freeze in smaller portions and shallower depth on a pre-frozen metal cookie sheet . Defrost and strain the sauce . Make a new roux and add the defrosted &amp; strained sauce . The flavor comes from the frozen sauce and the new roux recreates the gluten .
A non-exhaustive list of ways to get your bread to rise when it 's cold includes : Just let it rise slowly over a long period of time , which does give you good flavour but requires serious patience Put it in the airing cupboard , assuming Australian houses have such things , but in the winter the hot water tank will keep it nice and warm If it 's still in the rising in the bowl phase rather than having been shaped , you can carefully put the bowl in a larger bowl of warm water ( not too hot though or it 'll go a bit mad ) Sometimes I can get away with putting the pan with the shaped bread ready for the oven over a large bowl or bucket of hot water Put it in the oven with the pilot light on if your oven has a pilot light Put it in the top oven with the door open while you 're cooking something else in the bottom oven , if you have two ovens ( careful though , this can get too hot depending on your oven ) Encourage the cat to sleep on it
Basic Physics of the System Bread rises ( as you probably know ) due to microorganisms , primarily yeast , converting sugars into CO ₂ + byproducts . The CO ₂ forms bubbles , stretching the gluten in the flour . In order for the bread to rise , the microorganisms must produce CO ₂ faster than it can escape from the dough . Graphed over time , the amount of CO ₂ produced would start at 0 , fairly quickly rise to its maximum ( as the yeast , etc. come back from dormancy ) , then slowly decrease , eventually to 0 ( as they run out of food and/or are overwhelmed by byproducts such as alcohol ) . The amount of gas escaping from the dough also changes over time . It must obviously start at 0 , and probably increases over time ( after all , there is more to escape ) , and eventually of course its all escaped and thus it must be 0 again , but I 'm not sure of its exact shape . So , a diagram : That 's the basic physics of the system . At some point , the bread must fall . ( Well , maybe in a 0-g environment it would shrink instead of fall , but ... ) How the Environment Matters The microorganisms are very sensitive to fairly small changes in their environment . In particular : Temperature . If your kitchen is 70 ° F and the author 's is 80 ° F , it could easily take twice as long . The lower the temperature , the slow the microorganisms go ( up to a point , once it gets too hot , they 're not happy either ) . Hydration . If your bread dough is lower hydration ( drier ) than the author 's , it 'll be slowed down again . The recipe is written in volume measures ( cups ) , as you know flour packs down . That leads to huge variations in how two different people measure it . Make sure to measure it how the author says to ( hopefully it specified somewhere in the book ) . Scoop-and-sweep vs. sift-and-sweep can easily be 25 % different . Preferably , spend $ 25 on a kitchen scale , and do your baking by weight . Salinity . Salt slows down yeast . If you happened to substitute table salt for kosher salt , and still measured out 1 1/2 tablespoons , you 've used more salt than the author wanted . A fair bit more . Age of your yeast . If your yeast is old ( and sometimes the packets in the store have been sitting for ages ) , it may not have the same potency as a fresh packet would . It 'll probably take longer ( but as long as it rises , it 'll likely be fine ) The times in the book could just be nonsense . Authors and editors do sometimes make mistakes . Other times they 're in a rush , and just take a guess . " Yeah , it was about two hours ... " The book could just be wrong . Also , generally speaking , slower leads to better flavor . So its not a bad thing . Summary Give it longer . Provided you 've covered it in plastic ( so it does n't dry out ) , it 'll eventually fall . Keep in mind that " fall " does n't mean it 'll return to its original size , just that it 'll fall back from its maximum size . The " or flattens on top " comment in your book is a pretty accurate description of what it looks like . Normally , while its rising , there is a dome shape on top , with the center as the highest point . When it starts falling , that dome vanishes , and may even invert ( as in , the center will be the lowest point ) . I 've made preferments that take upwards of 20 hours to fall . It will eventually happen . And when it takes forever , it 'll probably taste better .
The basis for any sort of Japanese soup dish is going to be dashi stock , a stock made of fish and seaweed . It has a much lighter flavor than chicken broth , so you might not have identified it easily . You can buy it in a powder form for convenience , and it can be sprinkled into other liquids rather than reconstituted . <URL> is for soba with a dipping sauce , but it 'll give you a good idea of the flavor profile you 're looking for : Dashi stock plus <URL> , which is made of soy sauce , mirin , and sugar ( and simmered so it 's not strongly alcoholic ) .
I do think there is a maximum to the duration of stewing a cut of beef . There is in my opinion such a thing as too tender and soft . If you plan to cook the meat as one large chunk you will have to add a little to your normal stewing time , but I would not go as high as 15 hours . Cooking and re-heating is quite an interesting option though , as quite a few dishes benefit from this in terms of flavour . Perhaps a <URL> on this subject , or a <URL> would be of interest to you . For me , the smaller the size of your chunks of meat , the more you should stick to your normal stewing time of 8 hours and the more you could consider making it a day early to enhance the taste .
As the oven heats up , the bacon will slowly warm , and slowly start to render its fat . This minimizes the curling from shrinkage . It is not absolutely necessary , and makes the total time to the bacon being done shorter , if you start timing from when the oven is turned on . For more insight , see the various answers to <URL>
I have the same problem and went through 3 different brands of milk , thinking they were UHT . However , after some experimentation I determined what I was doing wrong . In my case , after cutting the curd , and while the water was heating back up to 105 , we were stirring too much . The key is very slow gentle movement . Just enough to slightly move the curds , and not disturb them . " Stirring " will cause you to end up with a nice tasting ricotta , but not mozzarella .
A rainbowy layer is almost certainly oil . ( This is called <URL> . ) Earl Grey uses oil of bergamot for flavoring , and likely cheap teas you 've used have oil-based flavorings as well . It 's not surprising that the oil eventually separates , and there 's not really any way to avoid that without significantly modifying the tea , or using tea that does n't have quite so much oil . I would definitely expect the flavor to be stale after it 's left for a while - aromatic compounds are by nature volatile , and they 'll slowly escape . You might be able to prevent some loss of flavor by putting the tea in something airtight ( preferably a completely full container , so there 's not even air on the surface ) and chilling it , but it 's going to be a losing battle . You said the color was stale as well ; I do n't know exactly what processes would cause that , but in general , the only way you 're going to be able to slow down any chemical processes is by chilling the tea . In the end , the real answer is simply that it 's best to drink fresh tea . Your time would probably be better spent getting to where you can make it quickly - for example , get an electric kettle that can rapidly boil a single cup worth of water .
No . It is not general practice to add bleach to rice . The brown rice bran is removed through mechanical processes . As to whether he should continue to indulge this worry ... I 'd be more concerned about [ insert common American male problem here ] before ammonia in rice . <URL> This review has many free references in it . Should you want further peer-review reading , I can provide it .

What happens during a cold fermentation that makes bread taste so good ?
A cold/delayed ferment does several things : Allows for more complete hydration of the starches , and more gluten development . An enzyme called protease , which is naturally occurring the flour , breaks some of the long gluten bonds , making the dough more extensible . ( This is not in conflict with the first reaction , it just controls the gluten length ) . Creates flavors through alpha-amylase action converting starches to sugars . The first two items are lumped into the term autolyse , which can be done in time frames of anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours . The third item of a cold ferment gets more complex ... Additional enzymes ( alpha-amylase enzymes ) that come along with the flour , yeast , other ingredients added to the flour ( malt powders ) , or grain mashes , perform a set of reactions that break starch molecules into sugars . This reaction is what turns malted grain from starchy soup to sweet liquid in the beer-making process of " mashing " . These sugars both add flavor of their own , caramelize to create new flavors , and feed the yeast creating even NEW flavors . The trick , and reason it is cold , is that the yeast contribute valuable enzymes to this process , but can be too energetic . If they are allowed to ferment wildly they would likely over-leaven the bread . The cool temperatures slow the enzymes down as well , but not as much as the yeast , letting the enzymes catch up with the process . Now - no part of this process is dogma . There are people who cold-rest their dough and THEN add yeast the next day . Problem here is that you need to allow at least 6 hours at room temperature for the yeast to catch up , and it is hard to integrate yeast into pre-made dough . The results can be similar , but the scheduling is awkward . Other variations include cold resting only part of the dough , or making a liquid " soaker " that includes some mashed grain , allowing that to sit at room temperature without yeast , which is then integrated into the main dough on the day of baking . Cold-resting dough is also a practical matter - once the dough is mixed and resting , if it spends 12 or 36 hours in the fridge , it does n't matter too much , and once it is pulled out , only requires a few hours to come back to temperature , final proof , and bake . It sounds like a slower way to make bread , but personally , splitting the process into two days makes it easier to fit into a busy life - I start the dough on one day , then the next day ( or two or three days later , if I get busy ) , I can pull the dough after work , proof and bake for a late dinner that evening . The flavor and dough development are icing on the cake . To really dive into this process and what drives it , check out Peter Reinhart 's books " Bread Baker 's Apprentice " and " Whole Grain Breads " , both of which go into the process in great detail , and are excellent reads for anyone wanting to improve their baking . It includes a lot of the science , and enough background information to make you feel comfortable with what you are doing , and comfortable experimenting on your own with variations to the process .

Generally , slow-cooking means any food preparation method which relies on using low-heat for a long amount of time . Barbecues , smokers , luau pits , and low-heat ovens could all qualify . The benefit of slow-cooking , generally , is that food becomes incredibly tender , as all of its connective tissues break down . Also , flavor can infuse over time and provide deeper results than with virtually any other method . Lastly , long-cooking times create a celebratory atmosphere where food is the focal point of a social gathering . Specifically , slow-cooking refers to the ' slow-cooker ' a counter-top set-up which has a large , electronically heated ceramic bowl and a glass lid . It usually has only a few settings , such as ' low ' , ' medium ' , and ' high ' . The benefit of slow-cooking in a slow-cooker is mainly convenience . These units are safe enough to turn on before work and return to before dinner , with fully-cooked , piping hot food ready to go . The slow-cooker is geared towards ' one-pot ' recipes , which means they require minimal food preparation . You simply cut up the ingredients in fairly large chunks , add seasoning , and liquid , and that 's it . They are a favorite of working parents , but increasingly , also a device for more advanced experimentation .
I presume you 're talking about active dried yeast . In that case , the granules of packaged yeast have some nutritive content to them , so what you observe when you add warm water is a weak form of priming . Priming is the addition of both warm water and a food source , typically sugar or flour , to dried yeast with the goal of ' waking-up ' the yeast from their dormant , packaged state . The warm water dissolves some of the food in the granules and warms the yeast up to a temperature which is favourable to fermentation .
I expect that you have already considered the most probable answer . For some spices , the aromatic compounds are released by some heat , but are not destroyed . Thus their effect is heightened . For other compounds , even a small amount of heat will destroy them and thus reduce their effect - see Mischa 's comment . I believe that the difference essentially lies in at what temperature a flavoursome compound starts to degrade .
What is food grade lye Pure lye is by itself always food grade . There is nothing toxic about lye ( although it 's corrosive even at low-ish concentrations ) . When a manufacturer sells you food grade lye , they are guaranteeing you that it is not contaminated with anything unpleasant . After all , a chemistry plant will make a lot of different chemicals using the same equipment , and you do n't want to use lye which was mixed in the same erlenmeyer flask as a batch of pesticides . Also , the equipment used in an industry processes can leave unpleasant traces too , some search shows that one of the more common setups in the 20th century used an asbestos barrier for the electrolysis process of lye creation . The problems of making lye from sodium and water at home If you make your lye at home , you 'll only have to ensure that your ingredients are food grade . There is nothing in the process which can make the lye accidentally toxic . Even if you use wrong ratios : if you add more water than intended , your lye will be diluted , which does nothing bad , and even makes it less corrosive . If you add more sodium , you get more concentrated lye , which you can dilute . You do n't need any catalysts , solvents , or other intermediate reagents about whose possible residues you should worry . All you need is food grade sodium . But here we come to the first problem with your plan . It is much easier to find food grade lye than to find food grade sodium . Retail lye is used for household purposes , including baking pretzels and cleaning cooking utensils . I do n't know of any use for retail sodium beyond seventh grade chemistry class demonstrations . The second problem is that storing pure sodium at home is a PITA . First , you 'll need to find some food grade liquid for the airtight seal , and it will react with cooking oils . You obviously do n't want to use kerosene , so you 'll probably need to get medicine grade liquid paraffin . Should you ever have a fire in your kitchen , the sodium will also burn with a much hotter flame than anything else around , and you probably wo n't get it extinguished until it has burned itself out - non-watery fire extinguishers are not very effective on it , and water-based ones will actually accelerate the fire . The third problem is that you should pay lots of attention during the reaction . Sodium powder is prone to spontaneous explosions . Luckily , there is n't that much chance that you 'll produce powder from it unwittingly . But the byproduct of the reaction , pure hydrogen , is also explosive when mixed with air at certain ratios , and you can not control the ratio you produce . The fourth problem is that the reaction is quite exothermic . You can mitigate it somewhat by adding very small amounts of the metal to the water ( but not small enough to make a powder ) , but you 'll still get some heat development . And it is happening right under a possibly explosive hydrogen-air mixture - not a good idea . So my recommendation is to just buy food grade lye and use that . It will save you from lots of headaches . The problems of making lye by brine electrolysis at home You clarified that you had planned to use electrolysis . This is possible , and sodium chloride is certainly a more benign ingredient than pure sodium . The resulting sodium hydroxide should be safe for consumption . Still , I think it 's more trouble than it 's worth , and purchasing commercial lye is the better option . First , you still have to manage your byproducts . You 'll get elemental hydrogen and elemental chlorine bubbling up . You do n't want either of these gases floating in your living space , hydrogen being explosive and chlorine plain poisonous . Also , if you want a decent lye concentration , you usually do the reaction in a container where the electrodes are separated by a semipermeable barrier , else it reacts right back to salt . The problem is that your product will corrode most barriers quickly . I have done it as a kid in a u-shaped part of a drinking straw , with a piece of sponge in the middle . The lye ate the sponge away , and before that the chlorine turned the water in its part sickly green ( yes , you have to dispose of that byproduct too somehow , it does n't get out so quickly ) . If you use this method , it will be very hard to either find a barrier which is not corroded by the lye , or accept some corrosion but make sure that the product ( which will contaminate your lye ) is not harmful when eaten . Then there is the part about electrodes Wayfaring Stranger mentions in a comment : you want to choose a cathode material which is not dangerous when ingested , especially no heavy metals . To complete the equipment safety part , use a glass container for the whole bath , not a plastic or metal one . And of course , do n't use phenolphtalein drops to check for the proper concentration , get dry strips for dipping .
Short answer : store mayonnaise has less yolks per volume oil , and yolks give most of the yellow color . Mainly the reason is that store mayonnaise adds water , rather than relying on the moisture in the egg yolks and vinegar . To quote On Food and Cooking , page 634 : Though cookbooks often say that the ratio of oil to egg yolk is critical , that one can only emulsify a half-cup or cup of oil , this is n't true . A single yolk can emulsify a dozen cups of oil or more . What is critical is the ratio of oil to water : there must be enough of the continuous phase for the growing population of oil droplets to fit into . This means you can use less yolks and just add water to get your volume . Since yolks impart most of the yellow color ( from plant pigments called xanthophylls ) , this reduces color considerably . Store mayonnaise also uses some whole eggs , not just yolks , which do not emulsify as well , but are cheaper . This further reduces the amount of yolk in the result . Note that while home mayonnaises use yolks , store mayonnaises can get away with including egg whites by using very powerful machines to emulsify the mayonnaise , and in some cases add emulsifiers such as lecithin to help stabilize it . The Experiment ! One whole , very jumbo egg , with a little white wine vinegar ( around 15 mL ) . For oil , I used vegetable oil with a small splash of olive oil . The total amount of oil used was 1.5 cups , or 350 mL . First , I tried to create mayonnaise by hand whipping with a mini-whisk . It turned out a pale yellow , and thickened some , but refused to thicken fully . This confirms that making a homemade mayonnaise by hand requires yolks or some sort of mechanical beating/blending ; whole eggs just do n't emulsify well enough . It 's fair to say that the result is quite yellow when it is n't fully blended . Next , I gave it a shot with my immersion blender : See how much lighter and paler the mayonnaise is ! I can only speculate that the blender created a much finer emulsion , and incorporated more air , reducing the impact of the oil and yolk color on light scattered off the micro-droplets . Finally , I went ahead and added flavorings ( a little dijon mustard , a ton of paprika , salt , pepper , and more vinegar ) . In this comparison against commercial mayonnaise , you can see that the result is now darker and more orange , courtesy of the paprika . It is also clear how close the color was before adding paprika . Clearly , the use of whole eggs is the biggest part of the equation . It is clear that by adding more water to thin the emulsion and then adding oil to achieve the proper consistency , I could make this even paler , very close to store mayonnaise . The use of mechanical blenders may assist in the process , producing a finer and paler emulsion . Recipes that include paprika also yield a more yellow-orange result ; I think it is for this reason that my commercial mayonnaise uses " paprika oleoresin " in place of ground paprika . Finally , the use of more heavily colored olive oil appears to darken the resulting mayonnaise . Given how bland my mayonnaise was with only a touch of olive oil , I would encourage you to blend in water and additional oil , rather than avoiding the olive oil . Ideally , the water would be added about a tsp at a time , when the mayonnaise is still somewhat liquid .
Mirltons are a member of the squash family , but have a traslucent , soft-crisp texture which is n't really exactly like any other squash . In recipes where they are an incidental ingredient , you can generally substitute zucchini ( especially if you peel and seed it ) without too much trouble , but in recipes where they are a main flavor they are hard to substitute . And , as Mien points out , it never really works to substitute the main ingredient in a recipe . I suggest that your daughter wait for midsummer and check out Mexican or Indian groceries until she finds some .
Well , if you really want a " definitive " way to measure when lactic fermentation is complete , you 'd have to do a laboratory test directly for residual sugars . Most traditional foods that are lactic-acid fermented do n't have enough sugar to reach a final acidity that will self-limit continued fermentation by killing all the bacteria . ( Foods with too much sugar also often tend to spontaneously undergo yeast fermentation and lead to alcohol production instead if not monitored . ) Given the wide variety of fermentation products that can result from initial ingredients and different fermentation conditions , it 's really difficult to come up with some sort of " test strip " or something for residual sugar that is accurate . Home fermenters rarely bother with such things , but large-scale commercial fermentation sometimes tests residual sugar content for batches to ensure shelf-stability . That said , a specific recipe with specific starting ingredients will often have a target pH range , depending on the quantity of sugar in the ingredients , the amount of salt ( which in excess will inhibit further fermentation ) , desired flavor , etc. . The composition of the ingredients will determine the mininum possible pH when fermentation is effectively complete . The desired pH of lacto-fermented foods can vary anywhere from about 3.0 ( even down to ~ 2.75 for some sweet relishes ) to 4.5 ( more common in grain-based ferments , or quick-fermented vegetables meant to be used up quickly ) . To answer the specific question for sauerkraut , I 'd say most people would say sauerkraut fermentation is " complete " when a pH of ~ 3.5 or below is reached ( though opinions may vary ) . Part of the difficulty in answering the question is that home fermentation is often done with the intention of keeping the food " alive " even when it is consumed , which means fermentation will still be ongoing . In most traditional food cultures around the word , lactic acid fermentation is often deliberately incomplete , only used for a short period to transform an ingredient and then use it within a dish for consumption . This contrasts with much alcohol production , where continued fermentation in your final product can obviously create various difficulties for bottling , proper aging , etc. . And some people just prefer food at various earlier stages in the fermentation process . To take sauerkraut as an example , a pH of 4.0-4 .5 will be achieved rather quickly ( usually within a few days , depending on temperature , salt content , etc. ) . Some people prefer the taste of a fresher , crunchier product , and they may only ferment for a few days and then refrigerate to slow down fermentation significantly . Other people like to go much further and will ferment sauerkraut anywhere from a month to several months , again depending on temperature -- to achieve a final pH below 3.5 and even down to ~ 3.0 . Over time , the final product will obviously get more sour , but it will also soften and various nutritional changes will take place . It 's all a matter of preference when done at home . Lastly , in reference to the " lagering " aspect of the question , I think the closest analog in lacto-fermentation is the fact that various processes ( and various bacteria ) will work better at different temperatures . A higher temperature fermentation , for example , may result in a greater acetic acid component in the final ingredients , enhancing the " sharp " vinegar notes . At lower temperatures other bacteria may become more prominent in the fermentation , and in some temperature ranges enzymes and natural ( spoilage ) reactions may help to change flavor and texture too . Anyhow , for these reasons , some people prefer to refrigerate fermented foods or hold them for a while at " cold cellar " temperatures to allow these " aging " mechanisms to work as bacteria slow down ( analogous to lagering ) . Whether this is done after fermentation is effectively complete or at an earlier stage when the food is less sour again depends on individual preference .
When I am using skim powdered milk and want more fat , I just replace some of the water in the recipe with heavy cream . Your recipe does n't have water , it already uses milk and cream . You could replace a little of the milk with cream to make up the difference . However , with all the cream and butter in that recipe , I doubt you would be able to notice the fat missing from the dry milk . I would just use your skim dry milk and not worry about it .
What happens is not so different than when you do add at boil . You just have less control over the perfectly cooked point . At sea level , water boils at 100 & deg ; C and 212 & deg ; F. However , when you add your room temperature ( or from the fridge at 4 & deg ; C temperature ) , the water temperature drops . How much you say ? well it depends mostly on the weight of water and the weight of your vegetables . If you add 1lb of vegetable from the fridge to 4 quart of boiling water , you 'll end up with a mix that is maybe around 85 & deg ; C ( 185 & deg ; F ) . At this point the stove tries to take the new mix back up to boiling point and your vegetables continue to cook . By adding the vegetables before boiling point , you 'll reduced the mixed temperature even further . At any given temperature , different vegetables will take a certain amount of time to cook . Since the temperature here is going up and down , knowing exactly when they 're prefect gets much harder , that 's why the recipes try to standardize on the boiling water at x minutes thing . That said , some food when taken through a range of temperature ( say cold to hot ) will have different components in them denature at different times and some things dissolving into the water before cooking begins . This sequence might end up with unpleasant and unsightly things released into the water and the food not holding together well . the bottom line : If you were close to boiling when you added food , do n't worry about it . If you put the food in cold water then brought to boil , you 're looking at a different recipe :)
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
This is most likely referring to honey processed without any heating , often simply called raw honey , or possibly cold-extracted or cold-processed . It likely has more flavor and color preserved than commercially-processed honey ( which uses plenty of heat ) , but it may not be much different from gently heated honey . It 's not actually cold ( honey flows really slowly when cold ) , just not heated . There are two primary ways honey would have been heated during processing . First and most common , most commercially sold honey has probably been heated substantially ( perhaps up to 165F ) to help melt crystals , allow impurities to separate , and to make sure everything 's dead and safe . This definitely does affect the honey - it makes the flavor a bit more mild , and the color a bit lighter . If you 're getting honey from a very small producer ( maybe someone with a hive in their yard ) , it 's also possible that they actually heated it in order to separate the honey from the beeswax . The most effective way to get honey out of the comb is to remove the caps and <URL> to spin the honey out of the frames , but for hobbyist beekeepers without access to an extractor who do n't want to just crush and strain it , another method is to heat the comb , letting the melted wax ( it melts around 145F ) float the top for easy separation . This is pretty gentle heating , and does n't have nearly as strong an effect as the commercial processes .
Sweetness is perceived in inverse relation to temperature , so what you say is quite correct . Further along the same range , ice cream or sorbet tastes much less sweet when frozen than when you taste the initial base .
Buying coriander whole rather than ground is probably your best bet . As is the case with allspice and coffee , they 're bound to eventually lose flavor , likely to light/heat/moisture , fresh grinding will bring back some of the spark . If you 're using fresh from the garden coriander you 're not out of options . There 's <URL> , and also <URL> if you 're willing to go down that route . If the fridge/freezer simply is n't an option , and having a bouquet of coriander is n't in the cards , then I would just hang them upside down in your basement/closet and then keep them in airtight containers away from direct light and heat .
It is not a good idea to combine ANY teflon pan with an automatic dishwasher , regardless of what the manufacturer says . But fortunately for you , I have handy the Cook 's Illustrated from October 2010 , which did a nonstick skillet ( aka frying pan aka saute pan ) review . According to them , even the best nonstick coatings wo n't survive more than a year or two of heavy use . This makes proper care all the more important . Brand also is n't a good indicator of coating quality , because many pan manufacturers buy coatings from the same suppliers . To quote the article : Most cookware manufacturers do n't make their own nonstick coating ; they buy it from suppliers offering a menu of options , from basic to premium , and spray it on their pans . It 's similar to painting a room ; the quality of nonstick coating is determined not only by what 's in it but also by how carefully it 's applied and cured , and how many coats the manufacturer decides to put on . They found the Tefal ( T-Fal in the States ) Professional Total Nonstick Fry Pan ( $ 35 ) had a nonstick coating that outperformed the other pans by a significant margin , probably due to its 5-layer nonstick coating ( most pans use 2-3 layers ) . The only fly in the ointment was its handle , which had rivets that loosened after abuse . But , for $ 35 that is n't bad , doubly because it outperformed the $ 150 + All-Clad nonstick pans they used normally . If you 're looking for something cheaper than that , I 'd suggest you look at construction and not brand . Pick a heavy pan ( for its size ) , with either solid , thick-gauge aluminum OR a multi-ply construction . This combination ensures the pan will heat evenly and rapidly ( crucial for eggs ) , and is resistant to warping ( important if you use an electric range ) . If you 're cooking eggs , avoid hard-anodized aluminum interiors , as they do n't help prevent adhesion of eggs , and just cost more . The nonstick layer should look thick and smooth , not slightly textured . My most-used frying pan ( the default egg pan ) is a small T-Fal that cost all of $ 7 . The important thing is that it has the right construction and I treat it correctly ; I 'm careful not to scratch the surface with utensils , I never use a scouring pad on it , and it ca n't go near the dishwasher . This makes more of a difference than picking a fancy brand .
Industrial breads use ' dough conditioners ' that soften the dough and make working with it easier . You can buy such mixes online , <URL> for instance , and I 've seen them for sale in natural food stores and the like . Other things that might work are adding a starch or a fat , or heat treating some of your flour in the microwave ( a minute for a cup , do n't do this to all the flour , it destroys some of the gluten ) . Guar gum or xanthan gum will help to keep things moist as well . I 've never used these techniques , so some experimentation might be necessary . Store bread in plastic bags as soon as it cools , and do n't slice right away .
I 'd say no never prick the sausages if you can help it . the fat inside helps to keep them succulent and moist , and if you have a problem with the splitting and are pricking them to release the pressure as was stated by @foodrules , then I 'd say you are cooking them over too high a heat . Lower the heat , or if you are BBQing move them further from the source , then you will get to have unsplit , moist sausages . When pan frying I prefer a very low heat for a long time . This allows a delicious sticky crust to develop on the outside of the sausages . mmm ... If they were meant to be pricked why would they not come pre pricked ?
This has to do with esters , which are flavor compounds created during fermentation . Each grape variety has a unique physiological make up with aromatic compounds found in trace amounts within the grape skin cells . The concentration of each of these aromatic sensations is dependent on the grape type and is mostly undetectable until the juice is fermented . Fermentation magnifies and makes these aromas more easily perceived by the nose , so think of wine as a caricature of the grape . From <URL> . <URL> <URL> , although in Shiraz I imagine it 's the same or similar to that in Zinfandel : Australian chemists have identified the compound responsible for the peppery aroma of the country 's iconic Shiraz wines - and discovered the same molecule is by far the strongest aroma in peppercorns themselves .
Clean your potatoes . Peel if desired . Slice in half , lengthways . Place flat sides down on your cutting board . Cut again in half , lengthways . This would be for very large wedges . For slightly smaller , cut in thirds , lengthways , on a 60 degree angle , from the outside of the potato to the centre line where it hits the cutting board . For even smaller , slice in half again after the second half cut .

How to caramelise onions ?
Low and slow is the only way to go , I 'm afraid . You can add some broth and simmer them down ( as opposed to just cooking them in oil ) but make sure you add little enough that it will all evaporate ... Do n't want to be pouring off flavor .
You can put a cup/bowl of water ( you can also add some vinegar if you do n't mind the smell ) in there , heat it up to boiling , let the steam out . Then you should let it sit in the microwave without opening the door . Wait for a few minutes , open the microwave , and wipe off the inside . All that steam should have soften any stains or food pieces left in there . You may spray some natural cleaners or lemon/vinegar mixtures to wipe off the inside more .
Clams take about twice to three times as long to cook than mussels . The shells are just so much thicker it takes that long for the heat to get inside . Kinda like trying to cook a 2 inch steak on a grill beside a 1/2 inch steak and expecting them both to be done at the same time . If you want to have both for a meal then do them in seperate pots and mix after or ... pre-cook the clams ( not recommended ) and add them to the mussels when cooking them , so they 'll re-heat ( and get rubbery too probably but I know many a restaurant that does this ... they have no love for the clam ) . Seperate pots is the best way . Enjoy .
Yes . You can either use aluminum foil that has been lightly sprayed with some Pam or rubbed with butter OR a piece of parchment paper cut into a larger circle than the pie . It will create an overhang that you can use to pull out the weights or beans . If you try to bake it with the beans on the surface it will cook directly into the dough and your shell will be ruined . I still prick the bottom of the crust because steam and air will still be trapped underneath the pie weights . When you remove the weights to finish the baking of the crust , if it has not been pricked you could still end up with pockets and air bubbles as that part of the crust is still a bit raw .
Draining the juice , refilling the jar with oil and then storing to reduce the acidity wo n't work because : Acid and lye can be diluted only with water or liquids like water ( if I remember correctly , ethanol will also work ) but not oil . You might run into the risk of botulism . ( Maybe not since the mushrooms are sour . If you do n't measure the pH you ca n't be sure ) . The only thing you can do is to soak the portion of mushrooms you intend to eat in water before eating . Replacing the brine with water of the whole jar beforehand to lower the pH will shorten the shelf life significantly .
Cut the tomato in half at the midsection or equator ( stem end being the " north pole " ) to expose the seed cavities . Holding the cut side down over your garbage bowl or trash can , gently squeeze to remove the seeds . You can easily pry out stubborn seeds with your fingertips . Place the tomato half cut-side up on the cutting board ( Cutting waxy skinned vegetables is much easier when the skin is on the bottom so the force of the knive cuts cleanly through the skin with less effot ) and cut in half again . After doing this with both pieces the tomato will be in quarters . If you want evenly diced pieces of just the exterior flesh ( such as for sprinkling on a plate for a garnish ) , then use your knife to cut out the interior portion so that just the tomato " shell " remains . You can then easily dice the exterior shell . Otherwise , after cutting into quarters just gently push down to flatten each quarter and cut into strips lengthwise and then cut cross-wise to finish the process . While cumbersome to explain in text , it 's much safer and quicker than cutting the tomato into slices and then trying to dice from there .
Chives are an herb , green onions are part of ... well an onion . They are often used in similar ways and in similar dishes . You can substitute one for the others in most cases , but I could not say they are interchangeable . They have distinct flavors and it will change the dish to change the ingredient . Also do not attempt to replace green onion with dried chives 1-to-1 ( or fresh chives for that matter ) . Dried chives , not uncommonly found in pre-packaged spice racks , have about as much flavor as straw and will not deliver the desired result ( unless you like straw ) .
Your polenta was probably sticking because you did n't use enough oil or your barbecue was too cool . Olive oil on a barbecue is a bad idea as it flares up and burns easily , you 're better off with a more standard vegetable oil . The choice of oil is not as important as the quantity in keeping things from sticking , you need to use a lot of it . I use a high temperature silicone to baste the barbecue surface with a lot of oil when I need things not to stick , some use a halved onion dipped in oil to apply it to the grill . Also oil your food . Your barbecue surface could also be too cool . If it 's too cool the surface of the polenta block wo n't form a crust quickly enough and will adhere to the grill . It should be hot enough that you ca n't hold the back of your hand over it for more than 2-3 seconds . Other factors in frying or grilling polenta are the thickness of the polenta , the temperature of the polenta , and the thickness of the mix . You want to be grilling thick slabs of still fridge-temperature polenta that was on the gloopy side when cooked .
A glass of water in the microwave will result in less microwave energy reaching the popcorn . I use a large glass of water ( 8 - 12 oz . ) when I 'm softening butter because I want the water to absorb most of the energy . For popcorn , you may get by with 2-4 ounces of water . I 've also found that the amount of oil makes a huge difference . I sometimes pop popcorn in a paper lunch bag . If I do n't use any oil , I get the combination of burnt and unpopped you described . With a teaspoon of oil added to 1/3 cup of popcorn , results are a lot better . Perhaps you just need a little more oil to get great popcorn .
The pigments that give onions the colour behave like a litmus test . They are red in the naturally acidic onion . They turn green/blue in an alkaline environment . It sounds like when you cooked the beans it created that alkaline environment to cause the colour change . <URL>
You need to cover soft vegetables in egg or batter first . Normally the vege 's are steamed first to actually cook , cooled , then egg washed or lightly battered and flash deep fried in hot oil just to set the thin batter Try Indian style spicy pea/chickpea flour batters
Depends on the type of cabbage , but I 've had success with prepping as if I was about to boil , and then freeze on a dry cloth ; Once frozen , transfer to an air tight freezer bag , and use as fast as is practical .
Well , you 're definitely right . Onions cooked at a high temperature act differently than ones cooked at a low temperature , per " the bible " aka On Food and Cooking . However , it does n't go in to much of an explanation as to why . Probably the most relevant aspects of what is in there are : When onions and their relatives are heated , the various sulfur compounds react with each other and with other substances to produce a range of characteristic flavor molecules . The cooking method , temperature and medium strongly affect the flavor balance . Baking , drying , and microwaving tend to generate trisulfides , the characteristic notes of overcooked cabbage . Cooking at high temperatures in fat produces more volatiles and a stronger flavor than do other techniques . <URL> Since a low temperature produces less volatiles , I assume that the natural sugars of the onion shine through instead . It 's probably also important to understand where the oniony flavor comes from . The spice , as you describe it , is the onions natural defense mechanism . However , it does n't exist defacto in the onion , but is rather the result of a chemical reaction . The onion stores very reactive sulfur in the cell fluid , and a seperate trigger mechanism in a storage vacuole . When you cut / crush / cook / peel the onion , you break the vacuole and the enzyme and sulfur cause a chemical reaction giving off the spice . <URL> &amp; <URL> )
Although ours rarely lasts for more than a week , we typically just store it in an airtight container with the rest of the cereal . I would imagine the fat could eventually go rancid , so if you need to store it for weeks or months , either refrigeration or freezing should work . You 'll still want the airtight container , however , to prevent any fridge funk from tainting the taste .
I have a " Grill Wok " that I received as a gift that looks like this : It is great for grilling potatoes . Peel and cube to about 1 " pieces . Par boiling or microwaving works equally well for blanching the cubes . Toss in a large bowl with olive oil and melted butter Add seasoning : salt , pepper , chili powder , oregano , etc. ( to taste ) Allow Grill Wok to preheat on the grill , when hot add potatoes . Cook till golden brown ( I believe mine was obtained at Bass Pro Shop , but they are available elsewhere )
On another couple of sites ( <URL> for starters ) I found the answer to this . It appears that mould is expected sometimes in the Pancetta making process and as a general rule of thumb as long as it is n't too green and furry then it should be OK . I 've followed Ruhlman 's advice and dabbed the spots of mould with a vinegar soaked cloth and it wiped straight off and looks fine . My meat was coming up to the end of it 's hanging time anyway so rather than worry about it further I 've refrigerated it . I hope this helps anyone that stumbles across this with the same issue .
Round popcorn is just made from a different variety of popcorn , called mushroom popcorn . The " normal " kind is called butterfly popcorn , or sometimes snowflake popcorn . The two are mentioned in <URL> ( last paragraph of the linked section ) , along with a photo . It looks like it 's pretty easy to buy online , if you prefer it . Mushroom popcorn kernels are a little sturdier and easier to coat , so it 's well-suited for prepackaged popcorn and especially things like caramel corn , but at least to me that sturdiness is also a slight toughness , so I prefer the butterfly-style popcorn most of us are used to .
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
If you are simply looking to convert gluten contents then you can certainly always go higher by adding the correct proportion of vital wheat gluten to dough to get the percentage of gluten that you want . However there are many other differences between flour bags in terms of processing . How is the flour ground ? What wheat variety is it from ? Is it white or whole ? There are a lot of variables . I do speak as someone who has found that Gold Medal is perfectly acceptable for all my baking needs and also routinely uses store brand flour . Personally I suggest simply trying whatever flour you want to try ( not including substituting bread for cake or something along those lines , that definitely will cause issues ) and seeing how the recipe goes . Determine if a higher-end flour brand is for you yourself .
A crisp crepe is less about the recipe and more about the cooking technique . You simply need to leave it a little longer before flipping it , allowing the edges to crisp . A little more oil than usual will help , but it should still only be a thin coating wiped on with a paper towel . To make a thicker crepe , simply use less liquid . You can also look at using alternative flours like buckwheat which alter the texture .

Why do purple snap beans turn green when cooked ?
This is another case for anthocyanins , the same compound that causes garlic and ginger to turn blue . Anthocyanins are pH sensitive , only appearing blue or purple when in the presence of acidity . As you cook the beans , the cells begin to rupture and lose water , which causes the acid around the anthocyanins to be diluted . As this happens , they lose their color allowing the green chlorophyll ( which was always present ) to show through . <URL>
Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam , and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid . Specifically , 1 mL of water becomes ~ 1.36 LITERS of vapor , before it gets heated further . That 's 1000-fold expansion , before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated . Marshmallows do n't have all that much water content , but when it 's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily , it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon . You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient ; unless I 've badly muddled my calculations , gas expansion from 20C to ~ 150C ( caramelization temperature ) will increase the gas volume by under 50 % .
I always go with my gut in these situations , so scraping it off is probably a good idea . If the green was not really dark and moldy looking , or really soft in comparison to the rest of the flesh , it could be that it just was n't fully ripe yet in that area . Either way , you 're planning on cooking the squash , correct ? I believe that this would be perfectly safe to eat now that the questionable parts have been removed . I 'd eat it with no qualms . If the rest of the squash was firm , and not bad looking on the outside or inside , then I am guessing this is not a problem , unless said green part was much softer than the rest of the squash .
If you 're making a sauce that is n't supposed to curdle , and it does , you throw it out and start over .
Your microwave is n't exactly cooking your food from the inside out . Instead , what is happening is that some parts of your food that happen to be on the interior are being heated faster than those parts of the exterior that you observe . This sort of uneven heating is intrinsic with how microwaves work . Microwave ovens cook unevenly because a pattern of standing waves forms inside the oven chamber , and the pattern creates an array of hotspots throughout the oven 's volume . An operating frequency of 2.45 GHz will produce a wavelength of around 12.25 cm , and the regions of maximum intensity ( hotspots ) will be at half-wave points , or every 6.125 cm , but in a complex 3D pattern From <URL> So , in your microwave the waves happen to be arranged just so the inside of your casserole heats up faster than the outside . In microwave ovens that do not have a rotating carousel , this effect is even more pronounced , although even using a carousel is not a panacea . Many microwave oven recipes often include instructions to rotate and/or stir the food intermittently as a means of distributing the heat more evenly for the same reasons ; changing the position of the food within the oven has the effect of shifting the hotspots around in the food as it cooks . So , my suggestion is to try changing the position of the food in the oven over time , particularly if it 's being heated over several minutes , as that should help it heat more evenly . If you can , it is also a good idea to stir the food intermittently as well . Personally , after the microwave finishes the allotted time , I also will stir and then wait a few minutes before serving to let the hot spots naturally dissipate a bit via <URL> .
First off I want to point out the term " fresh " . While some containers might keep milk from spoiling for longer , it may not taste as nice . Several things might be why : 1 . ) Plastics leach flavor and odor into the milk . <URL> , not wax since about the 1940s . I would say this is likely the biggest impact -- I 've always found plastic containers make drinks and food taste downright funky . <URL> are made of <URL> . The FDA considers this material safe , but just because something is safe does n't mean it does n't impart a flavor . <URL> showing glass having least effect on taste : " ... overall , the development of water off-taste occurred least in glass containers and most often in high density polyethylene containers ... " 2 . ) <URL> Ice cold milk tastes better ( fresher ) to most people . The thing is , it 's not actually colder while in the fridge . <URL> That means heat can transfer through it faster than plastic . The <URL> demands equilibrium , so while your hand makes the milk hotter , the glass of milk makes your hand colder . Because of glass 's higher thermal conductivity , it does this faster than plastic and we sense the glass as being colder . So while it 's not - actually - colder and would n't keep the milk from spoiling for longer , it would affect our perception of how cold it is and therefore also the taste . Packaging of milk varies so a thicker glass bottle might also keep the milk colder while it 's sitting on the counter vs most thin plastic milk jugs . There are a lot of variables with packaging so it really depends on what you 're comparing . 3 . ) <URL> Permeability : <URL> Starting in 1937 the <URL> used to be one of the main statutory tests for checking if milk was bad by checking how much oxygen is present in the milk . This lets you know how much aerobic bacteria is in the milk ( bacteria that requires oxygen ) . <URL> While we do have newer , better tests for handling milk in bulk refrigeration these days , it 's important to note for a long time this was a large part of measuring milk quality . 4 . ) It just takes time to process , test , and ship milk . You mentioned it yourself -- usually to get a glass bottle you have to get it from a dairy , something local and closer to home . So it has n't traveled as far . Also , while it 's not legal everywhere , some people will sell raw milk in glass bottles so there is n't even time wasted <URL> or testing the milk . <URL> . Still , some people might prefer the taste while it 's still good . Processing is done to kill bad bacteria ( so it 's not a bad thing ) , but it does take time that eats into shelf life . Milk delivered to you may only be a few hours old . The processing itself can effect the flavor of the milk . Processing plants can hold milk for up to 3 days . 5 . ) In many areas , the companies that bottle with glass are the ones that are making higher quality milk in the first place . Glass is expensive , and usually only people who are willing to pay more for higher quality milk are going to be the same ones who pay for a higher quality bottle . Glass bottles are good for the environment and so some people are willing to pay more for that . <URL> uses about half as much energy vs plastic counterpart . Note here that glass does n't automatically mean " better milk " . 6 . ) <URL> In a 1980 study , subjects were blindfolded and asked to tell whether the beverage they were drinking was flavored orange . Only one in five could . But when they were allowed to see what they were drinking , each of them identified the orange flavor . And when a lime-flavored drink was colored orange , nearly half of respondents thought it was flavored orange You also see this with high-end restaurants -- they put a lot of value in how the food is plated , going as far as using a ruler to get a perfectly straight line , and wiping up small drips to make the food look perfect . Our vision influences our taste . Since most glass is translucent and most plastic containers are not , there 's a good chance this influences taste as well .
The most likely culprits are : Steeping too long : 1-3 minutes , depending on the type and grade of tea . Using water that is too hot or too cold : Again , this depends on the type and grade of tea . <URL> is an excellent resource for getting these factors right : On Steeping Time : Green tea does not require much time . Too long a steeping time will result in more bitterness and a less balanced flavor . We recommend experimenting with a range of 1 - 3 minutes . Japanese green teas generally taste best at 1 - 2 minutes while Chinese green teas seem to prefer 2 - 3 minutes ( the smaller leaves of Japanese teas will extract faster than the generally larger leaves of Chinese teas ) . Steeping time should be balanced with water temperature : the lower the temperature , the longer the tea can be steeped . On Temperature As a general guideline , green teas taste best when brewed at temperatures between 140 ° F - 185 ° F ( 60 ° C-85 ° C ) . The grade of the tea and the time of its harvest will also influence the appropriate steeping temperature . Green teas picked earlier in the spring will benefit from lower temperature brewing due to their overall higher levels of amino acids . ... The most accurate way is to use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water in the kettle . One approach is to heat the water in your kettle to the desired temperature and then pour it into your teapot . Another approach is to heat the water to boiling and then let it cool down a bit before pouring into your teapot . <URL> for further background .
If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge , it means you did it right ! Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin ; that 's the very essence of stock-making . The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock ; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency , but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture . The more you reduce the stock , the more gelatinous it will become , so if it turned out stiffer than you expected , it 's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate . Typically , when making stock , you use a very low simmer ; just a few bubbles per minute . Any more than that and your stock will reduce . But reducing is perfectly OK , and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few tablespoons ; it 's like bullion , only without all the salt and preservatives . Heavily-reduced stock is called glace de viande and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick , imparting a powerful meat flavour . But you probably did n't reduce it that much . If you 're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous , even at higher temperatures , you can feel free to dilute it . For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1 , but taste as you go along just to make sure you 're not watering it down too much . When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator , it is probably fat , which you should skim off and discard ( or reserve ) . The rest is your actual stock , and in your case it sounds delicious . Also , since you mention vacuum-sealing - I prefer to use covered ice cube trays for freezing stock . That lets you portion it out much more easily than a big solid blob .
Dark roast has a heavy bitter taste . As espresso usually is served pretty strong , people expect the bitter taste . Most bars serve 70/30 or 80/20 ( natural/dark roast ) blends . If the roast is made of the cheaper robusta bean , the coffee shop can save money . But , you can make an excellent espresso from 100 % natural roast arabica beans ( I do it all the time ) . People will notice the difference , even though they 're not conscious what it is .
It wo n't turn bad , in fact it may make it last longer . You may have madeira-ized it ( see below ) Madeira wine is known for it 's extended " shelf life " after opening because of it 's unique process of being heated to as high as 60 degrees C ( 140 F ) . You may find that in the Campari some of the sugar may have crystalised . This may slightly affect the flavour , but it most certainly wo n't make it turn bad .
Soften . Other things that typically are added with salt will tend to toughen the beans , but it is n't the fault of the salt . For decades , chefs have circulated the oral tradition that adding salt hardens beans , but it 's a myth . Several scientific studies verify that adding salt to the soaking water for dried beans will reduce the cooking times . The first and most cited article , originally published in 1977 , can be found <URL> . As mentioned in the first answer you cited , the fine folks at Cooks Illustrated found in 2008 that 3 TBSP per gallon of water produces soft skins while not over-salting the interior of the beans . Since you ca n't see the full article , here is the science according to CI : " Why does soaking dried beans in salted water make them cook up with softer skins ? It has to do with how the sodium ions in salt interact with the cells of the bean skins . As the beans soak , the sodium ions replace some of the calcium and magnesium ions in the skins . Because sodium ions are weaker than mineral ions , they allow more water to penetrate into the skins , leading to a softer texture . During soaking , the sodium ions will only filter partway into the beans , so their greatest effect is on the cells in the outermost part of the beans . " Harold McGee 's NY Times blog ( August 9 , 2008 ) also notes that adding salt early enough will allow complete penetration of the bean , which improves flavor . On the other hand , things typically added with salt -- particularly sugar and calcium-rich products -- tend to toughen beans ( and the salt gets the blame ) . This toughening effect is most notable in baked-bean recipes using things like ketchup , molasses , and BBQ sauce . You can bake these beans for days , yet the beans will stay whole and firm . The actual mechanism for this effect is not clear ; one hypothesis currently circulating seems to be that these products stabilize the cell-cell " glue " ( e.g. , Shirley Corriher says so on Good Eats " Pantry Raid III - Cool Beans " , transcript online <URL> ) , but I could not find any peer-reviewed study specifically verifying that hypothesis .
Assuming the cod was the same quality as before and you de-salted the fish in the fridge for 24 to 48 hours , then I would also guess overcooking . Rendering the gelatin at 45 & deg ; C ( as suggested in the paper <URL> ) should prevent the fish from cooking and give enough time to get it into the oil . You can always cook the fish in a separate step after you made the pil pil . Modern techniques for salting cod use less salt and create a product that will not be edible by future archeologists , so store in a dry cool place ( tightly wrapped in the fridge ) .
The thing to remember , vis a vis bacterial contamination , is that it 's almost always the OUTSIDE of the meat that 's contaminated , not the inside . With pork and chicken you 're worried about an internal parasite/bacteria , which is why they 're not cooked rare . With beef , if it 's grade A , it 's good to go , and most everything you buy in the grocery store is fine . With tuna ( which is another one people like super-rare ) the story is mostly the same , though the chance of getting a parasite from fish is higher . In both cases , do a hot sear on the outside , and it 'll take care of any bacteria that may be hanging around . The reason ground beef is considered a higher threat is because the " outside " is pretty much the whole thing after the grinding process .
Typically dry beans expand 2-3 times their original volume when soaked , depending on their age ( fresher beans have more moisture left than older ones and expand less ) . I usually put them in a large pot and cover them with at least 5-6cm of water above .
Ground beef cooks quite fast . It does n't need more than 5 minutes ( depending on the base of your pan and the amount of meat of course ) . Just take a piece and rip/cut it open . If it 's brown inside , and not red or pink , it 's fully cooked .
I am not familiar with nopales , but I would be astonished if their green color was determined by something else than chlorophyll . Chlorophyll is usually destroyed by normal cooking techniques . If you want to keep the color mostly green ( some dulling is inevitable ) : cook the vegetable in an alkaline fluid . The easiest way is to use water with some baking soda added . The problem here is that humans like food which is slightly acidic , and alkaline food tastes soapy . Also , vegetable fibers soften more easily in alkaline environments , so they will be somewhat mushy . So use a very small amount . If they are to be added to a dish which is acidic ( in a Mexican dish , the culprit will probably be tomatoes ) , cook the green vegetable separately , and only combine it with the rest of the dish at the last possible moment . Right before serving is best . Heat destroys chlorophyll too . Cook the green vegetable as short as possible . Blanching is perfect , do n't forget the ice bath at the end . It will probably be enough as a preparation method . While I do n't know how hard a nopale is , I find blanching to be quite sufficient even for broccoli ( provided the water contained either salt or baking soda ) , and their stems are one of the woodiest things we eat . If you do n't think they are softened enough after blanching , cook them longer , until you find they are sufficiently softened .
What are the primary causes of this ? The steam and other hot gasses that were puffing the cookies up either escapes or condenses . Without heat to create more steam , the cookies deflate . You get exactly the same effect with bread , quiches , and other baked goods . You can hear bread start to make a crackling sound almost as soon as it comes out of the oven , and the sound continues for some minutes until the bread has cooled a bit . Quiches are always quite puffy looking when they 're in the oven , but they start to shrink a bit as they cool . If you want your cookies to shrink less , you might try cooking them at a slightly higher temperature , or cooking them a bit longer , or perhaps not chilling them so much prior to baking . Bumping up the amount of egg white in the cookie may help , too . The idea is to get the structure of the cookie to set a bit more by the time you remove the cookies from the oven . That will , of course , cause the cookies to be less chewy and more crunchy .
<URL> are antioxidants that are a very common water based pigment in plants . There are over <URL> which are are responsible for many <URL> . It is thought that the colors serve to attract pollinators to flowers and camouflage leaves from herbivores . They are the naturally occurring in purple snap beans , garlic , some ginger , many berries , red cabbage , as well as many other common foods . When added as a food coloring , they have the E number E163 . The color is dependent on the pH of the fluid around them . This causes many plants ( such as <URL> ) to lose color as they are cooked and their cell walls begin to burst and release water , diluting fluids the anthycyanins are in or absorbing cooking liquids of a different pH. Some varieties of <URL> contain anthocyanins which can turn blue when exposed to acids . Varieties of ginger originating in Japan contain these compounds , but varieties originating in China do not , which explains why this only happens to some ginger . The pH of ginger is slightly acidic , so that probably starts the reaction . Anthocyanins are also responsible for <URL> when in an acidic solution . In the case of garlic , the color is sometimes enhanced by reactions between the sulfur compounds naturally occurring in garlic and copper that may be present in water or cooking vessels . This creates another blue pigment , which is still perfectly safe to consume . More technical information can be found in <URL> .
I think the problem lies in that the beans are not water blanched , but rather oil blanched . The technique is called " dry frying " , and is a traditional Sichuan cooking method . The oil temp is kept low to dry out the inside while cooking the outside of the food . After the dry frying you can then stir fry the food . This technique should give you the required look and texture to the food . Hope this helps .
The main difference is the degradation of cell walls . The human digestive system does indeed struggle to break down the cellulose in cell walls , meaning that we are far more efficient in getting nutrients from vegetables when they are cooked . That does n't mean however that cooked veggies are always more nutritious than raw ones . There is actually quite a bit of debate on that and some people even eat raw foods exclusively . Your question is actually very similar to <URL> . You might find some useful insights there .

How long can I store cooking wine ?
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
Yes , it is possible , and in fact usually results in better bread , because the yeast has more time to work and develop flavour . It depends on the recipe , but you should usually reduce the amount of yeast being used to prevent overproofing . You can keep most doughs for a couple of days in the fridge , depending again on the amount of yeast and how often the fridge is opened . Simply mix and knead your dough as normal , cover it tightly with plastic wrap over the bowl , then put it straight in the fridge . You will usually need to allow a couple of hours the next morning for the dough to ' wake up ' and finish a full proof , but if your dough has fully risen in the fridge ( ie it has grown 1.5-2 times ) you can go straight to shaping .
When we have had garlic in our garden I have used the garlic leaves . They do have a garlicky flavor but are milder than garlic cloves . I tend to use them more as I would chives or garlic chives as in addition to having the milder flavor than the cloves they make for a quite nice presentation . Regarding drying them , I have never tried it . Off the top of my head I ca n't think of any reason not to dry them for later use but there may be issues that I just do n't know about .
If your quartering of the chicken was done quickly then you are just asking how long you can keep a chicken in the fridge . <URL> Your 40 hours is fine .
A mixture of flour and water at room temperature is a very hospitable growth medium for many bacteria , yeasts , and molds ; and indefinitely is a long time ... Even if you are extremely vigilant when it comes to kitchen hygiene , the mixture will eventually start to grow some form of microbes . This process could take a week or more to become obvious . If you use the batch up within a week or so it is unlikely to cause any problems . For longer storage you should refrigerate the dough and/or add salt ( in the proportional amount you would use for bread ) . If it develops an off smell or visible mold you are better off throwing it away . Keep in mind that hydrating flour , especially whole grain flours , activates amylase enzymes that break down starches into simple sugars . This process , called autolysis , improves browning and flavor , but if allowed to go on too long it leads to a gummy crumb or poor overall structure .
Yes , you can store it for about a day in the fridge . Let it warm up again before you cook it though .
Yes , it will " make it last longer in the fridge " for a certain definition of " last longer " : it will not mould nor infect other foodstuffs in the fridge if it does n't come into direct contact with any of them . Is it still safe to eat after a few of these re-heatings ? Very probably not ! Elaboration : More then half of the number of cells in your body are actually bacteria ; bacteria do n't generally kill you but the toxins they release is what kills you . E.g. Botulinum Toxinum D ( one of the toxins released during Botulism ) has an LD50 of 0.4 ng/kg , which means that you need about 500g ( a pound ) to kill 99.9 % of all human beings on the entire planet ... ( And that is for just a few re-heatings ; for " nearly indefinitely " we need to bring extremophiles in the equation ... ) <URL>
Wine will eventually turn into vinegar . So , other than having a really icky taste by itself ( unless you like drinking vinegar :) ) , it is n't bad for your health and you can cook with it .
Looks like ehow has the <URL> thus far to storing bean sprouts After purchasing Bean Sprouts should be stored and washed after purchasing in growing . The article indicates that the best methods for storage are the following : Wash them after you purchase them . Wash bean sprouts after purchasing or growing . Wash them in cold water to remove seed coats , roots and other residue that may be present . If you are using them within a day , store them in the refrigerator at 40 to 45 degrees . Place the sprouts in a plastic bag with a wet paper towel to keep them moist . Store in icy water and change the water few times a day You can also store sprouts in a bucket of icy water and change the water a few times a day . Depending on how long the sprouts were in transit or on the store shelf , they should last longer than when stored in a plastic bag . Freeze them Freeze sprouts for the longest storage . Wash sprouts as described in Step One . Then heat one layer at a time in steam for three minutes . Cool right away in icy water and drain . Put the sprouts into plastic containers and seal . It also mentions in the <URL> to just grow them to provide the best freshness . Apparently the shelf life of beansprouts should only be stored up to <URL> Source : <URL>
There 's no rule that you have to drink your wine 24 hours after un-corking it , in fact some wines can taste better after 24 hours . 3 or 4 days is fine in many cases , and some wines are still drinkable a week after opening . This can be extended by refrigerating your wine after opening , white or red , you can get 2 weeks out of a bottle of wine if it 's stored in the fridge . With reds let the glass stand for 10 minutes or so after pouring to get the optimal temperature . 2 weeks out of the fridge and it 's probably vinegar , but if it still takes ok you can cook with it no problem .
In the freezer , more-or-less indefinitely , depending on how good your freezer is . Certainly months to years . In the fridge , it depends on the kind of mole . Quick moles ( like various green moles ) do n't keep very long , maybe a week at most . A long-cooked mole should keep a bit longer -- up to 2 weeks -- since all of the ingredients are completely cooked . If you 're not planning to use it within a week , though , why not freeze it ? The texture wo n't take any harm from freezing and thawing .
Apples are best stored at 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) at 90 % humidity . If you do n't have a cellar , you 'll have to try to recreate that environment as best you can . The closest you can come in most small apartments is actually a plastic bag with some holes poked in for ventilation ( to prevent excess moisture from building up ) . Then put that in the refrigerator to get close to the correct temperature ; the best location is the vegetable crisper where you have control over the humidity . Do n't overpack them , though - about 80-90 % full is the densest you should go . Also be sure to pick only the best apples you can find if you plan to store them long-term . Over-ripe apples will obviously not last as long , and any bruising or piercing will speed up the decay significantly . Edit : If it 's a large number of apples then you can store them in a crate , which provides adequate ventilation , but good luck getting that into the refrigerator . I would still separate them into plastic bags , put whatever I could in the crisper , the rest in the fridge " proper " , and put out any that I intend to consume within a week or two in a regular fruit bowl out in the open . If that 's still not enough , then you probably need to accept that small apartments are n't very well-suited to storing very large amounts of fresh food ; just because they 're easy to get , does n't mean it makes economic sense .
Put in a ziplock bag with a piece of paper towel to absorb moisture , and stick in the fridge . Also applies to lettuce .
Short version : If it 's only overnight , and you seal the containers reasonably well , you 'll be okay prepping any of those ingredients ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator overnight . I often leave onions in the fridge when preparing a recipe that calls for only half an onion , or if I 've decided to use less than I prepped , or if I 'm making a salsa and I chop the onions before realizing I do n't have as many tomatoes as I thought , etc. . If you do n't cover them they will dry out a bit , but overnight does n't do much harm ; I find if they 're tightly covered , whether in a glass bowl with plastic wrap or a sealed plastic storage container , they 're just as good the next day . The same goes for carrots and celery . I 'm sure there 's been a time when I prepped too much mirepoix ; but generally speaking , if you have a cut carrot or stalk of celery in the fridge , it does n't suffer too much overnight . More than a day and it starts to dry out ; the cut surface of the carrot will start to look like the end near the tops , and possibly split . The celery dries out more quickly , as it 's got higher water content and more fragile structure to begin with ; more than a day and it 'll lose its color , eventually turning limp and yellow , starting from the cut end . For the veggies , the way to keep them freshest is with a tight seal and as little air as possible . You could put them in a zipper bag and squeeze out any extra air but I think a reasonably-sized glass bowl , covered tightly with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge , is good enough for 12-24 hours . If you do n't have room in the fridge , you 'll probably still be okay , and they may even be less prone to drying out ( the air in your fridge is very low-humidity ; sometimes you have a special compartment for which the humidity can be adjusted , for fruits and vegetables ) . I have less experience prepping meat ahead of time , unless I 'm brining or marinading it ; in those situations , the meat 's covered by a liquid that contains preservatives ( salt , acid ) that help prevent it from spoiling , and it 's always refrigerated . Keeping it cool and minimizing the contact with air or contaminants is the main thing . If you only have enough room in the fridge to store some of your prepped ingredients , use it for the meat . In this case I 'd say a zipper bag with the air squeezed out is the clear way to go ; meat is malleable and you 'll be able to get nearly all of the air out , which means it 'll store almost as well as it did before you chopped it into pieces . The thing to remember about ground , chopped or cubed meat is that anything that contaminated the outside surface of the original cut is now mixed evenly throughout . This is why it 's generally safer to order a steak rare than it is to order a hamburger rare ; the center of the steak has n't been exposed to as much of its environment as the center of the burger , during handling and storage . So even if you refrigerate your prepped meat in a sealed container with the air evacuated , effectively storing it just as well as when it was in the original packaging and in one piece , I would n't expect it to keep the same effective " use by " date because it 's been disturbed and mixed and exposed to the environment of your prep area . You 're better off doing this with a cut that you purchased recently , which has n't been refrozen and is n't nearing expiration .
The cheesecake kept for 1 year just fine with no discernible off flavors or other problems . I 'm a homebrewer and we wound up putting the cheesecake into the freezer section of our spare ' beer fridge ' . That freezer is pretty much only used for overflow freezer space , and the refrigerator section is used for beer bottles and kegs , and we have had a few apples in the crispers for most of the year , but that 's it . The freezer section was rarely opened more than once per week . The cheesecake had no off flavors , and only had light water crystallisation on the surface , which was not at all detrimental to our enjoyment of the cake . This was a plain ' real ' cooked cheesecake with graham cracker crust . So , for a ' good enough ' storage method , wrap loosely in foil and store in a freezer that is rarely used , and the cheesecake should be excellent for at least one year .
I regularly store chopped onion in my refrigerator ( or at least halves &amp; quarters ) . I either use tight-sealing plastic containers or zip-top bags . You may want to double-bag in zip-tops to be sure to avoid a smell . One problem you may be having is onion-ness getting on the outside of the container . Be sure the outside is all clean and dry - no point in having a nicely sealed packet of onion when the outside can get all stinky anyway .
rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title . However , you can also address your problem the other way round . First , cook the soup until your noodles are al dente ( but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed ) . Take the big pot of soup off the heat . Second , take a small pot , and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater . Put it on the heat , and cook until the noodles are done . ( Alternatively , put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot , but I would n't nuke a good soup for no reason ) . Third , eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own . Fourth , freeze the soup from the big pot . Finis . Note that from a food safety point of view , you are better off with flash cooling the soup . But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free . Plus , 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling . If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people , you should probably prefer a rapid cooling .
Most bacon home curing methods you will read use a semi-dry cure where the bacon is covered in a cure mixture then allowed to sit in the resulting brine made of salts , sugars , and exuded liquid from the meat . This is probably due to the fact that most people are more comfortable using their fridge and are also only making a small amount of bacon . The key to what you are looking for is dry curing with drainage . By using a cure mixture which includes nitrates ( traditional ) or nitrites ( modern ) as well as a draining board or table you produce a quickly cured meat product that is stable and can be produced at higher than fridge temperatures . The drawbacks are that the final product will have a greater loss of meat weight due to the loss of water , the product will have more pronounced flavor , and will be saltier but it will also be better preserved . This method is best for meats that will not be cooked but smoked and air-dryed or just air-dryed . It is the best curing method for people living in hot climate or having no refrigeration . In the South , bacon and ham production is something that was traditionally done in the late Autumn to take advantage of the natural cooling to reduce spoilage during the air drying portion of the curing process . The second traditional foodway that allowed bacon to be a staple in the South was the use of <URL> . Method : To guarantee continuous supply of salt and uninterupted curing of the meat , the dry curing is performed in a few stages . The cure ingredients should be thoroughly mixed . The mix should be rubbed into the meat at a ratio of 1:100 , curing salt mixture to meat , by weight . During this initial salting of the meat , it is important to thoroughly cover all surface of the meat piece with the salt mixture , because the high salt level and the cooler temperatures are the only means of protection against the growth of spoilage bacteria . Then the meats would then be packed tightly in a container with larger pieces like hams on the bottom and smaller pieces on the top so that each piece will retain its shape . The meats are packed skin down . Liquid drawn from the meat will accumulate on the bottom of the container and if the holes were made it would drain off . ( If you want to experiment with smaller amounts of meat you can perform this part of the process on a flat tray set at an angle to allow juices to drain away or in a perforated pan . ) The rule of thumb is 2 days of curing for each pound of original meat weight . Flip the meat after 3 days , and then again every 7 days thereafter , making sure that there is salt covering the entire surface . ( For bacon that would be stored for a long time or subject to higher temperatures they would most likely overhaul the cure , replacing the salt mixture 1 or more times during the process . ) After curing is complete , the meat pieces must be rinsed in fresh water to remove any crystalized salt that accumulates on the surface that would prevent sucessful smoke penetration . Blot dry then hang the meats or place on wire mesh to dry overnight . Store meat in a refrigerator or cool root cellar overnight or for up to 2 days . Allowing the bacon to dry uncovered in a cool place the night before you plan to smoke it encourages smoke retention through <URL> formation . At this point you would smoke the bacon and then let it air dry in a cool barn ( during Autumn and Winter ) or a root cellar . Like country hams , the bacon would likely be stored by hanging it in the root cellar in a muslin sack . Bacon produced this way is saltier than modern bacon . If you find it too salty , you can blanch it in simmering water for 30-60 seconds immediately before frying to reduce the salt . <URL>
Unless your fridge is above 40 F ( 4 C ) , it wo n't go bad . I 've had large frozen turkeys take 4 days to thaw before . Just use it once it is fully thawed , do n't let it sit around thawed for several more days . There 's no food that I 'm aware of that goes bad in the time it takes to thaw it . The stilltasty link below shows 3-5 days for refrigerated meat , and 4-6 months for frozen . Transitioning from frozen to thawed though , I generally count on defrost time + 2-3 days . If you want to thaw it faster you can always use the cold water method . Simply place it in a sink full of cold water ( submerged ) and change the water every 30 minutes . The rule of thumb for turkey is 30 minutes of thaw time per pound . I imagine pork shoulder would be similar , maybe a little longer ? Additional Info : <URL>
Well , picking the best wine to complement a given cheese -- or vice-versa -- is a bit complex to fix into a stackexchange answer . I recommend Janet Fletcher 's book <URL> if you 're really serious about this . However , picking a wine which goes OK with the cheese is a lot easier . Here 's a few tips based on my personal experience throwing wine &amp; cheese parties : Robust red wines ( Cabernet , Zinfandel , Syrah ) complement no cheeses I know of ; they swamp the taste of the cheese . Fresh , lower-fat cheeses ( chevre , ricotta , Nicasio 's Foggy Morning ) go well with light &amp; sweet white wines , like a riesling or gewurtztraminer . Brie goes well with fortified wines , like manzanilla or muscat . Most hard aged cheeses ( manchego , cheddar , asiago ) go well with light , acidic reds like a lighter grenache , pinot noir , or tempranillo . Blue cheese generally wants a very sweet fortified wine , like a ruby port or late harvest zinfandel . Swiss-type cheeses ( emmenthaler , jarlesberg , St. George , etc. ) work well with medium white wines , like sauvignon blanc or unoaked chardonnay . Really , what you 're trying to do is to have some complementary and some contrasting flavors in the wine as in the cheese . And generally you want to err on the side of milder wines unless the flavor of the cheese is very strong , since it 's too easy for the wine to wash out most of the cheese flavor . The other fun thing to do is pair cheeses up with wines from the same culture . Manchego with sherry and almonds , Roquefort with sancerre and French bread , pecorino sardo with barbera , cheddar with brown ale . Hope that helps some .

Is there any substitute for saltpeter / sodium nitrate in corned beef brine ?
Saltpeter is potassium nitrate , which does not directly cure meats . Bacteria convert nitrate into nitrite , which is the real preservative . Saltpeter can be replaced by a smaller amount of nitrite to get the same curing effect ( most commercial cured meats do this ) , though a prolonged cure that converts nitrate into nitrite can develop more flavor . Tender Quick is not a direct substitute because it contains mostly salt . I 've heard that you can replace the salt in your recipe with Tender Quick , and drop the saltpeter , and have a success . You would have better luck finding a recipe that was meant to use Tender Quick , though . It is definitely possible to buy ( food-grade ! ) saltpeter . I would check online , or at specialty stores . It 's a little more difficult than picking it up at your local grocery store , of course . ( Chemistry lesson , courtesy of McGee : nitrate ( NO3 ) is converted to nitrite ( NO2 ) , which then reacts to form nitric oxide ( NO ) , which bonds to myoglobin in the meat , which turns it pink and prevents oxidation . Nitric oxide is also present in smoke , which gives that " pink ring " around the outside of smoked meats . )
What is the application ? For most uses , no , there would be little to no effective difference . Dairy products are a mixture of water , sugars , minerals ( which the dairy industry calls ash , because they are left as ash when burned in a calorimeter ) , proteins , and fat . If the product is not homogonized , the fat globules will eventually rise to the surface ( where they can be skimmed as cream , giving rise to the term skim milk for when the cream has been removed ) . If the product is homogonized , the fat has been forced into much smaller globules which form a stable emulsion , and will not rise . Whipping non-homogonized cream is much easier , but most of us ( at least in the US ) do not have easy access to such a product . Additionally , most dairy products are pasteurized in one of the various methods , slow or fast , which can affect the flavor . Other than these differences in flavor or whipability , you can mix them with little difference for most applications . Note : to your specific question , your mixture of smim milk and cream may actually be richer than commercial half and half , which is often about 12 % milkfat , but it would function very similarly . Of course , all the above only applies to fresh products -- basic milk or cream of various fat percentages . Fermented products like yogurt , creme fraiche , cottage cheese , buttermilk , and so forth have entirely different charactaristics .
There are a number of factors that will contribute to how well the salt penetrates the interior of the piece of fish including thickness of the fish , types of tissue that have to be penetrated , and length of brine . The skin creates a significant barrier to salt penetration and the solution will penetrate the meat from its face and from its leaner side . After brining there will be more salt near the lean face than near the skin area . In order to get the most even salt penetration remove the skin , cut the pieces thin like sushi or ceviche , and brine in a 15 % salt solution for 2-3 hours . For even penetration you need even contact on both sides of the meat so you either need to suspend the pieces in the solution , or flip them at regular intervals . The surface will always be saltier than the core , but with thinner pieces and sufficient time the difference will be negligible . If you want to use larger pieces you will need to extend the time . Consider combining a soaking brine with injections of the brine solution into the meat itself . You could brine any kind of fish that you would find in a sushi restaurant , just make sure it is as fresh as possible . EDIT : After reading <URL> comment I was able to find <URL> which states that salted herring typically has a salt concentration of 7-13 % , however <URL> leads me to believe that a dry cure then brine combination may be responsible for the higher salt concentration . According an <URL> about hams and sausages , wet curing methods can reach salt concentrations up to 26 % , but maximum weight gain is reached with a salt concentration around 5 % . The first site also notes that salt concentrations above 7 % are considered unpalatable by most people .
The <URL> has several diagrams - a current one in the main section apparently originally derived from the German wikipedia , and two others from older Russian sources . I was also able to find <URL> with another diagram , and translations of some of the cuts into English , which is helpful because the names are difficult to translate to similar English cuts via Google Translate , which simply gives anatomical terms for many of them . <URL> discussing the subject , largely from the perspective of someone who only knows the American name for the cut they are looking for .
The idea is to brown the outside of the meat in order to develop the flavour via the <URL> . This flavour will add to the richness and meatiness of the stew as a whole . Go ahead and give it a good crust . Do n't overcrowd the pan or you will just end up steaming the meat in its own juices and it will never brown up : fry it in small batches instead . Two hours braising in the stewing liquid will easily be enough to cook one-inch cubes of beef all the way through and will easily see off most nasty stuff .
When I am using skim powdered milk and want more fat , I just replace some of the water in the recipe with heavy cream . Your recipe does n't have water , it already uses milk and cream . You could replace a little of the milk with cream to make up the difference . However , with all the cream and butter in that recipe , I doubt you would be able to notice the fat missing from the dry milk . I would just use your skim dry milk and not worry about it .
Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it ( it 's not quite vinegar , not quite wine ) . I 'd probably try a blend of some other mustard + a little white wine vinegar ( not white vinegar ; white wine vinegar ) or champaigne vinegar or apple cider vinegar . ( Maybe even a dry white wine , if you have that on hand ) . If you have dry mustard powder , and some time to let it sit , you could also try making your own ; most of the recipes online seem to use a dry white wine as their base , a few use white wine vinegar .
I would halve the amount of icing sugar and substitute in cocoa powder . As long as you sift the cocoa powder well you should still have a smooth icing at the end . Provided your chocolate is n't milk chocolate you should still have a ' proper ' chocolate flavour as well .
Hello @Huangism and welcome to Seasoned Advice . You may consider domestic wagyu . To get the best , it will still be pricey , but not nearly as much as Kobe . Please see this excerpt from <URL> . You Get What You Pay For All Wagyu beef is not created equal . In Japan , Kobe beef sells at more than $ 300 per pound . But now Wagyu is starting to be seen in grocery stores and casual-dining restaurants for $ 30 per pound . This mass-marketed variety of Wagyu will have a marbling score at the low end of the 12-point scale . American Wagyu Beef from Lobel 's of New York will score 9 points or higher . More expensive than our USDA Prime , our American Wagyu costs a bit more than $ 100 per pound ( depending on the cut ) . In terms of quality , taste , and texture , Wagyu and Kobe beef are indistinguishable . If what you 're looking for is best quality Wagyu , you should expect to pay $ 100 or more per pound . The linked page has a lot more information and more links to additional info . Although this place is in the US , I linked it because of the information available . Performing anther search , I found that wagyu beef is now available in Canada at Loblaws in Toronto and also at Costco ( various provinces ) .

It will definitely make a difference . Yolks contain various things like fats and emulsifiers that affect the flavor and texture of baked goods . If you want more details , then tell us what you 're baking .
The most accurate substitution would simply be <URL> . It is concentrated rum with a huge kick of flavor , and much less alcohol . A little goes a long way . If you 're going to stick with a strong liquor my first choice would be a <URL> , it 's a similarly " sweet " liquor that tastes good in baking . Another good option would be <URL> . If you 're avoiding liquor , then you may be able to use vanilla extract . Non-alcoholic varieties are available . According to <URL> you can also use molasses thinned with pineapple juice . The rum is used simply for flavor .
In either case store the cheese in the liquid it came in , transferring it to a clean container and covering well . Feta lasts reasonably well , but mozzarella only keeps well for a couple of days .
Once an animal is dead , the enzymes in its own cells start degrading its tissue . Enzymatic reactions are complicated , and only work well within a narrow temperature range . Land animals have a body temperature similar to humans . When they are slaughtered and the flesh is chilled , the enzymes slow down their work a lot . Fish are " cold blooded " animals . This is usually a misnomer - a snake lounging on a sunlit rock can get quite warm . But fish live in water , which tends to be cold . Their enzymes are very active in the temperature range found in refrigerators . So non frozen fish starts to spoil , and this ca n't be halted . People generally use spoilage as an indicator for unsafe food , and are probably not aware that it does n't apply in this specific case . Also , the decomposition of fish produces some amines which are usually perceived as a very objectionable smell . So people just prefer eating their fish before this decomposition process has progressed much . Beef 's decomposition is slowed down a lot in a refrigerator , and it takes different chemical pathways which do not produce a fishy smell . People even like some of the smells which appear during early decomposition ( the gaminess of aged beef ) . Also , specifically for beef , aging provides tenderization . This is not needed for fish , whose muscles fall apart easily without aging .

The answer , quite simply , is no . Even advanced laboratories have difficulty making the determination for certain . This is also a complex problem that gets more difficult as various standards are used and then fail . Before 2000 , a common solution was to simply use microscopic analysis to look for pollen and and other vegetable matter . Since then , many honey processing plants have been developing increasingly advanced filtering techniques that will remove the characteristic markers ( deliberately or unintentionally ) . [ ** See detailed note below . ] Various chemical or basic physical markers also have proved insufficient , since the sugar composition of honey can be faked quite well with various sugar syrup blends . The accepted standard these days , as mentioned in the question , seems to be to use a mass spectrometer to determine the <URL> in a rather specific lab procedure . ( Obviously most people do n't have a mass spectrometer at home . ) The current procedure for this test was adopted after previous lab tests were shown to <URL> in some batches of honey . The isotope ratio method is the only one specifically listed in the FDA 's <URL> to determine the possibility of adulteration : FDA laboratories do not have the instrumental capability to analyze honey according to the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International , AOAC Official Method 991.41 , which requires an isotope ratio mass spectrometer . Ironically , in order to avoid the previous false positives for the New Zealand honey mentioned above , the new testing process <URL> , a process which has also been used to hide the origin of honey and to confuse analysis : To eliminate a false positive C ( 4 ) sugar test for Manuka honey , prior removal of pollen and other insoluble material from the honey is necessary to ensure that only the pure protein is isolated . But even a refined isotopic methodology is flawed when it comes to detecting various types of adulteration , specifically beet sugar . As <URL> notes : [ Using isotope ratios from a mass spectrometer , ] adulteration using C4 sugar syrups ( HFCS and GS ) could be detected to a certain extent while adulteration of honey using C3 sugar syrups ( beet sugar ) could not be detected . Adulteration by using SS ( beet sugar ) still has a serious detection problem , especially in countries in which beet is used in manufacturing sugar . So , what 's the alternative ? Well , the other general method that could detect various adulterating components is <URL> ( DSC ) . <URL> gives a good summary of the process , which essentially looks at how a material behaves as it undergoes thermal changes . At certain temperatures when crystallization or something occurs , there will be excess heat absorbed or given off compared to at other temperatures . And at other points there will be minor changes in heat capacity ( i.e. , the amount of heat it takes to alter the temperature of a substance by a specific number of degrees ) . Honey , for example , displays a glass transition temperature ( Tg ) around -40 ° C ( -40 ° F ) near a certain point in crystallization . Other sugar syrups may not show this , but they may show changes at slightly higher temperatures ( still below freezing ) , due to water crystals freezing or thawing . ( Water is included in the sugar network in honey , so it does n't show the same characteristics . ) There are other thermal properties that can be measured at various temperatures . As <URL> summarizes in its conclusion : Used concomitantly with the second enthalpy of fusion ( occurring between 40 and 90 ° C ) , the glass transition temperature , Tg , is one of the most potentially useful parameters for characterizing honeys and syrups and for distinguishing between them . The Tg value , being strongly dependent on the amorphous phases of the sample , will respond to modification of the chemical composition and the implicit structural modification caused by the addition of exogenous material . Thus , adulteration of the honey will cause inevitable changes in both Tg and [ delta ] H2 values . Under laboratory conditions , adulterations by industrial sugar syrups can be detected from 5-10 % additions depending on the measured parameter . I would pay particular attention to this final sentence -- the differences can only be detected " under laboratory conditions " where precise temperatures and amounts of heat can be measured . To replicate such a test at home , you 'd need to be able to add a certain precise amount of heat to the honey at subzero temperatures , all the while keeping it isolated from other sources of temperature fluctuations and observing where the heating " stalls " briefly . Then , you 'd have to calibrate your homemade test against some known samples ( syrups , 100 % honey , etc. ) just to be sure you 're actually observing the same things as in the article cited here . You 'd need to confirm that by observing a more subtle difference in heat capacity changes that would occur in hot temperature ranges

I 've been a fan of brining for a while and NO , adding flavouring to the brine wo n't make much if any difference in relation to the brining itself , which makes a lot of difference . I have employed my most wishful thinking many times with brine , on the basis of the fact that pretty much every reference to it in recipes , on cooking shows , etc. , always seems to promote the idea that the flavour will diffuse in the brine and be absorbed by the meat . This is some kind of " look at the Emperor 's New Clothes " tradition .1 I 've gone to ridiculous extremes to test this , sometimes adding many ounces of e.g. , paprika or thyme to < 1 gallon of very salty ( 4 tbls/quart ) brine with a chicken overnight -- which is actually too much time , a few hours is plenty with that much salt . In some cases I 've gone overboard with the salty part , but despite all the piles of herbs , powders , an entire bottle of hot sauce , etc. , you at best get maybe a hint of something on the surface . In short , my opinion now is that while brining is awesome for pork and poultry -- salty and moist meat being far superior to dry and bland meat -- adding something to the brine and expecting it makes a difference is a complete waste of time and materials . As per one of my comments on the question , I 'd guess the issue here is that brining exploits osmosis . From <URL> : Brining makes cooked meat moister by hydrating the cells of its muscle tissue before cooking , via the process of osmosis , and by allowing the cells to hold on to the water while they are cooked , via the process of denaturation . The brine surrounding the cells has a higher concentration of salt than the fluid within the cells , but the cell fluid has a higher concentration of other solutes . This leads salt ions to diffuse into the cell , whilst the solutes in the cells can not diffuse through the cell membranes into the brine . The increased salinity of the cell fluid causes the cell to absorb water from the brine via osmosis . The salt introduced into the cell also denatures its proteins . The proteins coagulate , forming a matrix that traps water molecules and holds them during cooking . This prevents the meat from dehydrating . So the idea is that the meat absorbs salt ions , which then causes it to absorb more water . This is through the cell walls , and I do not think large particles such as the stuff we might associate with " flavour " would be included . Of course , some of the brine may be drawn into the meat between the ( large congregations ) of cells , but this is probably not a significant volume . 1 . Some of these recipes call for really paltry amounts of flavoring too , an inadvertent testament to how nice the Emperor must look naked ( " Umm -- I can so taste the rosemary from the brine ! " . Hogwash . ) . They also often involve paltry amounts of time ( " brine for 20 minutes " ) , I suppose because if you can pretend to taste rosemary you can also pretend to taste salt and appreciate moistness . If you do n't have at least an hour , do not bother . At least quadruple that for a whole turkey .
They just use it for the lecithine . You can buy straight lecithine ( they normally sell soy-based lecithine , but maybe you should check with the producer to make sure it is vegetarian ) and dissolve some in the cream . Do n't bother replacing the fat , truffels have enough from other sources .

Can I create cream of tartar with tartaric acid and potassium hydroxide ?
Potassium hydroxide is not something you 'd want to eat . It 's caustic ( the base form of corrosive ) , and you ABSOLUTELY should not mix an anhydrous ( pellet or powdered ) form of it directly into food , whether or not you mix it with another powder first . Also , if you get the proportions off and the acid and base do not fully react , you could end up with a corrosive result . That 's not something you want in food . The chemical synthesis of <URL> ( otherwise known as " cream of tartar " ) is relatively straightforward . Usually , you 'd have a solution with a high concentration of tartaric acid , to which you 'd add a solution of potassium hydroxide until the salt ( potassium bitartrate ) begins to precipitate out . You 'd then continue to titrate to obtain maximum precipitate . Lastly , you 'd filter out this precipitate and dry it to have powdered cream of tartar . But I can not advise you to attempt this on your own unless you have chemistry training . First , as another answer points out , industrial chemicals are not generally designed to be " food safe , " and although they are relatively pure , the small impurities may not be something you 'd want to ingest , depending on how they were manufactured . Second -- and more important -- it 's potentially DANGEROUS unless you know what you are doing . Read the <URL> , particularly the section on acute health effects . ( Note that the health hazard rating is ' 3 ' , which is on a scale of 0 to 4 , with 4 being the most hazardous . ) You should generally wear gloves and goggles when making a potassium hydroxide solution to begin with . And even if you safely handle the stuff , you need to ensure it is properly reacted and the resulting cream of tartar properly filtered and dried , or else you could be putting a caustic agent into your food . Basically , the potential for injury is high if you do n't know what you 're doing and mess something up . I would n't recommend it for home food applications unless you 're a trained chemist .
In theory it 's possible . However , not all blenders are created equal . <URL> mentions doing it , but in my experience to blend something into a super fine powder ( a flour-like consistency ) you need a really powerful machine like a Vita-mix . Also you may get inconsistencies in texture with a blender . This is one reason professional coffee bars use burr grinders instead of blade grinders : to achieve a consistent grind .
With regard to your source that suggests adding lettuce will reduce foaming of the oil : it might be possible to use lettuce as a tool to scoop up surfactants from the surface of the oil . If you 're going to attempt it , I think the best time to do it would be when the oil is cool . An Introduction to Surface Tension Foaming is related to surface tension : for example , adding a <URL> ( such as soap in water ) to a liquid reduces its surface tension , which makes bubbles more stable . So to reduce foaming , you would need to increase the surface tension . Note that we ca n't increase surface tension by adding something to the oil : the only way to increase the surface tension of a liquid with an additive is to increase its overall density . To see why that 's the case , suppose for a moment that there were a magical substance that liked to stay on the surface of the liquid and caused higher surface tension . That higher surface tension would compress the liquid , and raise its pressure . That means any spot on the surface that had less of the substance would have less surface tension and less pressure , so the pure liquid would be pushed out of that spot and cover the surface . That process would result in the substance never actually being on the surface of the liquid , which contradicts our starting assumption , so no such substance can exist . Instead , such substances become distributed evenly throughout the interior of the liquid ... and , if they make the liquid more dense , that raises its surface tension . So , if we want to increase the surface tension of aging oil , the only way we can do that is by removing surfactants from the oil , assuming we do n't want to mix the oil with large quantities of something more dense . Surface Tension and Frying As J. B. Rossell explains in <URL> ( with credit to BaffledCook for finding the source ) , surface tension is very important in deep fat frying , beyond just the idea of foaming . Initially , oil for deep fat frying tends to undercook ( or takes longer to cook ) food , because few surfactants are present in fresh oil . Due to the high surface tension , the oil is less often in direct contact with the food being fried ( as little as 10 % of the time it is submerged ) , which means less heat transfer by conduction , less of a crust , and less oil present in the final product . As the oil gradually breaks down with repeated cooking , surfactants build up in the oil , reaching an ideal range which gives the preferred golden crust and moderate greasiness , with oil being in contact with the food between 20 % and 50 % of the time it is submerged . When the oil goes bad , the high quantity of surfactants results in too much contact between the oil and the food , resulting in greasy food that is overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside , and may have a bad flavor due to the rancidity of the oil , or contamination from the food being fried . Removing Surfactants First of all , I want to say that I 'm not sure I 'm in favor of trying to prolong the life of frying oil beyond its natural lifetime : the breakdown of the oil results in potentially cancer-causing free radicals , so I 'd rather err on the side of replacing the oil too often , especially if I 'm cooking for myself or loved ones . If you were going to re-use the oil anyway , you might be able to reduce the amount of oil that gets into your food by reducing the quantity of surfactants , but if you 're debating saving money by using your fry oil longer than you normally would , I 'd say a bottle of oil is cheaper than a trip to the oncologist 's office . Speaking of cost , I think a bottle of most oils used for frying is also cheaper than a head of lettuce , so I 'm not sure how economically viable this strategy is . That said , since surfactants ( SURface ACTive AgeNTS ) are attracted to the surface of the liquid ( they find a lower energy state by decreasing the energy of the boundary between two liquids or a liquid and a gas ) , they can potentially be removed by skimming ( or just pouring ) them off the surface . ( I expect putting the oil in a narrow bottle and pouring off some of the oil from the top would be a more economically viable solution to remove surfactants . ) Because crinkly lettuce leaves have a high surface area , its possible that just dipping lettuce in the oil and drawing it out might remove a significant amount of surfactant , especially if the surface area of the lettuce leaf is high in comparison to the surface area of the pot that the oil is in : the surfactant will attempt to spread evenly across the entire surface of the oil . If we assume the surfactant is attracted only to the oil/air boundary ( note : I have no knowledge of whether this is actually the case , or whether the material of the container matters ) , then when a lettuce leaf with a surface area equal to the surface area of the oil/air boundary is dipped into the oil , and then slowly removed , the oil covering the top of the pot and the oil covering the lettuce leaf will have roughly equal su
Of course you can make gyoza with raw meat -- that would be the traditional method . You can find countless recipes , including raw meat ones , simply by googling " <URL> " . While perhaps less common , you can also google " <URL> " to find many options using chicken such as <URL> , although there are some false hits mixed in that are not chicken based . Gyoza ( which are the Japanese version of pot stickers ) are normally not much larger than bite sized . This small size will help ensure that they are cooked through during the hybrid frying/steaming method that gives them their crispy bottoms , which is normally similar to : Fry the dumplings , flat side down , until the bottoms begin to be brown . Add water to the pan , and cover , creating a makeshift steaming environment to cook the dumpling through . Allow the water to evaporate and the bottoms to re-crisp . While it is is fairly difficult to take the internal temperature of a single dumpling ( you probably can if you have a very high quality instant-read thermometer with a short probe distance , like a Thermapen ) , you can still judge their doneness indirectly by squeezing . They will be quite firm . The small size ( even very big Chinese style pot stickers tend not to be more than an inch/couple cm wide , although they may be longer ) helps make sure they can cook through very quickly ; steaming is also a very effective method at transferring heat into the target food . So yes , making gyoza with raw meat , done with some care , is safe .
For a substance to burn , it must first reach its ignition point . For it to keep burning , it must reach its fire point . The ignition point of a 40 % ABV liquid such as brandy is 26ºC / 79ºF , and the fire point is approximately 10ºC higher than that . What this means in practical terms is that you need to heat the alcohol a little first before you add it to the ice cream . The simplest way to do this is to put the alcohol in a ladle and heat it over the hob - it wo n't need much as 36ºC is not a great deal over room temperature . Then light it carefully with a long match , and pour it around your ice cream - if you 've got it warm enough it should keep burning until the alcohol is consumed .
What you want is cream with 35 % -40 % milkfat , and no gelatine or other stabilizers for whipping . If you use a lighter cream , then it will not have the rich , creamy texture , and evenly thick consistency you seek . In fact , if you use a light enough cream , it will not thicken properly . Now we enter the murky realm of regional naming differences , trying to find the appropriate kind of cream ! In Australia , this would be called pure cream ( 35-56 % milkfat ) ... which might be the same as " cooking thickened cream . " Read the label and make sure it is just cream , not gelatin or foam stabilizers like " thickened cream " . It could also be labelled " single cream " too ( ~ 35 % milkfat ) . In America , we call it heavy cream , or heavy whipping cream , and it is defined as 35 % + milkfat , and is generally around 38 % . In the UK , <URL> I found the uses a mixture of milk and " double cream " ( cream with 48 % + milkfat ) . They mix 100 mL whole fat milk + 426 mL of double cream . The final milkfat content is somewhere around 40 % . In the rest of the EU , the same procedure appears to be the best bet , since I ca n't find clear names for heavier creams besides double cream ( which appears to be the same as the UK ) . Edit : You may also be able to get a good result using straight double cream . I 'm looking at a French recipe that uses it . The catch is , of course , that while the minimum fat content is specified , actual fat content in double cream can vary considerably , potentially giving erratic results .

I would actually just make caramel . Place about 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup in a heavy bottom pan and dissolve over low-medium heat then crank up the heat and let cook , without stirring , until the mixture turns a golden amber colour and starts smoking . Then use the resulting caramel to sweeten your coffee :-)
It 's a little hard to understand exactly what you 're asking , but flavor and fragrance scientists have been at this for a long time , and yes , there are people who specialize in flavor research , using methods like " collecting headspace " ( gathering flavor compounds ) and analyzing those with techniques such as gas chromatography . They work to figure out what the " most relevant " compounds are in a particular food . Seasoned professionals are usually able to recognize and name specific flavor compounds by smell . But with a few exceptions , most of those chemicals are n't super easy to just buy off of a shelf somewhere without consulting with IFF or a similar company . ( You can buy artificial vanilla , for example , and methyl anthranilate , the dominant flavor from concord grapes used in artificial grape flavoring , as a bird repellant ) . So for most of us without labs for fermenting synbio vanilla , we will find it more cost effective to use the original ingredient . Most foods have hundreds of distinct flavor compounds and fooling the tongue , and especially the nose , is n't super easy . But it can be done in some cases , sure . It 's worth noting that a great portion of how we experience flavor comes from texture in addition to the flavor compounds , however . Even when you buy a flavored chip that is meant to taste like steak or mango salsa or whatever , you 'll often find it a bit off , perhaps the food industry 's equivalent of the " uncanny valley " problem , thanks to texture and context differences .
Yes , I 've heard this suggested , using wet/dry sandpaper and a mousepad . It is a very inexpensive way to match a whetstone , and you can use sandpaper with the same grit to produce an excellent edge . You duct-tape the sand-paper together so it wraps around the mouse pad , and then pull the knife along the sandpaper with the edge trailing . This is to say , you use sandpaper in the opposite direction as a whetstone . Once you work up to the finest-grit papers , you can use jeweler 's polish and a leather strop for a truly razor-sharp edge . Because the mouse pad 's rubber/foam has some give , this method produces a convex edge which remains sharp for longer that an V-cut , because it has more metal behind the edge . It also still presents a very sharp point for cutting , moreso than an equivalent V-cut front bevel . Using sandpaper will also cost a small fraction of what you spend on a good sharpening stone , which will run you $ 50 or more PER STONE . Wondering what grit to use ? There are comprehensive tables <URL> and <URL> . However , here is a quick-reference mini-table for you : Name / US Grit Rating / Use Coarse / 100-400 / Remove lots of metal . At the low-end of the range , used for reshaping blades , taking out large chips , or restoring snapped points . At the higher end of grit range , used to establish a bevel angle and restore very dull edges . Medium / 400-700 / Remove moderate amounts of metal . For refining an edge established with coarse grits , and for restoring moderately dull blades . Can be used to establish a bevel angle , but it will take considerably longer . 600 grit is a common point to start at for standard sharpening . Fine / 800-1200 / For finishing a blade or touching-up a slightly dull blade . At about 1000 grit , you will get something equivalent to a factory edge , assuming you use the same bevel angle . Ceramic steels have grits in this range . Extra-Fine / 2000 + / For polishing . Higher grits create a shinier and sharper edge , until at 8000 + grit you get mirror finishes and sharpness equivalent to a straight razor . If you 're going to bother using grits this high , a leather strop and polishing paste may serve you better than even a ceramic steel ; the steel would actually be reducing the edge sharpness with use . Source : <URL> Source2 : <URL> Edit : Another way to use sandpaper in sharpening -- expanding the grit range for a Spyderco Sharpmaker I 'm currently using sandpaper to make a very coarse stone for sharpening extremely dull edges on my Spyderco Sharpmaker . I wrap both of the normal triangular stones with a strip of emery cloth or 220-grit wet/dry sandpaper , and then hold it in place with medium binder clips . Since the lowest stone the Sharpmaker comes with is 800-grit ceramic , this saves HOURS versus using the normal stones . It is also considerably cheaper than the diamond stones they sell ; for a big tub of clips and a package of sandpaper , I paid $ 7 , versus about $ 37 for the diamond rods .
In terms of commercial food processing , there are more efficient ways to extract gelatin than slow-simmering the bones , generally by treating the organic matter with a strong acid prior to boiling , then using commercial evaporation and filtering equipment which is far more efficient than anything a home or even restaurant cook has access to . According to <URL> ( see the " Gelatin Manufacture " section ) it can also be first treated with a strong base solution before acidifying it , which lowers the isoionic point . It 's kind of difficult to explain exactly what that is if you do n't have a background in organic chemistry ; technically speaking it 's a relationship between pH and electrical charge - but applied to extraction it refers to the pH at which the solubility of a protein ( such as gelatin ) is the lowest . Lowering this is a good thing in extraction , because it means that the gelatin will be easier to filter out in an acidic solution . Thus I have to point out the question is actually a bit contradictory ; if your goal is the extraction of gelatin then you want to decrease the solubility . But I think this is all going to be beside the point anyway , because none of this applies to stock making ; the goal in food processing is to extract the pure gelatin , not to get a flavourful stock . When making a stock you definitely do n't want to use an acid solution , it 's going to ruin the flavour . Realistically , when it comes to stock-making , especially at home , the only way you 're going to be able to extract more gelatin is to simmer it longer . That 's it . When the bones break without any resistance , that means you 've denatured all the collagen and you 've got all the gelatin you 're going to get . I would n't worry about solubility because typically in stock-making you 're already using more than enough water to dissolve all the gelatin that you could possibly hope to extract .
Preface : I 'm not a big fan of fruit-flavored stuff ( I like fresh fruit by itself , just not in stuff ... ) so I ca n't speak to these from personal experience . For fresh fruit , puree in a blender or similar . Moist fruits can probably be pureed in their own juices ; otherwise , you 'll need to add some . You 'll probably want to add some sugar , but offset this by reducing the sugar you add to the ice cream mix . ( Seeds might be an issue too - get seedless if possible . ) As Manako suggested , you can also cook it down and then puree , though this will result in a wetter mixture than with their natural juices alone . This will also present a different flavor profile from the fresh fruit , so experiment to find what you like . Another possibility would be to cook out some of the water from your puree . In any case , you 'll want to reduce the liquid ingredients of your normal recipe by roughly the same amount as the pureed fruit you 're adding . In light of the previous item , you 'll probably want to use a higher-fat cream than normal , since the fruit will add a lot of water . Unlike " chunky " additions , you do n't really care that the ice cream should be at a thick consistency before you add them . ( for suspension ) I 'd just add it directly to the mix before you start churning .
According to Cook 's Illustrated 's article <URL> ( possible paywall ) : Briefly soaking meat in a solution of baking soda and water raises the pH on the meat 's surface , making it more difficult for the proteins to bond excessively , which keeps the meat tender and moist when it 's cooked . This is almost certainly the effect of the baking powder : to help create a more tender product . This is probably especially necessary given the lack of bread products ( which provides starch that physically interferes with protein linking , and helps retain moisture in the , thus producing a more tender meatball ) . The tartaric acid is probably there because recipe authors are used to pairing it with baking soda which is necessary when it is used to create leavening in baked goods . In the meatballs , it will simply tend to help make them more acidic , although it will also neutralize some of the baking soda . I have surveyed several recipes on the web which include baking soda in meatball recipes ; they variously claim that it helps make the meatballs lighter or more tender .
Yes , I think you can . The page you link does list the oil as " food grade " , and specifies no added solvents ... so there 's probably nothing dangerous in the jar and it can be safely used for cooking . In general , though , you usually should n't equate cosmetic treatments and edible substances , even if some of the ingredients are the same ( soaps often do this , list all food sounding ingredients until a second glance reveals it , well , soap ) , or even if the base substance is the same but may have undergone different processes ( like coconut oil or cocoa butter ) . If the coconut oil had been processed with some non-food grade solvents or processes , it might be perfectly safe for topical application , and still be quite dangerous to consume . If you are questioning whether a substance might be an ingredient as well as a cosmetic treatment , look up the information , and I mean brand-specific product page , and see if it mentions " food grade " - that means exactly the bit of information you 're looking for , that it is of a high enough quality that it passes the tests they use for product meant to be eaten .
Recipes As far as salsa recipes go , they 're all over the web . Check sites like <URL> or <URL> - - or <URL> ! Shelf Life Refrigerator . With regard to shelf life , according to <URL> , you 're only going to get 5-7 days out of fresh salsa in the refrigerator . Freezer . The same source says you can keep it for 1-2 months in the freezer . Use containers meant for storing frozen foods ( they make plastic lidded containers for this very purpose ) , and leave " headspace " in the container ( room for expansion as the liquid freezes ) . If you opt for freezing , you can use any recipe you 'd like . Food safety wo n't be an issue so much as quality would . For example , I would not recommend freezing a <URL> , though it 's great fresh . Canning . You also could pressure can your salsa . <URL> is the best resource to learn to can . If you opt for canning , be sure to follow a trusted canning recipe - you ca n't just can any old recipe . I would use one off the National Center 's site . Cost Comparison It all depends on what you make and the price of your ingredients , of course . If I can get cheap salsa at cost X and expensive , tasty salsa and cost 2X , my goal in making my own is to achieve great taste at a cost less than 2X . My homemade blueberry jam costs me about $ 2 per jar , much more expensive than generic jam ; however , good blueberry jam is about $ 5 at the store . Incidentally , I 'll be making salsa this summer once I can get lots of cheap tomatoes . Keep an eye on jessica.mcrackan.com late in the summer if you 'd like some real examples and cost comparisons .
I have also not tasted hoop cheese . All descriptions of it that I can find describe it as unsalted , pressed cottage cheese . While you can definitely press out extra liquid from acid set cheeses , the proteins are not as firmly set and the texture is going to be very different . I think you will find that using rennet is not much more difficult and opens a wide variety of cheese experiments . Junket also provides quite a few recipes and I have had success with many of them : <URL> This recipe for cottage cheese uses the bacteria in ( fresh ) buttermilk to acidify the milk . Then with the addition of rennet a curd forms that is much firmer than what you get with acid alone . Making their cottage cheese recipe and pressing it into a hoop should be easy enough for you . I use the end cap of 6 " PVC pipe with holes drilled in it as my mold and bungee cords for the press . For an excellent page on home cheese production in general check out this page : <URL>
Since you say French-style ice cream works fine , but the gelato is freezing rock hard , I suspect the problem may simply be the serving temperature . Gelato needs to be served at a warmer temperature than ice cream . Unfortunately the temperatures I 've found are pretty variable ( some say 5F , some say 10-20F ) , but everyone consistently says gelato needs a higher temperature than ice cream . So just try taking it out of the freezer 15 minutes before you want to serve . If you do n't want to do that , then actual gelato recipes probably wo n't work well , and you 'll have to modify them . You can try some of the usual tricks for softening ice cream : <URL> . But keep in mind that they may cause you to stray a bit from the original gelato flavor or texture !
Flaky pie pastry works beautifully for quiche . You can improve the texture with two techniques . The first is " blind-baking , " or a partial pre-bake to toast the crust lightly . The other is to brush a wash of egg white onto the crust before blind-baking .
I do n't think it is close to either cous-cous or rice . It is less starchy than both . Also , it has a unique mouthfeel when you chew on it , because the tiny grains ( 1 mm or less ) pop under your teeth . I would try getting the real thing in a whole food store or an organic store , or also online . If you ca n't find it , in these stores , but can get other exotic grains , you can try quinoa or millet . If you really ca n't get anything uncommon , I would use durum semolina . Wash it before cooking and cook it with fat to reduce the starch . Also , I would maybe cook it in more water than needed and remove excess water after it has been cooked and cooled , so your semolina grains do n't form a creamy pudding . Maybe tapioca pearls of the extra-small variety can work too , I am not sure because I have n't tried using them and do n't know what their final texture is . You will notice that , when suggesting replacements , I am most worried about texture . The reason is that the flavor of amaranth is very faint and bland . It is best used as a base for other , strong flavors . So you can use anything with the right texture , the flavor in the dish should come from spices and other components .
You may have been served Bearnaise , which is a common red meat sauce . Bearnaise is based on Hollandaise ( a mother sauce ) , a butter based sauce . Hollandaise is somewhat advanced to make because it is important to keep the temperature right and the ratios correct while making it , but the result is worth the effort .

How to make deep fried beer ?
Indeed , Mr. Zable actually applied for a patent -- US application no . <URL> , filed Sept 13 , 2010 . ( Of course , just because he applied does n't mean the US Patent Office will issue a patent on it . ) His process is , in essence : ( 1 ) gelling a liquid beverage ; and ( 2 ) wraping an aliquot of the gel in a raw " farinaceous dough " , selected from the group of pretzel , pizza , bread , and pasta doughs . The application says he used gelatin as his gelling agent , but the patent ( if it issues ) would not be limited to gelatin . Once wrapped , the raw snack could be fried immediately or frozen for later use .

Altering the proportion of soda ( alkali ) to citric acid makes it more or less fizzy .

The basic idea is that you use a half-empty beer can as stand for the chicken , placing the chicken 's cavity on top of the can before roasting or grilling . The idea is that the aroma from the beer will transfer to the chicken , and the steam will help keep it moist . You can even buy commercial racks to do the same thing without the beer can . My personal opinion is that both of these ideas are bunk : Very few if any aromatic molecules will transfer to the chicken , and even if they do , they will not penetrate past the surface The steam will not keep the chicken moist , as the dryness of the meet is essentially a function only of the temperature to which you cook it , and very little else . If the chicken is cooked to too high a temperature , then the proteins will tighten up and express water making the chicken tough , rubbery , and dry tasting . The minimal amount of steam can not change this fact .
Since most are pre-cooked ( in US Supermarkets anyway ) , and you are just re-heating , your ( still tasty ) options are pretty limited with respect to beer brats From the perspective of UW Madison ( self-proclaimed " Brat Capital of the World " ) : Simmer in beer first , then grill . <URL> ; this method would definitely be the preferred method for upping the intake of moisture without losing it during grilling ( so long as you do n't lose the brat flavor by wasting the beer you boiled them in ) For an <URL> : I have found that if you cook the brats on the grill first , then put them into the beer they do n't shrink as much . Here 's how I do it : I brown the brats lightly on both sides , then I place them in ' warm ' beer for a few minutes . Repeat several times until brats are cooked thoroughly . Now you can put the brats into ' hot ' beer to hold for individual serving ... When I said brown the brats lightly , I meant about 20 seconds per side on hot coals then into a 180 degree beer bath . Any hotter and they will shrink . I continue alternating the grill and beer bath until they are fully cooked . It 's a lot of work but my brats weigh almost as much cooked as when they went on the grill . Another thing you might try is adding chopped onion to your beer bath . " In a non-tailgate , just getting them cooked in a hurry setting : For grilling , I put them whole on the rack , otherwise you will lose moisture . Adding beer ( while grilling ) wo n't really do anything but cool them and the charcoal down ; but you could make a <URL> For stovetop , I barely cover the brats in beer ( typically watery domestic like Miller High Life ) in a pot/pan that can accomodate the quantity of brats being cooked and heat until beer reduces like a glaze . Wait until casing browns up a bit , then enjoy . In this instance I fork them a few times to absorb beer . For microwave , same as stove basically , fork and nuke covered with beer . As for type of beer , I think watery domestic does it best for the boiling since the carbonation is high and the sugars glaze up nicely before the brat is over-done . For the beer mustard pale ales are recommended by some , but I like brown , spicy mustard and might try something sweeter like a porter and banging heads with some punch from horseradish .
Well , looking at the recipe ... The sugar ( brown sugar + honey ) level looks roughly appropriate compared to the flour so that 's unlikely . The fat level looks a tad low for the cookies I normally do , but I 've never used oil in cookies before . You might try increasing the oil just a bit to lend extra tenderness , but I do n't think this is the real issue . ( Using oil in cookies also means you 're not <URL> , which is typically important in most cookies ... so its a bit odd , but I do n't know that it would cause them to be ' crumbly ' . ) The <URL> definitely is n't helping it to keep structural support . The recipe is basically banking on the fact that it needs to be moist to hold together . There 's not really enough liquid to form gluten to add structure ( which you do n't usually want for cookies anyway ) . Since there 's nothing in the cookie to give it ' structure ' , if you dry it out its just going to fall apart on you . I suspect your problem is from the directions of ' Do n't overbake these , or they 'll dry out a little . ' They dried out a bit too much and lost all support . It 's easy to over bake cookies and this is a recipe with very little room for error in that area .
The fourth option is the correct one . The problem is that if you start with oil in the mortar , the pestle will slip and you will not be able to properly mash the rest . What you usually do is : Wash the basil in cold water . Put the leaves on a tea towel and leave them to dry ( you can delicately pat them with another towel ) . You do n't want extra water in the pesto , so be sure the leaves are dry before starting . Traditional pesto is made with <URL> . Start with the garlic ( traditionally <URL> ) and a few grains of rock salt in the mortar . You would generally put 1-2 pips of garlic for ~ 50g basil leaves , but obviously that is up to your taste ( if you were to make Provencal pistou you would probably go for a higher garlic to basil ratio ) . I generally remove the inner part of the garlic ( the anima ) before mashing it . Now add the basil and mash them with a circular movement . You have to be quite delicate when doing this . You 'll see a green liquid forming at the bottom of the mortar . Now add pinenuts and/or the walnuts and finally the cheese . A mix of 36 months-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino ( sardo or romano ) is perfect for pesto . Finally add the extra-virgin olive oil slowly , while mixing . Put in clean pots , let it rest for half an hour , then if necessary cover with some extra oil . Whether you do this in batches or all at once mainly depends on the size of the mortar and how much pesto you are making . If you are making a big amount or have a small mortar repeat the steps for every batch ( I would wash the mortar each time , as it will be oily . Remember to dry it throughly before restarting ) . Most informations taken from : <URL> ( in Italian )
None of the answers so far mention collagen -- specifically , using a stock made from roasted and cracked poultry bones . You do n't have to roast the bones , but you do need to crack them -- use a large , heavy knife or cleaver ( not a chinese vegetable cleaver , you 'll screw up the edge ) to chop the bones up into about 2 " to 3 " pieces ( 5 to 7cm ) . Put them in cold water , and slowly bring it up to a simmer , and just leave it simmering for a few hours . You can add vegetables , too , but you 'll want to pitch them , as they 'll have been overcooked by the time the simmering 's done . Then strain everything , and use that as the base of your soup . If your refrigerate stock that has enough collagen in it , it 'll set up like jello , and hold its own shape . Starches can work , but they 're not ideal for soup -- flour ( unless cooked as a roux ) leaves a raw flour taste and cloudy soup ; tapioca leaves little granules in there ; corn starch will break down if you cook it too long .
You have a few options to lower their explosiveness : Pierce the skin , like you do <URL> . Lower your frying temperature can help a bit , but you 'll probably always need to use a temperature higher than the boiling point to get any kind of crisping action . Dehydrate the liver a bit before frying . You could use a dehydrator , a low-and-slow oven bake or a low temperature , low oil sauté to get them to release their juices ( like you do for browning some mushrooms ) . I do n't know which of these will work best for liver , but naturally you 'll lose a little bit of the final juiciness . You mention the splash guard , which I ca n't recommend enough . These numbers are cheap and easy to find . <URL> But you can also protect your hands directly . I recommend something articulated , like this pair of silicon mold Storm Trooper styled oven mitts from Think Geek : <URL> <URL>
The secret to crisp sweet and sour pork is mostly how you serve it Roast , BBQ , grill ( whatever you like ) the pork so it fully cooked , but on the lighter side of done . Cut into bite sized pieces If you want to deep fry ( not actually required ) use a thin and light tempura style batter ( flour , baking soda , beer mixed for ten seconds works OK ) . Drain well . This can be done the day before and keep it in an airtight container , but reheating is as much trouble as fresh deep frying . Remember , when using a thin light batter deep frying only takes a minute If not deep frying , finish and reheat under the grill ( broiler ) till it just starts to smoke Use a hot Chinese style serving platter and poor in all your sweet and sour sauce fresh from the wok . The sauce and the platter should be piping hot , it does n't matter if the the pork is not that hot Pile the middle of the platter with freshly shredded raw cabbage and onion . This should make a low flat island in the sauce just breaking the surface of the sauce . You can use wok fried capsicum , onion , carrots etc instead of cabbage ( not as good ! ) Carefully pile the pork pieces onto the island For extra zing add more shredded raw onion on top For a coastal style , and some fresh shredded coconut and/or mango ( not to everyone 's taste ) Serve immediately with a large serving spoon , so guests can scoop up the sauce and pork all in one go
Making maraschino cherries is a bit involved ... basically , you brine them and then flavor them . To keep them for a long time , you 'll also need to can them . <URL> a great recipe for making the cherries , and <URL> instructions for canning . The canning instructions are specifically for cherry topping , but you would use the same boiling-water canner process for maraschino cherries in their syrup . To pit the cherries , I 'd advise purchasing a cherry pitter ( yes , there 's actually a device for this ) if you 're going to be doing this very much .
The other answers touch on the fact that its the release of water from the turkey that interacts with the oil , causes the oil to overflow , and then ignite the burner . Generally , this happens pretty shortly after you put the turkey in ( due do any moisture on the outside of the bird ) . To do it safely do n't bank on the fact that you 've removed all the water - do two additional things : Do it outside . In the event something bad happens , better to lose some grass on the lawn than your house . If you do n't have space outside , you can always go to a public park or such . It may seem like a pain but turkey frying should not be done inside . There 's one absolutely surefire way to ensure than you do n't catch the burner on fire by accident . Do n't have it on ! Prep your turkey . Have it dry on the outside and completely thawed . Heat your oil outside . Turn the burner off Lower the turkey into the hot oil Wait 1-2 minutes or so , most of the initial contact between water and oil should over by now . Turn the burner back on and cook the turkey . Also make sure the burner is off while taking the turkey out , just to prevent any spills from becoming terrible . @ChrisWalker , below in the comments , also provides a method for making sure you do n't put too much oil in the pot and thus cause a spill over .
A Southerner will probably tell you that there is no type of BBQ sauce to go with this type of pulled pork because it 's not actually real pulled pork ... or real BBQ . Authentic pulled pork is smoked , and that comes with a completely different set of pairings . This is technically just braised , shredded pork . Which is not meant as a criticism , mind you - I often make a similar recipe in the winter time using a dutch oven . But terminology is important here because there 's a huge difference in flavour between pulled pork and braised pork . I 'll note for the record that any kind of slow-cooking will make a pork shoulder fall right apart ; you do not need the root beer ( which is n't that acidic anyway , and <URL> ) to tenderize the pork . The heat and moisture do that all by themselves , although root beer is as good a choice as any if you 're braising . Now onto the flavouring . Because the braise , unlike smoke , only minimally flavours the meat , you 're going to need strong flavours from elsewhere . If you 're really trying to mimic an authentic Southern-style pulled pork then you need to incorporate the smoky flavour somehow , which means using a smoky BBQ sauce ( hickory is common ) or better yet , incorporate this flavour at the very beginning of the cooking process by applying a dry rub containing smoked paprika or including a small amount of liquid smoke in the braise . If you do use a rub then the other flavours are up to you - there are plenty of recipes out there - just do n't use salt in it because pork already has plenty . As with any braise , stick to aromatics like garlic/onion powder , various chili powders/peppers , cinnamon , etc. . Once you 've successfully incorporated the smoke ( or what passes for smoke in indoor cooking ) then a little sauce goes a long way . Definitely incorporate some of the leftover braising liquid so as not to waste those delicious drippings - I use about half of it but that 's with a much milder braise . Ketchup and dijon mustard in a 50/50 to 60/40 ratio is very simple and surprisingly effective when mixed in with the juices . If you still find this to be lacking punch , you can throw in some cider vinegar , which pairs well with both the pork shoulder and your root beer braise . I actually boil off the pan ( after reserving some braising liquid ) and use cider vinegar as a deglazer for the fond , but since you 're using a crock pot ( or equivalent ) , you probably wo n't have much/any fond and this would require an extra vessel , so ... just throw a splash or two into the finished sauce , and reduce if that makes it a bit watery . Worcestershire sauce is also a good way to punch up any homemade sauce , and if it starts to get too intense or tangy from either that or the vinegar , tone it down with some brown sugar or molasses if you have any . If you 're dead-set on following the recipe to the letter , then , as above , I think I 'd choose a hickory or mesquite sauce , something smoky and not overly thick . Some of the better brands/products will actually include a small amount of alcohol , like whisky or bourbon . Almost all will contain onion , garlic , paprika , sugar , molasses , and vinegar ( often cider vinegar , as above ) - not surprisingly , exactly the same kinds of ingredients as I 'm suggesting in the dry rub and homemade sauce .
I would use the oven . The dehydrator will obviously remove water , but it wo n't toast the granola like an oven would . You could always try super-dehydrating half a batch and ovening another .
Beer , like wine or coffee , is often used when a reduction over a long cooking time is called for but water would be sub-optimal . I make chili a lot . Water is not your friend there , especially if you incorporate a lot of elements that have water in them to begin with ( undried/roasted tomatoes in particular ) . Beer does n't add the acidity that coffee does , but it is great for adding sugars and the maltier flavors . The sugars are n't precisely ' sweeter ' but rather add depth of flavor . I 'd be interested in the effect of carbonation on the cooking process , however since carbonation is supposedly lost faster at higher temperatures I 'd imagine it 's less than expected . Beer can be used to de-glaze and so on ; its lower alcohol makes it much less reactive ( than marsala or liquor ) and the sugars make it as likely to glaze over . Still it imparts some flavor depending on the context . The type of beer you should use is largely up to you . They differ greatly in flavor and composition . <URL> Another consideration is to look into Cicerones ; it 's a certification people get where ( more for large scale operations than restaurants or personal use ) , in addition to knowledge of processing and manufacturing , <URL> . An additional consideration is how long the beer will be cooking down . The longer the cook down , the more the flavors will be less distinct . However , there are flavors that are frequently only found in beer ; hoppiness , roasted malt , and ( the effects of open fermentation with ) wild yeast can do amazing things in a dish . Creating a side reduction minimizes the cook down and can preserve the flavors .
Basically , it is that easy . But it is a costly endeaver . I have know chefs to make it with a pure olive oil or grape seed oil . Some heat it to 220 degrees or so but I have meet some that do n't . The ones that did n't made sure to pull the oxygen from the bottle with one of those wine vacuum savers . I have been told self made truffle oil will lose it truffle flavor due to most the flavor actually coming from an odorant . I have not personally made any so I ca n't speak from experience on how long it will hold . All the above being said . If I had the money to buy some truffle , I am not sure the best use for them would be to make truffle oil .
The cut is important for both techniques . For sauteing , you need a lean cut - fillet , sirloin , or good rump steak . These should be cooked quickly over a high heat . As Cerberus has suggested , if you are cooking something else in the same pan , take the beef out and re-add it later ; do n't boil it in a sauce . Stewing beef needs some fat and cartilage which breaks down during slow cooking and tenderises the meat . Packs of such beef are usually sold as such in the supermarket ; look for a pack with plenty of fat marbled through the meat ; ' Lean stewing steak ' is as useful as a waterproof teabag ! My personal favourite stewing beef is brisket , as it breaks down into nice tender fibres after 2-3 hours cooking . Contrary to popular belief , browning meat does nothing to ' seal in the juices ' . It simply provides a bit of extra colour and flavour by ' caramelising ' the outside a little . So if you have a strong flavoured stew ( like a chilli , for example ) , just throw the chunks of meat straight into the sauce .
Just to summarise the comments into an answer : To lighten the icing , you can add air to it by whipping , either by hand or with an electric mixer . It will probably be easier to do that if you loosen it a little with some milk or cream .
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
The lower ( first ) temperature actually cooks the potato so that it is tender , the hotter temperature ( second ) is what gives the crispy golden coating . If you just did the lower temperature , your fries might be too soft . If you just did the hotter temperature they would be too too tough .
I 've used dark beer with good results . It just depends on what flavor you desire . I often use Lion stout , for example , which imparts a strong , intense flavor and color , which I quite like , but it would not be appropriate for all applications . Also Sierra Nevada porter has happily found its way into my bread . Keep in mind that these beers may be too strongly flavored for your taste , in which case you can add some lighter beer to balance it out ( lager or pilsner ) . Personally I do n't like to add pale ales to bread as I do n't enjoy the way the hop flavor comes through , but this comes down to personal preference . In general , the flavor of the beer will come through in the bread , but you wo n't notice all of the subtleties of flavor that you do when drinking , so I would n't put too expensive a beer in bread -- the bread will turn out fine , but you 're not going to appreciate the beer to its fullest .

What is the best way to clean a roasting tray/baking tray that has sauce burned on to it ?
Half fill it with water , then put in on the stove top over a medium heat . Work the burnt-on bits with a wooden spoon or spatula as the water starts to boil . You should be able to soften it up and be able to get it off then .
Clean it immediately , before anything has a chance to dry . As soon as I 'm done grating anything , I run the grater under water and wipe it with a sponge . Wipe with the direction of the blades , then run a little water inside it . Optional : put the grater in the dishwasher to clean fully .
Last evening , I left one empty ( but dirty ) sauce pan unattended on the induction stove top as the dish washer was full . The stove was turned off , but dirty as well , and the pan was slightly touching the controls . During the night , there was a small power outage ( 2 computers were powered off this morning while one was n't ) and apparently , that was enough to have the stove turn on by itself , start cooking and burnt the left-over sauce completely black . Moral of the story : Even when you 're tired after a late meal : clean the stove before going to bed . Leave dirty pots in the sink and not on top of an induction stove !
Place on non-stick sprayed foil ; broil for ~ 4 minutes in oven with some source of moisture or a glaze over top ( ie , you might take salmon and add a soy/mustard glaze ) to protect hydration levels .
Honey should be stored at 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit Honey is similar in to olive oil and should be storaged between 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit according to <URL> : Similar to olive oil , honey should be stored at a cool temperature between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit . So , it 's best to store it away from your oven or stove . Also , it should not be refrigerated . Extreme changes in temperature will spoil the flavor of honey . Looks like this confirms that you may want to keep it in a cool place and away from hot temperature where it would cause honey to degrade in quality . <URL> continues : Remember Do not store honey in a refrigerator or near a stove or oven . Store it in an air-tight container . Thus , choosing an appropriate container is an important part of the equation . <URL> has a great article germane to this topic . Refrigerating Honey In the <URL> , it talks mentions the crystallizing state of honey if it is refrigerated in no way it harms the honey at all .

I would have tried using semolina , polenta , or grits . If the grind was too big you could always use a small coffee grinder to get it a bit finer . Corn muffin mix generally has other additives like sugar , baking powder or soda , so you probably would n't have wanted to use that on the outside of your bagels !
The truth is , there really is no good way to reheat such sandwiches . The bread will have gotten soggy while the sandwich was in the refrigerator , and the densest part ( which requires the most energy to get hot ) is on the inside . The option which is probably the least poor is to use the microwave , as more of the energy will be transmitted to the filling directly than with other heating methods . This is still likely to leave the bread kind of mushy and rubbery . Your best option is to only buy the size of sandwich you want to eat , or to split one with someone . Note that you mentioned store bought subs . If the sandwiches are homemade , there is a good answer : do n't assemble them until you want to eat them . You can then toast the bread , and heat the filling separately , and then combine them , and thus have a very fine sandwich .
The method I used in the past ( which might not be the best way ) is to lightly fry the food initially , drain it of all oils , and put it in the refridgerator until it is almost time to serve the large amount of food . Then you can finish deep frying the batches . The initial frying will dramatically reduce the time it takes to refry each batch . I found this was the best solution for myself as I was able to serve hot and ( almost ) fresh out of the deep fryer food to a large group of people at lot faster . I think the result is way better than if you had to store the fully deep fried food for 2 hours and had to reheat it up somehow .
You can avoid the tray altogether and bake them on a steel rack . Lye does n't react with stainless steel ( or with carbon steel , for that matter ) . It will stick lightly to the rack , just like anything else on stainless , but due to the small surface , you should be able to separate them . The second way would be to just use enough rock salt on a steel tray so that they are too high to stick . But it might mean that you 'll get too much salt embedded in them . And as a final word , you might just be using too much lye , or too strong a solution . Pretzel were baked long before there were silpats , and they did n't strip the seasoning off the tray . Avoid any coated trays ( teflon , enamel ) , and , most of all , aluminium .
Use a carbon-steel wok ! The shape works very well to keep the unpopped kernels in the hot oil , while the popped kernels end up on the cooler sides . I usually use about 2 T of oil and 1/3 c of popcorn to make enough for two people . If you want to keep with the Chinese theme , Szechuan peppercorn-salt goes extremely well on popcorn ! To make it , grind Szechuan peppercorns and kosher salt in a spice grinder .
Here 's what I do - it simulates the high direct heat and then lower , indirect to finish ( like on the real grill with multiple zones ) : Put the ' grill ' on the top rack ( make sure its not coated or non-stick , that it can take high heat ) . ( I do mean to put a pan under this to catch grease . ) Turn the oven to broil for a few minutes . Prep your chicken . Put it in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes ( I ca n't really give you a time here because it depends on thickness and other things ) , but you 're trying to promote that browning and a bit of char like the grill . * After its been in a few minutes and browned/charred somewhat , pull it out and quickly flip it and repeat . If your dish is n't fully cooked to your liking , move the item to the middle rack and turn the heat down some . Pull it out when finished and Rest the meat . Enjoy To be honest though , for indoor grilling - I usually preheat the oven to 400 , get some grill marks on a cast iron grill pan , and then finish in the oven . Its only when the volume is too much that I do the above method . Cast iron grill pan for a couple of servings has always been much less troublesome than the broiler which can bring items from tasty to ruined in record time for me . * Some people close the oven door here , some do n't - its the difference between if you just want to sear it or really start to cook it . I pretty nearly always close the door , but I 'm also the guy who always puts the lid back on the grill .
Ok - finally got it open ! While googling , I came across a suggestion to cover the lid with a plastic glove and use that for traction . Not sure if it was the combination of running under hot water + the glove , or if the glove would 've worked on it 's own , but it 's open now :)
Your clarification means a lot -- " baked " potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own , where the insides become fluffy and creamy , and is done with larger starchy white potatoes , or sweet potatoes work well , too . Roasted potatoes , on the other hand , tends to be ( in the U.S. ) be smaller " new " potatoes , waxy potatoes , or even larger starchy potatoes cut up ( eg , ' oven fries ' ) . The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it 's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you 're going to be cooking them with the roast as there 's going to be moisture in there , I 'd go for a waxy potato ( eg , Red Bliss ) . As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil , and if they 're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast , as you 're going to have to rest it anyway , drain the meat juices , crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F ( 230C ) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes . ps . yes , I know a sweet potato is n't a potato . And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything , as it makes great baked potatoes , and roasted potatoes ( although , not sure how well with a roast at the same time ) and they 're good in pot roast and stews if you do n't add them too early .
First , I would suggest you buy a higher quality can opener . I have a Swing-A-Way that I inherited from my grandmother . I think it 's older than me . Second , do n't submerge the can opener in water every time you use it . I only full out wash it on the rare occasion I splash or drop something all over it . The rest of the time I just use my dishcloth to wipe the blade and handles clean and let it dry in the dish rack before putting it away .
It 's actually pretty straight forward and fairly easy to do . Build a fire . You are building a cooking fire , not a warm hands and look pretty fire . I use a <URL> . Wait for it to burn down so there are plenty of white coals . You do n't want lots of " fire " . Fire is pretty to look at , but more unpredictable to cook in then hot white coals . While the fire is burning down , wash and prep your potatoes to bake as you would normally . Wrap them tightly in tin foil . Once the fire is burned down to hot , white coals , toss the potatoes directly onto the coals . Wait until cooked ( roughly 40 minutes for an average sized potato , on an average fire , adjust accordingly ) . If you have a shovel or something , put some coals on to the actual potato as well , so you 're completely surrounding it . It 'll speed it up . If you do n't have anything handy to handle coals , make sure you flip them half way . Remove carefully and enjoy . The moisture of a potato , will allow it to cook without burning . Just make sure you wrap them with no exposed areas , in order to trap the steam .
Most likely you just need to turn up the heat a bit . Moving the rack higher might help too . It 's a little hard to say without actually measuring your oven , but that kind of thing can happen if your oven 's just a bit cooler than it claims to be . So it 'll take a little longer than the recipe says to bake , but the lower temperature means it wo n't brown as nicely . Turning up the heat will get more browning done by the time the center 's done .
Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate . I 've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste , but because frankly , I like to play with fire . But lets assume that there is a taste difference , identify where the differences comes from , and how to address them : The smoke from charcoal . This is ( if you 've been using natural lump charcoal ) pretty much just wood smoke . If you 've been using briquettes you 'll also get the smoke of the filler and such , but generally this is n't desirable and we do n't want to replicate it . For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like <URL> . Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner , it should start smoking . Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals , and rising back up to flavor the food . This used to be a big advantage to charcoal , but its largely minimized by new gas grills with ' vapor bars ' . As long as your grill has one of these , you 're in luck . Otherwise , there 's not a good , safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it . Its a long bar usually running the length of burners . Lighter fluid taste . Another undesirable flavor if you 're doing a particular ( and not good IMO ) kind of charcoal grilling . Frankly , its not one you 're likely to miss . Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them . Nowadays the biggest is definitely # 1 , but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially ' porous ' . If you 're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts , I would n't bother if smoke . If you 're doing burgers - maybe/probably . If you 're doing thick steaks , thick pork chops , a whole chicken , or anything that 's going on awhile , then creating some smoke is definitely worth it . ( " Liquid smoke " definitely does n't taste like the real thing . )
Consistent results stem from consistent actions . Bechamel is one of the most basic sauces , so you should take the time to master it . The general proportions for this sauce are : 1 Tbsp butter ( clarified optional ) 1 Tbsp flour 1 cup milk 1/2 tsp salt 1/8 tsp nutmeg The things to make sure you do right : Cook the roux - It should be a nice golden hue ( not brown ) . Scald the milk prior to adding - The milk should be heated to a near boil in a separate pot while you prepare the roux . Cold milk is one of the primary causes of bechamel fail . Add the milk in 1 cup increments . Whisk thoroughly until you see no lumps with each addition of milk . Stir constantly until done .
It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic , it will rot quicker , so I wrap it in paper towels , then bag it ( but not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . For whole heads of lettuce ( iceburg , butter , red leaf , etc ) , I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels , then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer 's market . I then pull off leaves as I need it , and re-wrap it . It stores for well over a week this way . For mescalin mixes , arugula , or other individual leaves , I 'll wash them , dry them , then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on , then roll up the whole thing , and bag the roll ( again , not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . I can probably get a week out of it this way . ( all times assume you 're not buying from a store where it 's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it ; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer 's market ) So , to answer the specific questions : keep the bag open ; you do n't want moisture to condense inside the bag , as it 'll make the lettuce rot faster . I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole . If you 're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days , it probably does n't matter , and for loose lettuce , I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway . You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged , but damp will lead to it rotting faster .
That 's a really good question . I imagine it was probably stabilized with something that stays solid at high heat , b/c hot cheesecake would be fairly soft . Was it warm all the way through ? My wild guess would be they rewarmed it in the oven , then ( if needed ) blasted with a blowtorch for crispiness .

What happens to an acorn squash when its skin turns orange ?
As long as it does n't have soft spots , and when you cut it open there is no mold or rot inside , it is still fine . I 've often used acorn squash that have partially turned orange , and yes , that is just further ( but unneeded ) ripening .
The only good way I know of to concentrate fresh orange juice and maintain the flavor is by removing the water . But not by heating it , as the heat will destroy the flavor . You need a vacuum distiller or freeze dryer for your orange juice . Pulling a vacuum will boil the juice at room temperature , removing the water without adding any heat .
I am not a chemist , but my grandma always used to make bread ( and similar stuff ) with sparkling water instead of still water . She always mentioned that the result will be more fluffy and airy . This only addresses the question about the ( important ) consistency though , but I guess you should just try it out yourself . Edit : Some benefits of using sparkling water in the kitchen As this answer got downvoted to zero I guess my grandma was not convincing enough . So I asked a befriended chef who works at a luxury hotel chain in Germany . Here 's what he explained : Desserts can be made more creamy without actually adding cream . Here he gave examples of pudding/mousse-ish desserts Vegetables steamed with sparkling water results in less loss of color ( i.e. brighter colors ) , more crispyness , and stronger taste . He particularly recommended to try it with carrots , broccoli or cauliflower . You can add sparkling water to thick soups shortly before serving to get them more foamy . Similar with Salad dressings Last but not least he confirmed precisely what my grandma said . For doughs and similar stuff ( for salty or sweet dishes ) you would get a nice fluffy texture . Kudos to my grandma at this point .
First , as a gardener who 's grown these , I can tell you that acorn squash -- like all winter squash -- need to be left on the vine to ripen . After picking , they will get a little sweeter as they sit for a couple weeks , but if picked too early , they wo n't actually continue to ripen . That said , there 's no great trick to picking a good one . If you see some some orange color in the skin , it 's almost certainly ripe , though they can still be mature when all green , too . Ideally , you should be able to trust that the farmer harvested these properly , but if you 're getting unripened winter squash , someone probably screwed up out in the field . If you think the store gives a damn , it 's probably worth mentioning that you 're getting some bad ones .
Soften . Other things that typically are added with salt will tend to toughen the beans , but it is n't the fault of the salt . For decades , chefs have circulated the oral tradition that adding salt hardens beans , but it 's a myth . Several scientific studies verify that adding salt to the soaking water for dried beans will reduce the cooking times . The first and most cited article , originally published in 1977 , can be found <URL> . As mentioned in the first answer you cited , the fine folks at Cooks Illustrated found in 2008 that 3 TBSP per gallon of water produces soft skins while not over-salting the interior of the beans . Since you ca n't see the full article , here is the science according to CI : " Why does soaking dried beans in salted water make them cook up with softer skins ? It has to do with how the sodium ions in salt interact with the cells of the bean skins . As the beans soak , the sodium ions replace some of the calcium and magnesium ions in the skins . Because sodium ions are weaker than mineral ions , they allow more water to penetrate into the skins , leading to a softer texture . During soaking , the sodium ions will only filter partway into the beans , so their greatest effect is on the cells in the outermost part of the beans . " Harold McGee 's NY Times blog ( August 9 , 2008 ) also notes that adding salt early enough will allow complete penetration of the bean , which improves flavor . On the other hand , things typically added with salt -- particularly sugar and calcium-rich products -- tend to toughen beans ( and the salt gets the blame ) . This toughening effect is most notable in baked-bean recipes using things like ketchup , molasses , and BBQ sauce . You can bake these beans for days , yet the beans will stay whole and firm . The actual mechanism for this effect is not clear ; one hypothesis currently circulating seems to be that these products stabilize the cell-cell " glue " ( e.g. , Shirley Corriher says so on Good Eats " Pantry Raid III - Cool Beans " , transcript online <URL> ) , but I could not find any peer-reviewed study specifically verifying that hypothesis .

Answer : No oil . I do n't use oil . I use a non-stick pan or I grill it in oven . I do n't understand why people are using oil to do injustice to salmon . I want the salmon to be firm and not mushy . I already face the problem of having to take care of the juice/oil flowing out of the salmon . I do n't want more fluid added which would further mushify the fish . Pan-poaching : Place the slice of salmon on its skin , on the pan . Gradually turn the heat up to moderate . As the skin-side gradually becomes firm , turn the slice over . When the other side also becomes firm , turn the slice back to face the skin-side down to brown the skin on strong heat . The problem I face is too much juice/oil exuding from the salmon . Continually notice if salmon juice/oil is flowing out , to drain the juice/oil into a bowl . After cooking salmon is complete , place salmon into serving plate and the pour salmon juice back into pan . Add diced garlic , chopped cilantro and onions . Or use pre-fried onions bought from Vietnamese store . Stir fry for 2-3 minutes . Resultant is a nice gravy to be used as topping for the salmon . Sprinkle blue cheese bits . Broiling ( set the oven to broil ) : Place salmon skin facing up on oven pan . For soft steak : use a smaller pan so that the juice/oil that flows out would not spread out to be being burnt away by the heat . So that the juice/oil keeps the salmon moist and soft . For firm poach : Drain the pan frequently . Use various apparatus to elevate the pan so that the salmon is 1 inch away from the top heating element of the oven . Turn oven to 180 F for 30 minutes . This is to firm up the salmon and let its initial flow of juice/oil out of the salmon . Then turn the oven up to 240F till the fish is cooked . Gently separate the skin from the fish without injuring the flesh . Broil the skin at 350F till it becomes crispy . Crispy salmon skin biscuit = heavens ! The crispy salmon skin must be eaten within 30 minutes - otherwise , it would soon absorb moisture and becomes flaccid . See , no oil involved ( other than the oil exuding from the fish ) .
Milk proteins , mostly . And some sugars that have been caramelized . This is an example of what one chef I know describes as " <URL> , " and is much like what happens when you sear a steak on the grill .
I remain extremely skeptical that there is a right or wrong way to dress , pick up , eat , or otherwise deal with sushi . A <URL> for " is there a right way to eat sushi " turns up hundreds of pages , many with contradictory information . If there is a " right " way , it 's most certainly dictated by the locale or restaurant you 're in or the people you 're with . My advice is to do whatever you want , particularly if you 're paying for the meal . If you 're a guest , follow the lead of your hosts . But do n't sweat it . Enjoy it ! UPDATE since the original question has been edited ... what is the better way to dress sushi and sashimi . " Better " is still difficult to define for everyone , and will vary by each person 's taste . Something that " enhances " flavors for me may be completely unacceptable to you , and vice-versa . There 's no accounting for taste ! But since you made an effort to clarify your question , I am updating my answer accordingly . Sometimes the " better " dressing is none at all . This is particularly true for Unagi or others that have some kind of sauce already applied ( though I know some people who dip Unagi in soy sauce and claim it is great ) . I have a daughter with soy allergy , so she can not use soy sauce at all and does n't like wasabi . She enjoys eating salmon and tuna nigiri pieces completely plain . I 've tried it myself , and with good , fresh fish it is really good . I have heard of people dipping the pickled ginger in the soy sauce and using that as a kind of " brush " to gently apply soy sauce to the topping . That may be " better " if you are adept with chopsticks and enjoy pickled ginger along with soy . Some people dip only the topping into the soy sauce , to avoid getting the rice saturated . This is a little easier to do if you use your fingers to pick up the sushi pieces ( and according to <URL> this is perfectly acceptable for sushi ) ( but <URL> ) . Some people mix wasabi ( sometimes , copious amounts ) in with the soy sauce and dip the sushi into that mixture . Some suggest that <URL> .
The smoke produced from a heated oil is n't all too different from the smoke produced by a fire . You are essentially burning that oil and causing rapid , incomplete oxidation ( or rather <URL> ) . In actual fact , the peroxidation will start to occur long before you hit the smoke point ; however , smoking is an indicator that this is happening very rapidly . The net effect is very similar to that of rancidity , in that it will produce many <URL> and <URL> , and while this is n't the place to be debating whether or not that 's bad for you , I will simply point to the aforementioned link on free radicals and say that at the present time , the prevailing belief is that these free radicals have deleterious effects . It 's up to you decide what level of risk is acceptable to you . The effect may in fact be identical to that of rancidity , although I ca n't confirm that with a source at this time ; all I know is that heating an oil up to its smoke point will increase the oxidation rate ( make it go rancid faster ) , and rancidity in turn lowers the smoke point , so the two are definitely related . So what I 'd say is , if you do n't mind the idea of occasionally eating rancid fat , then go ahead and smoke it all you want ; otherwise , you might want to be more careful . <URL> , even if the actual ingestion is n't . So again , be careful . Avoid overheating oil if you can . By the way , saturated fats like coconut oil , animal fat or ( clarified ! ) butter tend to have the most immunity to this particular chemical breakdown , as evidenced by their naturally higher ( unrefined ) smoke points . Lipid peroxidation works on the double bonds , which do n't exist in saturated fats ( polyunsaturated fats have the most ) .
I always thought it was the combination of mayonnaise and sour cream ( or something like buttermilk ) that gives ranch dressing that ever so slightly tang to it . Then add in the seasonings like dill , pepper , and garlic and onion and you 've got yourself something delicious .
Look for a strong motor and thick blades . If the blades are thin , they 're likely to warp over time . The motor needs to be able to spin those blades through the liquid . Look for a thick glass container . The plastic ones are unlikely to deal with the heat of things like soups and sauces being dumped in . Check the gasket between the glass container and the piece that attaches the blades . A thin , flimsy gasket is likely to start leaking before a thicker , softer gasket . Look at the number of teeth on the connection from the motor to the blade . The more teeth , the greater the surface area being used to distribute the power to the blade mechanism and is less likely to wear out . Overall , as with many things , one of the quickest ways to tell a good one is to weigh them both . The heavier item is better . No one pays for shipping extra weight unless it 's there for a good reason . ( note that the " heavier " rule does n't apply to electronics like cellphones/computers , etc. where the cost of making it small is actually higher )
Yes ! I just came across this , and it just so happens I could use an orange in a slaw I 'm making right now . <URL> Simply lop off the ends , make a small incision in the side and carefully open to reveal easy-to-eat orange segments . ( Or as I prefer to call it , an orange caterpillar . ) I did it with my orange , and I had never peeled an orange so quickly : Now if you just want to eat the orange , you can just pluck off the segments as you pop them into your mouth . If you roll the orange around a bit first , before you lop off the ends ( as in @Barry Staes ' answer ) , it should make it even easier and more pith-free . But what was really neat is that by prepping it that way , I had a pretty close approximation to supremes , supremely easily ! ( haha ) With two passes of the knife and 5 seconds of picking at it , this is close enough for my slaw . Just flatten the " caterpillar " as much as you can with one hand , and with one slice ( or two ) , cut between the peel and the segments . I just picked away most of the remaining connective " stuff " and membranes with the knife and my fingers at this point , but a pair of kitchen shears would make even quicker work out of it . It 's not absolutely perfect , the traditional method of supreming <URL> would be the way to go if you 're gunning for a Michelin Star , but this is fine for more casual applications . With the practice of a couple more oranges , I think I could go from an intact orange to " cheater " supremed segments in less than a minute ( and without getting my hands sticky ! ) Pretty cool . BTW , there is a pretty neat animated GIF on the linked page that will make it all clear if the pictures do n't . EDIT : It works even better with grapefruit ! Open the grapefruit just enough to use a pair of kitchen shears to cut away the the connective membrane from the " points " of the segments ( what would be at the center of intact fruit ) . While you 're at it , remove any seeds . Be careful when you roll out the " caterpillar " to separate every segment and to put pressure evenly on all parts of the peel . The peel is a bit more prone to tearing than orange peel . Since the membranes between the segments are more like leather and less fragile than the membranes on orange segments , they are very easy to pluck away . This makes the supremed segments perfect . This gives better results even than the traditional method of supreming !
SAFETY should be your primary concern in all cooking methods . The danger inherent in cutting dense , hard , ROUND foods is that they tend to roll or shift when pressure is applied , thus allowing hand or fingers to suddenly slip under/against the cutting edge . One key to safety is STABILITY . Hasty chopping , hacking , swinging , or stabbing motions are dangerous -- especially if you ca n't be sure the food will stay put . Firm , controlled movement upon a stable surface is the safe way . Placing the squash on a nest fashioned from a tightly-wadded or rolled , clean kitchen towel is a good way to achieve stability . It is also important to work with a very sharp knife that has a rather thick blade . This acts like a wedge acts in wood-splitting . The knife should also be several inches longer than the diameter of the widest place on the squash , to allow for gripping both ends of the blade during the final cut through . Place the squash on your towel nest , use another kitchen towel , folded , as a sort of mitt . This " mitt " should be thin enough that you can grasp firmly with it . ( 100 % cotton towelling usually grips better . ) Using your mitt , grip the wider end of the squash ; insert the tip of the knife into one of the longitudinal ridges , with the cutting edge away from that mitted hand , until the knife has nearly come out the opposite side , lodging in the flesh of the squash on the opposite side . Then , lever the knife edge down in a motion that uses the lodged knife-point as a fulcrum . ( Think of the motion of a paper-cutter . ) Flip the squash over , repeating this , until the pointed end is cut all the way through . Up-end the squash , placing it on its stem end in the towel nest . Check for stability . Place your knife into the slit , perpendicular to the axis of the squash . Use your gripping towel to pad the non-cutting side of the knife , then press down until the squash is cleaved through .
It is possible to over brine meat . If you leave it in too long it will get too salty . If you use a more dilute brine it wo n't get as salty but you will wash out more of the natural flavor into the water as well . You could submerge your turkey in its packaging in ice water in a cooler for a day before brining . You could even thaw the turkey in this manner if you made sure to keep it in ice water so it did n't get to 40F .
If you like to cook using 3 or more elements at once , ensure you buy a sufficiently powered model . There 's nothing more frustrating than upping the power on one element and watching another one reduce at the same time . Touch controls look nice but they 're horrible from a usability standpoint . I always had problems with responsiveness with wet or greasy fingers . Cockroaches love induction . I do n't know if the frequency attracts them or it 's just the heat but they will come and eat out the wiring , even if you 've never spotted one in the house before . It 's a common problem as it 's hard to seal the electronics for thermal reasons . Board replacements are expensive . It 's one item I would consider an extended warranty on . As for any 2 " cooktop , larger pot/pan sizes ca n't be accommodated if you 're using 3 or more elements . Go 2 ' 8 " minimum .
It is basically the anethole ( a phenol ) of the star anise that react with the sulfur in the onion to create sulfur-phenolic aromatics . In Chinese cuisine the same family of reactions is used with duck and pork . The sulfur-phenols are also produced during the Maillard reaction , the reaction that gives grilled meat its characteristic flavor , so adding star anise to the onions will give your dishes more of that grilled , browned flavor . The reactions of the compounds in the star anise with those in the meat are not the relevant reactions for flavor or texture . From averaging a few recipes , I would say 1 star anise for every 250g of chopped onion . Too much star anise will highlight the other aromas in star anise , so one has to use it in moderation and allow enough time for the reactions to take place . Garam masala , a common Indian spice combination that is used in meat dishes , may have star anise . Star anise is sometimes used in French onion soup -- it intensifies the caramel flavor of the onions -- and in Vietnamese cuisine , which today incorporates French elements .
This is called the " roe " . More on wikipedia : <URL> Red roe is that of a female , and white , that of a male . It 's optional if you want to eat it , personally it do n't like the taste . More on ( ahem ) <URL>
The skin is the outer thick orange-coloured cover ; obviously as you 're not told to remove it this would include the pith ( the white fibrous material ) as well . The pips are the seeds inside the fruit : pip noun plural noun : pips 1 . a small hard seed in a fruit . synonyms : seed , stone , pit
Most of the issues come down to the additives and the shape of the salt . Some people find that iodized salt gives some off flavors , while sea salts will have regional differences in their mineral content that affects the flavor . In my mind , the bigger issue is the shape of the salt : Kosher / flake salt : See <URL> . Pretzel salt : large crystals , gives a crunch when eating it . Popcorn &amp; Pickling salt : fine crystals ; will disolve in room-temp water and stick well to relatively dry items . Pickling salt is uniodized . Rock salt : good for salting paths and salting ice to bring down the temp when churning ice cream . For general baking , or salting water for cooking , I tend to stick with cheap , old fashioned table salt , in part so I do n't have to convert recipes . And I use iodized , because I do n't eat out much , or eat much seafood or processed foods . For general cooking , I tend to use kosher salt , mostly because I keep it in a container I can easily get a pinch of . I 've never bothered with most gourmet sea salts ... maybe I 'm not using enough , but other than smoked salts , I do n't really taste the difference .

What is the problem with overmixing ?
In the type of recipe you reference , all of which are quick breads , the result is supposed to be tender , not chewy . Wheat flour has proteins in it , which if agitated in the presence of water , will combine to form a new protein , gluten , which is very chewy . Sometimes , this is desirable as in yeast raised bread , where the gluten forms the structure of the bread , and gives it its bite and chewiness . In fact , this is why ( most ) yeast raised breads are kneaded . Gluten development is not desirable in tender quick breads , like cornbread or banana bread . Biscuits are a type of quick bread where the lumps of butter will promote flakiness , but you still want a tender crumb . The flour and the liquids are combined as quickly as possible , with the least reasonably possible agitation , to minimize the development of gluten , and thus maximize tenderness . The idea of leaving some lumps is to help prevent over mixing , and thus toughening the product . Even if there are some small lumps of unmixed flour , the liquid from the batter will penetrate them in a few minutes during baking , and they will not be a factor in the final product .
Double-yolked eggs are the result of an anomaly in the egg generation process in the hen . They can happen in any breed of hen , on any feed . It is a result of two ova being generated at the same time , and then encapsulated in a single shell . According to <URL> , it happens more often with younger hens . I am not aware of any process to intentionally foster double yolked eggs , but that does n't mean such a thing does n't exist . They are safe to eat , although they may be visually startling .
To expand on what others above have said , Ultratex is tapioca starch , specifically tapioca maltodextrin . I imagine maltodextrin must be available in Australia . Occasionally health food stores sell it . If you go to khymos.org and search for the downloadable PDF ' Textures : A hydrocolloid recipe collection , ' you will find within a whole bunch of different thickening products ( both trade names and chemical names ) . Alternatively , simonjohnson.com.au carries the Texturas line of products from Albert and Ferran Adria , which includes a variety of thickening and gelling agents .
The most widely-accepted substitute seems to be various sauces made from mushrooms . I do n't want to say " mushroom sauce " because most products do n't have that exact name . For example : Here you have " Vegetarian Mushroom Flavored Stir-Fry Sauce " on the left , and " Premium Shitake Mushroom Flavored Soy Sauce " on the right . I 'm actually not familiar with the one in the middle and not sure what the whole label says - it might be the same as the first . If you go to a specialty Asian food store , you might actually find a product called " vegetarian oyster sauce " , which is pretty much the same thing . Failing that , you can always substitute soy sauce , or hoisin sauce if you want a less watery texture . They wo n't be exactly the same , but it 's the same general idea ( dark , fermented , salty sauce rich in glutamates ) . " Fish sauce " will be very close to oyster sauce in taste , but may still contain shellfish , so be careful .
In all cheese making and especially with young cheeses like cream cheese , fat adds a lot to the flavor and texture . You can skim off extra fat but your cheese will be thinner and less richly flavored . Shaking the cream in wo n't help if you are using a fermented method ( as opposed to using boiling and acid to curdle the milk ) because it will separate out again during the fermentation . Your thickened , fermented milk will be richer on top where the cream rose . It will mix back in when you drain the cheese and form it .
There are a number of sites that provide diagrams and information on the different cuts , one fairly extensive resource is <URL> Edit : Made a change due to comment .

Wikipedia , as well as all 12 serbian recipes I found specify full-fat white brine cheese ( cow or sheep milk ) . Only one of them called for a type of cream in addition to the cheese . In Western Europe , Turkish groceries can carry typical Balkan white brine cheese . If you do n't have access to one , buy feta . Cow and sheep cheese are considered substitutes in Balkan cuisine - the cooks are aware that they have a difference in flavor , but they use what they have at hand , similar to the way that an apple recipe will call for crisp apples , but wo n't specify Pink Crisp or Elstar apples . So both cow and sheep feta will do in principle . But I have noticed that supermarkets sometimes carry expensive real Greek feta , which is high quality , and only cheap western-made cow feta-style cheese , which is of inferior quality and has a rubber texture . If you are not sure of the quality , go for the real imported feta ( which will be sheep ) , not the feta-style .
The coating you are talking about is potato starch that is browning on the bottom of the pan , similar to what happens to roux when it is prepared . If you deglaze the pan using alcohol , it will come right off without any effort ( water works too , though more is needed ) . As for how to get the potatoes not to stick , it 's important that the pan and the oil are quite hot when the potatoes are added to the pan . As described at <URL> , the hot oil encourages a steam barrier to appear between the potatoes and the pan , temporarily protecting the potatoes from sticking and encouraging the formation of a crust that will permanently keep them from sticking . Depending on the amount of potato being cooked , the amount of oil added to the pan will have to be adjusted for thermal mass , since the addition of uncooked potatoes will cause the oil to cool down very quickly .
Time to apply a bit of healthy skepticism here : The blog post : Is ( so far ) the first and only one I 've ever seen stating mold to be a practical problem in coffee - in the sense of being present in a high enough quantity to matter ( mold grows everywhere ) . Uses all kinds of weasel words to describe symptoms ( " edgy " , " cranky " , " useless mentally " ) . Describes symptoms that are well in line with plain old <URL> . Frequently links to other blog posts on the same site , most of which are " top 10 ways " and " top 5 reasons " fluff pieces . Manages to cite and thoroughly misuse two studies : <URL> , and <URL> . Both are about Ochratoxin A ( OA ) , which is n't even the biggest risk ; Aflatoxin is . ( More on these later ) . Advertises a fairly expensive product , sold by the same author . The author : Is , according to his LinkedIn profile ( which I refuse to link here ) , the VP of Cloud Security at <URL> - a Silicon Valley tech company . I could not find any evidence that he or his his employer has any experience in human biology or nutrition . Makes all sorts of unusual claims about himself : " He upgraded his brain by > 20 IQ points , lowered his biological age , and lost 100 lbs without using calories or exercise . " Has an entire page of testimonials , which he frequently cites as " evidence " . Has an entire site dedicated to product-peddling , including the ubiquitous <URL> ( yes , that 's hyperbole ) and a <URL> . Has the following disclaimers on the product site ( all in tiny print at the bottom ) : The statements made on this website have not been evaluated by the FDA ( U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration ) .

The testimonials on this website are individual cases and do not guarantee that you will get the same results . In short , he employs tactics which are commonplace among con artists selling magnetic bracelets . In my opinion , all his claims are technobabble , and I think they are not trustworthy . The facts and studies : The largest sample tested was just 60 samples of beans , and was tested from only one source ( Brazil ) . This is fine for individual studies , but in the real world there are hundreds ( thousands ? ) of sources from many different countries . It 's safe to say that the current studies do n't even come close to testing all of the coffee from around the world . Both OA studies found an incidence rate of approximately 50 % for the OA-producing mold , at wildly different concentrations ( minimum 0.2 ppb in one study , maximum 7.8 ppb in another ) . If this tells me anything at all , it 's that you should probably vary your source if you want to minimize your risk . Neither the FDA nor the EFSA actually have a legal limit for OA , but the EFSA " suggests " a limit of 8 µg / kg , which means that even the worst samples are below the very conservative legal limit . One study actually tested the incidence of OA in brewed coffee , not just the beans , and found a maximum of 7.8 ppb in the brew ( that 's 7.8 µg per 1 kg of ground coffee ) . For reference , there 's an <URL> recommending an intake of no more than 120 ng/kg ( body weight ) per week , which comes out to 8.4 µg / week for a 150 lb/70 kg individual , or 1.2 µg / day . Based on the worst contamination of brewed coffee ( 7.8 µg / kg ) , doing the math , you 'd have to consume the brew from 150 g of ground coffee per day . That 's about half a standard-sized tin of coffee . Per day . If you drink that much coffee , shame on you . The <URL> ( the one rumtscho linked to , not cited by the blogger/con artist ) looked at Aflatoxin , not Ochratoxin , which actually is regulated by the FDA at a maximum of 20 ppb . This study also showed approximately a 50 % incidence rate after roasting , with the highest concentration of AT being 16 µg / kg for decaf ( less with caffeine ) . So that means with any random cup of coffee you have up to a 50 % chance of consuming an amount of AT that 's still well below the FDA limit - that 's very nearly zero risk . None of the studies test the rate of mold growth on beans while in storage under various conditions ( temperature , humidity , etc. ) , so we ca n't comment on what happens in storage . So I guess if you want to really be on the safe side , only buy as much coffee as you think you can use in a week or two . Conclusion : Do n't believe everything that people tell you - especially people with something to sell . Unless you 're drinking gallons of coffee a day , brewed coffee is perfectly safe .
Not really , but there have n't been that many studies in to the issue . An abstract of the most significant one can be found <URL> . To summarise , the study tested people who had drunk black coffee , coffee with milk , and coffee with non-dairy creamer to see how much of the phenolic acid ( one constituent of coffee that is supposed to have health benefits ) entered the bloodstream in each case . The study found that adding milk had no effect , but adding creamer affected the maximum concentration of the phenols in blood plasma , and the time it took to achieve that concentration . This kind of toing and froing over the health of certain foods is rife today . One minute coffee is bad for you , the next it 's good for you , and so on . For example , the study above assumes that the phenolic acids involved , being antioxidants , are good for you because they reduce free radicals in the body . Free radicals in too high a concentration can indeed be harmful . However , they are also an essential part of the immune system - when a harmful bacteria is found in the body , phagocyte cells will surround it and destroy it with free radicals , for example . Things like this mean that there is rarely a simple answer to questions of food health . Likewise , it has been suggested that people with a certain set of genes may be adversely affected by drinking too much caffeine , which may cause bone loss , unless they also have a source of calcium , like milk , in their diet as well , which would rather suggest that milk is definitely a good thing to have with your coffee !
You should refer to the discussion here : <URL> Some relevant points : MSG is found naturally in seaweed and other things . It is used to enhance the flavors it is combined with . It is completely harmless unless you are limiting your sodium intake . Check out the wikipedia article on the subject as a starting point : <URL> In short there has been no linkage to any adverse effects found in many controlled studies . As far as replacing it - You can leave it out altogether or add a little salt .
Coffee beans will retain their essential oils and flavor compounds longest if stored in a dry , dark , airtight container . Refrigeration and freezing are therefore not desirable options since they will almost always cause moisture to form on the surface of the beans . Note that for the first couple weeks after the coffee has been roasted it will naturally release a lot of carbon dioxide , so the airtight container must have some sort of one-way vent valve to let the gas out . Therefore , the pre-sealed coffee bags that are now ubiquitous in stores are ideal since they have a built-in one-way valve . There are also some <URL> that have a small pump to pump out the air once or twice a day . Once the beans are roasted , their essential flavor compounds quickly start to degrade . Therefore , do not buy beans unless you know their roasting date . If stored in ideal conditions , the beans should remain in peak condition for two or three months .
It is simply to add tartness to add some balance against the sugar . The water from the vinegar will evaporate and leave behind acetic acid . There is an old fashioned type of hard candy known as <URL> . Your lollipop is essentially just that candy on a stick .
They 're generally good for adding some crunch , too , not just the flavor . A few things that come to mind : on top of a salad - my family does a roasted corn and black bean salad ; also probably good instead of croutons in salads where they 're a better flavor/style fit garnish on a soup - tortilla soup , sopa de elote ... as part of a breading for fish or chicken ( or anything else to bake or fry ) In general , anywhere you would use breadcrumbs , tortilla chip crumbles might find a place . If you 're afraid they 're too salty , you could always put dump them in a sieve and shake some of the really small bits out , leaving the more sizable bits of chip .
The quickest way to get rid of leftover wine is to think of it as flavoured water . In many if not most recipes that call for water - especially stovetop recipes like sauces and stews - you can simply substitute wine for the water or stock that the recipe normally calls for . We actually had a similar question recently : <URL> and I 'd recommend you take a look at that , as many of the points there apply equally well to wine . Probably the best summation was in <URL> : I 'd consider stock to be just another flavorful liquid ( thanks Alton Brown ) , to be usable in exchange for others like wine , etc. . You need to be conscious of the gelatin aspect and mindful that some substitutions will be more successful than others , flavor-wise , but it 's always worth considering if stock might be a good substitute for any other flavorful liquid . Just swap the terms " stock " and " wine " and you 're good to go . Even though wine does n't contain any gelatin , you actually do need to be mindful of the gelatin aspect when substituting wine for stock , because you might have the opposite problem if the liquid is supposed to thicken . Similarly to stock , I also would n't recommend using wine in anything that you plan to refrigerate or freeze for a long period , for a different reason obviously - because it can go sour over time . So try to only use it in recipes that will be consumed in the near future . Other than that , just experiment ; whenever you 're making a savoury recipe that calls for water or stock , try using some wine instead . You 'd be surprised at how much character it can add to otherwise simple dishes . Some examples of places where you can replace some other liquid with wine : Rice or risotto Soups and sauces Deglazing a pan ( for a pan sauce ) Salad dressings ( this is an especially good use for sour/fermented wine ) Marinades Poaching liquids ( for eggs , chicken , etc. ) There really are no rules , and any time you find yourself tossing plain water into a pot or bowl , you should keep in mind that you are potentially missing an opportunity to add flavour ( which a good wine will add plenty of ) .
A couple of things will help give you smaller holes : Keep the hydration reasonably low ( say , 60 % with American-style bread flour ) . Use some oil or butter . Try 10 % ( baker 's ratio ) . Knead very well , something like 10 -- 15 minutes in a stand mixer . After the first rise , normally you try to be gentle , and not press out all the air . Do n't . Instead , press it out . Bake in a moderate ( say , 350 ° F ) oven . You do n't particularly want much oven spring here . For even finer texture , part way through the second rise , you can press it out again , and let it start a third rise ( but not to double ) . Also , adding some whole wheat or rye flour will give a denser crumb . With different flavor , too , of course .
Creaming puts the air bubbles into the mixture . The baking powder only helps enlarge the bubbles , not make them . In cookies the creaming plays another essential role , which is to help dissolve the sugar . To <URL> ( at 65 & deg ; F , harder in the summer ) . It has <URL> that cookie dough is different from cake batters . Sugar is part of the structure of the cookie and not just a sweetener , tenderizer , and browning agent . It forms the base upon which the fats and the starch granules of the flour are embedded . The sugar needs to dissolve for the matrix to form . If you beat the whole thing , it will be harder to get bubbles in and you may end up overworking the dough . The cookies will end up flat and tough .
It is to cool it down without dilluting it - ice cubes would melt . And yes , you could simply cool the entire bottle , but it would n't look that fancy . Note that some purists would wrinkle their noses and insist that whisky1 is best enjoyed at room temperature and perhaps with a small dash of spring water . 1 And I 'm soooo not going into a whisky vs. whiskey debate here .
Restaurant supply stores carry degreaser , which will remove the brown baked on oil . However , that oil is n't hurting your cooking at all . It is the same thing that forms on cast iron skillets , but it is n't objectionable because you do n't notice the color against the black of the cast iron . If it works I 'd continue to use it . If you are thinking of changing , you might want to consider the cast iron Dutch Oven route . They hold their heat better than consumer deep fryers and a Dutch oven can do more than just deep fry . And they are easier to clean .

Why does my beet kvass taste bad ?
The recipe 's goal is to use the natural bacteria in the beets and beet peels to cause the fermentation . The thing about using natural bacteria is that you never know what these are going to be , so it 's a crapshoot what flavors you are going to get . Beets produced in one farm may have radically different bacteria in them , different varieties grown in the same patch of land could also vary significantly . It 's the same process as making a sourdough bread starter using natural yeasts - you may get a nice smooth and delicate flavor , or you could get something that will take the paint off of a door . The point is that you may be doing everything right , it 's just that 's what you are going to get from the process . Looking at the science of the natural yeasts and assuming the recipe writer is not talking complete BS , it could be that the delicate bacteria spoken of in the recipe is being out-competed by the other natural bacteria in the water you use , and on the surface of the container , lid , and airlock . The thing to do in this case is to reduce or eliminate these other bacteria so that the beet bacteria will be the only game in town . To do this use sterilized water ( buy distilled or simply boil your water for a few minutes before letting it cool completely ) , or run your water through a filter which will remove or kill bacteria . Then use a chlorine solution to sterilize every single piece of equipment you will use . That means the container , lid , lock , spoons - anything that will come into contact must be very clean . Wash your beets in sterilized water as well . I 'd do that to the equipment even if I used a culture , it will increase my chances of a good result . If that does n't work you may have to accept that is the way natural kvass will taste . It could be that the writer of the article likes it that way , or simply does n't know what he/she is talking about . In that case consider using a culture - there 's no dishonor in it and you 'll get something drinkable .
Puff pastry is a laminated dough , with very strong gluten development , so an extra couple of days in the refrigerator should not have caused problems . 450 F seems like a typical temperature , and the time seems in the normal range . The only thing you have mentioned is that is definitely outside the standard treatment is trimming the edges with a butter knife . Normally , you want to trim or cut puff pastry with a very sharp knife or pizza cutter , in order to cleanly cut through the layers . A blunt knife like a butter knife can mash the layers together , making it hard for them to separate at the edges of the pastry . Still , this should have lead to lopsided or strangely risen pastry , rather than a complete failure to rise , especially in the center . The other possibility is that the dough was too warm when you rolled and worked it , or that you rolled it too much , which would work the fat or butter layers into the dough phase , rather than keeping discrete layers of flour then fat , which is what allows the rise .
I would add a slight clarification to hoc_age 's great answer , since the question mentions using " only yeast " and does not mention sourdough explicitly . Assuming the question is referring to commercial yeast , a long pre-ferment can still result in some sourness in the flavor . However , unlike sourdough , the types of bacteria and acids produced may not be as consistent . Sourdough cultures are selective environments that only grow certain types of bacteria , like certain Lactobacillus strains , which can survive in an acidic environment . Flour and water mixed with commercial yeast is generally not a particularly acidic environment , so all sorts of things will grow -- and your dough will resemble something like the early stages of a brand-new sourdough starter , with a variety of naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria , many of which live naturally on flour or come from air or water . Eventually the waste products from the yeast and bacteria will create acids . In comments , the question of acetic vs. lactic acid came up . The quantity of acid produced by yeast is not appreciable . However , bacterial fermentation will produce both acids ( and a few other minor ones in very small quantities ) . In general , the ratio of these two acids depends on a number of conditions as well as the ingredients . Fermenting at higher temperatures and with a wetter pre-ferment ( e.g. , a sponge ) will increase the lactic acid production compared to acetic acid , while dry-dough fermentation at lower temperatures will often have a stronger acetic acid taste . Note that acetic acid is more volatile and thus gives a stronger taste and smell , so not very much of it is required ; it also has greater mold-inhibiting properties than lactic acid . ( This is probably the original association of particularly " sour " dough with prospectors in cold temperatures ; in those conditions , the bread produced could taste much more sour . ) So it 's not only time but temperature and hydration ( i.e. , " wetness " ) of the pre-ferment which will effect how much sourness and the type of sour flavors produced . ( In sourdough , the initial amount of starter used in the pre-ferment will also be significant . ) The question asks how to avoid excessive sourness . Aside from the advice mentioned above -- especially pre-fermenting at warmer temperatures and with higher hydration -- one can also just use a soaker instead ( i.e. , water and flour , and perhaps other ingredients -- particularly grains -- without yeast ) . If the goal is to maximize other flavors beyond sourness , a soaker will allow enzymes to break down the grains and release flavors , but acidity will be less without the yeast . Another possibility is to use a " mash , " which is effectively a soaker heated up somewhat to speed up and maximize enzyme activity . Sometimes various dough enhancers ( e.g. , malt powder ) can also be used instead or in addition to speed up flavor development .
There are a number of reasons why the flavor of tomatoes changes during both the cooking and drying processes . The first is that when drying the tomatoes , farmers and processors will dust the tomatoes in fairly high levels of salt , which helps to keep harmful microbes and insects from eating into the fruit and causing rot and infections . The second is that when drying anything , you need to remove the water from the flesh of whatever it is you 're drying . This causes all of the flavor molecules to become more concentrated . The resulting flavor is more intense because there is simply more flavor per bite . The final and probably most important ( and beautiful :) reason is chemistry . Tomatoes play house to something like 400 volatile aromatic compounds - that is , molecular structures that change and break apart during the acts of heating or drying . While I do n't have the EXACT science in front of me right now ( and ca n't seem to find it on the interblags ) there 's strong indications that it has quite a bit to do with the structure of sulfur-heavy amino acids , c6 volatiles , and glutamic acid breaking down over the course of the drying process - due to the evaporation of water and introduction of salt - and changing into different aroma molecules . All of these , taken together together have a profound impact on the flavor profile of sundried tomatoes .
Soaking beans will not soften them . If done for a very long time ( i.e. , days ) , some beans will eventually begin to sprout or ferment , at which point they will become softer . But that is generally not desirable for basic cooking . Instead , you 'll need to cook the beans to get them to soften . Bring to a slow boil and then simmer until the interior is the desired texture . ( A common test is to take a few beans out on a spoon and blow on them ; if the outside of the bean breaks open a bit when you blow , they are likely soft and cooked through . ) By the way , the main purpose of soaking is to hydrate the seed coat ( the outer covering of the beans ) . Once that happens , the moisture can more easily penetrate the interior when cooked , allowing the beans to soften . If you do n't soak , you 'll simply waste the first part of your cooking hydrating the seed coat . Depending on the type of beans , their age , and other factors , that could increase your cooking time by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so . ( For more details , see my previous answer to another question <URL> . ) Also , do NOT try using an acid . Acids can actually toughen the seed coat , making the beans take longer to cook and soften . This is one of the reasons chili recipes ( for example ) often recommend cooking the beans first , before adding to acidic ingredients like tomatoes . ( Note that cooking times for beans and lentils can vary significantly , depending on type of bean and age . For a mixed bean soup , I 'd expect about 1-2 hours of simmering for pre-soaked beans , and perhaps as many as 3 hours . Older beans can take longer , and I 've occasionally had old batches of dried beans which never quite softened to a consistent texture . ) EDIT : Just to add onto Joe 's great advice from the Dry Bean Council , Harold McGee has this to say about beans which never soften ( from On Food and Cooking ) : " Hard-to-cook " beans ... are normal when harvested , but become resistant to softening when they 're stored for a long time -- months -- at warm temperatures and high humidities . This resistance results from a number of changes in bean cell walls and interiors , including the formation of woody lignin , the conversion of phenolic compounds into tannins that cross-link proteins to form a water-resistant coating around the starch granules . There 's no way to reverse these changes and make hard-to-cook beans as soft as regular beans . And there 's no way to spot them before cooking . Once cooked , they 're likely to be smaller than normal and so may be picked out before serving . McGee also mentions that occasionally you may encounter batches of " hard-seed " beans , which hardened during particularly hot and humid growing conditions . In such cases , the beans will be tough no matter how early they are used ; they may take much longer to cook than usual ( and sometimes may never soften ) .
This deli meat you speak of is generally made of small scraps of mechanically-separated meat that are essentially " glued " together into a solid mass by enzymes that partially break down the tissue . This processed " meat brick " does n't really have the same texture as an intact muscle tissue , which has individual muscle fibers aligned along a " grain " that makes it pleasantly chewy . Folding/layering/rolling slices of processed meat gives it more of a texture and chew , and tricks you into thinking you 're eating an actual piece of animal muscle instead of meat-flavored jelly .
The fat in your dough started to soften/melt - especially if you have a hot oven running in the kitchen . Keep your dough cold in the fridge between batches . See <URL> for more details on the issue in general , but for your situation , keep it cold between batches . You seem to have started correctly , which is good - you just have to keep it going right .
This question is a little vague , but probably your temperature probe is lying to you , or you 're not accounting for resting your meat . I would suggest a legit thermometer rather than one that gives you hints about the meat -- you 'll have more control over the final product . Temperature Guide : Medium Rare Beef has an internal temp of 145F / 60 Celsius Medium Beef has an internal temp of 160F / 70 Celsius Well Done ( ruined ) has a temp of 170F / 75 Celsius Remember that on resting your beef will rise roughly 10F / 12C in the middle as the heat distributes . So , if you pull the beef out at 160F / 70C , it will be well done by the time you eat it . If you want Medium Rare , pull it out at 135F / 55C .
Yes , saurkraut can go bad . It is a fermented product , protected from other micro-fauna growing by the acidity of the juice , a natural pickle created during the fermentation . Having the juice cover the solids is important to protect them from spoilage . If the juice gets diluted , or there simply is not enough to cover the kraut do to spillage , being eaten or whatever , then molds and other things can colonize and begin to grow . Throw your saurkraut away if it shows signs of mold , or if it has an unusual odor . Still , because of the pickle , it should have a long shelf life in practice . <URL> suggests six months , refrigerated .
Putting strong spirits in the freezer should not harm them . The solubility of air gases increases at low temperature , which is why you see bubbles as it warms up . Drinks with a lower alcohol content will be affected in the freezer . There is potential to freeze water out of anything with an alcohol content of 28 % or lower . Many people use the freezer to increase the alcohol content of their home brew in UK , by freezing water out of it - the alcohol stays in the liquid portion .
The most likely culprits are : Steeping too long : 1-3 minutes , depending on the type and grade of tea . Using water that is too hot or too cold : Again , this depends on the type and grade of tea . <URL> is an excellent resource for getting these factors right : On Steeping Time : Green tea does not require much time . Too long a steeping time will result in more bitterness and a less balanced flavor . We recommend experimenting with a range of 1 - 3 minutes . Japanese green teas generally taste best at 1 - 2 minutes while Chinese green teas seem to prefer 2 - 3 minutes ( the smaller leaves of Japanese teas will extract faster than the generally larger leaves of Chinese teas ) . Steeping time should be balanced with water temperature : the lower the temperature , the longer the tea can be steeped . On Temperature As a general guideline , green teas taste best when brewed at temperatures between 140 ° F - 185 ° F ( 60 ° C-85 ° C ) . The grade of the tea and the time of its harvest will also influence the appropriate steeping temperature . Green teas picked earlier in the spring will benefit from lower temperature brewing due to their overall higher levels of amino acids . ... The most accurate way is to use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water in the kettle . One approach is to heat the water in your kettle to the desired temperature and then pour it into your teapot . Another approach is to heat the water to boiling and then let it cool down a bit before pouring into your teapot . <URL> for further background .
This is a basic fact of food safety . It does n't matter how long each of the ingredients take to go bad separately . Prepared food will go bad soon unless you do something special to preserve it . In your case , you had hazelnuts , which do n't go bad because 1 ) they have too little water , and 2 ) bacteria can not enter their tissue , which is made of intact cell walls . You also had chocolate , which does n't go bad because it does n't have enough water for bacteria to survive in it . Ditto for sugar . Then you mixed everything together and added water , the one thing which was missing in order to keep bacteria out . And you also pureed it , which destroyed the protective cell walls . Bacteria found your food and started multiplying in it . To address your comment too : water by itself does n't usually go bad , because it has all the water a bacteria needs , but not nearly enough food content . So , bacteria can not survive in it , at least for a short time . Were you to leave out a mix of water and carbohydrates out , you 'd notice vigorous bacterial activity - this is what fermentation is . But there are some classes of bacteria which can survive on the minimal amount of debris caught by a water reservoire sitting around for weeks , and one of them is indeed pathogenic , causing a dangerous form of pneumonia . So , water does deteriorate , just not as quickly as the usual types of wet food , which are hospitable to many more pathogens . In general , all human food is great food for bacteria , often including pathogenic bacteria . You have to take something away to make it inedible for bacteria . Any mixture of two shelf stable foods can turn out to add exactly what the foods separately lacked , and make it a bacterial breeding ground again . So , never assume anything about food shelf life based on the shelf life of its ingredients !
From what you 're describing , I think the cheese ( or cheese-like substance , in this case ) ' broke ' ... that is , the oil separated out of it . I 'd recommend : Do n't melt it at full power Stir it multiple times during melting Melt the cheese ( or " cheese-food " ) seperately , then add the tomatoes , so the tomatoes do n't get hot , causing uneven heating . I 'm not sure if there 's a good way to recover cheese once it 's broken . Some starch will help keep dairy from breaking in the first place , but I do n't think it 'd help you in this particular case .
I do n't know that type of rice , but it sounds like it ran out of liquid before it was done . Some types of rice can be done in about 10m , some take over half an hour . My tricks for risotto like dishes are : wash the rice to remove loose starch taste regularly so you can intervene as needed , avoid stirring as much as you can ( you can stir a few times to avoid burning ) , fry the rice with the onions before adding water , add liquid in small batches until it 's done . Try it with a few small batches to get the hang of it . It could very well be the wrong type of rice , so you may want to try other brands .
The crystalization is to be expected , that 's what inverted sugar does . It is the same thing as with honey , which is chemically nothing but a contaminated inverted sugar . So , you are not doing anything wrong . In an inverted sugar at sucrose ratios , you will get sucrose crystalizing back out of the solution , just as you are observing now . If you really need it smooth , you can try changing the ratio by adding some fructose , as such a mixture is less prone to crystalizing . The one thing that puzzles me in your description is that you can not get it back smooth by heating , this should in principle be possible . Maybe try adding a bit of water to the syrup itself during heating , so it can dissolve again .
I 'm not sure what causes the bowing to be more pronounced from one cooking method versus another , but the solution is to put a thumbprint indentation in the middle , creating a slight " donutted " shape . This will help to ensure you get the " patty " shape you want .
Your question : is it good to use . My answer : yes . You say it smells and looks normal . That 's an important clue . We are talking about a dry product . No moist means no growth , no toxins ... Best before date . <URL> : Most shelf life dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling and exposure to temperature . Use prior to the expiration date does not necessarily guarantee the safety of a food or drug , while a product is not always dangerous nor ineffective after the expiration date
Buttermilk is already thoroughly packed with live bacteria . During its manufacture , that bacteria already consumed some portion of the available lactose and turned it into lactic acid . Because of the lack of food , acidity , and the extreme competition it is pretty hard for buttermilk to go bad . The good bacteria will stay active and the buttermilk will get thicker and more sour until it runs out of lactose . In fact - when your buttermilk container has about 1/2 cup left you can make more just by refilling the container with milk and leaving it to ferment on the counter for a day . If you use it up more quickly than the bacteria eat the lactose then you can keep this up indefinitely . Do n't worry if it is thicker - if it still smells good then it probably is . As Noctrine said - mold around the lip is the worst risk . I am not a food chemist and despite my personal experience - if you ever suspect that food is bad just throw it out . $ 2 of buttermilk is n't worth an unpleasant afternoon .
Pre-grated . Do n't use pre-grated cheese for any sauce where consistency matters . Pre-grated cheeses are almost universally coated with cellulose to prevent clumping . This will muck up a good sauce every time . If it 's going into a lasagna or a mac &amp; cheese though , chances are it will go unnoticed by any but the cook .
There is a large collection or reasons , some are : Differences in makes and models Modern form over function problems Crap EU standards ( EN 60350 etc ) that limit the amount of power a element can use .

Why should n't I bake on scratched silicone mats ?
Silpats and Exopats have a glass fibers ( regionally called fiberglass or glass wool , but not candy floss ) embedded in them for strength . The warning not to use them when scratched is because fiber glass does nothing good for a person when ingested , and a scratch may expose it . Some types of silicone based cookware do not have the fiberglass reinforcement , and so do not have the same issue . These are mostly the flexible baking dishes or muffin cups , but you should read the label information for the product you have .
This is what <URL> ( sorry , paywalled ) has to say about it : Sometimes baked potatoes can use a flavor boost . And instead of light and fluffy , most often they are dense and crumbly . We found that baking the potatoes on a bed of salt remedied these problems . Moisture that escaped the potatoes during baking was trapped in the enclosed pan , absorbed by the salt , and eventually reabsorbed by the potatoes , making their skins tender and their flesh light and fluffy . All we needed to do was fine-tune the variables . Using a hot oven and uncovering the potatoes toward the end of cooking ensured dry , crisp skin . A 13 by 9-inch baking dish provided plenty of space so that we did n't have to crowd the potatoes , and 2 1/2 cups of salt allowed us to thoroughly cover the bottom of the pan . I have found that salt roasting potatoes makes the skin crispy , without it getting hard . Like the above says , the potato itself seems fluffier . The way the salt seasons the potato is particularly nice as well . Incidentally , you can reuse the salt over and over again , so it 's not as wasteful as it might seem when you first consider the method . You 'll want to keep separate salt for things like this , though , since it picks up potato flakes and discolors a bit . EDIT The ATK method calls for covering the 9X13 baking dish ( for 4 potatoes and 2 1/2 cups of salt ) tightly with aluminum foil and roasting at 450F ( 232C ) for 1 1/4 hours . Remove foil , brush potatoes with oil , raise oven temp to 500F ( 260C ) and continue roasting for 10-20 minutes , until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and the skins are glossy .
Olives ( and onions ) are a very traditional garnish used by bartenders to add a slightly savory flavor to a drink . As with many things behind the bar , they 're used nowadays largely because they 're iconic , but they do have a subtle effect on flavor . It 's not really known where traditional garnishes such as citrus peels , cherries , olives/onions , and mint sprigs originated , but they 're found in the earliest known published bartender 's manual . ( This was <URL> ' How to Mix Drinks or the Bon-Vivant 's Companion ; cocktail historian David Wondrich 's book <URL> , which reorganizes and provides context for the original , is required reading for the modern cocktail nerd . ) These garnishes may have started with early drink families called cobblers and juleps which feature fresh berries and mint , respectively . Over time , drinks got more elaborate and drinkers came to expect something added to their drinks to give them more visual appeal . <URL> . At first , as seen in other early bartending guides , bartenders just tossed whatever they had ( usually preserved or pickled items that kept well including nuts , olives , and cherries ) into the drink on hand . Eventually they sorted themselves out and figured out that olives or onions went best with savory drinks such as the Martini , and cherries went best with sweeter drinks such as the Manhattan . The tradition solidified a few years before <URL> in the US , and was one of the practices that survived the resulting upheaval in drinking traditions . In the 1950s , Martini practices grew more variable ; when ordering , you 'd be quizzed about whether you wanted vodka or gin , shaken or stirred , an olive or a twist , without any particular standard . The olive may have become even more tightly associated with the Martini later on , when drinks began skewing to sweet and fruity in the late 1960s and 1970s , and fresh citrus started disappearing behind the bar . For whatever reason , bartenders also seem to have forgotten how to store vermouth ( which , since it 's a wine , will go off if stored at room temperature and allowed to oxidize ) and the olives may have been the only thing preventing Martinis from being unpleasantly bitter . By the 1980s , the " dirty " Martini ( which adds a dash or more of olive brine ) emerged as one of the few options for drinkers who wanted a non-sweet cocktail at a bar . Fortunately , we 've now come full circle , and a Martini closer to the original pre-Prohibition version can be found at many cocktail bars ( usually with a twist of lemon peel ) . But the olive has now been firmly established as the traditional Martini garnish for multiple generations . One of the main reasons that the briny olive works as a garnish is because a small amount of salt is a flavor enhancer , which is why just about every savory dish that we eat ( and some sweet ones , ala salted caramel ) contain at least some salt . There are n't many drinks where salt is added directly , but there are certain drinks ( such as the <URL> ) where it 's an important part of the flavor , and <URL> with a culinary background use a couple drops of salt solution in almost all of their drinks . Some people particularly like this in a Martini , especially if that 's what they 're used to . So , the tl ; dr : It 's now seen as traditional , some people really like the salty flavor it adds , and it works pretty well in a largely savory drink like the Martini .
Not much is out there . Food-grade silicone oil ( dimethylpolysiloxane , for the chemists out there ) is routinely used in medical and food-prep devices , and it has been approved by the US FDA Office of Food Additive Safety for use as a direct additive in diverse foods , like milk , dry gelatin dessert mix , canned pineapple juice , and even salt . Of course , we 're talking about minuscule amounts , in the range of 100 ppm ; at high concentrations , it is a skin and eye irritant . So what level is safe ? We ca n't assume that the FDA ever tested it , as the Office of Food Additive Safety is woefully underfunded . An informal literature search yielded me only a handful of scientific articles looking at silicone oil in frying . The most promising was by Bertrand Matthaus , Norbert Haase , and Klaus Vossman , " Factors affecting the concentration of acrylamide during deep fat frying of potatoes , " Eur . J. Of Lipid Sci . &amp; Tech. , V. 106 ( 11 ) , pp. 793-801 ( Nov 2004 ) ( fig. 3 specifically measures acrylamide concentration as a function of the amount of silicone oil ) . Unfortunately , I do n't have a subscription , so I ca n't tell what the bottom line was . Myself , I do n't see the benefit of using it at home .
It really depends on what your goal is ; that is , what you are doing with the pasta . If you are making most authentic Italian pasta dishes , the slightly under cooked pasta is transferred to the pan in which the condiment was prepared . It is then tossed with some water from the pot that that the pasta was cooked in , along with some butter or olive oil ( depending on the region of the dish ) . This finishes the cooking , emulsifies the sauce , and mixes in the the condiment . The final dish is not about pasta or the condiment in isolation , but rather the combination . Just like a salad is not about the lettuce , per se , but the combination of lettuce and dressing . It is true that pasta will potentially absorb the sauce and get mushy if stored in fridge . This is less of a problem if sauced appropriately , but still , it is possible . First choice , prepare only enough pasta for the meal . Depending on the type of pasta , you are only looking at a maximum of 10 - 12 minutes of cooking and often less . So , it 's not really about convenience . If you find you have cooked more than you need , you could always chill and reserve non-sauced pasta , then reheat it in condiment at another time . But , in my opinion , this would be inferior to freshly cooked , and take almost as much time . If your goal is a cold pasta salad , by all means , cook , chill , then mix with dressing whenever you need it .
Traditional dough will not freeze well . You have to par-bake it . In the US , the & ldquo ; freshly baked & rdquo ; bread sold in most supermarkets is par-baked dough . This is risen dough , which is then baked for 70 to 80 % of the usual baking time , cooled , frozen , and shipped to the supermarket , where it is baked again until golden . You could do the same . A par-baked baugette is a bit denser than a traditional one . Freezing the dough before baking it kills most of the yeast preventing it from working during the first stages of baking .
I use the same hole if what I am checking is large , like a loaf of bread , and I do n't want to poke it full of holes ... although with my instant read thermometer , the hole is not particularly large . If the hole is a large proportion to the item ( big hole in the side of a cookie ... I know , absurd , but you get the idea ) where you think heat can run down that tunnel you 've made , then be concerned , but I ca n't imagine any situations where it is likely that the thermometer hole is going to let enough heat in to alter the cooking . I CAN imagine a situation where a thermometer in place could help transmit heat to the center and make it , potentially , cook quicker . We used to put a large nail in the center of a potato that we were baking in the coals of a fire so that the steel would help transmit heat to the center of the potato to make sure it got done evenly , but I do n't know how much of a difference even THAT made .
The pie crust is ready to use . There is nothing in a graham cracker crust that requires baking , although a little toasting gives some color and deeper flavor . If you are putting in a filling that will not be baked ( a refrigerator pie ) , you might choose to " blind bake " ( bake without filling ) the crust for a few minutes to give it more color and flavor , but it is not required . If your filling will require baking , there is little reason to bake the crust separately .
The exact time and temperature will depend on the size of the breasts and your oven . You should always use a meat thermometer to verify that the chicken is cooked all the way through . For breasts , you want to make sure they 're around 160 F on the inside ( they 're actually safe to eat a bit earlier , but 160 F leaves you with a margin of error ) . If you do n't have a meat thermometer , you 'll need to cut them open to make sure they 're not pink on the inside , and the juices run clear . I 'd start the oven at about 375 F , and start checking on them after about 30 mins .
You may wish to try a dark colored baking sheet , such as <URL> ( not an endorsement , I have n't tried it . ) The dark finish will help absorb radiant heat , which is a major mode in baking , and better brown the bottoms . In fact , such a tray probably would bake too fast for the bottoms of cookies . Buttering it will also help conduct heat from the pan to the bottom crust , although you will also get a touch of that almost-fried texture ( I like it , but it might not be what you have in mind ) .
It depends on the artichoke 's size . The Birds Eye brand common in the US will take about half an hour at 475 & deg ; F ( I have never timed them , so it 's a guess ) . I just watch them until they start getting brown spots . If they are big , lower the temperature .
The best approach is to use most of it to make a starter and feed the mother with flour and water for the next bread . Once you have the mother , you can feed it with as much flour as you need . Let 's say you have 1 cup of mother at 100 % hydration . You should use 3/4 cups of it to make a starter for the bread ( add flour and water to form a starter your formula suggests ) . Then , feed the remaining 1/4 cup with 3/8 of both water and flour to make it 1 cup again . Then , when your starter is active enough ( it 's better to rest overnight ) , you can make the bread the same way you do with commercial yeast . Just be sure to calculate the flour and water in the starter for baker percentages . The numbers are symbolic , it 's better to use weight and not volume for correct calculations of baker 's percentages .
Rust , or iron oxide , is not poisonous , unless consumed in large amounts . Thus it is relatively safe to grill on your barbeque . What about the people who get cut by rusty nails and get lockjaw ? That 's not due to the rust , but rather , due to the bacteria on the rust , which is called , <URL> , which is found in the soil , and presumably , the nails have had come in contact with the soil , and so actually contains some of these deadly bacteria , and so , when a wound is made by the sharp object , the sharp object ( nail ) will also infect the wound causing tetanus , or lockjaw . Which is totally irrelevant to your grill , as I assume , it has n't actually come in contact with the soil has it ? So , it 's safe , relatively
Yes , you can definitely use UHT milk in bread . UHT is not usable for some applications , because its proteins have been changed by the heat . But in bread , you do n't need the proteins from the milk . Bread recipes include milk to make the dough richer , so it is mostly the fat content that matters . Using UHT wo n't change anything in the dough structure . I even think that the usual unpleasant taste wo n't be noticeable , but I am not so sure about that . Still , it gets diluted a lot in dough , so if you can drink UHT as-is , you should n't have a problem with the bread taste .
I am guessing you have a model which seals tightly and thus is a type of pressure cooker . Turbo mode no doubt essentially pressure cooks the rice so that it can reach temperatures above 212 F / 100 C and thus cook faster . ( The Cuckoo product line seems to have this as a distinguishing feature . ) There really is no downside to pressure cooking grains or legumes from a culinary perspective , and the modern equipment is quite safe .
It does n't matter in which modality ( banking , simmering ) you bring the meatballs up to temperature , only that you do . Normally , if you are cooking them in the oven first , it is for browning generate additional flavor . Otherwise , you could simply simmer them from the beginning , which is perfectly viable .
The best way to remove the aphids is to submerge the vegetables in cold water for at least 10 minutes . Then drain , rinse them off , and dry them . Salad spinners are perfect for this . Once the aphids have been drowned and rinsed off , the greens are perfectly safe to eat . Actually , it should be safe to eat the aphids as well , it 's just unappetizing .
In most wheat-based recipes , gluten strands are formed while you work the dough . If you do n't rest the dough , rolling can be more difficult and you may get a tougher texture in the final product . Additionally , refrigerating the dough up to a certain point will firm up the fats in the recipe ( butter , etc ) , which will make the dough less mushy and will making rolling out the dough evenly a bit easier . Unless the dough is so firm it becomes brittle , refrigeration will make the dough less fragile in most cases . Perhaps less important , the moisture levels may become a bit more consistent throughout the dough as well .
You are making Gianduja - and if you make chocolates out of it , they 're Giandujotti - singular form Giandujotto ; The name might help you find sources of information . The tempering process will be basically the same ( I 've seen sources suggest 2 ° C below temperatures for white chocolate temperatures at all times ) , but keep in mind that it wo n't be as melt resistant and as such not particularly good for enrobing .
Reasons to wash your rice : Reduce/Control Starch levels Often when you 're cooking rice you want distinct grains of rice and for your rice to have texture . In the case of Chinese fried rice for example , you specifically want your rice grains to not stick to one another . If you 're talking white rice especially , there will be a lot more loose starch that will form a thickish paste if if you do n't rinse it away . To clean out impurities I imagine there was a time when there were a lot more impurities ( dirt , dust , bugs , etc. . . ) . I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case these days with modern manufacturing . If you 're concerned about your source , then this may be a factor for you . There 's also the <URL> that suggest rinsing to reduce levels of something like arsenic ( see <URL> on arsenic in rice ) ... I think 1 . is your bigger factor here though . Reasons to not wash your rice : It removes nutrients . This is true for fortified rice . See <URL> on the fortification process . Note , whole grain/brown rices are less often fortified ( I want to say they 're not fortified , but I actually do n't know for sure ) . So it would depend on what kind of product you 're buying and where it came from . You actually want to keep the extra starch . This is the case for things like risotto where the starch is what gives the dish it 's creaminess . <URL> that talks about the process .

How can I tell the difference between a rabbit and a cat ?
In Germany we have an old ( joking ) saying that roughly translates to " head off , tail off - bunny " , so your question is legitimate . But first thing 's first : There is no health risk involved if you ate the latest shipment of " meowling rabbit " . ( To cat lovers everywhere : This is no endorsement , I have a much loved and pampered cat , too ! ) The most obvious differences are head ( look at the teeth ! ) , tail ( short vs. long ) , and feet ( cat claws are quite distinctive ) . But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale , so we 'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy : Shoulder blades : Cats ' shoulder blades are rounded on top , especially in the front , making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts , rabbits ' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side . Femur ( thigh bone ) : A cat 's femora are straight , whereas a rabbit 's is more or less bent , especially pronounced in older animals . Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna ( forearm ) , but they might have been removed . Ribs : Cats ' ribs are " rounder " than rabbits ' ribs according to <URL> . I ca n't say by how much , but <URL> 's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie <URL> . Pelvis : The same source as above states that the <URL> ( = the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint ) is oval in rabbits and round in cats . I could n't find a good picture to show this , though . Here 's a rabbit : Source : <URL> And a cat :
In the U.S. biscuits are made with chemical leavening , they use baking powder to cause them to rise . Rolls ( or dinner rolls ) are yeast bread . There are obviously other differences in the recipe ( s ) but baking powder vs. yeast is the essential difference .
Yep , cocoa and cacao are the same thing . The 72 % has sugar making up the rest of the mass . The description on amazon actually mentions that it 's 27 % sugar and 43.5 % cocoa butter . The rest is cocoa solids , the chocolate-y stuff . As you say , that particular brand is pretty expensive ; it 's also pretty popular and well-regarded . Since it has plenty of sugar in it , you can use it for pretty much anything , including things like coatings , or even just eat some . The 100 % is unsweetened ( there 's no room for any sugar in there ) so it 's really only usable for things like baking , where you 'll add some sugar . It 's unlikely to be pleasant to eat on its own . For what it 's worth , usually in English you 'll hear cacao only when referring to the overall cacao seeds and their use as a component of chocolate . It 's not common in non-culinary contexts . For example , we 'll say " cocoa powder " not " cacao powder " .
' Paella rice ' is not actually a variety of rice , but a category suitable , as the its name suggests , for making paella . Some common varieties are : Bahia , Balilla , Bomba , Senia , and Calasparra ; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose . These varieties differ from risotto rices , such as arborio and carnaroli , in not creating a creamy ' sauce ' around the rice . Paella rice should stick together , but be distinct and not in a creamy ' sauce ' . Arborio rice has a creamy , chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin ( one of two components in its starch ) content . Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices , however it too would become ' creamy ' if you stirred it like a risotto , since it also has a high starch content .
There are several factors that increase price . Some are related to the objective quality of the wine , some indirectly linked , other are rather disconnected from quality ( but not necessarily irrelevant , as we 'll see ) . It 's also worth noting that being of high quality does n't necessarily mean being appealing to the average consumer . Apart from the stuff listed below , mass-market wines tend to be made in a non-challenging , easily accessible style . Lower tannin levels , less acidity and a generous amount of residual sugar ( say 10-30g / l ) makes for easy quaffing but little complexity or elegance . They can be very well-made , but the agriculture may not be very sustainable , and the fruit probably is n't of the highest quality . ( If you visit a winery at harvest when they bring in the bulk wine fruit , the meaning of " quality " becomes rather apparent . ) Wines targeted at connoisseurs , wine snobs and wine geeks ( such as yours truly ) tend have more structure ( tannins , acidity ) and are more often completely dry ( although there are of course high-quality off-dry , semi-sweet , and sweet wines ) . There 's a limit to how much a producer can spend to increase quality , a limit which varies with location ( because of salaries for workers etc ) but around $ 100 per bottle is probably in the right order of magnitude . This does not mean that all wines above this magical limit are equally good , though . A dirt-cheap wine will also have a cost associated to it which will be payed for by someone else , like under-payed harvest workers , the environment around the vineyard , etc. . Below are some factors that have a more or less direct link to wine quality and/or character : Yield per acre : Limiting the vineyard 's yield per acre ( which can be achieved by sparser planting , thinning / <URL> , old vines , etc ) increases the quality of the fruit , but you will produce less wine with more or less the same amount of work , which means you 'll have to adjust the price . Number of harvesting tries : At harvest , you can pick all the fruit of one vineyard at the same time and be done with it . Unfortunately , not all bunches ripen at exactly the same time , so to avoid over - or under-ripe grapes , you can make multiple tries ( French , pronounced " trees " ) over several days and pick each bunch at optimal ripeness . More tries inevitably means more work , and so , price increases . Selection : When the harvest is brought in , you can throw all the fruit into the press , or you can select the best grapes to make your wine ( and make brandy or a <URL> of the discarded grapes , or sell them on to a bulk wine producer ) . Being picky reduces the amount of wine produced , and so , prices increase . Drying : Some wines , like <URL> and <URL> , are made from partially dried grapes , and drying decreases the amount of wine you produce ( apart from being extra work ) which means - more expensive wine . Sparkling : Sparkling wines made with the <URL> - like <URL> and <URL> - need to be disgorged after bottle fermentation , which leads to a certain amount of waste ( a Cava producer I talked to said that around 10 % of the original wine is lost in disgorgement ) . Oak aging : Many wines are <URL> , which greatly affects the character of the wine compared to other types of containers , like concrete or stainless steel vats . ( More oak does n't mean better wine , of course . ) Oak barrels are horribly more expensive than the alternatives ( and European oak is more expensive than American , and they impart different character ) , and so , the more oak you use , the more expensive the wine gets . Aging in general : Most high-quality wine receive a bit of aging before consumption to let all components integrate ; some designations of origin even require aging prior to selling . <URL> Gran Reserva , for example , must be aged at least three years , with at least one of those years being on oak , while vintage <URL> is mandated to rest three years on the <URL> , etc. . Apart from time being money , you also need a suitable storage location ( cool and humid but not too cool and humid , secure but accessible to yourself , etc ) which is far from free . The price increases . Other factors are n't causally linked to higher quality , but tend to be connected : Reputation : If you 're an unproven winemaker you will be able to charge more if you 're operating in a district of high repute than if you 're working in an area where no-one has made quality wine before . Conversely , a well-known , high-quality producer expanding their operations to a somewhat less proven district will likely be able to charge more than their new neighbours . Brand : Marketing can take many forms , such as it advertising , tailoring wines to suit <URL> , and tends to push prices up . Wineries can even try <URL> . You can also be lucky and find some great , undiscovered producer ( do n't tell anyone ! except me , that is ) selling their wines at more-or-less cost price ( which probably still wo n't be dirt cheap , though ) . Land prices : Some spots are better for growing grapes . If you 're in
Depending on where you are , the word <URL> can mean a few different things . In Mexico it refers to a flatbread made of either wheat or corn and a few other ingredients . These flatbreads tend to come in standard sizes in the United States at least , one of which might be labeled the " burrito " size . A <URL> is one use for a tortilla . A burrito consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped around a filling . Often the filling might include beans , cooked meat , rice , and perhaps vegetables .
Butterscotch and caramel are very different things . The taste difference between the two is far from ' slight ' in my opinion . Caramel is typically made with granulated sugar , milk and/or cream , butter , and sometimes vanilla . The primary flavors of caramel are the sugar and milk/cream . Butterscotch on the other hand is made with brown sugar . It 's primary flavors are brown sugar and butter . It typically also contains milk/cream but they are not as prominent as caramel . Toffee is butterscotch that has been cooked to the <URL> stage . There is no liquor in butterscotch . There is a lot of leeway in what things get called caramel , butterscotch , and toffee . The important differences to keep in mind are that caramel is made with granulated sugar , whereas toffee and butterscotch are made with brown sugar and much more butter .
For Easter , a friend and I cooked rabbits . We marinated for 72 hours in buttermilk , dijon , rosemary , and sage ( NO SALT ) . Then boned them out and spatchcocked them ( sort of a butterfly , with skewers to hold the flat spread out shape ) , seasoned , and roasted at 350 until done . Moist , flavourful . Served with parsnip puree , rosemary potatoes roasted in duck fat , and sorry but I forget the other veg we used .
春卷 ( Chūnjuǎn , Spring rolls ) are julienned vegetables , sometimes with a bit of noodles , sometimes with a bit of minced meat , wrapped with a flour dough skin and pan - or deep-fried . They are a filled roll . You can see the different varieties by country here : <URL> Spring roll : 鸡蛋卷 ( Jīdàn juǎn , Egg rolls ) are many different things around the world . In Chinese communities , these typically refer to a sweet biscuit type roll , of hollow flaky egg pastry ( not filled . ) However , there is also another variety ( common in American Chinese cuisine ) where a flour dough wrap is filled with " pork , shrimp , or chicken , adding cabbage , carrots , bean sprouts and other vegetables , and then deep fried . " In the American Chinese respect , I believe it is very similar to a Spring roll really , although the flour dough looks thicker and of a different composition than a typical Spring roll ( the dough bubbles when deep-fried , with Spring roll skin it does not . ) <URL> Sweet egg roll : American Chinese egg roll :
Heavier limes tend to be more juicy , but another important factor is the color and texture of the skin . Look for the brightest green ( sometimes with almost a yellow tinge ) and smoothest skin you can find . Many bumps or shriveled looking areas are good indications that there will be less juice . If that 's all that 's available in your store , though , just get more of them . If they have broken skin , I always avoid those . I 've gotten them home and found that even if there 's juice , at least the section near that break has gone dry and sometimes discolored , definitely a waste of my money and time . Another thing I 've found helpful , which can be done easily in the grocery store , is a smell-test . ( This also works with lemons , which to me are just as confusing . ) When very juicy , the skin has a scent , which may be subtle , but definitely different than those with none . It 's one sign of freshness , similar to knowing when to pick them from the tree . As Josh Caswell said in his excellent answer about pith , there 's nothing wrong with rolling them around in your hand in the store ; not enough to damage the lime of course , but enough to warm them up just a bit so they 'll release some juice and a nice smell . I do n't know where you 're from , but in Massachusetts , in the Northeastern United States , the produce department is often quite cold , so I do that with all my citrus choices . <URL> has some good pictures and information , and even mentions using them for cocktails ! <URL> gives the same basic information , with a video that I found helpful . To answer the question that was asked about the importance of skin thickness , it 's something I do n't generally think about when I shop , so I did some research . Most sites did n't mention it , especially with the common lime which is the most popular variety , but there is <URL> that does recommend choosing a thinner skinned fruit . They should feel firm and heavy for their size , because heavy limes will produce the most juice . Select limes with thin skins , avoiding the thicker skinned fruit , which is an indication of less flesh and juice . I know you did n't specifically ask , but just to add that if you have limes at home and you 're not getting the maximum effortless , free-flowing juice , you can microwave them for about 20 seconds . It helps release the juice , and works for other citrus fruits too . I 'd watch carefully , because I 've overheated my fruit doing that . It 's fine if I 'm going to use it for cooking or in my hot tea , but for cold drinks and things you then have to wait for it to cool off , which may be more effort than you need .
There are many styles of burger , so there is no single answer . Steamed sliders are going to have different constraints than a smashed burger compared to a pub style burger . For burgers that are griddled ( for the purposes of this post , cooked on a hot , flat surface ) , the main issue is how much heat can get into the burger , and how fast ; secondarily , there are issues of sticking and general maintainability . Some hamburger cooking methods rely on sustainable , very high heat to sear the outside of the burger , and give a good crust , even while maintaining a less cooked intererior . This is dependent mostly on the total thermal mass of the pan . Stone - Lots of mass , but low thermal mass . Does n't transmit heat very fast . Also requires considerable care and maintenance to prevent sticking . Pan - There are so many types , it is hard to give a single characterization . Thicker , heavier metal tends to be better . See <URL> for some general advice . Cast Iron - Generally has high weight , and very good thermal conductivity ( compared to any non-metal ) , so often ideal for high temperature searing of hamburgers . Requires seasoning and maintenance . Charcoal ( or propane ) grill -- can develop extremely hot radiant heat , which is ideal for some forms of burger cookery , but can not be done inside . However , there are so many different types of tools and styles of burger , the quality of outcome is going to depend on your skill , what you are trying to achieve , and how you use the equipment you have as much as the specific pan that you use . Similarly , the flavor is going to depend , not only on how you cook ( which can develop the seared , brown , meaty flavors ) , but how you season the meat , and the quality of meat you start with . This is again as important as the particularly pan that you might use .
<URL> ( UK usage ) are a quick bread , usually moderately sweet . They are baked on a sheet pan , sometimes sliced into wedges , sometimes cut into rounds or other shapes . They are similar to , but sweeter than American style biscuits . Biscuits ( UK usage ) or cookies ( US usage ) are very small , flat cake-like confections , usually rich in butter and sugar . They are also baked on sheet pans , in individual portions typically only a couple of inches across ( although sizes vary widely ) . They come in a myriad varieties and flavors . Typical flavorings are vanilla , chocolate , nuts , citrus . Some of the simpler varieties allow the butter flavor to come through . Biscuit ( US usage ) or tea biscuit ( UK usage , one variant ) are a type of quick bread charactarized by flat , flaky layers . They are typically cut in rounds a couple of inches across , and tend to be about an inch tall . They are usually only very lightly sweetened if sweetened at all . Tea biscuit ( UK usage , another variant ) or teacake are biscuits or cookies traditionally served with tea . They tend to be fairly neutral in flavor . Muffins ( UK usage ) or English muffins ( US usage ) are small yeast-raised breads which are griddled in rings , rather than baked in an oven . They tend to be a couple of inches across , and about half an inch tall . They are often split and served toasted . Muffins ( US usage ) or American Muffins ( UK usage ) are a quick bread , usually moderately sweet , baked in single serving portions in muffin tins ( the same pans used for cupcakes ) .
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
You are correct : Cupcakes are just regular sponge cakes cooked in approximately cup-sized tins .
Both crispy and caramelized onions are cooked for a long time , and will be very brown . However , they are cooked slightly differently . Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture , and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan , stirring infrequently , so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel . Depending on the onions and desired result , you may even cover them , an add a little liquid and/or sugar . The end result is very soft and very sweet . Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions . They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan , stirring regularly . This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy , even burning on thin ends . These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy , and more savory than sweet .
In their various parts of the world , all of these words mean sauce , at least some of the time . They come from different cultures , though , and carry different connotations at least in US usage . Short answer , though : there are no absolute differences that you can count on . Salsa This is a generic term in Spanish , and in South American cuisines . It can cover everything from a thick , dark mole , an adobo , a light and piquant salsa verde , or the typical tomato , onion and pepper sauce often served with chips in the US . Some salsas are smooth ; others are chunky . They can be cooked or raw . Many people use the word to indicate the red , fresh or lightly cooked tomato salsa with onions , garlic , peppers and usually cilantro often served in Mexican restaurants in the US , but this is only the beginning of what salsas can be . Sauce The generic term . Almost any flavorful liquid put on another food to enhance it . These range from elegently smooth ( such as hollandaise ) to quite chunky such as putanesca sauce . Gravy Gravy tends to be a sauce made from meat drippings , and thickened to serve with the meat or its accompaniments . In Italian-American usage , it often covers " Sunday Gravy " or a ragu made from tomatoes and one or more ( or many meats ) that in some communities was traditionally made on Sunday ; and more generally , any sauce with meat in it . I am told that in Italian in the context of pasta sauces , the actual word is ( forgive my spelling ) accompanimento , an accent for the pasta which is the star . Chutney The word chutney derives from the India/Pakistan region , where again there are a myriad different sauces that carry the title . In the US , it tends to be used for a chunky , acidic sauce made from fruit and/or vegetables . This overlaps considerably with jam or preserves , in this sense , although chutneys tend to be much more strongly spiced , and may contain complex combinations of complimentary ingredients . Still , this does n't cover the full range such as a chutney of pureed cilantro and/or mint , which is much more thin and sauce-like than the above more typical US usage . Conclusion You can not really draw strict distinctions among these categories . You have to know what the specific sauce or item is that is being discussed to strongly draw inferences about it .
In my experience the primary difference is that Calzones have Ricotta ( and possibly Mozzarella ) and Strombolis only have Mozzarella . In the Philadelphia area , both are folded over pizzas , basically . Growing up , my mother made Stromboli and it was rolled , not folded . I rarely see that in a pizza shop these days , but I do prefer that in a Stromboli . Edit : Just read systempuntoout 's link to Wikipedia and it confirmed something that I was going to post and then deleted . When I was growing up , Strombolis were made from bread dough and Calzones were made from pizza dough ; nowadays all of the pizza shops just use pizza dough . I remember bread stores as being the primary place to get Strombolis growing up because they were the ones that made the dough !
I had to consult my copy of Bread Baker 's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart to be sure , but here is a quote : There are two types of firm , or dry , pre-ferments and two types of wet pre-ferments . The firm pre-ferments are known as pâte fermentée and biga . The wet pre-ferments are called poolish and levain levure . ... Biga , an italian style of firm pre-ferment , differs from pâte fermentée in that it does n't have any salt in it . Also , rather than cutting off a piece of finished bread dough to hold back as an improver , a biga is made specifically to be used as a pre-ferment . So , it seems the main difference lies in the hydration of the dough , where a poolish is made with a ratio of equal water and flour . There also seems to be a few other differences . A biga apparently uses .5 percent yeast to flour , while a poolish uses .25 percent . Mr Reinhart does not say anything about a concrete difference in final result between these methods - just that a ' wet ' pre-ferment is faster . Faster in the sense that in the same time-frame a poolish will develop more flavor and character than a dry pre-ferment . Sadly I 've personally only used a wet pre-ferment , since it is easier to handle . Just whisk it prior to bed time with a wire whisk and mix in the rest of the ingredients the next day . Having a full blown dough makes it more difficult to incorporate the rest of the ingredients .
It becomes quite confusing when talking about the difference between chow mein and lo mein mainly due to the error in translation . In Chinese chow mein literally translate as " fried noodles . " However when buying chow mein at a chinese restaurant , you get vegetables with a side of deep fried noodles . Somehow the title of a dish is referring the to side rather than the main dish which leads to much confusion . When talking about chow mein at a grocery store , it also gets confusing because you can get two types of noodles . The first kind is a fried noodle that looks something like this : This is definitely not what your recipe is referring to . The second type of chow mein you will find is very much similar to lo mein . It should be a raw noodles that is still semi-soft . It should look like this : If the chow mein you have at your grocery store resembles the second type of noodle , then you may use that as a substitute . If it resembles the first type , do n't . The first type is used as a topping sort of like chinese croutons .
Looking at individual recipes , there is a great deal of overlap between Crêpes and Swedish pancakes . If , however , you compare hundreds of recipes , some clear differences emerge . There are also differences between the English interpretations of these recipes and those written in French or Swedish . In the chart above , each cohort consists of at least 100 distinct recipe ratios , except for <URL> Crêpes ratio which is provided for comparison . A taste test of the Swedish recipe Pannkakor with French recipe Crêpes revealed the following differences : Batter : The increased liquid content of the Swedish pancakes made the batter much thinner than the Crêpes batter . Swedish pancakes are made in a pan with a raised lip around the edge . This allows the thin batter to be sloshed around , evenly coating the pan surface without running over the edge . Crêpes , on the other hand , are made on a <URL> . The batter must be thick enough that it will not run over the edge . A T-shaped spreader is used to evenly coat the crêpe maker surface in a perfect disk shape . Frying : Crêpes fried up extremely easily , unsticking themselves from the skillet ( I had neither a pancake pan , nor a crêpe maker available at the time ) making it possible to toss the Crêpes instead of flipping with a spatula . Swedish pancakes , on the other hand , require a bit of fiddling with a spatula to flip them . Crêpes had a slight tendency to curl up at the sides after flipping so they cooked less evenly than the pancakes which stayed perfectly flat after flipping . Flip side of a Crêpe ( French recipe ) Flip side of a Swedish pancake ( Swedish recipe ) I also tested Michael Ruhlman 's Crêpes ratio . These curled up to a much greater extent than French recipe Crêpes after flipping and were , consequently , quite unevenly browned on one side . Flip side of a Ruhlman 's Crêpe Taste and consistency : Both French recipe Crêpes and Swedish recipe pancakes hit caramel and butterscotch notes . In short , they both tasted great . The Crêpe consistency was a little tough together with traditional Swedish accompaniments ( Whipped cream and Strawberry jam ) whereas the Swedish pancakes were light and fluffy ; this worked perfectly with the filling . I tested again with lemon juice and sugar and this time the Crêpes won through , holding up well to the additional liquid while the Swedish pancakes became a bit soggy . Ruhlman 's Crêpe recipe did n't perform nearly as well . The caramel flavour was much less pronounced , they had a dry mouth-feel and they were tougher than French recipe Crêpes . For anyone who wants to form their own opinion , here are the ratios and ingredients I used in the tests : Swedish Pancakes ( based on 200 Swedish recipes with distinct ingredient proportions ) Ingredient weight ratios : 1:3.5:1:0.16 ( all purpose flour : milk : medium egg : butter ) 79g or 150ml all purpose flour 278g or 278ml milk 80g , 68ml or 2 medium egg ( s ) where each medium egg is 53g 13g or 13ml butter 1/4 tsp salt Crêpes ( based on 119 French recipes with distinct ingredient proportions ) Ingredient weight ratios : 1:1.97:0.75:0.17 ( all purpose flour : milk : medium egg : butter ) 116g or 219ml all purpose flour 228g or 228ml milk 86g , 73ml or 2 medium egg ( s ) where each medium egg is 53g 20g or 20ml unsalted butter 1/4 tsp salt Update : Joe 's comment prompted me to chart the ingredient proportions as a <URL> .

Can I make risotto without wine ?
Yes , all it is , is flavour . Apple juice and grape juice are 2 things I 've used in the past for non-alcohol people . You can also get away with not using anything as a replacement as long as you use enough of everything else ( butter and parmesan etc ) . Wine just gives a little depth and a sort of ' freshness ' . Edit : I just read the vegetarian part of your question . I 'm assuming you already know , but Parmesan is n't vegetarian , as it is made from rennet ( <URL> ) , and most commonly from the fourth stomach of young calves . The vegetarian substitute 's I 've tried in the past ( Called pasta cheese ) , are not great . However , unlike Parmesan , Gruyere is allowed to be made with vegetable rennet and taste 's great ( I personally prefer it over Parmesan ) .
I am happy to give you a brief idea , but you may have to tell me how much info you need Get the lotus leaves from chinese shop and they are usually dried leaves , so you need to soak them in water for a night . After that give it a wash and cut it to the right side sticky rice is a type of rice , so that 's what you need . Do n't use any other rice as they wo n't stick . You will need to soak the rice in water for couple of hours and add couple drops of oil . Prepare whatever you want to put in your rice like mushroom and meat When u make the wrap , put a layer of rice on the leaf and then place the meat and mushroom on the rice . After that put another layer of rice on top and wrap it up Put the wrapped rice to steam and I can not help you with the time , but it 's between 10-20 mins Good luck
As baka has said , more volatile components of the wine will be released with more wine surface exposed . Also , this not only releases aroma but also helps the wine to " breathe " and oxidize , which is why you open the red wine bottle half an hour before serving it ( so that this process starts ) , and why you might pour the wine into a decanter . This process accentuates the flavors and aromas of the wine . It is not very much necessary with younger , colder served wines ( e.g. vinho verde ) . In young , sparkling wine , a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster , as well as warming it . This is undesireable , hence the smaller , narrower glasses . Aged white wine should behave similarly to aged red wine , although it does n't need to breathe as much .
I have made refried beans out of pinto , small red , black , and even navy beans . I almost tried using kidney beans once but it seemed wasteful . They were all different in texture but they were all good . Black beans , for example , have a much more fibrous skin so the refried beans are not as smooth - I actually prefer it to the homogeneous pinto mash . Obviously their color is also more interesting . There are a lot of different bean varieties and I do n't know what is available to you . In general I would say to just try whatever you have - it will probably taste good even if it is n't exactly like pintos .
How archaic and fun ! I whipped out some Google-fu and found the following for you : Tincture of Capsicum You can actually buy this on Amazon : <URL> . It 's available other places , but I saw prices as high as 2x this . ( 9 ml ~ 0.3 oz ) Essence of Ginger This is from a late 19th century Jamaican cookbook ( <URL> ) . Three ounces of freshly grated ginger Two ounces of thinly cut lemon-peel Two pints of brandy or proof spirit ( white rum ) Just combine and let sit for 10 days , shaking well . Essence of Lemon This can also be purchased . You can likely find some lemon extract in your grocery store , if not here is some on Amazon : <URL> - note that it 's 3 bottles . Solution of Burnt Sugar This is n't just typical caramelized sugar , it 's burnt sugar . Sugar that has been heated to the dark caramel stage of 370 F to 400 F ( 188 C to 204 C ) . The sugar at this point has lost most of it 's sweetness , smells burnt , and tastes kind of bitter . It 's commonly called <URL> these days . This is what is gives Cola 's their dark color . In the small amount of 25ml and in the presence of 2.5 lbs of sugar ( wow ! ) you wo n't taste it . My amazon-fu fails here , but have found it available on this site : <URL> It might be simpler to buy this than attempt making your own . Caramel coloring can be a little hazardous to make , it 's easy to go too far and burn your sugar , and dumping any quantity of water into 400 F sugar is a sketchy experience . Here is a how-to if you desire though : <URL> Tartaric Acid This too can be purchased - <URL> Please note that tartaric acid is not the same as cream of tartar . Cream of tartar is an acid-salt in which the tartaric acid is partially neutralized . This site <URL> . I 'm not sure if this will make a difference in your drink because I 've never used cream of tartar in such a way or quantity before . There is also the possibility that a recipe of this age simply used the term tartaric acid to refer to cream of tartar . Who knows ?
Soda-like drinks have traditionally been made in the same way as beer , but with less fermentation to keep the alcohol content low . Without alcohol , ( and with a bunch of protein and fat around from the yogurt ) you run the risk of growing some <URL> in your soda . Some traditional fermentation techniques carry risk of botulism , and any ' new ' technique should undertaken very carefully . That being said , your soda should be quite acidic and probably safe . Get some pH paper and use it ! There are a few things I would change in this plan : Yogurt is made at fairly high temperatures to encourage lactobacillus growth while inhibiting others . Find out the best temperature for your culture , and make sure you can maintain it during fermentation . Try get the culture growing independent of any yogurt : grow it in your sugar/lemon solution for a few generations without pressure and with a bit of oxygen . If it 's still alive and still tastes good , you 're probably OK . Otherwise , if the culture dies halfway through fermentation , something else is likely to grow in its place :-( Lemon juice is quite acidic , and will clean metals quite nicely . So do n't put your soda in any metal container unless your really like the taste of iron . ( Even beer is acidic enough to cause this problem , fermentation is always in glass , plastic or stainless steel ) . Used plastic soda bottles work well when clean . The other major problem with a pressure cooker is getting the soda out : if the cooker did hold pressure from a fermentation ( actually it will probably leak CO2 faster than it is made ) you should n't be able to open it until the pressure is removed . Again , soda bottles are a good choice here . Last - your water should not be chlorinated , the flavor of your soda could be ruined by chlorine .
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
Thickening with starch or flour instead of roux can be quite acceptable if some other rich flavors are added . Here is where the calories can be traded in : Good low-fat broth for part of the liquid . celery root or coriander root are particularly good ing . for veggie broth Puree , in small amounts add body and flavor . soft cooked onion is particularly silky and surprisingly mild Flavorsome oils , few drops instead of copious butter . Macadamia punches above its weight . Sesame toasted ( tiny amount ) or if feeling adventurous , pricklyash from Asian market . lower-fat ' milks ' can add luscious body instead of cream or 3 % dairy milk . Unsweetened Almond or coconut does n't overwhelm most sauces .
Yes . In fact , many , many people believe ( falsely ) that adding salt before or during cooking will keep beans hard ( a myth addressed in your first link ) , and most of these people have been cooking perfectly good beans for many years without adding salt until the beans were fully cooked . The cooking time may vary slightly . In some circumstances , the texture of the beans and/or their skins may soften at somewhat different rates than with salt . But the beans will still cook fine . ( One note : some chefs have claimed that cooking beans without salt causes people to add even more salt afterward to create a flavor that tastes " properly salted . " Beans are generally enhanced by adding flavoring components early enough in cooking for the flavors to penetrate . But you can always add salt afterward too ; the resulting flavor distribution will just be different . )
Yes , you can squeeze walnuts , pecans , almonds together and get something going . I wo n't mention peanuts because they 're not tree nuts ( and they 've lost my respect in other ways ) . Read this answer tongue-in-cheek given the gravity of the question . Obviously pistachios are the easiest to open and filberts/hazelnuts the tougher nuts to crack . Pine nuts are somewhat easy , but who wants to carry a barrel of pine cones just to get a few nuts ? I 've never seen a macadamia or brazil nuts in a shell and been told Cashews are n't edible unroasted . You can also get creative using tools other than a nutcracker or your hands . I used to use the door and jamb ( hinge side ) in college since we had indestructible doors . Even keys and car keys are useful to wedge open walnuts . Some birds ( crows/ravens ) throw the nuts on the road and wait for a car ( hat-tip to them clever birds ) . Pretty sure one of my friends uses his iPhone 5 as a hammer ( it works , but do n't do it ) . Finally , if you 're concerned about oxidization on shelled nuts , I understand . As a delicious option , try placing shelled walnuts or almonds in cold water in the fridge overnight and rinse in the morning . The skins slide off and most of the bitter washes away leaving pure yumminess behind .
The wine will bring several things to the breadmaking party : Acidity Alcohol Water Flavoring Color ( especially if it is red wine ) The biggest of these is the alcohol which is a yeast byproduct -- they do n't like it in their environment , and it inhibits their growth . The acidity can do the same . Proofing will be retarded , and you may need a larger starting quantity of yeast than for a wineless loaf . You would also have to adjust the amount of liquid in the formula to account for that from the wine . Your bread would probably take on a strange mauve color , after being baked , and may have some hint of winey flavor . I think the lack of well known wine-loaves in the world 's baking traditions indicates this does not generally work out very well , although there are some recipes for yeast raise breads containing wine such as <URL> from The Fresh Loaf .
Blah ... this is getting to be a bit long for a comment , so I might as well reformat &amp; expand more , even though it might not be an appropriate answer . ( and I should note that this is mostly from memory as I got an engineering degree ~ 20 years ago ) Are you asking about the physics of what ' crunchy ' is ? It 's effectively stiff , brittle things . When you 're dealing with strength of materials , you 're looking at how much energy something can absorb before it fails . Strain is a measure of how much something deforms as it 's being loaded . Items that can take a high load ( force applied ) without deforming are considered stiff . ( stiffness = force / deformation ) Brittle is a characterization of how it fails -- something that deforms plastically ( stretches and wo n't go back to the original shape once the load is removed ) can become weaker as more force is applied , but still keep resisting . Think of something like taffy . Brittle failures , however , are almost explosive -- it just breaks suddenly . Think of a concrete block being crushed -- you load it and it looks like nothing 's happening , but suddenly bits of it shoot off and you 're left with a pile of rubble . Why things are crunchy is another issue entirely -- because there 's lots of different structures that can result in " crunchy " . Crunchy baked goods are more like a wooden truss bridge . Wood can handle a lot of force without breaking , but once once member goes , the truss loses strength and is ripped apart , and it suddenly fails . There 's often debris along the breakage because of how the item rips itself apart internally . ( although we typically call them ' crumbs ' not ' rubble ' when talking about this kind of food ) . For these foods , water will typically soften the structure making it so they ca n't support much load -- making them not stiff , and thus not crunchy . Moist things like apples , lettuce and carrots are often crunchy , but it 's a bit different . It 's more like bubble wrap . Cells are effectively a bunch of tiny water balloons bound tightly together . As we apply pressure , they pop . ( although they 're so tightly packed together that unlike a single water balloon , it does n't have space to deform ) . In this case , we do n't see crumbs as much as the moisture from the cells breaking . If the cells are n't full , then we consider it to be mushy ... maybe even chewy if we dry it far enough ... if the cells do n't stay bound together well , then it 's mealy -- it crumbles easily , rather than giving us that resistance before it fails explosively . So anyway ... if you want crunchy without sugar and fat ... have some celery . If you 're okay with a bit of sugar , then carrots . If a bit of fat , then crackers ( but not ritz or really buttery ones ) .
The goal is to evaporate alcohol and concentrate flavor . If adding wine to a mirepoix , or sofrito ... some sort of early stage aromatic vegetable ... reduce the wine almost until the pan goes dry , but not dry enough to cause sticking or burning . The flavor will be absorbed into the vegetable and you are good to go . If there is another instance of wine addition that you are considering , please specify .
I would check the recipe and see how much stock that requires , and then compare that to how much stock your bouillon cubes make . If it 's close , you 're probably fine . This assumes you make standard stock before using the cube , of course , and not concentrate . Does the recipe give any other clues ? If you ca n't get any joy this way , I 'd suggest you just guess , erring on the side of bland , and taste as you go .
Wine vinegar and wine are very different although are produced from the same thing . Wine vinegars are vinegars produced from fermenting wine by acetic acid bacteria which convert the ethanol in wine into acetic acid . Being a vinegar , it is much sharper than wine although like wine many flavours can be detected beyond the generic sharp lemon-like flavour , particularly in the premium aged varieties such as balsamic vinegar from Modena . Wine vinegar has no alcoholic content in it and so there is no need to ' burn off the alcohol ' which you would do when cooking with wine . Wine has a much subtler flavour and so would use it in things like gravies , sauces , etc. . Likewise , vinegar is much stronger and I would mainly use it in vinaigrettes or in small quantities in cooking ( ie finishing of a dish with a small drizzle of vinegar ) in much the same way as you might use lemon .
I make steel cut oats in a slow cooker , stick them in the fridge and then slice off a chunk to eat each day . In a slow cooker add 2 cups steel cut oats 8 cups water 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon cinnamon Cook on low for 8 hours . When complete , let cool some and transfer to another container and refrigerate . The next morning , scoop out a hunk into a bowl , splash a little milk on it and heat it up in the microwave . Add fruits and toppings as desired . For safety , the cooked porridge should be discarded after 5 days .
From my answer on another question ( that justkt linked in the comments ) : <URL> Arborio rice , the classic choice for risotto , contains roughly 19 to 21 percent amylose . However , that is not the only difference . The desirable " bite " in risotto is due to a defect in Arborio rice called chalk . During maturation , the starch structures at the grain 's core deform , making for a firm , toothy center when cooked . Sorry , but for the best risotto , you really need an appropriate rice .
The key to this is really high heat and pan-fry in a single layer , very quickly . The goal is to get that nice brown caramelized surface and barely cook the interior and then get it out of the pan before it starts to seep water . Also , wait to season with salt until it comes out of the pan so it does n't draw out the water prematurely .
No , it wo n't change the aroma compared to conventional heating . Generally , heating does change aroma . But it changes in the same way in conventional heating and in microwave heating ( given that you heat to the same internal temperature , which can be very different time and power settings for different types of heating devices ) . What microwaves change is texture . That 's why the microwave is considered " a horrible thing " among chefs . You ca n't bake doughs or batters in it , and other things like vegetables can also suffer . Then there is the problem with uneven heating . None of these factors matter with liquids . You can warm milk , wine , whatever , in the microwave , without fearing a taste change .
Speaking as a Brit - we are a nation of chip lovers :) Use an oil which can cope with the high temperature such as groundnut . For that proper chip experience ( * heart attack alert * ) add some beef dripping or lard . I add a small amount to give the chips a nice flavour . Whilst heating the oil regulary dip a chip in the oil . When it starts to bubble then it 's time to cook . If the oil is too cold the chips will absorb it and they 'll go soggy . ( This is easier to achieve with a traditional chip pan or I prefer a deep saucepan ) . For the perfect chip the potato variety is important but this is personal taste . Last seasons reds will make dark delicious chips but I prefer new potatoes which make a crisper lighter coloured chip . ( The potato variety also affects the colour when cooked ) . Finally , drain on kitchen paper and a sprinkle of salt .

Why do some recipes recommend a short rest after mixing but before kneading the bread ?
Besides the initial gluten relaxing that mrwienerdog wrote about , another important effect is the absorption of liquid . It takes time for the flour to fully hydrate with the available liquid . Before it does the dough will be more sticky and there will be less gluten available for kneading . Giving the recently incorporated dough a short rest allows the flour to pull in all the liquid it can and become much easier to work with . A similar effect can be seen with pastry doughs . Even though often the goal is to minimize gluten development , a short rest gives the flour time to hydrate and can turn pastry dough from difficult to work and crumbly to soft and smooth .
You are asking a surprisingly lot of questions . First , to deal with this question , you need to understand " creaming " . So look <URL> and <URL> . Nothing " creams " as dramatically as granulated sugar with room temperature butter . Those particular ingredients are special for that . Brown sugar does n't accomplish nearly the creaming effect of granulated sugar , but combined with granulated sugar the combination is greater than the sum of its parts . In other words , a 50/50 mix of brown and granulated sugar can achieve nearly the leavening effect of granulated sugar only with room temperature butter . The sweetness of brown and regular sugar are pretty much equal . In the US and I think almost everywhere else , brown sugar is just granulated sugar with molasses added . Brown sugar adds the molasses flavor , and not surprisingly , some browning . To use non-sugar sweeteners , choose recipes that do n't call for <URL> , they simply wo n't work right . If you want to use a sweetener other than sugar , pick a recipe with a fat that is unsaturated ( liquid at room temperature ) , or melted butter . Also , be sure that your sweetener of choice will maintain its sweetness if baked .
<URL> This site 's gardening tip says that tomatoes splitting on the vine is due to a lack of water - the plant gets dried out and the skin does n't retain the elasticity to contain new growth . The refrigerator is typically a dehydrating environment . Could be that 's your culprit . But for pity 's sake , store them on the counter where they stay their most delicious and you can see them and remember to eat them !

Baking is a complicated process and requires precision ; you start out with complex molecules , and transform them into something has to have many qualities precisely right . The common quality of all baked goods is the foam structure : each baked good is best when its foam is right . Example : for a cake , the " right " foam has lots of tiny , regular bubbles , and the bubble walls support the foam , but are soft , not elastic . The ideal foam for a bread or pie crust is different . There are other criteria for the cake layer to be good : Evenly baked Regular shape and surface , no cracks or doming Neither overcooked nor undercooked , starch gelatinized but not retrograded Moisture content correct , should n't be dry or melt in the mouth like a brownie Color Balanced flavor : not too sweet , eggy , salty , or bland This list is just for the layer itself , frosting and combining layers makes it even more complicated ! With so many qualities to balance , you need a precise process to get reliable results ; however home bakers do n't want to monitor precisely . Most lack probe thermometers , and Americans often use volume measures for dry ingredients , rather than the more accurate weights . Finally , most home bakers do n't understand the theory of baking . Great bakers draw on both theory and practice when they bake , and their recipes rarely fail . Theory teaches them the significance of each step , and the hidden assumptions made by the recipe . Practice teaches to judge what is happening before his eyes , and how to recognize when something has gone wrong . Theory and practice together let great bakers identify when something has gone wrong and rescue the project . A novice will have neither practice nor theory aid them . He is even likely to misunderstand steps . For example , he may stir vigorously when the recipe says " fold " . He may also omit key steps when pressed for time , without realizing their significance . For example , using fridge-cold eggs when they should be room temperature . Of course , everybody has to start somewhere , and not all baking recipes are created equal . Some have more room for error than others . For example , making a genoise for the first time is very hard . The egg yolks start foaming at around 50 ° C , but ca n't build a good enough foam at below 65 ° C . They curdle irreversibly at 85 ° C . So a genoise has to be created in a water bath at a temperature around 70 to 75 ° C , and when the yolks are foamed , the flour ( which has to be low-gluten ) is added and mixed well enough to not fall to the bottom in lumps , but not well enough to remove the air from the foam . After that , the layer is baked , and it glues itself terribly to the pan , unless the baker had the foresight to use parchment combined with proper flouring technique , and then used proper technique to remove the layer when it is still warm enough to separate but not so hot that it gets irreversibly squished . There are so many things to get wrong with a genoise that a novice will run into them without ever realizing what happened . Recipes that " never fail " are the opposite ; they are robust , and do n't rely on precision . Simple muffins are one example : The chemical leavening of the baking powder works well in many conditions , unlike the fickle yolk foam leavening in the genoise . Muffins even work if the cook just beats everything together in the bowl . You do n't have to worry about overmixing , creaming , or specific temperatures . The fat content keeps muffins moist even when measurements are n't exact , and masks mistakes by enhancing flavor . The cook actually seeks out doming , rather than avoiding it ! Finally , the crumb does n't have to be soft , regular and airy the way cake crumb should be . Muffins can tolerate a lot of mistakes ! To summarize : " never fail " recipes are recipes where : There are few steps Each step is simple to perform Even if the baker makes an error , the end result is still likely to come out tasting good . Of course , this ignores the catches ! Publishers can claim a recipe will " never fail " when they are unreliable for a novice . Sometimes this happens accidentally , when a bad baker repeats a recipe enough that it becomes easy , but others have difficulty with it . Finally , not everyone has the same criteria for success . I once found a recipe for a wedding cake on a popular site ; it used box mix , smothered it in pudding from a sachet , and decorated with gummi bears . Virtually all commenters insisted that it has turned out " great " and described how the wedding guests complimented them . I ca n't imagine that it was really " great " , but suspect that people who know what a great cake tastes like did n't bother to make the cake or leave comments . There is no guarantee that a recipe labelled " always works " lives up to its name , or is actually good . But , if you 're a new baker , it 's a good idea to start with such a recipe until you have gathered some experience .
it 's possible that the heat only comes from the burner/element at the bottom . Especially if you have a gas oven . Try bufferring the bottom of the bread with a pizza stone . A terracotta clay pot saucer , or practically any unglazed natural stone tile can substitute . Marble or granite are not ok .
The technique that many restaurants will use is to prepare the pasta ahead of time and store it in or on ice water . The chilled pasta may be then submerged briefly in boiling water and served .
Its called chocolate <URL> . There are two types : Fat blooming - cause is not known for certain , but probably the type VI chocolate crystals are more thermodynamically favored , so spontaneous conversion ( and exit from the surface of the solid solution constituting the chocolate body ) may be possible . Sugar blooming - the sugar in the chocolate is dissolved by humidity , and the precipitates on the surface . Fortunately , there are no safety problems with bloomed chocolate , and it can be remelted with no inherent loss of quality . So bloomed chocolate is perfectly useful in recipes where it will be melted ; or it can be melted and <URL> if desired .
It 's not so much the taste as the texture . If they have n't been sauted first , the onions stay relatively crunchy during the rest of the cooking . The same is true of the garlic , but you 'd usually have cut the garlic into much smaller pieces so it does n't take as long to soften up , hence kicking the onion off first and adding the garlic a bit later .
The real issue , I think , is that you want to add the egg whites immediately before service , as they will begin deflating once they are whipped and mixed in . So instead of holding the mix a certain period of time , instead you hold the mix until prior to service , and then fold in the whites , which should be freshly whipped .
I suspect that the purpose of the double boiler is to bring the eggs up to room temperature , which is n't going to make that much of a difference . Most recipes would say that the process will take 10 minutes , but you may be able to speed things up marginally : Use a bowl that concentrates the eggs in as small an area as possible so your beater blades contact as much eggs as possible per rotation . A narrow , tall bowl is better than a wide , shallow one . If you do n't have that then tip the bowl you do have so it all concentrates in one area Use fresh eggs , I 've found that fresher eggs take air better . It 's true for egg whites at least , so I suspect it will be for whole eggs as well Let the eggs come up to room temperature before using them , that way you do n't need the double boiler setup , which will give you more flexibility when it comes to bowls . If you do n't have 20-30 minutes to let the eggs warm naturally then 5 minutes submerged in tepid water will do the same thing Other than that the only thing I can recommend is to buy a stand mixer or cultivate patience . Preferably both .
Straight after it comes out of the pan it will usually be too hot to eat . Regardless of resting or not , you ca n't fully taste things which are too hot , they need to come down to a comfortable temperature before you eat them . Some things you can do to stop the meat being too cold when you serve it : You can rest the meat wrapped in foil , this will stop it from getting too cool too quickly if you are not ready to serve once its had the time to rest . you can rest it and then warm it again before you eat it , either under a hot grill for a little , or in an oven . serve it with a hot sauce which will warm the meat serve it on a warmed plate which will stop it cooling more too quickly on the table Although I think you are worrying too much about nothing IMHO . Even once rested the meat will still be at a good temperature , especially as you have not cut it yet and most of the heat will be retained in the middle of the meat .
Convenience : It 's more convenient and easier to monitor the temperature inside the home . The oven has a thermostat , where the grill temperature needs to be monitored and adjusted manually . No smoke left : Is could be assumed that the smoke has been exhausted . Too much smoke : The smoke flavor could become too strong if finished on the grill .
Why resting longer ? Resting the dough not only let 's gluten linking begin , but also allows <URL> . There are some technics for making bread that take profit of that to extract more taste from the wheat , such as <URL> ( invented by <URL> ) or Pain à l’ancienne ( which uses autolyse and other delaying methods that you wo n't use in not leavened breads ) . Originally Monsieur Calvel stated <URL> ( that link might be in Spanish , but I do n't understand why it 's not in English ) , but nowadays people are experimenting with <URL> , and even <URL> . That enzymatic activity wo n't be affected by lipids , so adding fat or oil for Parathas or Rotis will work the same . They can be affected by a PH < 4 or 3.3 , but I do n't think you 'll reach that PH in a Paratha 's dough . So , how long is too long ? The longer you let enzymes make sugars , the tastier the dough will be . But if you rest too long a dough , the gluten will finally get broken : the dough will look more like a puree than a kneaded dough . It will depend on the enzymatic activity of the flour , and can vary a lot from one flour to another . It is measured by a value called <URL> ( you can see why is it important <URL> ) . That index is very rarely labelled in packages , but you can try getting in contact with the millers and ask them . Or you can also try to find the answer to your question empirically for the brands of flour you use ( that value should n't vary from different batches of the same brand of flour ) . Touch the dough every hour to feel if it still has a workable consistency . Note that your dough will be stickier , due to the sugars released by autolisis .
There are several main reasons , historically : Cows , sheep and goats have udders , and can be milked by hand into a bucket . Pigs ( or cats , or humans for that matter ) have nipples , where you need to suck the milk out . Consider that most of the cheese in the world was invented before machinery was able to create a vacuum , this means that the only option would have been to suck milk from the pig and spit it into the bucket . For making cheese , the fat/protein ratio in the milk is important . It changes , obviously , from species to species , which is why there are n't many hard yellow cheeses made of goat 's milk . Lastly , I have actually had camel 's milk ice-cream , which goes to show that it 's just a cultural thing mostly .
When you buy it , the fenugreek is almost certainly still alive , even if the roots have been cut off . It continues to respire and metabolize , or tries to . The leaves almost certainly wilted because the plant had no water . Treat it like flowers if you are going to hold it for a more than a day or two , by giving it water at the roots or root end of the stems ( if you have no roots , again like flowers , trim off the bottom of the stem , to allow a fresh surface to absorb the water ) . This technique also works with celery ( very well , in fact ) , parsley , cilantro ( eeew !!! ) and so on .
Most of the popular ingredients for BBQ sauce ( vinegar/ketchup/sugar etc. ) tend not to mix very well together . I know whenever I 've made BBQ sauce , placing all of the ingredients into a pan together they tend to separate and are difficult to combine . Heating up the ingredients , however , causes them to combine better , and after a short time cooking they will bind together and give a more consistent texture/taste . Otherwise the different ingredients may continue to separate even when mixed , and you may find clumps of sugar that have not dissolved into the liquid etc. . It 's quite possible your BBQ sauce recipe does n't need cooking , so long as things are substituted ( like sugar for sugar syrup or honey ) in order to combine better , but this may well give an incorrect texture because of the change in ingredients . Therefore if the ingredients you use can be combined without being heated , it 's likely that it does n't need cooking , however you may end up with an uneven flavor . As pointed out in a comment by @ToddWilcox , there may also be constituent ingredients that do require cooking , such as garlic or onion , in order to achieve the correct flavor so that they do not taste raw . Some sauces may also specify being cooked simply to make them thicker or more concentrated , as adding thickening agents such as flour may affect the taste , particularly if it is uncooked . So whilst there are some BBQ sauce recipes that may get away with being uncooked based on their ingredients , there are others that will definitely require cooking .
Onions The more you cook an onion , the sweeter it is going to get ; heat breaks down the volatiles and complex starches and converts them to sugars . When an onion is completely brown then it is basically caramelized . The point of sweating onions is to draw out some of the pungency , but not all . If you cook them 'til they 're brown ( caramelized ) then they will be very sweet , and not really retain any of that sulfurous " onion-y " flavour at all . So it 's not really a question of how much you 're developing the flavours , it 's a question of which flavours you 're developing . The more sweetness you develop , the more of the original onion flavour you lose . In my experience , caramelized onions are rarely used as an " ingredient " - they 're more of a garnish or side dish , since they would n't really impart any significant flavour to the main dish . Celery and other aromatics These do n't undergo the same drastic flavour changes that onions do , but the principle is the same : You sweat them to draw out moisture and aromas without starting a Maillard or caramelization reaction . The key is that sweating is a preparation step . Yes , frying/saut éing these for longer would develop more flavour ( or at least more of a certain kind of flavour ) , but you do n't want to do that too early , since they 're going to sit in the pan for a while longer ; sweating means softening them up slightly without eliminating all of the aromas or the natural crunchy texture . You generally do n't brown vegetables during the preparation of a recipe ; you only do that if you plan to eat them by themselves without any further cooking . If you brown them , then continue to cook , you will turn them into mush and possibly burn them , and there 's no way to fix it after that happens .
... as long as it needs to , depending on a wide variety of factors . You can shape it for baking , put it in the fridge , let it rise , pull it out of the fridge and put it in the oven - no warming up time at all . If you are going to punch down/knead/form after it comes out of the fridge , you can do all that cold , and let it rise as long as it needs to before baking - which will depend on the dough and the room temperature . Or you can let the bulk dough warm a while .
Which could mean one thing for sure . The density and weight of the grams which float is way too lower than the ones that sink . Which means , there is a possibility that it is hollow inside , because of some bug infestation or small worms/bugs gotten inside them , eaten them making it hollow . Else the natural weight if the gram is practically very low , and the growth is incomplete. , Former being the most probable cause . If would examine the lot for any worms/bugs to ensure that 's not the case . If proved clean , and the number of floating grams is much less , then I will just ignore and use . On the other hand , it there proves to be bugs/worms in the lot , the better option is just to discard them to be safe . Because , pulses and lentils infested with bugs mostly no longer taste the same . Thanks . Hope it helped .

Which sugar for brining ?
For a brine , no it does n't really matter , except that granulated sugar will dissolve more nicely than raw sugar . The sugar is for flavor more than anything else , though it does help the brine some . It also promotes browning of the meat . If you change one kind of sugar for another , I 'd use a 1:1 swap by weight rather than volume so you do n't have to worry about crystal sizes . Though the sugar does help the brining action some , the salt is the important component . From <URL> : How does brining work ? Brining promotes a change in the structure of the proteins in the muscle . The salt causes protein strands to become denatured , or unwound . This is the same process that occurs when proteins are exposed to heat , acid , or alcohol . When protein strands unwind , they get tangled up with one another , forming a matrix that traps water . Salt is commonly used to give processed meats a better texture . For example , hot dogs made without salt would be limp . In most cases , we add sugar to the brine . Sugar has little if any effect on the texture of the meat , but it does add flavor and promotes better browning of the skin .
Depends on how fine you have shaved the rind/zest , you can consider candying it ( boil it in syrup till it become very transparent ) or dip it in chocolate after candying it . if it is too fine , then add it into your next chocolate recipe to get orange-flavoured chocolate ...
Do n't see why you ca n't make oaked meat . Corned beef and salt pork have been around for a long time . The ' corn ' referred to is n't actually corn , but is rock salt . Here is a good starting point if you want to make oaked , corned beef which does n't require refrigeration : <URL> In the above article it specifically mentions barrels for storing the salted meat . Try google with [ salting meat ] . Having read some research some years ago regarding the propagation of bacteria on artificial ( plastic ) and natural ( wood ) cutting boards , and the large difference in the ability of bacteria to grow on these two mediums , wood being by far the most bacteria resistant , it would seem at least prudent and in your case , desirable , to use wood containers . Oak barrels are available in many sizes and you should be able to order them with removable covers with a bit of inquiry . There is plenty of oak , in many forms , commercially available . The explosion of wineries has produced many caterers to the makers of that product . Here is a source for oak chips : <URL> Here is another source for all types of oak , including barrels : <URL> If you do n't want to make the commitment of barrels , months long curing and the space requirements for same , you could simply buy some winery chips , brine your meat in the refrigerator with oak chips between layers of meat or surrounding a piece of meat . Have fun !
From <URL> : When you clean the fish , remove the skin and any dark-colored flesh . This part of the fish is especially strong tasting and somewhat oily . Check out these fish recipes to learn to cook bluefish . Also see <URL> for advices on improving the flavor ( e.g. soak it in milk ) .
Common names of plants are a very unclear matter . There are big differences not only between languages , but also regional differences within a single language . There are lots of ( closely related ) plants which are sold under the name blueberry . And probably not even the person who grew ( or gathered ) them can tell you the exact species . While it does matter when it comes to jam ( for the same reason it matters whether you use Roma tomatoes or Cherry tomatoes for a sauce ) it is highly improbable to find a source which can consistently provide you with a specific known variety . Also , you probably have to study some very specified botanical literature and be provided with parts of the plant other than the berries in order to be able to identify the type with some degree of accuracy . On the other hand , do n't let that come in the way of good jam . Blood orange marmelade may taste different than bitter orange marmelade , but both are good . The same goes for blueberries : you can use any variety , even if some of them would be a bit better on their own . What you need for a jam is a good sweetness to acid ratio , the proper amount of pectin , and as much aroma as possible . A softer texture also helps to prevent unpleasant lumps . So generally , you want to go with the ripest fruit available . They are soft , and have the fullest aroma . This is something you might want to consider with your current source of berries : maybe they 're not a special " green on the inside " variety , but only underripe . If they do n't taste very sweet , and their aroma is n't very complex , I 'd try to find other sources . Farmer 's markets and organic stores are usually able to sell much better fruits ( because they cater to a picky , price-inelastic clientelle ) , but of course they cost a lot too . Sweet fruit is always good , but you need enough sugar added for food safety . A ratio of 2:1 ( fruit to sugar ) can still be kept in the pantry , more fruit than that and you need to refrigerate the unopened glasses too . With blueburries , you 'll need to add both pectin ( to get the jam to gel ) and acid ( to get the pectin to work ) . This is the part which will vary with fruit variety : more watery types will need more pectin , and less acidic types will need more acid . If you want a good quality jam , you 'll need to do some experiments until you get the proportions right . If not , you can buy " jam sugar " or however it is called in your country - this is sugar with pectin and acid already added . It wo n't have the perfect ratio for your fruit , but it will more or less work . But then , if this quality is enough for you , you can skip buying the expensive berries and slaving at the stove , and buy manufactured jam .
There is no single ideal . More sugar and butter will mean a more crunchy crumble top ( and one that browns or burns more quickly ) , more flour will make it more sandy - they each have their place . The juicier the fruit , the sandier I like the topping to absorb some of the juice . The longer the fruit needs to cook , the more resilient to cooking the topping needs to be . And of course for a tart fruit like rhubarb , you might like more sugar in the topping to balance it - or you might just add sugar to the fruit and leave the topping alone . My goto mix is 1 cup flour , 1 cup sugar , 1/2 cup butter . But play with it a bit and vary it according to the fruit you are using - and I do n't just mean " rhubarb " or " apples " but taste a bit of today 's fruit to see how sweet it is , how soft it is , etc. .
The device is called a " panini press " and they 're available fairly small . I 've seen ones which are n't much larger than a toaster .
<URL> Sugar balances both salty and sour flavors in dishes . Adding just a little sugar makes salty things taste less salty and sour things taste less sour , without actually reducing the amount of salt or acid in the recipe . For example , the liquid base of the Pad Thai recipe I follow contains chili powder , fish sauce , tamarind , and light palm sugar . The palm sugar balances out the sour from the tamarind and the salt from the fish sauce . Without it , the noodles would come out too sour and too salty . I do n't know the physiological reasons for this . Would be interesting to hear them if someone knew ...
I think it 's more about technique than what fat you use when you 're looking for crispy outsides ( I 'm sure there is at least one question here already that has the technique answers ) . About the only solid advice I would give is that you need to find a fat that tastes good to you , or is neutral if that 's your preference , and make sure the one you use wo n't burn at the temperature you 're using . Beyond that , it 's all about taste and technique . edit : I looked for questions that might have solid technique answers , but did n't find any . So I looked out on the greater web and found some advice from Cook 's Illustrated . <URL> It does n't have the recipe for free , but the advice is good : Parcook at a fast simmer , get a little rough with the parcooked potatoes to rough up the outside , choose the right potatoes ( they liked Yukon Golds ) .
The toxin in kidney beans is destroyed by boiling for around ten minutes , which no doubt holds true for any toxin in the water as well . So there should be no problem with using the soaking water to cook the beans , provided you cook them properly .
Typically veggies are onions , carrots , celery , leeks , garlic , shallots , etc. . Throw in some peppercorns , also , and a <URL> . You can add most other veggies , too , and mushrooms , but avoid adding things that give a strong ( bad ) flavour after cooked for a long time ( broccoli , brussels sprouts , cauliflower , etc. ) .
I suggest starting with this <URL> for more information on brining . Much of what would be transferred into your turkey is liquid from the osmosis , but some salt , and sugar if you choose to use it , would be added as well . If you purchase an " enhanced " turkey that has already been injected , you do n't want to brine it . The injection has a similar effect . If you 've made an enhanced turkey in the past , you 've already eaten a bird with added sodium . <URL> states that the turkey will gain 10 % of its weight in a combination of water and sodium . Your brine comes out to about 3.9 % salt , so your 12 lb turkey will gain ( ( 12 lbs * .1 ) * .039 ) = .0486 lbs = 21 grams of salt from a 3.9 % brine . Your average soda has 55 milligrams of salt per serving . The total amount of salt from your brine will be spread over the entire turkey , so divide that amount by the number of servings you expect that turkey to provide to get the number of additional milligrams of sodium per serving of turkey from brining . If at the end of the day you do n't want to brine , in that same article McGee also suggests a way to keep turkey moist without a brine . EDIT : I did my math wrong above , and have corrected the formula and results .
Heavier limes tend to be more juicy , but another important factor is the color and texture of the skin . Look for the brightest green ( sometimes with almost a yellow tinge ) and smoothest skin you can find . Many bumps or shriveled looking areas are good indications that there will be less juice . If that 's all that 's available in your store , though , just get more of them . If they have broken skin , I always avoid those . I 've gotten them home and found that even if there 's juice , at least the section near that break has gone dry and sometimes discolored , definitely a waste of my money and time . Another thing I 've found helpful , which can be done easily in the grocery store , is a smell-test . ( This also works with lemons , which to me are just as confusing . ) When very juicy , the skin has a scent , which may be subtle , but definitely different than those with none . It 's one sign of freshness , similar to knowing when to pick them from the tree . As Josh Caswell said in his excellent answer about pith , there 's nothing wrong with rolling them around in your hand in the store ; not enough to damage the lime of course , but enough to warm them up just a bit so they 'll release some juice and a nice smell . I do n't know where you 're from , but in Massachusetts , in the Northeastern United States , the produce department is often quite cold , so I do that with all my citrus choices . <URL> has some good pictures and information , and even mentions using them for cocktails ! <URL> gives the same basic information , with a video that I found helpful . To answer the question that was asked about the importance of skin thickness , it 's something I do n't generally think about when I shop , so I did some research . Most sites did n't mention it , especially with the common lime which is the most popular variety , but there is <URL> that does recommend choosing a thinner skinned fruit . They should feel firm and heavy for their size , because heavy limes will produce the most juice . Select limes with thin skins , avoiding the thicker skinned fruit , which is an indication of less flesh and juice . I know you did n't specifically ask , but just to add that if you have limes at home and you 're not getting the maximum effortless , free-flowing juice , you can microwave them for about 20 seconds . It helps release the juice , and works for other citrus fruits too . I 'd watch carefully , because I 've overheated my fruit doing that . It 's fine if I 'm going to use it for cooking or in my hot tea , but for cold drinks and things you then have to wait for it to cool off , which may be more effort than you need .
Pure glucose is significantly thicker than a sugar syrup you would make on your own . It 's even thicker than honey . At the previous restaurant I was at , we would use glucose in some limited applications when making certain kinds of caramel sauces ( sorry , I did n't steal any recipes before I left ) , as ( if I recall correctly ) it has a higher tolerance for heat , and provides sweetness without caramelizing at the same temperatures as table sugar .
I use Propane all the time . There are several factors as to why : It is cheap , about 1/4 the price of butane . It 's more readily available . You can buy a propane torch at many different stores for very cheap . The torches typically put out a lot more heat . I 've used both propane and butane , mostly for crème brulee , but other food as well . The butane torches put out such a focused small area of heat , that it would get uneven burning . Whereas with Propane , they often put out a much larger area of heat , making it easier to caramelize across the surface evenly . As for the concern of it imparting propane flavor , I have had that happen , once , but I 've also had that happen with butane . It 's all about flow control . If you have the dial turned up too high and it 's spewing out massive amounts of propane , plus hold the flame too close to the food , you MIGHT get then hint of propane . But if you have the torched dialed in to the proper settings , you really ca n't beat the ease and convenience of " energy-efficient clean-burning propane gas "
No , sugar will never turn sour after long cooking , no matter how long you cook it . This must be some myth . If you take your sugar beyond caramel and into a burned stage , it can become acrid with a faintly sour taste . But this can not happen as long as there is any moisture in your food . The whole content of the pot will have to be a single black lump of charcoal before this occurs . It is not possible for the dissolved sugar in the soup to burn to this stage . Peter Taylor 's suggestion is interesting . In any fermentation process , sugar will be turned into acid . But cooking temperatures are way too high for a fermentation . You 'd have to keep the food for hours below 45 Celsius to sustain a bacterial or yeast colony ; it would flourish at even lower temperatures , around 37 Celsius , giving you obvious fermentation effects . This is a temperature which many people would find not hot enough for a bathtub , less alone to cook a soup . If the myth was born from this effect , it must come from a tradition in which the beans were soaked in warm water for hours , then cooked for a shorter time at higher temperatures , instead of being cooked all the time . There are other ingredients which should be added at the end , for example fresh herbs . They are likely to lose their flavor , not turn sour or something else . But this does n't apply to sugar , which has no aroma to speak of . Sugar also does n't get inverted by cooking . It stays as a single molecule ( sucrose ) until it starts reacting into more exotic stuff , undergoing complicated irreversible chemical reactions and turning into caramel . Inverting the sugar ( = breaking it into glucose and fructose ) is possible , but can not be done by temperature , it needs acid or seeding . Even if you were to invert some sugar with acid , it would 1 ) happen almost instantly , and 2 ) any sour taste will be due to the acid you used . Glucose and fructose are both sweet and not sour at all . So , if your sugar is getting inverted in the soup ( which will happen if you are already using other sour ingredients - but I ca n't imagine why you 'd do it if you want to avoid a sour taste ) it is not making it sour . So , I ca n't know what associations created this sugar-turns-sour myth , but it is n't true .
Sugar acts as a stabilizer in the heating process of eggs . It acts as a bit of " insurance " to keep the eggs from curdling under the moderate heat during the cooking process . It is a necessary component in making citrus curds .
Baking paper has a silicone coating to prevent sticking . If yours is only coated on one side ( the waxy side ) , this side should touch the food .
Your question seems to be conflating the question of bag vs boxed brown sugar with the question of " Brownulated " light brown sugar vs. regular light brown sugar . Brownulated pours like white sugar , but turns into a paste when it gets damp or wet . I think it tastes funny . Boxed vs Bag sugar is just a matter of storage and convenience . It 's the same sugar .
Both refined sunflower oil and refined soybean oil are generally considered flavorless . Also included among these are : Canola ( rapeseed ) oil Corn oil Peanut oil Safflower oil Vegetable oil The most reliable method of course is to taste the oil :) . I 'm sure you can actually taste the flavor of extra virgin olive oil .

Replacement for pop rocks ?
Sorry for taking your time , everyone . It turns out a visit to the candy store was all I needed . They 've got the original Pop Rocks .
Out of personal experience and out of personal taste I 'll give you the following : If you like it moist 55 degrees C for 4 hours . If you like it to feel like steak : cook it like steak . If you like your meat to feel more like fish cook it like steak for 20 minutes . Then drop the temperature by 10 degrees C.
Let 's do some physics again : All culinary aspects aside , a roast is a ( more or less ) solid " blob " with a certain mass and volume . To get the roast to the desired doneness , you want to reach a certain temperature at the center of the meat . The crucial properties are the <URL> and <URL> of your meat or , very simply put , how fast your meat transports the oven heat towards the center of your roast , which again is calculated on oven heat and starting temperature of your meat . This depends on geometry , or , the maximum thickness of your meat . Hence the rule to stick your meat thermometer in the thickest part of your meat . Two ducks next to each other are two separate masses , which heat up independently , not one roast of greater thickness : Two ducks in your oven need basically the same time as one duck of the same size . ( A good oven should be capable of heating enough that the second duck wo n't lower the temperature significantly . ) Now to the practical points : For the reasons discussed above , it is easiest if you choose two ducks of about the same size and weight . If not , one will need less time than the other and you might have to take one bird out of the oven sooner . If both shall be done at the same time , the smaller one needs to go in a short while after the bigger one - how much time difference is very hard to say , even with those handy " roasting time by weight " charts in cookbooks or on the Internet : Use a thermometer , not a timer , to determine doneness . ( And do n't forget that the core temperature will rise a few degrees even after you have taken the bird out . ) You ask about positioning in a conventional oven : By all means roast your birds side by side , not one above the other . Stacked , they will be very close to the top or bottom heating element , which will at least dry them out but more likely burn the top or bottom , while shielding the other bird from the heat on one side . Even if you switch positions occasionally ( do you really want to juggle hot pans ? ) , you get the same effect of a " burned-but-undercooked " bird . And no , foil will not prevent this . And just because we repeat it again and again : Do not determine the doneness of your roast by a watch , use a meat thermometer .
You could whip your own cream . Use 1/3 of the amount of heavy cream as cool whip , and whip with a splash of vanilla extract and a pinch of sugar to taste , either by hand or with a mixer . If a recipe calls for 1 cup of " whipped topping " , you would start with 1/3 cup of heavy cream which whips up to 1 cup .
As a substitute for untoasted sesame oil , most light oils will work ( light olive , peanut , canola , sunflower , etc ) . Any nut or seed oil should be pretty close . Toasted sesame oil has a much bolder and nuttier flavor . It could perhaps be approximated with a light oil and adding toasted sesame to your dish .
I assume we are talking about a variety of the Eastern European treat called Oblatne ( or a variety of that name ) ? Which consists of five to eight layers of store-bought wafers ( not " waffles " - in some languages it 's the same term for both , I know ) , " glued together " by a fatty or caramelly cream , pressed for a few hours and cut into little diamonds ? Like below : <URL> <URL> There are two main methods to create the cream , one based on condensed milk , dulce de leche or caramel , the other on butter , margarine or shortening . Often with an addition of nuts , chocolate and a dash of alcohol . Often , some raw eggs are included as well , so take the appropriate measures for these recipes . The common trait is low humidity in the filling , because otherwise the wafers become soggy and - worst case - could even disintegrate . Recipe requests are off-topic here , but a creative use of the terms wafer , cake , country of origin or some neighboring country , oblatne or oblate and your preferred filling ingredients in your favourite seach engine should set you off in the right direction .
The way restaurants do it is simple , straightforward , and also very easy to make organic by using organic ingredients . Standard 3-bowl breading 1 ) Bowl One : Seasoned flour -- flour , salt , pepper , and seasonings ( for me : thyme , paprika , cayenne , garlic powder , onion powder , and parsley flakes ) 2 ) Bowl Two : Egg wash -- Beaten egg with a 1-2 TBSP milk per egg yolk added 3 ) Bowl Three : Panko ( or other bread crumbs ) -- alternately , add some salt , pepper , and seasonings to them Procedure : Dredge the item to bread through the bowls in order , then repeat if desired to build up a thicker layer . You only need to change your seasonings to switch from breading chicken , fish , or even doing fried green tomatoes . If you make your own bread and breadcrumbs , the ingredient list will read : flour , water , milk , eggs , yeast , salt , and spices . Hard to get more straightforward than that ! It 's simple , fast , and works beautifully every time . Here 's why it 's the best way : the flour sticks to the wet surface of your item , leaving a dry , starchy surface for the egg wash to adhere to . The egg wash allows the panko to stick . For the next layer , the flour fills in the gaps between bread crumbs and absorbs residual moisture from the egg wash .
It is absolutely worth adding ground pork or veal . I usually use a leaner ground steak and compensate with a fatty ground pork ( shoulder is good ) - fat = flavour . Another tip is to take your time . Many people try and cook bolognese in half an hour , but considering ground meat is usually made with tougher cuts , you end up with tough meat and under-developed flavours . Use plenty of onions and garlic , brown your meat well , use good wine , stock , tomatoes and herbs ( thyme , rosemary and bay ) and gently simmer that bad boy for at least 3 hours . For ultimate flavour , cook it the day before and let the flavours marry overnight .
Sumac is commonly used a tart flavoring element in the eastern Mediterranen region . Historians believe that it was the common sour element in cooking for that area prior to domestication of lemons . It is a characteristic seasoning element in Fatoush , a Syrian bread salad . It 's not usually available in the mainstream spice section of most grocery stores . The best place to locate it is in mid-eastern markets , delis , upscale stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca or online through P <URL> or the <URL> .
The problem with using the non-ground pearls is that they do n't always fully dissolve . <URL> they can be pulverized or ground in a grinder or by mortar and pestle and used similarly to the starch . However , there are pearls which are instant and those that are not . With instant tapioca you can substitute 1:1 , with regular tapioca pearls , pulverized , it would be 2:1 . As for , they are good as a thickening agent assuming that you are okay with little gelatinous balls in whatever you are making . Rice and tapioca puddings spring to mind ; there are uses of it in curries and stews for its thickening prowess ; also it can be used as a gluten free thickening agent in place of flour . If you run out of corn starch or arrow root you can also turn to the pulverized stuff . Same rules apply ; <URL> . However , do not bring to a boil or you will end up over-cooking the starch .
When I freeze tomatoes , the main thing I worry about is getting the skin off . To do this , score the bottom with an X , then blanch . After cooling in ice water , pull the skin off . I have n't ever worried about the details you mention , or about cutting them up , and I have had great success .
Given the science as Kenji Alt explained it in his article , the key fact of the vodka is that it is 80 proof , or 40 % alchohol . So beer , which usually is on the order of 4 to 6 percent alcohol ( yes , there are outliers ) will not have the same level of inhibition of the gluten formation . The vodka is not the only factor in the recipe leading to crispiness and good crust , so you will probably still get very good results with the beer , assuming you like the flavor profile it brings to the wings , but it wo n't be quite the same . If you use another liquer that is on the order of 80 proof , again assuming you like the flavor profile , you should get quite similar results . This would include mixing grain alcohol with water or orange juice or whatever to the appropriate ratio . Other than some white wine for cooking , though , I do n't buy spirits so I do n't what would be more economical -- and that might vary from region to region .
Use a carbon-steel wok ! The shape works very well to keep the unpopped kernels in the hot oil , while the popped kernels end up on the cooler sides . I usually use about 2 T of oil and 1/3 c of popcorn to make enough for two people . If you want to keep with the Chinese theme , Szechuan peppercorn-salt goes extremely well on popcorn ! To make it , grind Szechuan peppercorns and kosher salt in a spice grinder .
The USDA recommendation for a safe internal temperature is 165 degrees for chicken . The breast , being leaner , should n't be cooked to any higher than that or it will dry out and be tough . The thigh can be cooked to a slightly higher temperature ( 165-175 ) . That is the Kitchen Network 's preference for taste and texture ( <URL> ) . Getting the thigh to a slightly higher temperature ( and keeping it there for longer ) helps the collagen break down , which will make it more tender and taste more moist .
I 've had the same problem once . The first substitute is <URL> . But they 're not easy to find either . The second one is using <URL> . Tamales will be done in the same time and you could eat the leaf if you want . I 've tried it once and it came out great . Here it 's a recipe for <URL> . Here it is a graphic <URL> . They are written in Spanish , let me know if you need a translator ;) PS . My mexican mother in law used to do it with chard .
As stated by Logophobe below , you can of course substitute ingredients as you like . I personally find subbing beef for lamb or vice versa a bit risky though . Lamb in general has a much milder taste of itself and thus requires a sauce and other accompanyments that do not overpower the taste of the meat . In your case this could mean that the sauce will be too weak as an accompanyment to beef . In a case such as this and not knowing the actual recipe I would suggest replacing the Pinot Noir with a somewhat more fragrant red wine ( a new world Merlot low on tannines should do nicely ) . You could also make the sauce more rounded by adding some crushed juniper berries . Should you want to stick to your original recipe , you might try just reducing the sauce a little more than you usually would .
The problem is that there are different types of olive oil that are used for dramatically different purposes . A high quality ' cold pressed extra virgin ' oil often has fruity notes that are destroyed when you heat it , but is great for drizzling over things at the last minute , or cold applications such as salad dressings ... but note that the US labeling laws are lax , so something labeled as ' extra virgin ' in the US may not qualify as such in Europe . For most cooking , I use a good grade olive oil ( ' virgin ' , but not ' extra virgin ' ) for cooking with , not the extremely expensive stuff . For frying , there 's ' extra light ' olive oil which has a higher smoke point but little to no flavor on its own . It 's refined to such a point that you might be better off just going with any neutral flavored oil ( canola/rape , soy , corn , etc. ) Price depends on a lot of things , and a lot of it 's marketing and worthless -- if you can , I 'd look for other signs of quality ... like if there 's a packing date . Older oil is more likely to have deteriorated , and in a worst case , have gone rancid . ( more likely if it 's in a clear glass bottle ... if you 're buying large amounts of oil , keep it out of sunlight , or even better , buy it in a can ) Note that packing dates can also be cheated -- they might press the oil , then hold it for months before it 's actually bottled for sale . Also beware of ' blended oils ' . This is when they cut olive oil with something less expensive , but still try to pass it off as ' olive oil ' . ' Imported from Italy ' is another suspect label , as it might be foreign olives that were sent to Italy before being imported . ( but there 's nothing wrong with non-Italian olives ... the Greeks and Spanish make some great olive oils , and we 're starting to see more <URL> ) . ... Also note that olive oil can be classified like wines -- some companies might press a single variety of olive ( eg , Kalamata , Castelvetrano ) , which can have dramatically different flavors . They might be fruity , grassy , buttery , or even peppery . Regions can also have an impact , as some areas press olives while green , and others wait until they 're black . I wo n't get into these , as that 's more a matter of personal taste .
I ca n't speak specifically to the shelf life of salami , especially considering all of the factors that come into play ( source , type , age , storage , etc. ) , but when dealing with meat in general , you should never eat it if it smells or tastes " off " . Smell is really the most reliable means of determining whether or not meat is still good - far more reliable than the use-by date . It 's unusual for meat to smell or taste sour as a result of foodborne bacteria ; sourness is more likely to be due to rancidity of the fats , which is of course equally dangerous , albeit in a different way . Oxidation is very likely if the meat was not properly wrapped and/or stored in an airtight container . Of course , many people have trouble telling the difference between spoilage due to rancidity and spoilage due to bacteria , and so what you 're perceiving as rancid ( sour ) may really be bacterial spoilage . Either way , if it tastes off , it 's spoiled ; do n't eat it .
You can use an old tooth-brush it will give better results
Every substitution is probably going to require other alterations . Baking soda 's effects extend beyond leavening : it generally reacts with acidic ingredients ( making the batter less sour ) and also provides sodium ions which can affect flavor . If the substitute does n't react with acid as strongly , you may need to decrease acid ingredients or substitute neutral ingredients to obtain the same flavor ( e.g. , milk instead of buttermilk or yogurt , regular cream instead of sour cream ) . If the substitute does n't have sodium , sometimes adding a bit of salt may be necessary . As for the leavening action itself , any substitute will introduce its own issues in adapting . Unless you 're experienced with this sort of thing ( or like to " experiment " and possibly have cakes that fail in various ways ) , I would generally recommend finding a cake recipe that has leavening agents you actually have on hand , rather than trying a substitute . There are really only two common substitutions that often wo n't affect texture or flavor in major ways : ( 1 ) Potassium bicarbonate - can usually be substituted 1:1 for baking soda , but is generally tougher to find than baking soda . ( Look sometimes for it at drugstores ; baking soda itself can often be found as " sodium bicarbonate " or some other name in other countries at drugstores too . ) Without the sodium ions , you may need to add a bit of salt , roughly 1/4 or 1/3 of the amount of baking soda will be sufficient for flavor . ( 2 ) Baking powder - also often harder to find in other countries than baking soda . Also , other countries may have other formulations than what is found in the U.S. For standard U.S. baking powder , you 'd generally use 2-4 times the amount of baking soda in the recipe . The reason for this inexact ratio is a trade-off in flavor vs. reactivity . If you want the same reactivity with acidic ingredients , you 'd need 3-4 times more baking powder , but this often results in a " baking powder flavor , " sometimes described as " metallic . " But if you decrease the amount to avoid this flavor -- maybe twice as much as baking soda -- you wo n't react with as much acid , so you probably would want to reduce the amount of acidic ingredients in the batter . For baking powder outside the U.S. , you 'd need to look up the exact formulas/mixtures used and perhaps make further alterations . ( I 'm not going to go into the less common chemical alternatives -- like baker 's ammonia -- which are even less common for baking today . And I 'm not even going to bother with possibilities like homemade potash from wood ashes , which theoretically can provide some leavening . If you 're in a country where you 're that desperate for chemical leaveners , I 'd doubt you 'd have access to basic baking materials . ) Unfortunately , as mentioned , these two options are generally less common to find exact equivalents than baking soda . So , we move onto less reliable options that will require further recipe modification . ( 3 ) Egg whites as leavening - separate eggs and beat whites separately , generally to soft or medium peaks . Usually , fold into batter at the last moment ( generally in stages , first mixing in a portion of the egg whites more thoroughly to lighten , then gently folding in the remainder ) and bake immediately . This will only work by itself with relatively light cakes that do n't have a lot of heavy ingredients . Adding a small amount of sugar toward the end of beating may have a stablizing effect and prevent early collapse of a cake . Cream of tartar or a very small amount of other acids like lemon juice or vinegar can also prevent overbeating . ( Note that even if eggs are not separated , beating whole eggs or yolks until light colored will add in small amounts of air . ) ( 4 ) Creaming method - ignore recipe instructions and begin by creaming butter and sugar together until fluffy , often requiring at least 10 minutes of steady beating with a mixer for maximum results . ( By hand , this generally would be done for an hour or more traditionally . ) This will trap air bubbles that will ultimately leaven the batter ( the traditional method for pound cakes ) . This works better than egg whites alone for heavier batters ( e.g. , with more flour and/or butter ) , but it still will result in a denser cake than one with baking soda . Generally , continue after creaming butter and sugar by adding eggs one at a time while mixing vigorously , then fold in other ingredients more gently toward the end . ( If the recipe calls for a liquid sugar , like molasses or honey or whatever , substitute with dry sugar for more creaming action . ) ( 5 ) Yeast - there are <URL> devoted to the problems of converting a chemically leavened cake into a yeast-leavened one . Yeast is probably the only way to actually get the same volume without baking soda or other chemical leaveners , but it will usually change the cake texture significantly . Basically , yeast cakes tend to be tougher and more bread-like , while chemically leavened cakes tend to go for a softer cru

What animal parts can be included in head cheese ?
To address this , I think we should examine why head cheese is made from a head in the first place . There are two main reasons , the character of the meat attached to the head : paucity , toughness , and ( lack of ) accessibility ; and the large amount of gelatin that can be obtained . The meat on a head is well-exercised , and , with the exception of cheeks and jowl , thin , full of connective tissue , and wrapped around an oddly-shaped skull . It 's difficult and not exactly worth the effort to try to remove it raw ; after a good deal of work , you would end up with small shreds of meat that would probably best be braised anyways . Much easier to braise the head in its entirety and pick off the meat once it 's soft . The potential for gelatin is abundant in a head , especially assuming that the skin is left on ( which it is for pig 's heads ) : the skull of course contains plenty of albumen , the ears and snout are made of cartilage , and there 's tendons around the jaw and heading into the neck . Considering this , to make a substitution for a head , we should look for other parts of the animal that have these characteristics . The most obvious choice is the lower legs : pig trotters are in fact often added to the pot when making head cheese . Shanks all the way down to the ankles , and clean hooves from other animals , if available , would be perfectly suitable . The chicken feet you mention have the characteristic of yielding a good amount of gelatin , so they are a candidate . Tails are also a fine source of gelatin , with skin and plenty of connective tissue . Skin on its own would also be useful . For the meat , any of the usual well-exercised cuts should be suitable ; a jowl on its own , the shoulder , possibly a diaphragm ( hanger ) from a cow . In fact , one could very well make a delicious head cheese-like terrine using commercially-prepared gelatin with a full homemade stock , and any flavorful cut of meat that was available .
Well , it looks like I found my answer : <URL> is used for creating <URL> . Field corn includes a few types of corn ( dent , flour , flint , waxy ) . I 'm not sure if all types of field corn are used for masa de maíz , however . So , if anyone has a more specific answer , feel free to give it . I 'm guessing really any kind of corn could be nixtamalized , however ( but some kinds may be more ideal than others ) . Other kinds of grain besides corn can also be nixtamalized .
Try watered down cream , as you 'll still get some of the milkfat , but you do n't want quite as much . Water would probably also work for your crepes , although it would change the taste .
Buy the packaged crescent rolls and roll a slice of cheese in each roll before you bake it ... just in time for Thanksgiving ! Alternately , you can roll it with a slice of meat and mini flat breads for a quick snack .

There is some very useful information for you in <URL> . The direct answer is , every time you re-heat and cool the entire pot , you 're passing through the " danger zone " ( 40-140 ° F or 4-60 ° C ) where bacteria will continue growing . Even if you manage to kill all of them , this is a problem because : Some bacteria leave behind harmful protein toxins that can not be " killed " ( denatured ) by cooking . Cooking food is only effective against live organisms , not their toxic waste products . So yes , there is a very real risk . To reduce this risk as much as possible , you 'll want to follow the alternate method you describe of only re-heating the amount that you want to eat at any given time . That 's also desirable because : If you bring the entire pot back up to boiling each time , you 're continuing to cook it . Besides the risk of contamination , that will also affect the quality and palatability of the stew because it will be drastically overcooked after just a couple repetitions . It 's a lot more efficient to apply just the heat needed to re-heat a small portion than it is to re-heat a larger amount that you 're just going to let cool back down anyway . Also , keeping your stew in the pot may be undesirable , especially if it has acidic ingredients like tomatoes , which can react with a metal pot ( particularly aluminum ) and give your stew a faintly metallic taste . Do yourself a favor and do n't try to to take this shortcut . It 's a bad idea for a number of reasons . Pack the stew into individual servings instead and keep them refrigerated until you 're ready to eat them .
I think you mean " Can brussels sprouts be eaten raw ? " as in without cooking . The short answer is yes , though they will be a lot like little cabbages . You do n't need to boil them , either . I like to sauté them in butter in a skillet , then cover them , and let them steam a bit ; I serve them with salt and pepper . Cook them until they are bright green , but not too long to make them grayish green .
Stock is made from bones only and broth is the liquid that meat has been simmered in . A well made stock should be clear without particles or cloudiness . Broth will usually be somewhat cloudy due to containing more dissolved proteins . Bones for lamb stock ( and any brown stock - veal can be made white or brown but lamb is usually brown ) are typically first roasted . The roasting will melt fat that may still be intact . After roasting bones for stocks such as lamb , veal , and duck you would then remove the bones from the roasting pan and roast the vegetables . You can use the residual fat for coating the vegetables prior to roasting . ( Just put vegetables in roasting pan and toss to coat with the fat ) . Fat from the bones will congeal on the top once the stock is chilled and you can then easily remove it . I would n't add or purposely leave chunks of fat attached to the bone as you just have to remove it later but what is there is n't a problem .
During my younger days working in restaurants I have grated many pounds of cheese using a ' meat grinder ' ( or rather the meat grinder attachment for a hobart stand mixer ) ... I have also used my home Kitchen Aid meat grinder for cheeses ( cheddar , jack and mozzarella mostly ) . So , it depends on the grinder and the attachments you have but yes it can be done . You want a fine grinder plate and cold cheese ( so it stays together better ) . You probably also want to be doing a " serious quantity " as the set up/tear down/clean up will be an endeavor . If your having friends and family over for a Mexican Fiesta , perfect . If you are making a quick plate of nachos ... OVERKILL . . For a few burgers , do it once and decide for yourself if you want to do it again . It wo n't be bad for the grinder It wo n't be bad for the cheese Expect Leftovers ... ( note : IMHO near frozen mozzarella for lasagna is a perfect place to use a grinder for cheese ... )
Brunost is often used in Norwegian cooking , especially in brown sauces . E.g. <URL> . I have personly used brunost for such a recipe , and it does add a very nice flavor to the sauce . <URL> , from Tine the biggest maker of brunost in Norway ) Hope this helps , Best wishes from Norway !
Ah , you missed the obvious : pumpkin ! This is biologically a fruit , actually , as is the zucchini . Pumpkin loves same spices as carrot . Maybe even rum or butterscotch too . Now , beetroot is a veg and colors cakes delectably ; perhaps why it was originally added when going stingy on the cocoa . How about parsnip next ? Sweet and nutty , I think pistachios would complement it well in a recipe borrowed from zucchini bread . more veg here : <URL> p.s. if you have n't guessed Rabarber is rhubarb
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
Do n't know what the flavor profile of the shredded beef , but a nice flavorful hummus ( Sabra is my favorite brand ) is one of my favorite alternates to mayonnaise in beef sandwiches . Sounds unusual , but it 's a great textural and flavor compliment .
Citric acid and sodium hexametaphosphate are often used in processed cheese as emulsifier . These <URL> improve the protein 's swelling capacity and emulsification and thus inhibits the leakage of water or fat from the product ( forms <URL> ) .

When you want to freeze things so that they do n't stick together , you need to freeze them separately and then combine later . So , for example , if you 're freezing blueberries , you can freeze them on a cookie sheet and then combine them in one bag or container . For chicken , I would n't advise freezing the pieces uncovered ( as you do for blueberries ) . Instead , I would package the pieces in containers that only hold one meal 's worth . You can always defrost more than one package if necessary . This could be a plastic container or wrapped individually in plastic wrap or aluminum foil , or even a zippered plastic bag . Any of these would allow you to unwrap individually and defrost .
Wikipedia , as well as all 12 serbian recipes I found specify full-fat white brine cheese ( cow or sheep milk ) . Only one of them called for a type of cream in addition to the cheese . In Western Europe , Turkish groceries can carry typical Balkan white brine cheese . If you do n't have access to one , buy feta . Cow and sheep cheese are considered substitutes in Balkan cuisine - the cooks are aware that they have a difference in flavor , but they use what they have at hand , similar to the way that an apple recipe will call for crisp apples , but wo n't specify Pink Crisp or Elstar apples . So both cow and sheep feta will do in principle . But I have noticed that supermarkets sometimes carry expensive real Greek feta , which is high quality , and only cheap western-made cow feta-style cheese , which is of inferior quality and has a rubber texture . If you are not sure of the quality , go for the real imported feta ( which will be sheep ) , not the feta-style .
There is n't anything that is necessarily " bad " or should always be avoided in stock , but some ingredients have qualities you wo n't always want . Dark greens ( spinach , kale , etc ) can make a stock bitter and of course greenish in color . Cabbage also can impart a overwhelming bitterness . Potatoes can cloud a stock from their starchiness , so they are not good when you want clear stock for something like a soup or consomme . Tomatoes may overpower flavors in a light stock , but are a critical component in most dark stocks ( browning tomato paste improves the color ) Onion skins add a deeper flavor , but yellow or red skins can change the color of a light colored stock dramatically . Skin and extra fat from the meat used is sometimes avoided to reduce the amount of skimming required later on ( I personally do n't skim , the extra fat does n't bother me ) The bones of very oily fish ( mackerel , salmon , and trout for example ) are usually avoided because they can make a stock too strong in specific flavors to work in any other dish . Oily fish stocks also tend to have an unpleasant odor .
Well , yes and no . A lot of recipes for semifreddo are n't truly semifreddo because they are hard frozen . Recipes like that can be fried just like ice cream . The key to fried ice cream is to hard freeze the scoops of ice cream . By definition , that is n't semifreddo , but definitions do n't seem to matter much to writers of recipes . So , if the " stuff " is hard frozen , it can be coated and fried like fried ice cream . Perhaps after being deep fried , the name " semifreddo " is more apropos .
They all seem to use different cheeses depending on the brand . The most consistent cheese is definitely mozzarella , which makes sense as it 's the default cheese on most pizzas . Second to that is some sort of hard grating cheese like Parmesan or Asiago ... which also makes sense as it 's a traditional pizza condiment . Other Italian cheeses also seem popular like fontina and provolone But non-Italian cheeses like cheddar certainly show up . Below are some examples . I do n't recommend any of these products , they just came up in web searches and specifically describe which four cheeses they use . Amy 's uses : Fontina , provolone , Parmesan , mozzarella : <URL> Frontera uses : Mozzarella , white cheddar , smoked provolone , asiago . <URL> California Pizza Kitchen uses : Mozzarella ( apparently more than one kind ) , fontina , gouda <URL> Lean Cuisine uses : low fat mozzarella , Parmesan , asiago , romano <URL>
If we 're going to define " cheese dip " as " some substance made from cheese for the purpose of dipping other food in " - which seems like the only rational definition given no other context - then I 'd have to pinpoint its origin as being fondue . <URL> , the earliest known recipe for fondue comes from the Swiss cookbook , <URL> , first published in 1699 . That predates the Arkansas claim of 1935 by at least a few centuries , if we assume that Wikipedia does indeed list the earliest source . There 's also <URL> which was supposedly brought to Mexico by the Mennonites , which would place its origin in Mexico sometime in the 1920s - assuming that the Mennonites themselves did not simply adapt the recipe from something known even earlier . I 'd have to say that the Arkansas tourism board seems to be trying to pull a fast one on us , laying claim to this " invention " . Maybe they 're defining cheese dip as the specific kind of cheese dip they came up with , which would of course be a tautology .

How to rest meat but not let it get too cold ?
Straight after it comes out of the pan it will usually be too hot to eat . Regardless of resting or not , you ca n't fully taste things which are too hot , they need to come down to a comfortable temperature before you eat them . Some things you can do to stop the meat being too cold when you serve it : You can rest the meat wrapped in foil , this will stop it from getting too cool too quickly if you are not ready to serve once its had the time to rest . you can rest it and then warm it again before you eat it , either under a hot grill for a little , or in an oven . serve it with a hot sauce which will warm the meat serve it on a warmed plate which will stop it cooling more too quickly on the table Although I think you are worrying too much about nothing IMHO . Even once rested the meat will still be at a good temperature , especially as you have not cut it yet and most of the heat will be retained in the middle of the meat .
If you whisk egg whites to much they will definitely separate . Basically you are over tightening their stretchy proteins which squeeze out all the water . You are left with useless protein fluff floating on water . The flavor and odor will not change , however . That would be a sign off spoiling and unrelated to the whisking .
The purpose - as with any cooked meat - is to let the meat firm up so it does n't release juices when you cut into it . In the case of a turkey it also helps to let it cool enough to not burn you when you are carving and eating it . Both of these goals will be met in 30 minutes to an hour . I do n't know why that chef would recommend 3 hours . At that length of time the turkey would start to approach room temperature and would be less appealing to eat as well as start the clock on the danger zone .
Moisten your hands with a clean , damp towel . This helps the rice not stick . Look at any sushi bar ; the chef will be frequently moistening their hands on such a towel .
If your question is specific about acid : Nothing . The conventional way acids work is by dissolving them in water . I even have some vague memories that it 's not technically correct to call a substance an " acid " before it has been dissolved in water - for example , pure HCl ( a gas ) is not an acid , but once it is dissolved in water , it becomes hydrochlorid acid . pH , the well-known measure for acidity , is defined as the logarithm of the number of protons swimming around in the aqueous solution - and before you dissolve the acidic substance , the protons stay firmly attached to their host molecule . I have never heard of an acid working without water being present . I am not a chemist , and maybe there is an way to get acid to work using some other polar solvent instead of water . So I do n't want to tell you that it 's absolutely impossible to have an acid without water ( although this could be the case , I just do n't know ) . But : The acid itself is by definition water-soluble . You ca n't bring acid and water two together and not get a new , weaker , acid-water solution . I ca n't think of any edible polar solvent besides water . Ethanol could qualify , but most people do n't consider 96.4 % ethanol to be " edible " . If it does n't matter to you what the other liquid is ( not an acid ) , you can easily use anything non-polar . In food , any fat will do . You could start by floating solid-fat spheres in water and then pouring them into oil . The problem here is that they will take quite a long time to dissolve ( although this can be circumvented by using warm oil ) . The other way round will work better . Take something which dissolves in water quickly , and make the hollow sphere out of it . Float it in oil . Then you 'll pour it into the water to release the fragrance . Crystals are best for dissolving rapidly in water . I think that either salt or sugar will work well for your spheres . Of course , you are left with two problems : 1 ) how to manufacture the hollow spheres , and 2 ) what fragrance to use which will not dissolve the spheres themselves . For 2 ) , you are probably looking at essential oils ( warning , use foodsafe ones , not all are ! ) . For 1 ) , you probably need some precision candy-making techniques . Update : letting food react with acid . The answer above assumed that you are really looking for stuff which will dissolve in acid . The commenters pointed out that this is not necessary , as you can let the food react with the acid instead . It 's an interesting idea , but it wo n't be easy to get done . From the major food groups , you can exclude all proteins . We are made of protein , and any acid strong enough to quickly corrode spheres of gelatin or similar will ulcerate our mouths right away . You can also exclude the sugars . They are water-soluble . The polysaccharides are a better bet . Especially the hemicelluloses should be good candidates , as they are insoluble in water , and the result of the hydrolisis is edible ( sugars and some polisaccharides ) . But they typically need very strong acids for the reaction . You might try to use a concentrated edible acid for the reaction , then dilute the result for consumption , but you 'll have to pay lots of attention to proper ratio . Also , I do n't know how you 'll manage to physically shape one of the insoluble polysaccharides into a water-tight capsule at home . The fats are also bad candidates . They are largely unimpressed by acids , in fact their most interesting reactions are with bases ( saponification , etc. ) The short unsaturated ones will probably react with an acid , but you 'll need a fairly strong one , and the result wo n't really disappear . The probably easiest way to do this is with salts . Especially the sodium salts tend to be edible and to react readily with acids . Plain old calcium carbonate sounds like a promising material , and with a bit of heating you can get it to react very quickly with acid solutions dilute enough to drink afterwards . Again , you have the problem of somehow making spheres out of it .
In <URL> , Lorenzo notes that steaks may end up raw in the center if you only leave 'em out for 10-15 minutes to come up to temperature . I recommend 30 mins , but it will probably vary on what room temperature actually is for you . From Weber 's Way To Grill , which recommends salting right when you take them out of the fridge , here 's Mr. Purviance 's take on why you should consider salting early : It 's true that salt draws moisture toward itself , but over the course of 20 to 30 minutes that 's a good thing , because the salt begins to dissolve into that little bit of moisture . When the steak hits the hot grate ... [ you ] create a delicious crust . Any moisture you might lose is well worth the flavor of that crust .
I am an Indian and we make dough for everyday bread at home . It 's easy to knead dough ; you just have to take care while adding water . Do not add all the water you have , and add water slowly and steadily . For pizza dough I follow these steps : Mix yeast in warm water , add sugar to this water . Observe this mixture - as soon as you see bubbles , it is ready to be used for kneading dough . Add oil and salt to flour along with the yeast you have prepared . I use a spoon to keep mixing the flour and add spoonfuls of water , I keep some flour handy in case I have accidentally added too much water . I keep kneading the dough gently and add water or flour as needed . This does require some practice .
It 's a simple matter of viscosity , when eggs are cold the white is less runny . When eggs are warm the white is much more runny . As for whether it is easier to separate eggs when cold or warm it depends on your method . If you use the shells to separate the white , by cracking them in half and then transferring the yolk back and forth between the halves , then I 'd say cold is a bit better because once the white starts to drip out it tends to go as a whole . With warm eggs more white will stay in the shell with the yolk . However , if you use your hands to separate the eggs , by letting the white drip between your fingers ( or using an egg separator which does the same thing ) , warm eggs work much better because the runniness allows them to flow easier . This method works fine for cold eggs too , but warm is faster . Of the two methods I prefer using my hands rather than the shell for a few reasons : Less broken yolks : It 's easier to break a yolk when using shells It 's faster : especially if your eggs are room temperature you can separate eggs twice as fast this way You can whip the whites right away : Most of the time the reason you are separating the egg whites is to whip them into peaks , and warm whites whip better than cold whites . If your eggs are warm already then you can whip them right away , if they are cold you have to wait for them to warm up A handy trick if you are separating a lot of eggs is to separate each white into a separate bowl , then putting the white into a larger bowl with the rest of them . This is so if you get a bad egg , or a yolk breaks into the white you can discard the egg and keep the rest of them .
It is almost impossible to reduce the sweetness of cookie dough once made , without further reducing the quality . The closest you could come would be to create a second batch of cookie dough ingredients with reduced sugar , and combine it with your existing dough . However , it will be difficult to achieve good integration of the two batches , and even if you do , the extra working of the first batch from the mixing will create additional gluten , making tougher cookies . In this case , you might want to try some sort of tart lemon glaze or perhaps a very bittersweet chocolate icing to compliment your cookies and reduce the impression of sweetness . On the other hand , except for butter , sugar cookies contain no expensive ingredients . It may not be worth trying to salvage this batch . In the end , this is probably a lesson learned that your particular recipe is not to your liking as is . Next time , you will want to either reduce the sugar , or use another recipe .
It is because of the way starch retrogrades . It does so in stages . The first stage needs between 1 and 2 hours , the second one a few days . You have probably seen it more clearly in starch-thickened puddings : they thicken a bit on stovetop , but are only ready to unmold after a few hours , else they wuold n't keep their shape . In a bread , the starch granules are the same way : right after baking , they contain too much moisture . Sure , if you eat the bread right away , the aroma is very good . But the texture is problematic . It gets doughy and dense at the smallest amount of pressure . Tearing instead of cutting helps a bit . And if you are at home , eating with your family , go for it and eat the tasty still-hot bread . It is especially good with soft , low-gluten breads made with AP flour with the least amount of bran ( 50 % milling grade or even less ) , my grandma would say that they " melt in the mouth " when they are hot . But if you serve bread slices to guests , or want to spread something on the bread , wait for its starch to set . On a side note , the second stage of starch retrogradation is the reason why you should use day-old bread for crumbs for thickening , and the third stage is the one which makes bread inedible . But this goes too far away from the original question .
The basis for any sort of Japanese soup dish is going to be dashi stock , a stock made of fish and seaweed . It has a much lighter flavor than chicken broth , so you might not have identified it easily . You can buy it in a powder form for convenience , and it can be sprinkled into other liquids rather than reconstituted . <URL> is for soba with a dipping sauce , but it 'll give you a good idea of the flavor profile you 're looking for : Dashi stock plus <URL> , which is made of soy sauce , mirin , and sugar ( and simmered so it 's not strongly alcoholic ) .
Wikipedia has a whole article dedicated to this question ! Various possible reasons for Bond 's preference are given ; the last paragraph in this quote seems like the most solid explanation : " Shaken , not stirred " is a catchphrase of Ian Fleming 's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond , and his preference for how he wished his martini prepared . [ ... ] Scientists , specifically biochemists , and martini connoisseurs have investigated the difference between a martini shaken and a martini stirred . The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario in Canada conducted a study to determine if the preparation of a martini has an influence on their antioxidant capacity ; the study found that the shaken gin martinis were able to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only 0.072 % of the peroxide behind , versus the stirred gin martini , which left behind 0.157 % of the peroxide . Thus a shaken martini has more antioxidants than a stirred one . The study was done at the time because moderate consumption of alcohol appears to reduce the risk of cataracts , cardiovascular disease , and stroke , none of which afflict Bond . Andrew Lycett , an Ian Fleming biographer , believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken , not stirred because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour . Lycett also noted that Fleming preferred gin and vermouth for his martini . It has also been said that Fleming was a fan of martinis shaken by Hans Schröder , a German bartender . A part of Ian Fleming 's James Bond character was based on people in his surroundings . One such influence was his friend Bernhard von Lippe-Biesterfeld , who drank his vodka martini as Bond did , always shaken , not stirred . Some connoisseurs believe that shaking gin is a faux pas , supposedly because the shaking " bruises " the gin ( a term referring to a slight bitter taste that can allegedly occur when gin is shaken ) . In Fleming 's novel Casino Royale , it is stated that Bond " watched as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink , slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker , " suggesting that Bond was requesting it shaken because of the vodka it contained . Prior to the 1960s , vodka was , for the most part , refined from potatoes ( usually cheaper brands ) . This element made the vodka oily . To disperse the oil , Bond ordered his martinis shaken ; thus , in the same scene where he orders the martini , he tells the barman about how vodka made from grain rather than potatoes makes his drink even better . Other reasons for shaking tend to include making the drink colder or as Bond called it , ice-cold . Shaking increases convection thus making the drink far colder than if it were to be stirred . Shaking is also said to dissolve the vermouth better making it less oily tasting . While properly called a Bradford , shaken martinis also appear cloudier than when stirred . This is caused by the small fragments of ice present in a shaken martini . This also brings into question the movie versions which are never cloudy . [ ... ] Through multiple letters in New Scientist 's Last Word section ( June 5 -- 11 , 2010 ) , the mystery has been solved . When Ian Fleming was writing , most vodka was produced from potatoes and potato vodka has an oily aftertaste . Today 's grain vodka has no oily aftertaste . Experimenters found that potato vodka shaken with ice tasted less oily than did potato vodka stirred with ice . From : <URL> On a side note , that Wikipedia carries weighty articles like this should be reason enough to give in to their yearly pleas for a <URL> . ;)
It 's fine as written . Combining vinegar with baking soda ( or any acid with any base ) is usually done in baking to produce gas , which can lighten the finished product . This is an icing , which is applied after the baking process ; it 's not set to capture air bubbles , so any effect would be largely temporary and more easily produced through beating . The vinegar here is intended to mimic the tangy flavor of real cream cheese . The lemon juice has the same effect , but apple cider vinegar adds a different mix of acids , better matching the flavor of the real thing .
I agree with hobodave that you 're overcooking the prawns . But , I would cook the veggies first and then let the prawns cook with them for the last 2 minutes of the veggie cooking time . One other thing I would suggest is to cut out the salting/marinade stage . The salt could be " cooking " the prawns and is most likely sucking some moisture out . You could also try reducing the amount of oil you 're using , 1 tbs in a pan should be sufficient .
I believe the goal is to get the best sear possible on each side of the meat . Moving the meat around too much could cause it to cook completely without getting a good sear on the outside . Clearly this does n't apply when doing anything " rotisserie " style , as you 're trying to do the exact opposite : slowly cook the interior of the meat without burning the outside to a crisp or unevenly . Also , see this similar question : <URL>
It is a rather long timescale , but you already made the thing . I would put it in the freezer for 24 hours , the leave it in the fridge to thaw . That should be right on target for Sunday , without having to worry about infringing any guidelines .
Yes , you would remove the peas from the pods . <URL> shows how to do it efficiently . And no , the pods are not normally eaten , although according to <URL> you can .
This is most likely referring to honey processed without any heating , often simply called raw honey , or possibly cold-extracted or cold-processed . It likely has more flavor and color preserved than commercially-processed honey ( which uses plenty of heat ) , but it may not be much different from gently heated honey . It 's not actually cold ( honey flows really slowly when cold ) , just not heated . There are two primary ways honey would have been heated during processing . First and most common , most commercially sold honey has probably been heated substantially ( perhaps up to 165F ) to help melt crystals , allow impurities to separate , and to make sure everything 's dead and safe . This definitely does affect the honey - it makes the flavor a bit more mild , and the color a bit lighter . If you 're getting honey from a very small producer ( maybe someone with a hive in their yard ) , it 's also possible that they actually heated it in order to separate the honey from the beeswax . The most effective way to get honey out of the comb is to remove the caps and <URL> to spin the honey out of the frames , but for hobbyist beekeepers without access to an extractor who do n't want to just crush and strain it , another method is to heat the comb , letting the melted wax ( it melts around 145F ) float the top for easy separation . This is pretty gentle heating , and does n't have nearly as strong an effect as the commercial processes .
I expect that you have already considered the most probable answer . For some spices , the aromatic compounds are released by some heat , but are not destroyed . Thus their effect is heightened . For other compounds , even a small amount of heat will destroy them and thus reduce their effect - see Mischa 's comment . I believe that the difference essentially lies in at what temperature a flavoursome compound starts to degrade .
You can not make good hummus from canned chickpeas , you should make it from fresh dried beans The beans need plenty of soaking and rinsing When cooking , add one tsp of baking soda per cup of beans . Baking soda chemically softens the bean proteins . Never add salt or other flavourings during the bean cooking stage Traditional hummus is somewhat coarse , but very soft ( due to baking soda ) . It is made with a minimal amount of olive oil , but drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkle of cooked , and still warm chick peas when served Restaurant hummus is often just over processed junk made in a factory with a commercial grinder ( like a peanut butter grinder ) Also , see <URL> if your chickpeas never go soft

What is the difference between Prime Rib and a Standing Rib Roast ?
I just happened across this older question and found the answers provided , including the information in the link to wikipedia to be incorrect . All Prime Ribs are Standing Rib Roasts , not all Standing Rib Roasts are Prime Rib . A " Prime Rib " is a standing rib roast , from a beef that has achieved a USDA Grade of " Prime " . Bone-In or Bone-out are separate distinctions the can be applied to any standing rib roast , regardless of grade . U.S. Prime -- This is the highest grade of beef with the most fat marbling . This meat is very tender and only accounts for about 2.9 % of all graded beef . U.S. Prime is usually reserved for high end dining establishments . Because this beef has such a high level of fat marbling , it is excellent for dry heat cooking methods . <URL> Also , technically a Prime Rib is not a ' steak ' but rather a ' slice of roast ' . If one takes a slice from a raw rib primal and grills or broils it as a steak it is a " Rib Eye " , and can also be either " bone-in " or " bone-out " . ( the use of the word ' primal ' refers to a primary cut of beef , the first cuts a butcher will use to section a beef beyond quartering , it is utterly unrelated to the word " prime " in " Prime Rib " )
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
Apple cider has two meanings , but they both start with raw , pressed juice from crushed apples . Soft apple cider ( normally just called cider ) is simply the pressed juice , bottled . It is cloudy from suspended apple particles , and turns brown from the oxidation , much as apples themselves do when cut and exposed to air . Hard apple cider is an alcoholic beverage made by allowing soft apple cider to ferment . Apple juice is essentially the squeezed juice from the apples that has been highly filtered to remove the suspended particulates . It is usually pasteurized to have a longer shelf life . UK Usage : Per ElendilTheTall , in the UK , the alcoholic beverage is called cider , and the other products are called simple apple juice . See also : <URL>
No , spices are commonly sold as " X powder " or " ground X " . As far as I can tell , they are likely the same thing . The only thing I might imagine would be different would be the size of the grind . I would imagine yes , you can substitute one for the other . eg : <URL>
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
What 's the difference between gravy , jus , sauce and coulis ? Will says ... • ' Gravy is made from the juices of oven roast meat , thickend with a starch such as corn flour . • Jus is made from the same juices that has been refined and condensed to get a clear liquid naturally thickened . • Sauce could be made from the same juices with other ingredients added such as wines or spirits to compliment the food . Sauces can be served hot or cold . • Coulis is a thin fruit or vegetable purée , used as a sauce . If the purée is too thick , you can add some water and sometimes sugar ' . Source : <URL> My personal feeling for sauces is they can be made from anything . Parsnips , Mushrooms , Celeriac etc when ' Gravy ' and ' Jus ' must have Meat juices as their base . On menu 's you 'll often see ' Gravy ' on pub menu 's where they are n't trying to sound to posh , probably using some sort of packet mix . Jus ' on French style menu 's OR people trying too hard . Finally you 'll see something like " Beef and Juniper Sauce " on my menu and many others because ... Gravy sounds too common and Jus sounds too poncy .
I 've no idea about a standard , but a 90-seat restaurant where I used to work served a veal chop intended for 2-3 people by cooking it sous vide to 130F , then finishing on the grill to medium . We could thereby get a piece of meat that would have to grill or roast for at least 45 minutes to the table in around 15 , and the sealed chops could be kept in their bags for 2-3 days . Treating a whole prime rib roast this way might be a bit difficult , but perhaps you could use smaller slices , sous vide to very rare , and finish quickly in a hot oven ( or get all French Laundry and use a <URL> on the edges ) . Or perhaps the other way around - roast , slice , seal , and keep hovering just outside the danger zone until needed , at which time you bring up to temp . A bit questionable if an inspector catches you , and a bit tough to deal with carryover , but some enterprising chef might have tried it . I would venture a guess though that this is why you do n't see too many smaller places serving prime rib . I typically see this featured as a nightly special or only in larger steakhouses , and it often seems to be gone by the time I get there .
Pasta as you know is a simple egg and flour mixture . You can add flavouring to it to give it a different spin or even a colour but at it 's root it 's just an egg dough . The different type of shapes are " meant " for different types of sauces in a traditional sense . I do n't want to imply that you MUST use one type of pasta with one type of sauce . What I 'm saying is that a particular style of noodle shape just lends itself better to certain suace types . I.E. penne , rigatoni , macaroni work really well with a sauce that needs a place to sit and hide so that each mouth full gives you the right amount of sauce to noodle ratio . Mac &amp; Cheese is a great example of this . In a soup or salad the type of pasta you choose is probably going to reflect the need of the guest and how you plan to serve the dish . With a soup you want to have a spoon that will carry the right proportions of broth , vegetables , pasta in each bite . Because of that you select a small pasta shape like orzo . However , as cooking is all about using what you have on hand , if you do n't have orzo but you have fetticini then use that but break it up first so it will work the same way . Hope that helps .
First off , the terminology issue . So , can someone please clear up this fog ? What 's the difference between Microwave and Oven and Microwave Oven ? <URL> Both terms mean the same thing : an appliance that uses microwave radiation to heat food . Cooking food in this way is called " microwaving " . An oven , on the other hand , has a heating element which heats the air inside , which then heats the food . Cooking food in this way is generally called " baking " , though there are a lot of other things ( e.g. roasting ) you can also reasonably do in an oven . So if all you have is a microwave , then all you can do is microwave ( not bake ) . And if you have an oven , then you can bake ( but of course you ca n't microwave ) . There also exist combinations , which are capable of both microwaving and baking , i.e. they have a microwave emitter and a heating element . However , remember that in the US - and thus on much of the internet - something talking about a " microwave oven " likely does not mean this combination , but simply microwave heating . Names like " convection microwave oven with grill " , " combination microwave/oven " do refer to these combinations , though . I 've also seen " speed oven " . You may sometimes have seen people referring to these combination microwave/ovens as a " microwave oven " ( I think this may be common in Indian English ) , but that 's really just imprecise language . Some sites say that a " microwave " is only for heating or re-heating cooked food . Whereas , in " microwave ovens " , you can microwave and bake . Is that true ? It sounds like in this statement , " microwave oven " is careless language , referring to a combination microwave and oven . ( It does n't make any sense at all otherwise ; the two things are the same thing , so of course you can do the same things in them . ) So the question is really , what can you do in a microwave vs an oven , or a combination microwave/oven ? It 's true that microwaves are mainly used for reheating cooked food , and it 's true that they ca n't actually bake . However , they can do a lot more than reheat food ; there are a lot of kinds of cooking besides baking . For example , microwaves are great at simmering/boiling and steaming , and it does n't matter if the food was cooked already or not . The recipes you 're talking about are probably mostly in those kinds of categories , but if you 're interested , <URL> discusses in a bit more detail what works in microwaves . The big things that you can do with ovens but not microwaves are the things that actually need the steady dry heat of baking . You ca n't bake bread or cookies or roast a chicken in a microwave . Microwaves hold in a lot of steam and do n't get terribly hot , so you ca n't generally get things to brown or crisp up . They also do n't really hold a temperature like you need for baking , they just pump more and more heat into the food .
Potato pancakes are held together , usually with egg , sometimes flour as well . Hash Browns are usually just the potato , maybe onion and seasonings .
" Filter " coffee in general , is coffee beans that have been roasted and ground and is for use in coffee making machines . This makes ' fresh ' coffee that may have a variety of qualities not found in instant - such as sweeter or more distinct flavours , etc. . " Instant " coffee is normally a coffee that has already been made ( they had the fun already ! ) and is dried ( usually through freezing ) into a dehydrated state , hence we just add water and get coffee . I would think that most people who have drunk proper ( freshly made ) coffee would prefer the flavour , quality and effects from caffeine , over that of instant . For me , instant is a back up , in case the real stuff runs out , but I feel always tastes a little woody and not as satisfying in terms of a caffeine hit . There are several coffees available now - Kenco Millicano is one - that offer both instant and some kind of coffee bean , but all I see is coffee grinds in the bottom of the cup , and not much difference in flavour .

I have a bottle of San-J Tamari ( black label ) in my fridge and the back reads : Tamari is a premium soy sauce made with more soybeans than ordinary soy sauce giving it a richer , smoother , more complex taste . Tamari has more flavor enhancing properties than salt . Add 1 tsp . ( 320 mg sodium ) instead of tsp . salt ( 590 mg sodium ) to reduce sodium intake . Stir-fry or marinate poultry , meat fish and vegetables . Add 1-2 tsp . to perk up sauces , soups , gravies and casseroles . In my experience , I use a little less tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce . As Sean mentioned , it 's definitely a bit stronger than regular soy sauce . I eyeball most of the time , but I 'd say I use 1/2 to 3/4 portion of tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce . I reach for the tamari when I want a bit more of a complex flavor on something plain like rice - when the soy sauce is to be the star of the dish , essentially . I tend to use regular soy sauce when mixing into a larger homemade sauce or where the soy sauce flavor will blend into the background because the recipe calls for so many other strong ingredients . Oh , and tamari seems to add a bit of an almost " smoky " flavor , it seems .
Yes , you can detect the difference . How much of a difference will depend on the quality of both the imitation and of the real thing . That said , it 's difficult if not impossible for me to pick out the differences in baked goods . So I keep both around , and use the ( much cheaper ) imitation stuff for baking , and the real stuff for sauces , icing , custards , milkshakes , etc. . Incidentally ... In a pinch , bourbon makes a half-decent substitute for vanilla .
I ran across a good resource while looking into duck eggs . I 'll let it speak for itself : The higher protein in Duck Eggs means they must n't be overcooked , or the whites will go tough and rubbery . Some people say they will be too tough if you completely fry them : they advise to rather partially fry them then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan , cover and let the steam moderate the heat and finish cooking them . Most people , though , seem to say they do n't notice a difference between fried chicken and Duck Eggs . Swapping Duck Eggs interchangeably in recipes for chicken eggs : some people say you ca n't ; others who substitute all the time say nonsense , it 's fine . When the Duck Egg whites are beaten they will come up a bit higher owing to the protein . They take a minute or so longer to start frothing up , but then make up for lost time . There 's a great deal more information on the page as well : <URL>
The <URL> page has an entry on this very topic . Basically , the color of the egg does not affect the egg 's flavor , nutritional value , etc. . It simply depends on the particular breed of chicken that lays the egg -- white eggs from white hens , brown eggs from brown hens . It 's also worth noting , as the ENC points out : Generally , brown hens are larger and require more feed and therefore their eggs may be slightly higher priced .
Old fashioned oats are rolled whole-grain oat kernels . In quick oats , on the other hand , the oat kernel is first cut into smaller pieces before being rolled . This makes it much easier for quick oats to absorb water than an old fashioned oat . You can visibly see the size difference . For baking quick oats can be used in place of old fashioned oats . However , if a recipe calls for quick oats , you may not get expected results using old fashioned oats . Typically , a recipe that calls explicitly for quick oats generally has too short a cooking time for regular oats to fully cook ( e.g. pancakes ) . Another thing altogether is instant oats . Do not substitute these in any recipe . Instant oats are parboiled , dried , and often has sugar and salt added . Nutritionally , quick and old-fashioned oats are identical .
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .
' Paella rice ' is not actually a variety of rice , but a category suitable , as the its name suggests , for making paella . Some common varieties are : Bahia , Balilla , Bomba , Senia , and Calasparra ; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose . These varieties differ from risotto rices , such as arborio and carnaroli , in not creating a creamy ' sauce ' around the rice . Paella rice should stick together , but be distinct and not in a creamy ' sauce ' . Arborio rice has a creamy , chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin ( one of two components in its starch ) content . Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices , however it too would become ' creamy ' if you stirred it like a risotto , since it also has a high starch content .
There are several factors that increase price . Some are related to the objective quality of the wine , some indirectly linked , other are rather disconnected from quality ( but not necessarily irrelevant , as we 'll see ) . It 's also worth noting that being of high quality does n't necessarily mean being appealing to the average consumer . Apart from the stuff listed below , mass-market wines tend to be made in a non-challenging , easily accessible style . Lower tannin levels , less acidity and a generous amount of residual sugar ( say 10-30g / l ) makes for easy quaffing but little complexity or elegance . They can be very well-made , but the agriculture may not be very sustainable , and the fruit probably is n't of the highest quality . ( If you visit a winery at harvest when they bring in the bulk wine fruit , the meaning of " quality " becomes rather apparent . ) Wines targeted at connoisseurs , wine snobs and wine geeks ( such as yours truly ) tend have more structure ( tannins , acidity ) and are more often completely dry ( although there are of course high-quality off-dry , semi-sweet , and sweet wines ) . There 's a limit to how much a producer can spend to increase quality , a limit which varies with location ( because of salaries for workers etc ) but around $ 100 per bottle is probably in the right order of magnitude . This does not mean that all wines above this magical limit are equally good , though . A dirt-cheap wine will also have a cost associated to it which will be payed for by someone else , like under-payed harvest workers , the environment around the vineyard , etc. . Below are some factors that have a more or less direct link to wine quality and/or character : Yield per acre : Limiting the vineyard 's yield per acre ( which can be achieved by sparser planting , thinning / <URL> , old vines , etc ) increases the quality of the fruit , but you will produce less wine with more or less the same amount of work , which means you 'll have to adjust the price . Number of harvesting tries : At harvest , you can pick all the fruit of one vineyard at the same time and be done with it . Unfortunately , not all bunches ripen at exactly the same time , so to avoid over - or under-ripe grapes , you can make multiple tries ( French , pronounced " trees " ) over several days and pick each bunch at optimal ripeness . More tries inevitably means more work , and so , price increases . Selection : When the harvest is brought in , you can throw all the fruit into the press , or you can select the best grapes to make your wine ( and make brandy or a <URL> of the discarded grapes , or sell them on to a bulk wine producer ) . Being picky reduces the amount of wine produced , and so , prices increase . Drying : Some wines , like <URL> and <URL> , are made from partially dried grapes , and drying decreases the amount of wine you produce ( apart from being extra work ) which means - more expensive wine . Sparkling : Sparkling wines made with the <URL> - like <URL> and <URL> - need to be disgorged after bottle fermentation , which leads to a certain amount of waste ( a Cava producer I talked to said that around 10 % of the original wine is lost in disgorgement ) . Oak aging : Many wines are <URL> , which greatly affects the character of the wine compared to other types of containers , like concrete or stainless steel vats . ( More oak does n't mean better wine , of course . ) Oak barrels are horribly more expensive than the alternatives ( and European oak is more expensive than American , and they impart different character ) , and so , the more oak you use , the more expensive the wine gets . Aging in general : Most high-quality wine receive a bit of aging before consumption to let all components integrate ; some designations of origin even require aging prior to selling . <URL> Gran Reserva , for example , must be aged at least three years , with at least one of those years being on oak , while vintage <URL> is mandated to rest three years on the <URL> , etc. . Apart from time being money , you also need a suitable storage location ( cool and humid but not too cool and humid , secure but accessible to yourself , etc ) which is far from free . The price increases . Other factors are n't causally linked to higher quality , but tend to be connected : Reputation : If you 're an unproven winemaker you will be able to charge more if you 're operating in a district of high repute than if you 're working in an area where no-one has made quality wine before . Conversely , a well-known , high-quality producer expanding their operations to a somewhat less proven district will likely be able to charge more than their new neighbours . Brand : Marketing can take many forms , such as it advertising , tailoring wines to suit <URL> , and tends to push prices up . Wineries can even try <URL> . You can also be lucky and find some great , undiscovered producer ( do n't tell anyone ! except me , that is ) selling their wines at more-or-less cost price ( which probably still wo n't be dirt cheap , though ) . Land prices : Some spots are better for growing grapes . If you 're in

What 's the simplest method to cook rice ?
My foolproof method is as follows : Weigh out the desired amount of rice - I use 2-3oz per person - and put it in a saucepan . Wash the rice well by filling the pan with cold water , tipping it out , and repeating about 10 times . The more you wash the less the rice sticks together . Put enough water in the pan to cover the rice by about 5-8mm . Leave to soak for 25 minutes until the rice grains have turned opaque white . Put the saucepan over a high heat , uncovered , and bring to a boil . Boil until the water has evaporated and the surface of the rice is dotted with small holes . Turn off the heat . Cover tightly : if the lid is n't a tight fit , place a piece of foil on the pan , then put the lid on . Steam for at least 15 minutes . The beauty of this method is that it does n't matter how long you steam the rice for once it 's past the 15 minute minimum - in fact , the more it steams the better it is , especially if you have added spices or flavourings to the water .
You can heat clarified butter to a higher temperature for two reasons -- you remove the milk solids , which can burn , and you remove the water , which will boil at 100 ° C and cause spattering . In baking , clarified butter 's lack of water means that it ca n't develop gluten as you would with simple melted butter . It 's actually more similar to other oils than it is to melted butter when baking . In the case of ghee , my understanding is that because it 's from a warm country , part of the reason for making it was as a preservative , as the ghee would have a longer shelf-life ( months ) than standard butter in the local climate .
The proteins in a fresh egg are too viscous , even when thoroughly beaten , to wash a baked good . The water thins the proteins so you get a nice glaze instead of a layer of scrambled egg . Older eggs have sometimes degraded enough that they do n't need the water but it is easier to always add water than to make a subjective judgement on the state of your egg proteins .
This scum is made from proteins . Meat contains muscle fibers ( the proteins actin and myosin ) as well as some loose proteins swimming in the fluids within the meat ( the cell plasma ) . When you cook meat , the protein-rich fluids are expelled ( that 's why overcooking makes meat dry ) . Under hot temperature , the proteins in the fluid coagulate , making it firm . It is especially noticeable in your burger , because there is more liquid flowing out quickly from your cut-up meat , but it also happens with whole pieces of meat , albeit more slowly . It is also very noticeable when cooking stock , because the stock is cooked for a long time and the liquid has time to come out from the meat . The coagulated liquid can form a single piece ( as it does with steak on a slightly oiled pan ) , but when it flows into water or oil , it mixes with it without dissolving , creating small loose particles . They float to the top , creating the frothy scum you describe . The process is perfectly natural , you 're not doing anything wrong . You can in fact eat the scum without any ill effects , but the taste is n't that great . So it is better to fish it out from the oil ( or water when making stock ) . In dry cooking ( aforementioned steak ) it is exactly this stuff ( after getting nicely browned on the hot pan ) which makes gravy taste so well , together with the dripped fat .
I usually use 1/4 cup per person for a smallish portion , and 1/3 cup per person if you 're a bit hungrier . You 'll probably want to check the instructions for your rice cooker to check exactly how much water you should add as different manufacturers vary . I believe the one I used in the past needed an equal quantity of water to rice .
In the Caribbean green plantains are treated much like potatoes . One technique that is common is twice-frying , usually with a soak in water either before the first fry , in between , or both . Soaking plantains allows them to absorb a little water to help steam the inside as it fries , much like one would do for American-style french fries ( UK : chips ) . One example of this technique is <URL> . The Puerto Rican classic cookbook " Cocina Criolla " by Carmen Valldejuli calls for soaking the plantain pieces in room temperature water with salt and crushed garlic for 15 minutes as well as dipping them in water immediately before the second fry . Like many potatoes , green plantains will often turn brown if left out in the air for too long after being peeled , soaking in water also helps prevent this from occurring as well as reducing the amount of free starch on the outside which can cause over-browning . Elsewhere , both in the Americas and Africa , green plantains are cut very thinly and fried into <URL> ( UK : crisps ) . These are usually 1-2mm thick and also benefit from presoaking . If you decide not to fry them you could also boil them in salted water like a potato or boil them in vinegar with onions , garlic , and spices to make an escabeche . You could also partially cook them in salted water or stock then bake them in the oven .
Do you mean this one ? <URL> . If so , in Japan it is actually known as <URL> ( meaning pomelo candy ) as shown in this description . Here is a <URL> to how a similar milk version is made ( I think you would use mandarin/pomelo ( bontan ) juice in there somewhere for what you want ) , but it is in Japanese ... Perhaps the pictures will help but ... sorry , I do n't know if it 's ok to translate this ... but it says : milk 500ml , sweet glutinous rice 500g , sugar 500g , mizuame ( maltose ; could use corn syrup instead ) 600g , potato starch 200g , and a tray 31cmx24cmx3 .5 cm . Briefly , it says to soak the rice for half a day , then drain , and blend with the milk for 2-3 mins . Transfer to a pot and simmer on medium heat for 20-30 mins . Add sugar in a few lots , mix until dissolved . Drop to low heat , add mizuame and stir/knead very well - the firmness of the final candy will depend on how long you do this . Dredge tray with a thick layer of potato starch then pour the mixture in . To harden , refrigerate when cool .
It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic , it will rot quicker , so I wrap it in paper towels , then bag it ( but not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . For whole heads of lettuce ( iceburg , butter , red leaf , etc ) , I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels , then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer 's market . I then pull off leaves as I need it , and re-wrap it . It stores for well over a week this way . For mescalin mixes , arugula , or other individual leaves , I 'll wash them , dry them , then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on , then roll up the whole thing , and bag the roll ( again , not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . I can probably get a week out of it this way . ( all times assume you 're not buying from a store where it 's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it ; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer 's market ) So , to answer the specific questions : keep the bag open ; you do n't want moisture to condense inside the bag , as it 'll make the lettuce rot faster . I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole . If you 're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days , it probably does n't matter , and for loose lettuce , I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway . You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged , but damp will lead to it rotting faster .
Martha 's Vinyard Magazine suggests that the diamater of the stalks is not directly related to their age as one might suspect : Some might assume thinner spears are younger and therefore more tender . The diameter , however , has more to do with the age of the plant itself and the particular asparagus variety . They go on to cite Cook 's Illustrated , saying : [ T ] hin and thick spears as equally sweet , nutty , and grassy , but ... thicker spears have a slightly better , more tender texture . The reason is that the fiber is somewhat more concentrated in thinner spears . You can peel asparagus if you choose to . Personally , I peel the base of thicker stalks . Mark Bittman recommends peeling from just under the flowers to the base of the stalk on the thicker stalks . Thinner stalks may be easier to saute or grill , and thicker ones more suited to steaming , poaching , and so on , but this is more related to the time it takes them to cook through .

When I make a paella I never cover it , I find it keeps in too much moisture . My uncovered method is to put the fish in and cook for 10 minutes . If my mussels are small I will usually wait 2-3 minutes before putting them in , bu for " standard " mussels 10 minutes seems to work well . I use a low-medium heat on a large burner .
If you just need the pulp ( for pie , ice cream , jam , etc. . . ) then cook them down and run them through a food strainer . If you need them raw , or halved/skins on , then find a good audiobook ...
I 've never done this , but what about filling the bowl with water , lowering the spinning basket into it so the lettuce shreds lift off , then dumping it out ?
Hot water and detergent might be enough , but after serious mold growth , I 'd use a disinfectant . The easiest way to do this would be to disinfect your cooker with bleach , which is very effective at killing mold on non-porous surfaces . After thoroughly washing and rinsing your cooker , make a solution of 10 parts water to 1 part bleach and allow it to soak in your cooker for a few minutes , then dump it out and allow the cooker to air dry . <URL> ( note that the caveat here is that bleach is n't effective for porous surfaces . Anything that you 're cooking on should be an acceptable surface for using bleach on . )
It is the rice that is important , regardless of the cooker you use . If you think you are unable to find Sushi rice on your own in local market , why not check with a Sushi stall chef/owner near by ? Some people get mistaken with sticky rice , because really Sushi and sticky are on the same category . You could even say that Italian risotto is as well . However sushi rice is rinsed and surface starch is removed . Yamikuronue has already given you some good insight . Perhaps she could tell you what rice you could buy :) I hope you have the basic sushi rolling bamboo mat to help you with . From mine and many of others ' experience , the mat is very useful . I have used <URL> to make nice maki rolls . The following <URL> seems to be indicating a method ( water sprinkling ) that I saw/ate in a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo near Maru building . Hope it helps . Edit 1 : If you want to make best sushi out of normal rice , this is a bruteforce method we tried at home for the first time . Not the best Sushi found in a Sushi bar in Japan , but still it was a taste to remember , and an experience that made sense . break the long grain rice ( you can use a mortar , or bottle , or any clean/non-contaminated cylinder on your cutting board :) ) wash the rice until the starch goes away - even if it 's not 100 % , it 's good enough when you have soaked it . soak the rice rinse and wash again and rinse depending on the usual ' hardness ' of the rice you use , and how much water you add per cup of rice , you may have to change the amount of water you add . For example , if you have 50g of raw rice , and 75g of water , then the total weight is 125g . You must keep the same total weight when you add water to the soaked/washed rice . you can very well cook the rice in a pan good heat to cook rice : after boiling , bring down the heat to minimum and let it be , no need to take lid off once rice is cooked , you can mix it with sushi vinegar . If you do not have rice/sushi vinegar , then you can add some plain vinegar and pinches of salt mix all , stir well This gives you just nice rice for sushi :)
More is not always better . To extract the most flavour , just let it simmer for a long time ... it just wo n't be a nice cup of coffee , because that way some unwanted flavours are also extracted . To make a good cup of coffee , the water , the coffee , the temperature ( also of the cup itself ) , the time , the grind and the blend all are important . Just as important as the method . Favourite methods are the French press and the espresso machine , but a radical different method is Turkish ' coffee , where they take the coffee to a boil three times and serve it without filtering ... and it 's delicious .
The following excerpt answers questions 1 and 2 . Additionally it reduces the cooking time for the parboiled rice . Also known as converted rice , parboiled rice has been pressure-steamed and then dried in its natural outer husk ( which is later removed ) . This process hardens the starch in the grains so they remain firmer , less sticky , and separate when cooked . It also forces the vitamins and minerals from the outer layer of the grains into the endosperm , which is the part we eat . This makes parboiled rice a more nutritious option than regular ( unenriched ) white rice , which does n't retain any of the goodness of the nutrient-rich husk . There are several techniques you can use to prevent unprocessed cooked rice from sticking to each other : Use medium to long grain rice . Rinse the rice until the rinsing water is completely clear . Use the Boil and Steam method to cook the rice . In this method boil the rice for 5-10 minutes . Then pour off the excess water and steam the rice for an additional 10 minutes . This method of cooking the rice reduces the most starch on the outside of the rice which is what causes the sticking . Source : <URL>
Depending on what the ginger is going into , lightly greasing your knife blade helps ( but , obviously , not if you 're putting them in something where a tiny bit of oil would be an issue ) . As does using a heavy carbon-steel knife like a Chinese cleaver . Freezing sounds attractive , but it does n't work because the ginger becomes impossible to chop -- too hard . Overall , you pretty much have to expect to scrub the knife and cutting board after you 're done . You can make it a bit easier on yourself , but you ca n't make chopping candied ginger not messy .
I do n't usually hull strawberries , but when I do I use a straw . The idea is that you push the straw up through the tip of the strawberry and it comes out at the stem . For pictures you can see <URL> are just Google " hull strawberries with a straw "
' Paella rice ' is not actually a variety of rice , but a category suitable , as the its name suggests , for making paella . Some common varieties are : Bahia , Balilla , Bomba , Senia , and Calasparra ; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose . These varieties differ from risotto rices , such as arborio and carnaroli , in not creating a creamy ' sauce ' around the rice . Paella rice should stick together , but be distinct and not in a creamy ' sauce ' . Arborio rice has a creamy , chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin ( one of two components in its starch ) content . Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices , however it too would become ' creamy ' if you stirred it like a risotto , since it also has a high starch content .
As I understand it , it 's down to the flavour you get from frying the rice . However , it does also break down some of the starch which reduces the thickening it can do when the risotto cooks , which might cause a problem . I can attest to the flavour , but I 've not done experiments about thickening . Serious Eats had a good article on the topic though , in which such experiments were described . The solution in that was to wash the rice in the stock , then fry the rice , then add the stock containing all that undamaged free rice starch during cooking , thus giving you toasty flavour and creamy risotto with no questions asked . I have n't tried that , but it seems like a fairly sound idea to me . <URL>

What do green spots on the inside of a butternut squash indicate ?
I always go with my gut in these situations , so scraping it off is probably a good idea . If the green was not really dark and moldy looking , or really soft in comparison to the rest of the flesh , it could be that it just was n't fully ripe yet in that area . Either way , you 're planning on cooking the squash , correct ? I believe that this would be perfectly safe to eat now that the questionable parts have been removed . I 'd eat it with no qualms . If the rest of the squash was firm , and not bad looking on the outside or inside , then I am guessing this is not a problem , unless said green part was much softer than the rest of the squash .
Which could mean one thing for sure . The density and weight of the grams which float is way too lower than the ones that sink . Which means , there is a possibility that it is hollow inside , because of some bug infestation or small worms/bugs gotten inside them , eaten them making it hollow . Else the natural weight if the gram is practically very low , and the growth is incomplete. , Former being the most probable cause . If would examine the lot for any worms/bugs to ensure that 's not the case . If proved clean , and the number of floating grams is much less , then I will just ignore and use . On the other hand , it there proves to be bugs/worms in the lot , the better option is just to discard them to be safe . Because , pulses and lentils infested with bugs mostly no longer taste the same . Thanks . Hope it helped .
Adding oil or butter makes scrambled eggs more creamy by giving the egg protein something to hold onto and not curl as tight . The ideal formula for scrambled eggs is one extra yolk for every 4 eggs plus a little fat . I did n't like scrambled eggs until I tried this formula and it 's awesome . Credit goes to either Jack Bishop ( Cooks Illustrated ) and/or Nathan Myhrvold ( Modernist Cuisine ) unfortunately I ca n't remember which of the two clever gents I heard it from .
As long as it does n't have soft spots , and when you cut it open there is no mold or rot inside , it is still fine . I 've often used acorn squash that have partially turned orange , and yes , that is just further ( but unneeded ) ripening .
Per <URL> : [ T ] here are really two distinct cuts from the diaphragm of the steer . The outside skirt steak is from the plate section , below the rib and between the brisket and flank , and usually comes with the membrane still attached , which needs to be trimmed before cooking . Inside skirt comes from the flank -- it 's narrower and thinner than the outside skirt , and comes with the membrane removed . According to the <URL> , outside skirt stake is extremely rare in the US , as much of it gets exported to Japan due to a quick in the tariffs . The outside cut is tougher , but extremely flavorful . Both are used in similar applications , if you can get them . Given that any skirt you buy is probably inside skirt , the difference is likely to be moot . In making fajitas , Kenji Alt recommends grilling it over extremely high heat , to get browning flavors on the outside , and not overcook the center . He recommends not cooking it over medium rare . A couple of pictures :
I feel your pain . If only I liked summer squash better ... You definitely can freeze squash -- thick slice it , blanch it in salty water briefly until almost tender , transfer to an ice bath until it 's chilled , bag it , and put in the freezer . Later , thaw and use with recipes that do n't require ultra-crisp squash .
At Marriott hotel , where I worked for a while , we used similar flakes . Our technique was to add a good splash of boiling water first , incorporate the chocolate flakes by mixing it into a smooth paste ( more or less ) , and only then add hot milk . I guess the idea is that it is much more of a challenge to incorporate a small amount of solid into a large amount of liquid , however if you turn that solid into a paste first , its almost like your mixing two liquids . You 'll find that the same technique is used for making a bachamel sauce . For convenience sake , try using a small amount of hot milk , instead of water . Also , having your liquid boiling might help , which is hard to achieve in a microwave . e.g. when making a classic chocolate sauce which contains butter and cream , the chocolate is only fully dissolved when the liquid is boiled .

SAFETY should be your primary concern in all cooking methods . The danger inherent in cutting dense , hard , ROUND foods is that they tend to roll or shift when pressure is applied , thus allowing hand or fingers to suddenly slip under/against the cutting edge . One key to safety is STABILITY . Hasty chopping , hacking , swinging , or stabbing motions are dangerous -- especially if you ca n't be sure the food will stay put . Firm , controlled movement upon a stable surface is the safe way . Placing the squash on a nest fashioned from a tightly-wadded or rolled , clean kitchen towel is a good way to achieve stability . It is also important to work with a very sharp knife that has a rather thick blade . This acts like a wedge acts in wood-splitting . The knife should also be several inches longer than the diameter of the widest place on the squash , to allow for gripping both ends of the blade during the final cut through . Place the squash on your towel nest , use another kitchen towel , folded , as a sort of mitt . This " mitt " should be thin enough that you can grasp firmly with it . ( 100 % cotton towelling usually grips better . ) Using your mitt , grip the wider end of the squash ; insert the tip of the knife into one of the longitudinal ridges , with the cutting edge away from that mitted hand , until the knife has nearly come out the opposite side , lodging in the flesh of the squash on the opposite side . Then , lever the knife edge down in a motion that uses the lodged knife-point as a fulcrum . ( Think of the motion of a paper-cutter . ) Flip the squash over , repeating this , until the pointed end is cut all the way through . Up-end the squash , placing it on its stem end in the towel nest . Check for stability . Place your knife into the slit , perpendicular to the axis of the squash . Use your gripping towel to pad the non-cutting side of the knife , then press down until the squash is cleaved through .
Do n't use the pizza stone for cookies . Stones absorb a ton of your oven 's heat and will really mess up your baking times . They 're designed to be preheated in your oven before you ever put a pizza ( or other item ) on them . I have never tried it before but you might be able to use the pizza stone if you preheated it but then you have to put your cookies on a hot surface which may cause them to misbehave in other ways . Cookies should be baked on light-toned heavy-duty metal baking sheets ( or as close as you can get to that ) because the metal transfers the heat , it does n't absorb it . That 's how you get well-baked cookies .
Putting corn in water only makes sense if it is still in the husk , as that will keep the husks from burning . Soaking precooked de-husked corn would make no difference to you . You can barbecue it , but as it is precooked I 'd keep the cooking time down to a couple of minutes , just long enough to heat it up and get a bit of color on it . Any more and it may be overcooked .
They 're something leaf-like . If you look closely , you 'll find that they are n't just markings , they can be pulled away from the stem . There does n't seem to be a lot of agreement about the best name ; you 'll see " scales " and " leaves " in plenty of informal contexts , and " bracts " in some ( but not all ) more formal contexts . On Food and Cooking says they 're bracts , and actually mentions why they might be there : The stalk does n't support ordinary leaves ; the small projections from the stems are leaf-like bracts that shield immature clusters of feathery photosynthetic branches . That cluster inside them is what makes them <URL> : In botany , a bract is a modified or specialized leaf , especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a flower , inflorescence axis , or cone scale . <URL> . That 's a bit vague about where it actually is on the plant , but there 's an image later in the article making it clear what they 're referring to : <URL> Oddly , <URL> goes into a bit more detail : In asparagus ( Asparagus officinalis ; Asparagaceae ) , the scales found on the asparagus spears are the true leaves . If the thick , fleshy asparagus spears continue to grow , flat , green , leaflike structures called cladodes develop in the axils of the scale leaves . That does match the definition of bract . Asparagus is only tender enough to eat when pretty young , though , so perhaps when you eat it those cladodes have n't developed yet . That 's still the purpose of the scales , though . In any case , it sounds like " scale " vs " bract " may just be a difference in precision and perspective .
Trying to get to the bottom of the issue , I decided to take a few pictures of a few different types of salt . The pictures shown below were taken by me and are all proportional ( the camera was the same distance away from each type of salt , so you are getting an accurate size comparison ) . The picture illustrates my suspicions , which is the difference is the surface area ( ignoring of course mineral content and different types of grinding salt ) . Standard table salt is a compact little cube , effective when it 's to be dissolved in a liquid , but not so much when it comes to direct contact with the taste buds . Place one cube on your tongue and you get 1/6th of the surface area in contact , meaning , a lot of salt without much saltiness . Sea salt , with a more rectangular shape is closer to 1/4th the surface area touching your tongue . Ground salt is more like shards of glass , so nearly half of the exposed area could be in contact making things taste that much more salty . Also with a much finer texture , you are left with many more particles in a wider area , meaning , a saltier taste with less salt . It 's a good way of finishing a dish when the salt is going to be lightly dusted on top or mixed with an oil where it will not dissolve at all . When you are dissolving it in a liquid , it really makes little difference which type you use . When it comes down to it , it 's all about how picky you want to be with it .
This just means the potato has been exposed to light and has produced chlorophyll ( the green color ) . It is most likely safe to eat , minus the green areas . Producing the chlorophyll also produces solanine , which is toxic in large quantities . Remove the green parts and do n't eat more than 4lbs . For detailed information , see this link . <URL>
It 's a regional preference on what they 're called . When you 're buying seeds , they 're also called " bunching onions " , and I grew up calling them " scallions " , although I think that scallion specifically do n't have a bulb yet formed , while green/spring onions might . update : A little research suggests that " spring onion " is the preferred term in the UK , AU and Canada , " green onion " in the US south , and " scallion " in the US northeast , however I 'm not sure what the exact boundries are as in the US mid-atlantic , I 'll see both " green onions " and " scallions " for sale , with " green onions " being larger ( scallions with no bulb , maybe 12 " / 30cm long , while green onions might have a 2 " / 5cm bulb , and have over 24 " / 60cm of green top ) . It 's possible that " green onion " might be a polysemous term that varies by region .
Many references indicate that stress on the plant effects the heat rating of the fruits produced . " Good " stress ( usually people want to increase heat ) is generally a reduction in water supply , carefully and aptly timed , and/or increased outdoor temperatures . While appearing dated and non-authoritative , <URL> , also looks very accurate from my experience around growing chiles , and states that ( as is common , referring to spice/heat as pungency ) : ... total pungency amount of the medium and mild chiles increase dramatically when put under stress . Normally , chile plants like summer weather ( sunlight and warmth ) , and are not nearly productive in winter . What you 're obtaining in winter months may be imported from a very different location , probably from a place on Earth where it was summer when harvested . As indicated in the above-cited article , the truly hot peppers do n't get much hotter from stress . Anecdotal addendum : fwiw &amp; ime , chile plants grown in winter ( the ones observed are nagas , tabasco , japone , jalapeños ) are n't as productive and the peppers are not anywhere near as hot . So , when not grown in the proper conditions that a species expects - mostly enough daily sunlight or a long enough warm season , the heat in produced fruits can drop dramatically .
The collagen in the ribs needs to get to a temperature of about 160 F to start breaking down into water and gelatin . If your oven can be set as low as 175 or 180 F on a normal bake or convection bake setting that is probably a better alternative unless you have access to an oven thermometer and can measure what temperature the warm setting on your oven attains .
In Rome I was informed that I was eating a croissant with honey on top ( after informing my host that I had a honey allergy ) . It had the sweetness that I suspect you 're experiencing . To help you determine if we were trying the same thing : the croissant I had was shiny and slightly sticky on top , and it seemed more like it was brushed on top rather than drizzled . That would support @Carmi 's answer that it was brushed on with the egg . It was definitely honey , though , not sugar syrup .
Double-yolked eggs are the result of an anomaly in the egg generation process in the hen . They can happen in any breed of hen , on any feed . It is a result of two ova being generated at the same time , and then encapsulated in a single shell . According to <URL> , it happens more often with younger hens . I am not aware of any process to intentionally foster double yolked eggs , but that does n't mean such a thing does n't exist . They are safe to eat , although they may be visually startling .
It sounds like it was gassed to stay bright green and firm but the seeds are showing how old it actually is . The pith ( the whitish veins on the sides ) is also firm on a fresh pepper , if its limp probably due to age .

What 's a good substitute for cilantro ?
I would try Lime Basil or a mixture of 1/2 vinegar , and 1/2 bottled lime juice ( small portion ) .
Pretty much no , they are totally non-alike . The beauty of brisket is that it is full of connective tissue and other odd stuff that translates to succulence when cooked low and slow . Round is pretty much the opposite , it has very little in the way of interest .
Joe , Whole wheat puff pastry . It 's expensive , and hard to find , though . Or try another recipe . If the recipe you 're using calls for puff pastry , then the flavor and texture of the puff pastry is going to be a big part of the dish . It never works very well to substitute a primary ingredient in a recipe .
While this is n't a substitute , you can get better deals on saffron and make it go further . First of all , do not buy it at a normal grocery store . It tends to be very expensive there . Instead go to a farmer 's market ( not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church , but rather the big store ) . I 'd imagine most major cities will have one or more . Atlanta has at least 4 . Saffron is much , much cheaper at the farmer 's market . Second , thoroughly grind the saffron before using it . This will help the saffron more completely flavor a dish , requiring a smaller amount of saffron to get the flavor . A quick Google suggested Tumeric , but I ca n't really imagine that working , nor did a lot of the comments on the internets .
Dupe , but a good question . See Satanicpuppies answer here : <URL> I know you asked re : cranberry sauce specifically , but this is a great article regarding the differences in sugars , generically , which might help in the future : " Sugar can be a single molecule made up of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen -- like glucose and fructose . Other sugars , like sucrose , or white table sugar , are made up of multiple molecules ( in this case , one glucose and one fructose ) , tied together with chemical bonds . Now , when sucrose is heated with an acid , it breaks back down into the two smaller sugars , glucose and fructose , resulting in something we call invert sugar . This small chemical change makes a big difference : While sucrose is hygroscopic , invert sugar is even more water-loving . And this can make a tremendous difference when , say , you want to bake a chewy , rather than crunchy , cookie . " <URL>
Yes , for all practical intents and purposes , for flax eggs to congeal they need to be milled or ground to a powder and slurried with water , then introduced to the dish . After stirring and then letting set you should have a nice gloopy mess if you let it stand for a few minutes . I typically use a 1 part milled seed to 2.5 parts water , but typically ranges go from 2-3 parts water . You can use a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder for fast , thorough results . The exception to this is that <URL> ( this link will teach you how to use them to make hair gel , if you 're so inclined ) . This will cause the soluble fiber ( the congealing agent ) to dissolve , leaving behind the seed husks . Milled flax seeds do n't seem to be any less effective and no more distracting in terms of taste so , unless you 're doing up your hair , I just do n't see the payoff on boiling them . Another exceptional means to an exception to this is letting the seeds soak for approximately 6-8 hours . As I recall the person who tried this said it did n't congeal much , and was less sticky than a milled flax egg .
Short answer : no , you can not without radically changing the recipe until it is something completely different . See my answer here for more information : <URL>
On first blush , you will probably want a fat or oil with similar qualities as the " vegetable " oil you 're replacing , such as olive oil . Butter has a much lower a smoke point , however , cornbread recipes exist that use butter or lard . I 'd be willing to experiment , particularly if you 're used to cooking with butter . ( Just be careful with heat . ) As far as quantity , I 'd use a bit less than 1/3 of a cup , but that 's me being defensive as I do n't know the recipe you 're using .
The perfect solution to you - Use the Indian spice called " Asafoetida " or " Hing " . It gives a taste which is very much like Onion and Garlic - In fact , stricter practitioners of Hinduism are not allowed to eat onion and garlic ( as supposedly they cause mental agitation ) . Thus , traditional Hindu ( Vedic ) cooking uses Asafoetida as a subsitute for onion in Indian recipes which almost invariably call for the use of onions . The spice gives off a slightly funky smell ( I like it , but most people describe it as bad ) , but tastes great . It is easily available in powdered form in Indian grocery stores - and usually comes in small containters such as this : It has a VERY strong taste , so put a very small amount of it - about a 1/4 of a teaspoon for a dish that 's meant or 4 people . Usually in Indian cooking it is quickly fried to get rid of the " raw " taste . I am not sure how well it tastes in salads , you 'd have to experiment with it .
Capers are generally very salty , and not what you want as a peppercorn substitute . I think that black/white/red / madagascar peppercorn would be a fine substitute . The distinction between the different pepper flavours is very subtle , and not one to worry about much .
<URL> is a fantastic resource , and has probably <URL> out there at the moment . There 's also a lot of good stuff at the French Cullinary Institute 's <URL> . They 've got <URL> that 's quite enlightening . I actually disagree on the McGee recommendations . While it 's an excellent book , full of great info , I do n't think it 's a good starting point for molecular gastronomy ( in the sense of the cooking movement rather than the more literal sense )
US Jalapeno and Anahiems ( red jalapenos ) are usually under 2,500 . If you cook them a little bit , it will also reduce the spiciness , while maintaining the flavor .
I would n't attempt to substitute . I 've read somewhere that you can use regular lime leaves , but I 've never seen those anywhere . Even Googling for lime leaf turns up kaffir lime leaves . They can be found easily enough online : <URL> . They freeze well for months in just a zip-lock bag . The flavor profile is best described as a bright floral aromatic . It 's similar in function , not taste , to a bay leaf . Thai cuisine uses kaffir lime leaves much as we do bay leaves . If you decide buying online is n't worth the hassle , then <URL> suggests the following substitute : 1/2 a small bay leaf 1/4 tsp of lime zest 1/8 tsp of fresh lemon thyme
Black bean paste is also incorporated into Asian cuisine , and has a similar flavor , although earthier . Add a little sugar , maybe a little ground cashew or peanuts for nuttiness . It wo n't be the same , but it should work well enough . Since black beans are more common , this may work well enough for you .
To expand upon baka 's comment : this would taste good without the cumin too ; it 'd just be a simpler flavor . You can then replace it with any other spice that appeals to you , since pork 's flavor is n't going to strongly clash with many spices . ElendilTheTall 's answer suggests one option ; I 'm sure you can come up with others . This gives you a chance to make your pork fit well with whatever other dishes are in your meal .
Black garlic is not a substitute for regular garlic , you add black garlic to get a different result . I would never say use 2 cloves of black garlic for every 1 regular or any other ratio because the changes are so fundamental that they really are totally different ingredients . The question is how much black garlic flavor you want , and only you can answer that . I 'd suggest that you taste it when it 's close to being done and if you want more add more then .
I 've come across two great , and very different , types of steak . The first is typical in Argentina and is not aged at all , but from a young calf ( 6-10 months old ) , free ranging and grass fed ( hence not like classic veal ) . This is really juicy , tender , and with a very " bright " taste . Good high-end Argentine restaurants usually serve meat like this , and in the UK you can order it from pampasplains.com , which I think is great . The second is from an older cow and dry aged to tenderize , but the aging also gives it a deeper , more bone marrow-like flavour . The best I 've had of this type was a cow from Limousin in France , served in Paris at a small restaurant called Le Sèvero ( 8 rue des Plantes , 14th Arrondissment , reviewed in the NY Times a while ago ) . It was amazing ! In London , 32 Great Queen St 's " Hereford beef " is a similar style and also excellent . They get it from a Hereford farmer called Tom Jones ( seriously ) , who serves several restaurants . Good steak should never be marinated in anything - all it needs before cooking is salt , maybe pepper if you like ( though I sometimes eat it with Coleman 's English mustard ) . I 'm fairly sure that grass-only feed is important to good meat , i.e. no cereal-based fattening-up , though it 's hard to separately test this one variable . Breed also clearly matters ( all Argentine beef seems to be Aberdeen Angus or Hereford ) . I love a nicely marbled , fatty steak like the ribeye , but my ( Argentine ) wife prefers leaner cuts like sirloin and filet - clearly a matter of taste .
I 've only had red amaranth , so apologies if that is distinct from the type you have access to . As I recall , spinach is a bit sweeter and the leaves are a bit softer so they break down more readily . Also I believe the stem on spinach is less fibrous . That said , they are both leafy greens and I 've yet to find a recipe so touchy that one leafy green ca n't be substituted for another .
Amchur does n't give much of a flavor other than sour , at least , not in the amounts I use of it . It does have a bit of a distinctive aroma , but really , to me , it is just a fairly neutral sour flavor . The easiest , most neutral substitute would be citric acid powder . Unfortunately , they do n't usually give concentration/strengths on the packaging , but comparing Ball Citric Acid for Canning to the powdered amchur from the Indian store , it 's pretty close . I think the citric acid tastes a tiny bit lemony , but not enough to make a difference . Also , the amchur powder I buy is generally quite finely ground , and the citric acid is generally in crystals . If you are doing something like a spice blend ( e.g. , chat masala powder ) you would probably want to grind the crystals up to match the texture of the rest of the spices . Depending on what you 're making , there are quite a few substitutions , but most of them would be more obscure than ( or at least as obscure as ) the amchur , and all would be less neutral . Also , amchur is dry , so adding something liquid might affect your recipe . ( Easy to adjust if you are adding to something liquid , of course . ) In many Indian dishes , most of the Indians I know simply do use lemon juice when they want to make something sour , especially for northern dishes . This really is quite common , and nearly every Indian cook I know in the US has a large bottle of lemon juice in the fridge for every day use . If you 're making something South Indian , tamarind pulp or paste is often the souring agent of choice , but it is distinctly not neutral . It has a distinctive flavor and will also darken things ( in a somewhat yellow-orange-brown range ) . Some regions also use dried kokum fruit in the same way ( classic Maharashtrian aamti , for example ) , but I would say it is even more distinctive than tamarind , and it also will darken it ( with a dark grey-green-brown range of color ) . For both kokum and tamarind , you soak the pulp in water and add the soaking water without the pulp to the dish . You can also usually find tamarind concentrate ( a tarry paste ) but I 've never seen anything like that for kokum . One more option I just thought of is using some other unripe or sour fruit . Amchur is made by powdering dried green mangoes . You can actually sometimes find dried green mangoes at places like Trader Joe 's and if it is unsweetened , a small piece of that can certainly be used , but it seems that any fruit that is firm and sour should work , such as an unripe plum or a very tart apple . In that case , I would suggest either cooking with a small piece or two of the fruit in the sauce ( if there is one ) and removing it later or you could try to crush it and press some juice out . The problem here would be in figuring out the correct amount to add , but I think you could start from the dried-to-fresh conversion rates for herbs .
My wife loves it toasted . Toast shredded coconut in a dry pan or oven and put on ice cream and other deserts . It 's really tasty . Like toasting other nuts be careful as if you blink it may burn .

Does dry frying tofu really cause tofu to better soak up a marinade ?
Marinated tofu is essentially a myth perpetrated by well-meaning people who are , in my experience , culturally pretty far removed from cuisines where tofu is heavily used . Tofu is not especially porous , because it 's texturally very similar to a custard . Maybe osmotic pressure will result in a little flavor transfer to a custard , but it 's not the most efficient way to do it . Marinades are pretty rarely used for tofu in Asia in my experience . You 're more likely to see pan sauces or dipping sauces , or occasionally a topping added after cooking . But people in Japan , China , and Korea will generally expect a much fresher , beanier tasting tofu than you 're likely to find in a US supermarket , so there 's not as much of an impulse to cover up the flavor . In the US , thanks to generous expiration dates and a fairly unpicky customer base , a lot of tofu sold in supermarkets is slightly soured and just does n't taste very good . The primary effect of the dry frying technique on the page that you linked to will be to create a bunch of nooks and crannies and irregularities at the surface of the tofu that will make more of the sauce stick to the surface of the tofu , and the reduced water content will make it less likely for the tofu to break apart . The higher surface area may contribute to the perception of more flavor because you 'll have more of whatever salty solution you 've seasoned it with on your tongue . But inside the tofu you wo n't really get much additional flavor . Freeze-dried tofu removes most of the water from tofu and small holes form where water had previously been . When rehydrated and squeezed , you 'll be able to get a lot of a marinade to enter the tofu because there 's plenty of ways to get in there . The side effect is that the texture will be completely transformed into a sort of spongy mass , which can be pleasant on occasion but eventually gets a little tedious , so freeze-dried tofu is eaten only rarely and in small quantities in Japan and most of China . It 's frequently seen in lamb hot pots in China and occasionally in rustic simmered dishes in Japan . You can come close to the texture by actually freezing your tofu and then pouring boiling water over it a few times , but I usually just buy it from my local Japanese market . One form of marinated tofu sometimes seen in China involves very aggressively pressed/weighted tofu that 's been pushed between a muslin-like cloth for an extended period to drain . It 's often soaked or cooked in a soy and sugar solution with various spices , but most of the flavor and color is concentrated near the surface ; only some of the salt really seems to get to the center of that , so it 's often made in fairly thin blocks . I 've seen patted and pan-fried tofu used in Korea and occasionally in Japan , but it was typically not marinated ; it was typically cooked in a little oil until lightly browned and served with a dipping sauce of freshly-grated ginger and soy sauce . Deep-fried tofu also creates more surface area for sauces , especially if dusted with a starch like katakuriko or cornstarch , but it 's also generally only an occasional indulgence in Japan , China , and Korea , and also mostly affects capturing flavor that touches the surface of the tofu . ( I 'm less knowledgable about food as served in Southeast Asia , including Vietnam and Thailand , so I ca n't speak as authoritatively for all countries with a long history of serving tofu ) . I do n't know if it works well , but a Japanese TV show suggested that you can soak tofu in salted water to reduce the tendency for soft tofu to fall apart when stir-frying or braising . I have n't seen enough of a difference to justify regularly applying this technique and I have n't done a side-by-side comparison to be sure that it actually has much of an impact . But based on the guidance from that show , I suspect that if the marinade has any effect on structural integrity of the tofu , it 's due to salt and osmotic pressure .
I think you may reach the point of diminishing returns if you try and fix your oven because there 's lots that could be going wrong . It could be that your oven design is just bad , in which case you ca n't fix it anyway . It could be a faulty temperature sensor , or a bad gas valve , or a faulty burner . Your gas supply pressure could be inconsistent . By the time you replace all these you 'll have spent more than a new oven would cost . I 'd first clean it really well . Get all the dust and gunk out and see if that helps . Then you should see if you can find a pro who can have a look at it , test the gas supply , see if there 's any quick wins . One suggestion I 'd make would be to post this on the <URL> forum , the home improvement site . As this is more a question about mechanics and repair you 're likely to get a better answer there .
It will double in size when it is cooked , however the longer it is kept in the liquid the bigger it will grow until ultimately all liquid has been absorbed . A trick is to cook it separately , drain it , and toss with olive oil so it does n't clump . Then , add it to the rest of the soup , stirring well just before serving .
At least in the case of marinades containing acids ( such as vinegar or lemon juice ) or certain enzymes , especially from papayas , kiwis , or most commonly ( at least in the US ) , fresh pineapple juice , a certain amount of denaturing of the proteins will occur at the surface of the marinated meat . This will turn it opaque rather than translucent -- chicken will look kind of white . This is perfectly normal , and safe . Depending on the color of the marinade , and the particular cut being marinated , some of the marinade may also penetrate into the meat , changing its color as well . These are normal effects , and assuming you have otherwise respected good practices ( keeping the meat refrigerated during the marination , not holding the food uncooked longer than would be safe without the marinate , and not cross-contaminating and so on ) , the product should be safe to eat . In the case of your meat marinated triple the planned time , the outcome will depend on the nature of the particular marinade . If there was active enzymatic action , it could be very mush to the point of unpleasantness . On the other hand , if the marinade was mostly for flavor , rather than highly acidic , it might just have a more intense flavor from the marinade . Edit : I should add for clarity , above means ...
This deli meat you speak of is generally made of small scraps of mechanically-separated meat that are essentially " glued " together into a solid mass by enzymes that partially break down the tissue . This processed " meat brick " does n't really have the same texture as an intact muscle tissue , which has individual muscle fibers aligned along a " grain " that makes it pleasantly chewy . Folding/layering/rolling slices of processed meat gives it more of a texture and chew , and tricks you into thinking you 're eating an actual piece of animal muscle instead of meat-flavored jelly .
Tofu is high in protein , with a neutral PH. And it ( normally ) does n't contain any preservatives like salt , sugar or nitrates . Bacteria love foods like that . If it 's past the date , chuck it out .
Grilling/broiling would be a good alternative to pan frying , as the more intense heat will crisp the skin much more effectively than baking . It is a generally healthier cooking method because the food is not sitting in oil ; any fat will drip off into the grill pan .
It means to combine the things listed up to and including the cloves , as in " combine ingredients 4 through 11 " . In that recipe it 's just a helpful hint to tell you where the dry ingredients stop . The recipe is already calling for ground cloves - it mixes them into dry ingredients as-is . When using whole cloves , if you do n't immediately just grind them , you generally cook them in something liquid then strain them out later . ( Similar to cinnamon sticks or whole allspice . ) The cinnamon and nutmeg in the recipe are also ground , not whole . If a recipe wants whole cloves , it will explicitly say , and often count them : 10 [ whole ] cloves .
How yellow were you expecting it ? How much saffron did your recipe call for ? Generally , when a recipe calls for a " pinch " of saffron that can be anywhere from 15-20 stems ( expensive , I know ) . Saffron can take time to impart it 's yellow coloring , and the depth of that yellow can vary based on the quality , age , or phase of the moon ( not really ) . Some things you can try include : Soaking the saffron in hot water/stock for 20 minutes to an hour prior to adding . Grinding the saffron with a mortar/pestle Using more or a higher quality Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot of images are n't purely saffron induced coloring . Often turmeric is used for an additional punch , or even food coloring . Here is an example of an <URL> . Finally , your primary reason for using saffron should be for it 's remarkable and unique flavor . The yellow is just a bonus . If you want more than what your batch can give you , well ... cheat . :)
I usually let it soak overnight , though it is n't necessary to soak that long . You should soak it till it forms a paste/gel like consistency and it would take at least 2-3 hours , though <URL> claims under ten minutes ( time might vary depending on the batch of the seeds ) . You could also soak it in any juice or fruit extract as well . Additionally , you can also use it in its raw form without soaking , the way one would use poppy/sesame seeds .
Yes that 's exactly what it means , apply salt to the steak . You should n't coat it , but you should apply salt very liberally . It 's actually hard to over-salt a steak ; many inexperienced cooks actually underseason the steak . I suggest about 1 tsp per side for a good ribeye . Salt it about 10-15 minutes prior .
Microwaving meat to defrost it tends to start cooking it at the edges and generally make it go weird and rubbery ( scientific terms I know ) . So yes , it is better to defrost ' naturally ' in the fridge , in terms of quality . Freezing damages meat by bursting the cell walls as their water expands . This affects the texture more than the flavour . The damage is done when freezing , not cooking from frozen , so the latter should not effect taste . The main issue with cooking from frozen is that if the item is big ( say , a roasting joint ) , the outside can be overdone by the time the middle gets up to a safe temperature .
Yes , if you have access to sous vide equipment you can make them in less than a day . Here is the process I followed and it worked perfectly . <URL>
Marinades and Rubs are " surface treatments " only , they do not penetrate deeply into the meat . A brine is a deep treatment , which does penetrate by way of osmosis . For a quick explanation of this see <URL>
You will get the roasty , caramelized flavors ; how much influence they will have on the overall flavor of your stew will depend on several factors including : How deeply you roast the them How much you add , proportionately , into the stew How strongly flavored the other items in the stew are Roasting the vegetables will also cook them , so you will want to add them to the stew much later , so they do n't overcook . If you google <URL> , you will find several recipes for inspiration . As to whether this is a superior , or heartier flavor , that would be a matter of opinion . You do n't mention roasting celery or onions ( partners with carrots in the classic mire poix ) , but these are also excellent candidates for roasting , as are all types of root vegetable .
Strawberries turn a natural red color in their ripening process . This is usually a very strong , ruby-red color . Rest assured , strawberries in the US are not dyed . FDA clearly lists all adulteration done to fruits ( <URL> ) , but strawberries only has a regulation of when the product is <URL> , etc. . Note that even though dyed strawberries may not be sold in US , they may be exported in countries that permit it ( fruit intended for export is <URL> ) . Rest of the world is a different story . It would n't be uncommon for you to find strawberries that are picked too early in the process , or are just grown in poor conditions that are dyed red to give it the luscious red appearance . There have been <URL> - this color comes right off when washed , showing a white strawberry . Strawberries do leech a red fluid when washed , but that should n't result in a white strawberry .
Generally speaking , frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours . A good , heavy , screaming hot pan is required . Oil the steak , not the pan , with vegetable or groundnut oil ( olive oil will burn ) , and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour . If your steak is thick , you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150 ° C until the centre is 10 ° C off your desired doneness level ( if you do n't have a digital probe thermometer , invest the small amount they cost , it is completely worth it ) , then sear the outside on your mega hot pan . This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right .
Salt moves due to differences in concentration , from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration . So , when you boil brined fish , you surround the salty flesh with low salt concentration liquid , and thus the salt moves out to equalize the concentrations . Steaming the fish will not result in as much movement of salt , because steaming applies less total liquid to the surface of the fish . Steaming works because the very hot steam condenses onto the cooler food , and by condensing it liberates heat ( which transfers to the food ) . However , you still will have some movement of salt because the condensed steam on the surface of the fish remains at a lower salt concentration . Also , steaming is much gentler on the fish , since the meat is not being constantly agitated by boiling water . With less agitation comes less leaching . Grilling is the transfer of heat from pan to food , or from direct heat source to food . The temperatures are typically much higher than for steaming ( steam is at 212F , 100C ) , so you get entirely different chemical effects from the process ( e.g. , caramelization ) . Therefore , I doubt the fish would " fry " in its own oil in the case of steaming . If you 're concerned about maintaining the salinity of your brined fish , you could consider steaming it en Papillote , or even in foil . This would result in the fish cooking in its own moisture , essentially eliminating the leaching of salt ( although some salt would move to the surface , carried by the water ) .
Bread is mostly flour and water . Flour comprises a small amount of protein ( gluten , which is responsible for the bread 's elasticity or chewiness ) and a large amount of starch ( specifically two molecules called amylose and amylopectin ) . The process involved in bread baking - in massively oversimplified terms - accomplishes two things : Development of additional gluten ; and <URL> . The latter - starch gelatinization - is the important part in the context of this question . In order for the starch to gelatinize , it needs to be completely dissolved in water and then heated , which breaks up its original crystalline structure . This process can not be reversed ... except , it sort of can . Gelatinized starch undergoes another process called <URL> . At lower temperatures , these starch molecules will actually start to realign themselves back into their original crystalline structure or something similar , and during the process they will force out water . That is why refrigerated bread often appears to have a soggy exterior , and frozen bread may develop a layer of frost on the top . This process does n't happen on a large scale , but it is enough to make the bread go stale . But remember that bread is mostly water . When you heat it again , as in the microwave , you are significantly improving the solubility of these reformed crystalline molecules , which causes them to dissolve again . Essentially you are re-hydrating the dehydrated ( stale ) bread with its own water . As you 've noticed , the taste is n't great . You ca n't change the fact that the bread has lost water , and a non-trivial amount of great protein and other flavour in the process . The reheated bread is kind of limp and soggy and fragile because the protein ( gluten ) is what was holding it together . But it 's softer . If you 've got very stale bread , another trick you can use is to wrap it in a cloth dampened with hot water for a few minutes , or use a paper towel and microwave the whole thing for a short time . That will do a lot more to hydrate the retrograded starches instead of relying on whatever water is left in the super stale bread .
If you have n't done it before do n't do this for Xmas day , it 's not worth the risk . Always practise on less important occasions You need a wider , rather than taller pot . Nearly a paella style pan . And a strong arm Ingredients wise , I do n't know of any magic scaling tricks for risotto The hardest part is stirring enough , but not too much , and doing an even job of it Probably easier to have two pots going at the same time , rather the one large pot . Then you can have two different flavours going !

Should I buy a mechanical chopper ?
I have tried a number of similar tools and find that the Pampered Chef " <URL> " to be the best-in-breed for choppers . It is sturdy , it is well built and will last . reliable , after cleaning it assembles easily and works consistently easy to clean , opens up easily and is dishwasher safe . I find this model works well for small chopping tasks , such as those advertised with the " slap chop " . If you have more than " a handful " of material to chop you will do well to divide it into smaller bundles . Much more and it is time to move to a larger device . Mine if 5-6 years old , with no signs of slowing down . I am not a Pampered Chef rep I do not broadly endorse their products . Many of their items are " not so good "
I think that washing pre-washed greens is an issue of emotional security , if you do n't trust the purveyor . As the <URL> : Many pre-cut , bagged , or packaged produce items like lettuce are pre-washed and ready-to-eat . If so , it will be stated on the packaging . If the package indicates that the contents are pre-washed and ready-to-eat , you can use the produce without further washing . It certainly does no harm , but you then have to also dry them for most uses , so it is more work , and kind of redundant : you have paid a premium price to buy the greens already washed . If you are going to wash them yourself , why not buy less expensive produce , and perhaps have more control over what goes into your mix ?
It should be firm , not mushy , but not rock hard either . The most important thing , however , is smell . An unripe pineapple wo n't smell like anything . An overripe pineapple will smell vinegary . A ripe pineapple will smell sweet .
If you cook ( or bake ) using a timer , you should always use preheated equipment . Your stove top may differ from my stove top in terms of the length of time it would take to get to high heat ( hell , my stove top would n't even hit high heat in three minutes ) , and this would greatly effect the final quality . Always preheat , the instructions expect it . Otherwise , it would tell you to put a pan on the stove top , place in pan , and turn on to high heat . Leave for three minutes and remove .

For particularly pungent onions they go in the crisper drawer to keep the smell from being too strong in the rest of the fridge , but usually they 're just on one of the shelves . <URL> 2-3 days but my personal experience says otherwise . Generally in our house , they do n't last long enough for the flavor to degrade too much , but they will get a little dried and the smell will get stronger over time . After a week , they should n't be bad in the sense that you 'll get sick - but you 'll want to use them in a meal where the onion is the star , as the aroma will take over the dish . Another option that I 'm a big fan of is to dice or strip the leftovers ( or , a 5 lb bag at once ! ) and freeze them on a cookie sheet ( instead of in a bag , where they 'll turn into a giant clump ) . Once fully frozen , dump them into a plastic freezer bag , and store in the freezer for easy access to a handful at a time . For most applications , you can defrost them right in the pan/pot/casserole as you cook , so they 're very handy and accessible . We do the same with peppers in our house for convenience .
<URL> , using olive oil to fry is basically a waste of money . " After I 'd heated them , none of the olive oils had much olive flavor left . In fact , they did n't taste much different from the seed oils . " According to a <URL> I have access to , you could use high oleic sunflower oil for frying as it degrades better .
A Christmas cake is a large cake and you 're cooking it for a long time . Insulating and padding the tin helps prevent the outside of the cake from scorching before the inside is properly cooked .
Hey guys , since the question was posted they opened up <URL> , which specifically caters to this need . They supply chemicals for molecular gastronomy in consumer-sized portions . For $ 10 or less apiece , you can order small amounts of emulsifiers , gelling agents , foaming agents , etc. . They also have spherification kits , the Texturas products , and Molecule-R 's lineup .
Technically you should be able to make almost anything you 'd be able to make in a metal dish , in a glass dish , but if the preparation calls for one then you ca n't simply substitute the other willy-nilly . It will likely require a good deal of fine-tuning . Glass is an insulator . It absorbs heat . That 's why solar panels are glass and why having a window in your home is not like having a gaping hole in your wall . As a consequence of this , ( a ) it will take a longer time for the dish itself to come up to oven temperature , ( b ) it will cook much more consistently and evenly , even if you have an oven that turns the element on and off to maintain temperature , and ( c ) it will continue cooking the food after you remove it from the oven , unless you remove the food from the baking dish immediately . What this means is that you generally have to extend the cooking time by at least 5-10 minutes ( more if you are baking at high temperatures ) when substituting glass bakeware for metal , to let the dish " pre-heat . " Except if you 're going to let the food cool inside the baking pan , in which case you might actually need to decrease the overall time to prevent burning afterward . It 's hard to be precise because it depends on what you 're cooking , how long you 're cooking it and at what temperature . To be honest , I probably would not use a glass dish for any recipe requiring caramelizing because caramelizing relies entirely on finely-controlled conduction ; ovens are less sensitive than a stove top but nevertheless , a few minutes too long and it 's burnt , a few minutes too short and it 's still solid . Better to choose a material that 's highly conductive for that , i.e. metal . Glass is best when you need slower , more even cooking , like casseroles .
A basic bechemel or broth based pot-pie filling will not expand significantly when being baked . It may bubble a little under the pastry from being simmered . You would the casserole up to maybe 1/2 inch ( 1 cm ) below the lip , and apply pastry on top of that . Less is fine if you have less filling .
Restaurants quite often cook pigs cheeks ' sous vide ' , but unless you have , or fancy investing in a water bath , you can do things the old fashioned way . How you prepare the cheeks for cooking will , to some extent , depend on which part you 're cooking . If you 're going to cook the whole cheek , you really should think about soaking in a brine of sugar , salt , vinegar and spices for 24 to 48 hours . If you 're just cooking the ' pad ' that part can be skipped . The thing to remember with cheeks , is they are quite a fatty meat and the muscle fibres are very dense , so whichever method you choose , it 's going to take time . One classic method is braising the cheeks with a variety of vegetables and something slightly sweet and sharp as a counter for the fat and cook in the oven for 2 to 3 hours at around 180c ( 350f ) Basically dust the cheeks in a little flour and season , then brown in some olive oil . remove form the pan and lightly sauté your vegetables , use leeks , baby onions , carrots , apples , garlic etc. add the cheeks pack to the pan , add some stock or stock/cider mix and cook . You could also do this on the hob ( cooker top ) in a heavy bottomed pan , but cook for 4 hours on a low heat .
I fill a tall frying pan ( or pot ) with water . Add some white vinegar . Let it come to a boil Add the eggs . Do n't make it too overcrowded Take it out with a flipper or a spoon with holes when they look done .
There are a few consideratons that I can think of : How durable the device is . Generally , this is going to mean that you want something metal &amp; heavy , but I 'd really look at reviews of any model that you plan to buy online , particularly from something like Amazon which lets you see those 1 star ratings , and you can see why people rated them so poorly . How it clamps down to the work surface . I do n't care how heavy it is , if it 's a hand-crank , it 's going to walk all over the place unless it 's well secured to your counter . If you do n't have a counter that 's got a lip that you can clamp to , and you do n't have a table that you 're willing to possibly mar from the clamps , you might have to look for something else ( or bolt/screw it down to a large board ) Size ( width ) of the feed . There are some that are larger , which might be useful for making some pastries as well as pasta . ( and then there 's dough sheeters , which are huge and expensive , but are 18 " or wider , typically ) . How many different thickneses the dial has , and what the min/max thickness is . Again , a thicker one can be used for other pastry applications , but it also makes it easier to work the ball through that first time . ( I 've only ever used one where the thickest size was a pain ... so it 's not a common problem . All I remember was it was a friend 's , and it was n't an Italian company ) Hand crank vs. motorized -- almost every hand crank roller can be converted ( as the handle detaches for storage , so the motor just connects there ) , but the difference in cost is significant . ( ~ $ 50 vs. ~ $ 150 . If you already have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer , they sell an roller kit , but it 's in that $ 150 range . ) Even if you got a motorized roller , I 'd look to make sure that the motor detaches and it had a hand crank ... as it lets you keep working should the motor go into thermal shutdown , but it also means typically means that the company sells the roller and motor individually should one part die down the road . ( you should try to verify that , though ) Accessories -- so , other than an add-on motor , the two main accessories you 'll see are cutters ( fettucini and something thinner are typical ) , and ravioli stuffers . Personally , I 'd say the raviolli stuffers are n't worth it . If you want consistently sized ones , get one of those little forms that you run a rolling pin over to cut , as the cleaning of the attachment ones means it 's not worth it unless you 're making a huge batch . ( which you can do , then freeze 'em , but I never have ) . I think the cutters are worth it ( and are typically included in even the $ 40-60 models ) if you 're going to make fettucini . For the thinner strand pastas , I actually prefer extrusion over rolling . ( although , I think capellini/angel hair may need to be rolled vs. extruded , but I 'm not a fan of that size of pasta ) . For wider noodles , it 's generally not a big deal to hand-cut 'em . As for the question on price ... not really . There are a few major price bands for the good motorized vs. non-motorized , and most stores keep 'em in those ranges . The really cheap ones are going to break , or jam , as they just have a lower build quality . If you see something much over $ 150 , I 'd question it . Unless it had an exceptionally wide roller ( and that was a feature you wanted ) , I ca n't think of a reason to shell out that much . I 'd try to stick with a model that I could find well reviewed ( with at least a dozen people having reviewed it if it 's purchaser-submitted vs. something like Consumer Reports or America 's Test Kitchen ) , and preferably , a model that 's been on the market for years , as there 's very little innovation -- a brand new model was likely made to trim costs , or because it 's something the company never made before ( and thus , untested ) .
I would not recommend doing so . The technique you describe is known as <URL> , which as you might guess from the name is a <URL> in the French culinary tradition . It translates literally to " mount with butter " and is used to provide a rich , velvety mouthfeel to both white and brown sauces . By contrast , <URL> sauce originates in Japanese cuisine , which is a whole different tradition . Like Chinese cuisine and other east Asian cooking , Japanese cuisine does n't make use of much dairy , <URL> . Teriyaki sauce is generally a <URL> that gets its richness from a high proportion of sugar and can be thickened with cornstarch ( as seen in <URL> ) . You could try mounting a teriyaki sauce with butter , but my suspicion is that you might cause some of the sugar in the glaze to seize and crystallize by introducing cold butter ( as typically recommended when mounting ) and it would not be common in the culinary tradition that teriyaki comes to us from . So you can skip this step without causing any harm to your sauce or offense to any French or Japanese bystanders .
Are there different qualities in prepared Hoisin sauces ? Think of it like barbecue sauce or chili powder : every company has their own recipe , and it 's always hard to know the precise justification for a specific price . The high price on one may be part of their premium brand image , and have nothing to do with the quality of the ingredients . Ultimately , you just have to try a few brands and decide which flavor appeals to you , and whether you find the price reasonable . If so , would I be better served by making my own ? As far as I can tell , hoisin sauce does not need to be fermented , so it 's going to be much easier to make authentic hoisin sauce at home than something like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce . It 's more like making your own barbecue sauce . A few different websites have minor variations on this recipe : <URL> Is it worth the effort ? That 's a matter of personal opinion . It 's probably hard to justify on purely economic terms ; do you really use more than a few cents worth of hoisin sauce in any given meal , and are the ingredients that much cheaper than the product itself ? But of course , there are other reasons to cook than just to save money . I think you 've just inspired me to try making my own hoisin sauce :) If I make my own , how long will it keep for ? Each of those ingredients can last months on its own , often without any refrigeration , and together would create a highly acidic and antimicrobial environment . The worst that might happen to homemade hoisin sauce in several months of refrigerated storage is it might separate a bit and have to be remixed .
I have looked extensively and it seems that whether to boil or steam is determined by region and it is as subjective as the fillings used . See below from this <URL> . Other variations include using black instead of white glutinous rice , or precooking the rice and filling , or steaming instead of boiling , or even wrapping into a cylindrical shape or a flat paddle shape instead of a pyramidal one . You may be able to make a decision based on certain factors of your recipe . For example : Some recipes call for the rice to be soaked while others call for it to be cooked . If I was using soaked rice I would probably choose boiling as the zongzi may become too dry with steaming . Same idea for other ingredients . Another consideration would be how well the zongzi are wrapped . If they are wrapped very skillfully , either way could work . However , if not , the filling could come out much easier with boiling . So , in the end , I would say that there really is n't a really definitive answer . I think I would use the method called for in the recipe as there may be specific reasons the prescribed cooking method was chosen .
I feel your pain . If only I liked summer squash better ... You definitely can freeze squash -- thick slice it , blanch it in salty water briefly until almost tender , transfer to an ice bath until it 's chilled , bag it , and put in the freezer . Later , thaw and use with recipes that do n't require ultra-crisp squash .
Firstly , it strikes me as odd that your recipe has no raising agent - no baking powder , no bicarbonate/baking soda , no self-raising flour . Unless you 're whipping a lot of air into the batter , the cakes will barely rise , and you will end up with ' cookies ' . I would add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda ( baking soda ) and see if that helps . As for the temperature of your oven , I would n't go so far as to halve the temperature and double the time . The idea is that you need enough heat for the cakes to rise at a decent rate then form a crust on the outside . 100 degrees will do little but slowly dry the cakes out . Domestic ovens are rarely well calibrated , so your oven may be running hotter than the dial indicates . Invest in an oven thermometer to make sure you are setting the temperature correctly : I have had an oven run 40 degrees hotter than the dial said before now ! If you have n't got the time to get a thermometer , try setting the oven about 20 degrees cooler on the dial , to around 180 degrees .

What 's the fluid that comes out from cheese after heating it up ?
It is almost certainly either fat , water , or a combination of the two which was squeezed out of the cheese as a result of the heating . The heating would cause the proteins in the cheese to further tighten , squeezing out the liquid , which is why you may not see it until heating the cheese .
If you 're at all like me , you are reassured by hard numbers and measurables . This should help . In this situation one of the likely pathogens would be one of the Salmonella species . Salmonella is killed by temperatures in excess of 130 F ( 55 C ) . However , it 's not an instant death . The time to kill Salmonella decreases exponentially as the temperature increases . The following table represents all the temperature and duration to kill 99.9999 % of the most heat-resistant strain Salmonella senftenberg . This species is as much as 30x more heat resistant than a " normal " S. typhimurium . Temperature | Time --------------- | ------ 140 F ( 60 C ) | 60m 150 F ( 65 C ) | 10m 160 F ( 70 C ) | < 2m For any given temperature the proportion of bacteria killed is constant . 1/6th the time kills 90 % , 1/3rd kills 99 % , 1/2 kills 99.9 % etc. . USDA guidelines to kill Salmonella and E. Coli are as follows : Temperature | Time --------------- | ------ 135 F ( 57 C ) | 86.4 m 140 F ( 60 C ) | 8.6 m 145 F ( 63 C ) | 2.7 m 150 F ( 65 C ) | 51.9 s 160 F ( 70 C ) | < 6s 165 F ( 74 C ) | < 2s So , needless to say , re-searing your steak at a typically high stove top temperature ( at least 300 F [ 149 C ] ) for even a fraction of a second will result in utter devastation to whatever beastie population you may have picked up in recontaminating your meat . Chances are , if the steak came hot out of the pan , and you removed it from the plate quickly , the residual heat alone would be enough to kill it . The re-sear certainly does n't hurt though . A good rule of thumb is to wash plates as you go . If this is not possible or convenient you should minimally remove the plate from your vicinity by putting it in the sink or dishwasher as soon as you have taken the food off of it .
Actually , I think " the Internet " is wrong on this one , assuming that we are talking about proper caramel sauce . In most of candy making , you are very careful of crystalization . You are working with a supersaturated sugar solution , and it is looking for the slightest excuse to precipitate . Stirring will clump the sugar out of the solution into crystals . Some candy types need to be perfectly smooth , while others ( like fudge ) get their characteristic texture from careful management of crystal size . You should n't be stirring there at all . But once you have reached caramelization , you can stir . What you have in the pan is no longer a supersaturated sugar solution , but caramelization products mixed in a less-concentrated sugar solution . In other words , you have caramel , which is a substance quite different from sugar syrup . And it does not clump into crystals . It is amorphous in its structure , not a crystal , and it 's actually got some viscosity ( if you leave a clump a solid caramel around for years , it will flow a few centimeters ) . And you are not just dealing with pure caramel , but with caramel sauce , which also has lots of liquid added in the form of cream . So much liquid would have also prevented the sugar syrup from crystalizing if it had been added earlier . So , to summarize , you should n't stir a sugar solution during candy making , but you can stir both caramel and caramel sauce . It seems that somebody learned the rule about hot sugar solutions and decided that it applies in all kinds of candy making , without exceptions . But in fact , it does n't apply to caramel sauce .
The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick , which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold ; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2 " , maybe a little more than 1/4 " . The other " trick " is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets , which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich ; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you do n't have tension trying to pull the top piece away . Just do n't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak ; if you 've pounded the breast to 1/3 " thickness , then your cut should be no more than about 1/8 " . If you do it this way , you should n't even need to use toothpicks ; I never do , and I have n't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations .
A rainbowy layer is almost certainly oil . ( This is called <URL> . ) Earl Grey uses oil of bergamot for flavoring , and likely cheap teas you 've used have oil-based flavorings as well . It 's not surprising that the oil eventually separates , and there 's not really any way to avoid that without significantly modifying the tea , or using tea that does n't have quite so much oil . I would definitely expect the flavor to be stale after it 's left for a while - aromatic compounds are by nature volatile , and they 'll slowly escape . You might be able to prevent some loss of flavor by putting the tea in something airtight ( preferably a completely full container , so there 's not even air on the surface ) and chilling it , but it 's going to be a losing battle . You said the color was stale as well ; I do n't know exactly what processes would cause that , but in general , the only way you 're going to be able to slow down any chemical processes is by chilling the tea . In the end , the real answer is simply that it 's best to drink fresh tea . Your time would probably be better spent getting to where you can make it quickly - for example , get an electric kettle that can rapidly boil a single cup worth of water .
You can eat even shell . Ground shell is used in French <URL> to thicken the soup and make it more flavored .
No , it is not a good idea at all . It will be worse , not better . What you are missing here is that cocoa powder does not dissolve at all , never , it just disperses in water ( or milk ) . So there is no reason why methods for dissolving stuff would work with cocoa powder . You will need to use a method created for colloid-producing powders like cocoa powder , which is mostly starch with fat . This is why the answers to the other question recommend the slurry method . When you are dispersing an absorptive powder like starch , you always run a risk of clumping , and the slurry is designed to work around that problem . But starch also thickens much more under heat , so if you were to not just forego the slurry , but simply drop the cocoa powder into hot water , this would be the worst choice possible , leading to instant unbreakable clumps . The slurry method would n't work with hot water either , you 'll get clumps before you have created the slurry . So , the short answer is : if you try it , it wo n't " dissolve automatically " , it will produce an ugly undrinkable mixture of clumps .
To help get uniformly broken up ground beef : Choose an at least moderately fatty ( say 80-85 % ) grind , as very lean ground beef will tend to stick to itself more . Do n't compress it when you are bringing it home , as by setting other groceries on top . Do n't salt the meat before cooking , as salt tends to help it bind to itself . Break it up into chunks with your finger as you put it in the pan to brown . Do n't raise the heat too high , which leaves you less time to break it up as it browns . While it cooks , frequently break up chunks with your spoon or spatula The real key is the last one . There is always going to be certain variability in the size of chunks , unless you are very vigilant in breaking up the pieces fairly continuously . If you cook it in water , as per Cincinnati chili , you can get it very broken up , but it will be a different texture .
Among poultry , duck is exceptionally fatty , and a lot of its fat is directly underneath the skin . This can present a challenge when cooking , because we want the fat to render out and the skin to become crispy and delicious . The most common way to do this , classically , is to : Dock ( or less commonly , score ) the skin all over , to permit the fat an exit path ( when doing this , be careful to cut through the skin into the fat layer , but hopefully not into the meat itself ) Roast at a relatively low temperature for to permit the fat time to melt and drip away ; many recipes then finish on a higher temperature for crisping and browning Like all poultry , salting the duck a day ahead , and then letting it sit in the refrigerator will also promote crispiness , but it is far less of a factor with duck which cooks and renders for a longer period of time .
Wikipedia , as well as all 12 serbian recipes I found specify full-fat white brine cheese ( cow or sheep milk ) . Only one of them called for a type of cream in addition to the cheese . In Western Europe , Turkish groceries can carry typical Balkan white brine cheese . If you do n't have access to one , buy feta . Cow and sheep cheese are considered substitutes in Balkan cuisine - the cooks are aware that they have a difference in flavor , but they use what they have at hand , similar to the way that an apple recipe will call for crisp apples , but wo n't specify Pink Crisp or Elstar apples . So both cow and sheep feta will do in principle . But I have noticed that supermarkets sometimes carry expensive real Greek feta , which is high quality , and only cheap western-made cow feta-style cheese , which is of inferior quality and has a rubber texture . If you are not sure of the quality , go for the real imported feta ( which will be sheep ) , not the feta-style .
Cook 's Illustrated recommends storing lemons in the fridge in a tightly sealed ziptop bag with the excess air removed . I would imagine that the same applies to limes . As I understand it , the idea is to prevent air circulation in order to reduce the rate of dehydration . <URL>
This is really about water content , not flavor . Eggplant contains a lot of water , and there can be plenty left after baking or grilling . If you then make a mashed/pureed spread like this , that water could make it a lot more liquid than you want . That said , if you really thoroughly roast or grill the eggplant , you can get enough of the water out of it that you do n't really need to drain it . If you prick a couple small holes in it , and bake for something like 45 minutes to an hour at 400-450 ° F ( 200-230 ° C ) , or similarly grill until it 's well-charred , it 'll probably be dry enough . The exact details depend on the size of the eggplant , and what you 're trying to make out of it .
In all cheese making and especially with young cheeses like cream cheese , fat adds a lot to the flavor and texture . You can skim off extra fat but your cheese will be thinner and less richly flavored . Shaking the cream in wo n't help if you are using a fermented method ( as opposed to using boiling and acid to curdle the milk ) because it will separate out again during the fermentation . Your thickened , fermented milk will be richer on top where the cream rose . It will mix back in when you drain the cheese and form it .
... as long as it needs to , depending on a wide variety of factors . You can shape it for baking , put it in the fridge , let it rise , pull it out of the fridge and put it in the oven - no warming up time at all . If you are going to punch down/knead/form after it comes out of the fridge , you can do all that cold , and let it rise as long as it needs to before baking - which will depend on the dough and the room temperature . Or you can let the bulk dough warm a while .
Of course you can store them in the fridge . When things start to smell bad , you should toss it . From what I remember off hand , every pancake or cornbread batter recipe I 've read says about a week is safe .
( 1 ) Taste . When you salt your eggs DOES affect taste because it affects the way your tongue comes into contact with the salt . If you salt your eggs before or during cooking , some of all of the salt dissolves in the water that is in the eggs ( raw eggs , overall , are roughly 75 % water ) and is dispersed over the surface of your eggs while they cook . When you salt your eggs after cooking , crystals of salt remain on the egg and , when these crystals come into contact with your tongue directly , they produce a brighter salty taste . So basically , the way your tongue registers saltiness depends on concentration , not just amount . Think about how differently a pinch of salt tastes directly on the tongue as opposed to the way that same pinch would taste if dissolved in a drop of water . So ... the tongue registers a brighter salt taste when it comes in contact with salt directly . That does n't mean that salting eggs after cooking is better - it means that it affects perception of salt differently . Go with whichever you prefer personally . ( 2 ) Texture . Whenever I have a question about food science , I consult Harold McGee 's book " On Food and Cooking , The Science and Lore of the Kitchen . " He states unequivocally that salt DOES NOT toughen eggs . According to McGee , the only egg preparation that is harmed by the addition of salt is and egg white foam ( whipped egg whites ) . So from the standpoint of texture , salt whenever you feel called to do so . Controlling the heat when you fry an egg is the single more important factor in determining the texture of your cooked eggs .
The biggest reason to heat milk to almost boiling before fermenting is that it improves the texture of the yogurt . During fermentation the bacteria consume lactose and produce lactic acid which causes the milk proteins to denature and coagulate trapping most of the fat . The proteins involved are primarily the casein proteins . When this happens , there is still quite a bit of protein left that is n't bound up in the new casein mesh . All of the albumin proteins are water soluble and will not add to the structure of the yogurt . These albumin proteins denature when they are heated . For this reason recipes universally call for the milk to be heated to 190 and then cooled . The albumin is denatured and is able to tangle up with the casein during fermentation and add to the yogurt structure . Skipping this step will make a very profound difference to the structure of your yogurt . Without it your yogurt will be thinner and much more fragile . When you scoop it there will be more whey and all that albumin will wash out in it . According to Harold McGee ( On Food and Cooking pp 48 ) " These treatments improve the consistency of the yogurt by denaturing the whey protein lactoglobulin , whose otherwise unreactive molecules then participate by clustering on the surfaces of the casein particles . With the helpful interference of the lactoglobulins , the casein particles can only bond to each other at a few spots , and so gather not in clusters but in a fine matrix of chains that is much better at retaining liquid in its small interstices . "
In a cup with water . You place them straight up in a small cup with a little water . Just like you would if you were storing flowers . You 'll want to store this in your chill chest on the top most rack ; to avoid any cross contamination from other possible food products ( chicken , etc ) . You may want to leave the rubber band on to allow it to stay tidy . If you must you can cover your asparagus cup with a zip lock bag on top . With this method we usually can store asparagus for 5-7 days . If you must keep them longer it maybe better to just freeze them in an air tight bag . after they 're dried out .
They are just a " product number " , and it may vary for the same kind of pasta from a manufacturer to another .
" Proteiny " usually indicates " umami " , the so-called " fifth flavor " after sweet , sour , bitter , and salty . It 's triggered by glutamates . Common sources of umami include beef , mushrooms , some seaweeds ( most especially nori ) , rinds of some hard cheeses ( most especially pecorino romano ) and tomato paste . I would n't be at all surprised if the store-bought jerkies you are comparing it to include monosodium glutamate , a common food additive that is essentially concentrated umami flavor .

Why boil and cool jam before using it in a cake ?
This step is not about food safety , it 's about consistency and in fact about three properties of your jam : Jam comes in a wide variation of consistencies , one parameter is " stiffness " , another " water content " and a third " smoothness " . In baking , you want smooth ( no lumps ) jam that is speadable enough to form a thin layer ( especially if used as a " glue " ) , yet thick enough not to " bleed " into your baked layers . What you basically do is play with the <URL> in your jam - a warm pectin solution ( aka jam ) is soft , cold pectin solution is solid , softening goes quickly , re-solidification takes some time . But enough " kitchen chemistry " , here 's the practical approach : Warming your jam makes it liquid enough to be easily spreadable and , if necessary , to strain out any lumps of fruit . Sometimes a good stir can give similar results , but stirred jam wo n't solidify again afterwards . Boiling the jam lets water evaporate , thus thickening or " hardening " the jam ( once it solidifies again ) . This can be advisable if you have a rather thin or soft ( " watery " ) jam in the beginning . Especially under marzipan you want no excess liquid in the jam to avoid softening the marzipan layer or cause it to slip . The boiling is optional , it needs some experience to determine whether it 's really necessary for the specific brand of jam and the specific use . Cooling down the jam again has two reasons : Not all baked goods take well to being drenched with hot liquid and the possible thickness of a layer is partly determined by the consistency of the jam . Especially sponges etc. tend to soak up liquid jam , resulting in a coloured stripe of dough instead of a distinct layer of jam . ( Note that there is also the technique of brushing hot baked goods like danishes with hot apricot jam for a glossy sheen , but that 's not what we are talking about here ) But you also do n't want to wait until the pectin has solidified the jam again , because then you would be back to square one . Depending on the intended use , you let the jam cool until it has reached the desired consistency - still rather liquid under marzipan ( as it will solidify on the cake quickly ) or almost solid but easily spreadable for a distinct layer in your sponge that still can hold the cake layers together . Note that most recipes say " cool " but not " cool completely " .
I 'm writing this so it helps someone else . I decided to freeze my fondant because I did n't have time to air dry the fondant like @Sunishtha Singh suggested . I did n't want the fondant to become too dry either by adding the tylose/CMC powder or use the gum paste/satin ice because personally , I prefer the flavour of fondant better than gumpaste . So , I found <URL> link and <URL> one and decided to follow the instructions . But I did add a bit of guess work and common sense and instead of freezing the fondant panels for 15-20 minutes , I only froze for 10 minutes and did n't open the fridge/freezer until the 10 minutes were finished . I also put the panels in the freezer at the same time and worked very quickly to attach the panels once the 10 minutes were finished . Once I attached the panels , I switched on the aircon but not for more than 15-20 minutes and it seemed to be fine , even considering that it had been raining all day . I do n't know what role does the fridge play in this but I have a frost free fridge . I also used black fondant for the panels and even though I personally find it much more moist than the white fondant , the panels attached nicely and the shoebox looked very smooth , at least from the sides . I hope this helps someone and I give the fondant freezing a thumbs up :)
Every substitution is probably going to require other alterations . Baking soda 's effects extend beyond leavening : it generally reacts with acidic ingredients ( making the batter less sour ) and also provides sodium ions which can affect flavor . If the substitute does n't react with acid as strongly , you may need to decrease acid ingredients or substitute neutral ingredients to obtain the same flavor ( e.g. , milk instead of buttermilk or yogurt , regular cream instead of sour cream ) . If the substitute does n't have sodium , sometimes adding a bit of salt may be necessary . As for the leavening action itself , any substitute will introduce its own issues in adapting . Unless you 're experienced with this sort of thing ( or like to " experiment " and possibly have cakes that fail in various ways ) , I would generally recommend finding a cake recipe that has leavening agents you actually have on hand , rather than trying a substitute . There are really only two common substitutions that often wo n't affect texture or flavor in major ways : ( 1 ) Potassium bicarbonate - can usually be substituted 1:1 for baking soda , but is generally tougher to find than baking soda . ( Look sometimes for it at drugstores ; baking soda itself can often be found as " sodium bicarbonate " or some other name in other countries at drugstores too . ) Without the sodium ions , you may need to add a bit of salt , roughly 1/4 or 1/3 of the amount of baking soda will be sufficient for flavor . ( 2 ) Baking powder - also often harder to find in other countries than baking soda . Also , other countries may have other formulations than what is found in the U.S. For standard U.S. baking powder , you 'd generally use 2-4 times the amount of baking soda in the recipe . The reason for this inexact ratio is a trade-off in flavor vs. reactivity . If you want the same reactivity with acidic ingredients , you 'd need 3-4 times more baking powder , but this often results in a " baking powder flavor , " sometimes described as " metallic . " But if you decrease the amount to avoid this flavor -- maybe twice as much as baking soda -- you wo n't react with as much acid , so you probably would want to reduce the amount of acidic ingredients in the batter . For baking powder outside the U.S. , you 'd need to look up the exact formulas/mixtures used and perhaps make further alterations . ( I 'm not going to go into the less common chemical alternatives -- like baker 's ammonia -- which are even less common for baking today . And I 'm not even going to bother with possibilities like homemade potash from wood ashes , which theoretically can provide some leavening . If you 're in a country where you 're that desperate for chemical leaveners , I 'd doubt you 'd have access to basic baking materials . ) Unfortunately , as mentioned , these two options are generally less common to find exact equivalents than baking soda . So , we move onto less reliable options that will require further recipe modification . ( 3 ) Egg whites as leavening - separate eggs and beat whites separately , generally to soft or medium peaks . Usually , fold into batter at the last moment ( generally in stages , first mixing in a portion of the egg whites more thoroughly to lighten , then gently folding in the remainder ) and bake immediately . This will only work by itself with relatively light cakes that do n't have a lot of heavy ingredients . Adding a small amount of sugar toward the end of beating may have a stablizing effect and prevent early collapse of a cake . Cream of tartar or a very small amount of other acids like lemon juice or vinegar can also prevent overbeating . ( Note that even if eggs are not separated , beating whole eggs or yolks until light colored will add in small amounts of air . ) ( 4 ) Creaming method - ignore recipe instructions and begin by creaming butter and sugar together until fluffy , often requiring at least 10 minutes of steady beating with a mixer for maximum results . ( By hand , this generally would be done for an hour or more traditionally . ) This will trap air bubbles that will ultimately leaven the batter ( the traditional method for pound cakes ) . This works better than egg whites alone for heavier batters ( e.g. , with more flour and/or butter ) , but it still will result in a denser cake than one with baking soda . Generally , continue after creaming butter and sugar by adding eggs one at a time while mixing vigorously , then fold in other ingredients more gently toward the end . ( If the recipe calls for a liquid sugar , like molasses or honey or whatever , substitute with dry sugar for more creaming action . ) ( 5 ) Yeast - there are <URL> devoted to the problems of converting a chemically leavened cake into a yeast-leavened one . Yeast is probably the only way to actually get the same volume without baking soda or other chemical leaveners , but it will usually change the cake texture significantly . Basically , yeast cakes tend to be tougher and more bread-like , while chemically leavened cakes tend to go for a softer cru
Structure is the main reason a tube pan is used for angel food cake . Angel food cake rises a lot , but does not have much of any gluten network or other means of supporting this structure . The egg whites can hold the air bubbles initially , but will lose them eventually . ( Hence you should not delay baking after the batter is mixed , and you should treat the batter gently , spooning into the pan and taking care to not slam the pan around . ) The tube pan helps because as the batter rises , it can " climb " the pan , sticking to the edges . This is also why angel food cake is left to cool upside-down in the pan for an unusually long time ; it should not be removed from the pan until it is completely set . If it were n't for the tube , the center of the cake would not have anything strong to hold it up , so it would collapse . This is not an issue for cupcakes because they are so small .
It is n't necessary to even thaw bones before tossing them in the water , so long as you 're cooking long enough . With that said , to roast first and then toss in the stock , the goal is to get some browning going ( I 'm assuming your recipe says to roast at a relatively high temp like 400 ) to add some flavor , much like browning the meat at the bottom of a pot for a stew . Tossing them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 30-45 minutes will brown them for you and you 're not too worried about getting the insides cooked ( the core reason to why people do n't try to roast frozen meat ) . Stocks in general is as far from an exact thing as any recipe can go . There was this interesting article talking about all the differences in schools ... <URL> So in conclusion ... it is n't necessary . If you 're a stickler for recipes or you 're trying to duplicate something as close as you can , thaw the bones .
Yellow cake made from scratch is given its color and flavor from egg yolks . A cake mix from a box , although you did n't add any eggs to it , might already have egg product in it . If it was one of the major brands of cake mix then it will likely have additives such as flavorings and food color to give it its distinctive flavor and color . In the homemade realm a white cake is made with only egg whites and a yellow cake is made with both whites and yolk .
Yes , this works , as long as you do n't boil them too long . The idea is that by the time they get roasted properly ( e.g. your potatoes are browned on the outside ) the inside is only just cooked , not overcooked . I 'd aim for very roughly half cooked , starting to be pokeable with a fork but not actually tender . For flavorful things like beets , you may lose some flavor into the water , but they should still be quite good . If you want to avoid this , though , you can just steam them instead , or even microwave . It 's not really much more trouble than boiling ! If you do this , and get the timing right , it wo n't really affect the taste or texture much at all compared to just roasting .
Salt ( Sodium chloride ) is salt . As a topping , flakes are commonly used purely for presentation purposes only . The taste is the same , but gets more intense as the salt particles get finer , so use less if the salt is in powder form As an ingredient , use any form you are happy with , and is economical to use . Once salt is dissolved into water it will be identical to any other form of salt For health reasons , finely powdered salt is preferable as much less is required to impart a salty taste
There are at least three potential downsides : wood is quite light , so you will not get the benefit of added weight of the pestle for crushing ; many wooden mortars have a smooth texture , which will not aid in the grinding as much as , e.g. , a coarse ceramic mortar ; and wood is porous -- increasingly so as it dries over time -- so it may have the tendency to pick up the flavors of its contents .
Flouring the beef does two things : It facilitates the development of a crust on the outside of the meat that is brown and flavorful ; It contributes to the development of the sauce , as the starch will dissolve off of the meat into the sauce , where it will swell at about 180 F , helping to thicken the sauce . In this particular recipe , the flour is the only source of thickening , so it is being used for both purposes , but mostly for the second , where it is essentially creating a roux as your brown the beef , because you are also cooking the flour in the olive oil . In this recipe , omitting it would give you a much thinner sauce .
Yes , it changes the texture . If you want it light , you need to use it quickly , as the bubbles will disappate over time .
According to <URL> , the melting point of piperine - the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper - is 130 degrees celsius , so it 's definitely not a given that anything you 'll be cooking will heat all of the piperine above 130 degrees celsius - at which point you 'd begin to get significantly faster decomposition ( and lose the peppery flavor ) . Now , the maillard reaction does n't occur until around 155 celsius , so for cooking steak it 's pretty much a given that the outside of the steak ( including all of the pepper on the surface ) will get hot enough to melt and begin to decompose , so it 's certainly possible that you 'd lose much of the pepper flavor from the actual peppercorns . So the two questions are , how much is actually lost ? and where does it all go ? Most recipes that call for crusting cooked meat with black pepper call for a coarse grind . One good reason for this is that by minimizing surface area , you are not allowing the piperine to heat up and decompose as quickly , so depending on how coarse your pepper is , and how hot you sear your steaks , you may have a not-insignificant amount of piperine left in your pepper . I have n't found a good source for how fast piperine breaks down at various temperatures so you 'd have to test this a bit to see how much of the flavor you could expect to lose . Probably more important is the " where does it all go ? " part of this question . For this you have to consider that even though the ultimate tempurature of the pepper is far above its melting point , during cooking it has heated up slowly , not instantly , leaving a good portion of time where the piperine was melting but before it was hot enough to decompose very quickly . During this phase , piperine can escape from the peppercorn , while still intact ( not decomposed ) and migrate through the steak ( or other dish ) . While cooking a steak , piperine should migrate far enough into the steak that it does not ultimately reach a temperature where it decomposes . This will cause that portion of the steak to be flavored with piperine . So , the benefit of heating the pepper is specifically so that it will melt and migrate into the dish ( i.e. meld with the foods ) , something that you do n't get by sprinkling it on the top afterwards .
A Baker 's ( now owned by kraft foods ) employee named Sam German developed a chocolate recipe that was sweeter than semi-sweet chocolate , as well as containing a blend of chocolate liquor , sugar , cocoa butter , flavorings , and lecithin . Baker 's honored Sam by naming the chocolate that he created Baker 's German 's Chocolate . In 1957 the recipe was published in a Dallas newspaper , although nobody is sure exactly when the recipe was originally created . Generally Foods - who had bought the brand - noticed that alot of people liked the recipe and started a PR campaign for German 's Chocolate using the recipe . They started sending it to newspapers all over - and people liked it . At some point the " 's " got dropped from the name , introducing all of the confusion we have about the origin of the cake today . References : <URL> <URL> <URL>
I 've never heard of milk being used to season a pan and so I am a little skeptical of it . Pan seasoning is always done with fat that is heated until it polymerizes . This creates a very hard non-stick surface that makes cooking easier and protects the pan from rust . See this question for more about how to season your pan : <URL> See the article linked in one of the answers : <URL> This process , while slightly more labor intensive , produces the best seasonings I 've ever seen .
Short answer - not really . Fat is an essential component in any cake , and milk just is n't very fatty - about 5 % for whole milk . You can make cakes with milk , but they require totally different recipes : you ca n't simply substitute milk for oil . Bear in mind that you 're distributing the cup of oil throughout a whole cake , so that any one slice will only have a fraction of the oil . I assume you 'll also be sharing the cake with others , so you 'll be ' spreading the calories ' somewhat . You should be using a neutral oil like canola ( rapeseed ) oil anyway , as it has a relatively mild flavour . A popular alternative these days is to substitute all but a couple of tablespoons of the oil with apple sauce ( really ) , but this can be hit and miss and does n't work with all recipes - it usually works best with things like quick breads ( scones etc ) . Of course , there 's also the point that cakes are supposed to be a treat , and they 'd be less of a treat without the fat , in which case why bother ? If you want to be healthy , make a salad . If you want a treat , make a cake and do n't worry about the contents too much .
I have halved cake recipes before without issue . The most complicated thing to worry about is halving an odd number of eggs , but <URL> addresses that . The finished product was indistinguishable from the full recipe . Edit One thing to note . In your specific case , because it 's a two-layer cake , halving is simple because you 're only cooking a single layer . Halving other cakes , such as a pound cake , or a bundt cake involves adjustments to the cooking time . A halved cake will cook much quicker , and could possibly need a lower temperature as well as a decreased cooking time .
I ca n't say why you 'd want to do this in general for other types of sponge cakes . But in the linked recipe it 's very clear . The reason is because the milk/butter mixture is heated " to just under a boil " and according to the instructions should still be at least " hot ( about 150F ) " when added . In this case , you take out a small portion of the batter , then add this hot liquid mixture to it . If you do n't mix rapidly while doing so and if the temperature is a little off and too hot , you run the risk of coagulating the eggs in the batter ( which would obviously not result in a desirable texture to add back into the rest of the batter ) . Here , as the recipe notes , you 're using this portion of the batter as a liaison , which is a fancy word for a mixture the serves as an intermediary temperature between something hot and something cooler . By adding the hot milk/butter mixture to a small portion of the batter ( rather than the whole batter ) , you cool it enough so that it wo n't risk coagulating eggs in the whole batter . But in the process , you need to whisk rapidly to avoid small egg bits forming curds and becoming solid , so you 're sacrificing some of the bubbles in this portion of the batter to create an appropriate intermediary temperature mixture , which then is presumably supposed to be gently folded back into the rest of the batter . Now , the question is why you 're heating the milk in the first place . There is a whole genre of cakes called " hot milk cakes " or " hot milk sponge cakes , " which seem to have originated in the early 20th century . They use this rather unusual mixing method , where you beat the sugar and eggs for a long time first , then add flour and dry ingredients , and then add liquid and fat at the end . I 'd speculate that the hot milk serves two purposes : ( 1 ) it helps melt the butter , which both allows the liquid butter to combine easier with the existing mixture and causes it to coat the flour better which results in a tender crumb ( less gluten network formation ) , and ( 2 ) it raises the temperature of the batter above room temperature , thus shortening the time before the cake structure starts to solidify while baking . My guess is that this is helpful because the sugar/egg foam is less stable than , say , a sugar/butter " creamed " foam ( as in a pound cake ) , and if you do n't get the eggs to coagulate fast enough , the whole thing might collapse . ( Again , that last part is just a guess . ) The goal is to end up with a very light and tender cake .
To extend what GdD said , the reason why yeast raised breads and quick breads are so different comes down to gluten development . Yeast raised breads have structure based on gluten , which is a protein created in wheat flours ( due to enzymatic action on other proteins in the flour ) over time in a moist environment , or when physically agitated . Gluten has a strong , elastic structure providing the toothsome bite typical of yeast raised breads . The techniques , which typically involve one or more of : Long , slow fermentation by yeast -- the physical raising of the dough not only leavens it , but also helps gluten development Kneading , to enhance quicker gluten formation So called autolysis , or allowing to set in cool conditions as a moist dough for slow gluten development without extra work from kneading The result is a strong gluten structure , trapping gas bubbles , giving the charactaristic texture of breads . Quick breads are the polar opposite . As a general class , they are intended to be tender and soft , not chewy and resilient . The " muffin method " used to create them intentionally minimizes gluten development by : Not using yeast to raise the dough Mixing a minimal amount to discourage gluten formation Baking immediately ( in most cases ) after the batter is combined , in order to mininize gluten development from sitting time in moist conditions . The result of course is a tender cake , bread , or muffin . Typical cake techniques such as the creaming method also control gluten development by : Pre-creaming the butter with sugar , and then adding the eggs prior to combining with flour . The fat/sugar phase then coats the flour particles minimizing their interaction , and discouraging gluten formation . Cake batters , like quick bread batters , are not usually held , minimizing time for passive gluten formation Each of these methods is tuned for the outcome desired , and they can not easily be swapped . That being said , there are quick breads which are less like the sweet cake like banana bread for example -- the most iconic is probably Irish soda bread , but this does not change the general fact that yeast raised breads are a very different beast due to the gluten development . Still , they are their own beast , and not like a yeast raised bread .
It definitely needs to cool to prevent burns - the filling is likely even above the boiling point of water , because it has so much sugar in it and has been in a hot oven . Eating it pleasantly warm is one thing , but it takes a long time to cool from over 100C/212F down to a nice warm/hot temperature somewhere around 50C/120F . ( It 's not like a cookie , which cools quickly enough so that you can ( carefully ) eat it fresh out of the oven . Pie has plenty of thermal mass . ) Besides that , most pies have a filling that will set as it cools . With a fruit pie , the sugary syrupy part will be pretty runny when it 's hot , but it 'll gel up a bit ( like a jam - plenty of fruit and sugar ) as it cools . And of course custard pies definitely need to cool to fully set !
The pretzel originates in Germany , where it is called Laugenbrezel . It was originally prepared in a alkali solution , which is where the " Laugen " part of the word comes from ; typically , lye was used , but baking soda gets you most of the way there without a trip to the pharmacy ( a Mexican or Asian market may do the trick if you want culinary lye ) . The alkali solution is what causes the crust to brown so deeply , and it 's most of the difference between a pretzel and a bagel . A bagel would typically be boiled in a malted sugar solution instead . The flavor is also affected , but I do n't know how to describe the difference ; there 's a very pronounced aroma difference if you skip this step . To me , you end up with nothing more than a pretty breadstick unless the dough gets that alkali bath . If you do use culinary lye , use gloves and do n't rush anything . Traditional Laugen are n't boiled , so you just need a cool 3 % lye solution ; no boiling step . In Germany , the pretzel shape is n't the only option for Laugen . Little rolls calls Laugenbrötchen and longer , roughly baguette-width sticks called Laugenstangen are also popular . On my most recent trip last year , the Laugenstangen were frequently sold in the form of sandwiches , though I do n't remember seeing many of those when I was first living there in the mid-90s . ETA : Having done this a few more times since originally posting , I 'd also add that the utensils you use in lye-based pretzels need to be wood , glass or plastic . Eye protection is important too . Metal will likely corrode or oxidize when it contacts food put in contact with lye , even if it 's after the wash . I 'd recommend setting the washed pretzels on a wooden surface after dipping if you want to minimize damage/discoloration on your baking sheet .

How sharp should a filleting knife be ?
It should be slightly duller than a fresh razor blade . Skill can make up for lack of sharpness , but if you do n't have the skills you 'll mash the fish more than slice . This is why instructors and surgeons can get away with dull knives ; they 've got years of experience cutting flesh . Traditionally , fillet and boning knives are sharpened to a shallower angle than general-use chef knives , to allow a keener edge . The only knife in a cook 's arsenal that should be sharper is the slicer , which sees rarer use , and needs to be super-sharp for thin slices .
Do n't take anything that costs much : You may have it taken away from you by border controls . In some parts of the world being able to confiscate nice things is a perk of the job . You want to enter ( or leave ) the country , you part with the knife . It could also be illegal to bring in knives over a certain size Hostels are famous for being rife with theft . Having some nice folding knife just begs for someone to take it Traveling is hard on equipment It does n't really matter anyway : who cares about the knife , anything will do . Ingredients and technique are what matters If I were you I 'd get a cheap , short cooking knife from some hardware store . Also make sure it looks like a cooking knife , you do n't want anything that could be mistaken for a weapon ! If you lose it , or it gets stolen , or broken , or you give it to someone who needs it more than you do then you just buy another cheap knife at a market somewhere . If you have an expensive piece of equipment it 's just another worry .
I freeze cheese all the time , mostly mozzarella . It keeps longer . ( If I keep mozzarella or similar cheeses too long in the fridge it gets moldy , often even before its expiration date . ) However , I usually use frozen cheese only for cooking - i.e. if it 's going to be melted . Freezing cheese does change the texture . Parmesan , though , being a hard , aged cheese would probably be less affected by freezing . However , on the same token , aged cheeses keep very nicely in the fridge , so I would n't see much benefit in freezing it .
For the most part this is a question of convenience and how quickly you go through a fresh supply of spices in the quantities you buy . Pretty much every dry spice will last better and be more aromatic and flavorful if it is stored whole . That applies to leaves , seeds , bark , you name it . Some really hard spices like nutmeg may not be appropriate for the coffee grinder ( maybe if you break it up some first ? ) , but those are at least large enough to get a good grip for hand-grating . One exception for me would be specialty pre-blended spice mixes which sometimes have ingredients that would be really hard to track down , or which you might have to buy in much larger quantities than you can reasonably use . ( If you can get all the ingredients easily then it is probably better to blend it yourself to your own preferences and in the quantities you need . ) Another exception in my kitchen is hing ( asafetida ) which is a resin that in its pure form is extremely pungent and I find it difficult to work with . Commercially-prepared hing powder is generally diluted with rice flour and is much easier to use in appropriate quantities .
If you look here , at the last paragraph of <URL> , he gives you a fairly easy way of removing the air from a plastic bag without a vacuum . Put your food in the bag and then submerge the bag in water just to the zip . The pressure will expel all the air . Then zip the bag up as you pull the closed portion underwater . This gets results comparable with a home vacuum sealer , I think , with the added benefit that you can include liquids easily . While I would n't consider myself an expert on this topic , I would n't fill the bag with anything you would n't want to marinate your meat in .
Depending on what meat and cut you are brining , and how you intend to treat the meat after brining . You may need to experiment , anything from 50 % to 100 % of the time your recipe book suggest . Search for brining guidelines and other useful information , there are a large community that have a lot of knowledge and experience .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
According to <URL> : Whole fruits can be stored for a month in a cool , dry area , or refrigerated up to two months . The seed pips can be frozen in an airtight bag up to one year . Fresh juice should be refrigerated and used within two to three days . In my experience in a very dry climate ( Colorado ) after a couple weeks the skins become desiccated and very hard -- you need to saw through them with a serrated knife -- but the seeds are still mostly unaffected . They will shrink somewhat , but still remain unspoiled and flavorful . However , if you refrigerate them , ensure that you do not let them get too cold . According to <URL> : [ ... ] exposure to temperatures below 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) during storage and transport for longer than 4 weeks is a major cause of deterioration [ ... ] The minimum safe storage temperature is 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) for up to 8 weeks , if decay is not a problem .

The USDA <URL> that " all plastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time . Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves , they should be discarded . " Other advice they offer for avoiding food contamination from cutting boards : Avoid Cross-Contamination The Meat and Poultry Hotline says that consumers may use wood or a nonporous surface for cutting raw meat and poultry . However , consider using one cutting board for fresh produce and bread and a separate one for raw meat , poultry , and seafood . This will prevent bacteria on a cutting board that is used for raw meat , poultry , or seafood from contaminating a food that requires no further cooking . Cleaning Cutting Boards To keep all cutting boards clean , the Hotline recommends washing them with hot , soapy water after each use ; then rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels . Nonporous acrylic , plastic , or glass boards and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher ( laminated boards may crack and split ) . Both wooden and plastic cutting boards can be sanitized with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented , liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water . Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes . Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels .
This is going to depend on how long you want to keep it for . If you 're serving it soon ( say , same day , maybe next ) , then do n't refrigerate it at all , though some people seem to think it gives better flavor to refrigerate overnight . If you 've used e.g. , buttercream frosting , you 'll need to refrigerate or freeze it , unless you 're serving immediately after frosting . Some fillings may also require refrigeration . If you 're storing short term , up to maybe a week , refrigerate it . If you 're going to be storing it long-term ( more than a few days , up to three months ) , you 'll need to tightly wrap it once its cooled , and freeze it . After more than 3 -- 4 months , flavor will be lost , but it 'll still be safe to eat , as long as its stayed at 0 ° F / -17 ° C or below .
You have quite a bit of leeway with Instant Coffee . You can brew it using water of your desired temperature . I would recommend using water just below boiling point though , around 95-99 degrees Celsius . You could use 85-95 degrees Celsius water as well ; it wo n't make a big difference in terms of extraction of flavour , and here is why : How instant coffee is prepared in the factory : Coffee beans are roasted They are ground very finely ( 0.5 mm - 1.1 mm in diameter ) The ground coffee is mixed with water in percolation columns which reaches 155 - 180 degrees Celsius . This is the extraction process . This mixture is then concentrated and/or dried using vacuum evaporation , freeze drying , or spray drying methods . The result from this is what you get in the store . Conclusion : All of the very particular factors that one must consider when trying to make great coffee have already been decided for you . You have no control over roast , grind , time from grind to extraction , extraction time and temperature , or time from extraction to consumption . All of this been decided for you . It is up to you . Brew it at whatever temperature you like to drink your coffee at . However , it may be slightly harder to dissolve the coffee and get good flavor at cold temperatures . Keeping it on the hotter side may be better . That 's just chemistry though . Sources : I am a professional barista and coffee connoisseur . <URL>
Well there 's a few things . First , higher temperatures mean more volatile aroma and flavour compounds will be released , leaving a flatter-tasting stock . Second , boiling means more motion within the liquid , which makes it harder to skim off the protein scum which forms on the surface while a stock is cooking . In addition , some of the scum will just become reincorporated into the stock via a process similar to emulsion . Third , boiling induces faster breakdown of proteins and other particulate matter , leaving you with a cloudier end product . This is of course of very little concern for stocks which will end up incorporated into ( opaque ) soups or sauces . Of the three , only the first is of any real concern to home cooks . The other two issues are n't a huge deal at the restaurant level ( modulo need for clarity in consomme etc ) , particularly if the restaurant uses Superbags or algae filtration for clarifying stocks .
Yes , for all practical intents and purposes , for flax eggs to congeal they need to be milled or ground to a powder and slurried with water , then introduced to the dish . After stirring and then letting set you should have a nice gloopy mess if you let it stand for a few minutes . I typically use a 1 part milled seed to 2.5 parts water , but typically ranges go from 2-3 parts water . You can use a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder for fast , thorough results . The exception to this is that <URL> ( this link will teach you how to use them to make hair gel , if you 're so inclined ) . This will cause the soluble fiber ( the congealing agent ) to dissolve , leaving behind the seed husks . Milled flax seeds do n't seem to be any less effective and no more distracting in terms of taste so , unless you 're doing up your hair , I just do n't see the payoff on boiling them . Another exceptional means to an exception to this is letting the seeds soak for approximately 6-8 hours . As I recall the person who tried this said it did n't congeal much , and was less sticky than a milled flax egg .

It mitigates red rust It 's less sticky It 's mostly tasteless It 's main drawback - it 's ugly . <URL> This is my everyday carbon steel knife . It 's scrached and developed patina . It does not mind being used for cooking . It no longer requires wiping every minute , it can well be washed and dried after few hours . How to develop good patina ? First , the less patina you already have , the slower you need to go . Do n't keep virgin steel wet too long . Only after it begins to darken you can allow it to stay wet longer . Remove red rust when you see it . But do n't just use scrubber . If you want to develop patina fast , you should boil your knfe 's blade for ten or twenty minutes when you see it getting red . This will convert some red to black . Then gently scrub the rest of red from your blade . If you do n't want to boil , just gently remove rust , carefully not destroying patina . If you want to artificially develop patina , dijon mustard is especially good for that . Few hours in warm place should do the job . Lemon juice is not half bad , either .
A chocolate souffle should be warm and gooey in the middle , if it is solid throughout it has been cooked too long . It sounds like you have it right , I would n't change it . If you want to prove it to her do a google image search on chocolate souffle , you 'll see what the result should look like .
The melting point of lard can vary quite a bit : <URL> as low as 86F , depending on the type of pork fat used . ( I do n't know what their source is , but that sounds about right to me . ) That number will also vary depending on the exact rendering and processing method , particularly cooling which will affect crystalline structure of the solid . Rapid cooling will generally produce a fat with a more disorganized crystalline structure and thus a lower melting point .
In order to " Sanitize " any surface you must wash that surface ( in this case , knife blades ) with water at no less than 190 ° F ( ~ 88 ° C ) according to the ( U.S.A ) National Sanitation Foundation ( NSF ) . Earlier this year the <URL> recommended <URL> as an " energy saving measure " citing a study at Ohio University that claims that it is equally effective . Additionally they recommended that the temperature could be reduced to 120 ° F ( ~ 49 ° C ) with ' chemical additives ' ( soap ) . So the question is " How hot is your hot running water ? " According to " <URL> " ( a dubious source at times , but I will accept it for this point ) suggests that most home water heaters produce water at 104 ° F ( ~ 40 ° C ) to 120 ° F ( ~ 49 ° C ) . This would suggest that to sanitize a knife blade something more than ' hot running water ' is necessary . In fact since water over 131 ° F ( ~ 55 ° C ) puts you at risk for scalding ( Wikipedia , Ibid ) and you certainly do n't want a water heater putting out water that hot , I would have to disagree with your source and conclude that in household use soap is required to sanitize your knife blade . note : in order to qualify my answer to the question of " safe " , I have elevated the standard from " clean " to " sanitized " , certainly you may ' clean ' a knife with running water but that level of clean is not what I would consider ' safe ' .
Yes , I 've heard this suggested , using wet/dry sandpaper and a mousepad . It is a very inexpensive way to match a whetstone , and you can use sandpaper with the same grit to produce an excellent edge . You duct-tape the sand-paper together so it wraps around the mouse pad , and then pull the knife along the sandpaper with the edge trailing . This is to say , you use sandpaper in the opposite direction as a whetstone . Once you work up to the finest-grit papers , you can use jeweler 's polish and a leather strop for a truly razor-sharp edge . Because the mouse pad 's rubber/foam has some give , this method produces a convex edge which remains sharp for longer that an V-cut , because it has more metal behind the edge . It also still presents a very sharp point for cutting , moreso than an equivalent V-cut front bevel . Using sandpaper will also cost a small fraction of what you spend on a good sharpening stone , which will run you $ 50 or more PER STONE . Wondering what grit to use ? There are comprehensive tables <URL> and <URL> . However , here is a quick-reference mini-table for you : Name / US Grit Rating / Use Coarse / 100-400 / Remove lots of metal . At the low-end of the range , used for reshaping blades , taking out large chips , or restoring snapped points . At the higher end of grit range , used to establish a bevel angle and restore very dull edges . Medium / 400-700 / Remove moderate amounts of metal . For refining an edge established with coarse grits , and for restoring moderately dull blades . Can be used to establish a bevel angle , but it will take considerably longer . 600 grit is a common point to start at for standard sharpening . Fine / 800-1200 / For finishing a blade or touching-up a slightly dull blade . At about 1000 grit , you will get something equivalent to a factory edge , assuming you use the same bevel angle . Ceramic steels have grits in this range . Extra-Fine / 2000 + / For polishing . Higher grits create a shinier and sharper edge , until at 8000 + grit you get mirror finishes and sharpness equivalent to a straight razor . If you 're going to bother using grits this high , a leather strop and polishing paste may serve you better than even a ceramic steel ; the steel would actually be reducing the edge sharpness with use . Source : <URL> Source2 : <URL> Edit : Another way to use sandpaper in sharpening -- expanding the grit range for a Spyderco Sharpmaker I 'm currently using sandpaper to make a very coarse stone for sharpening extremely dull edges on my Spyderco Sharpmaker . I wrap both of the normal triangular stones with a strip of emery cloth or 220-grit wet/dry sandpaper , and then hold it in place with medium binder clips . Since the lowest stone the Sharpmaker comes with is 800-grit ceramic , this saves HOURS versus using the normal stones . It is also considerably cheaper than the diamond stones they sell ; for a big tub of clips and a package of sandpaper , I paid $ 7 , versus about $ 37 for the diamond rods .
I 've heard a few different answers ( theories ) as to why you should use different temperature liquids to the roux , most of it 's related to starch gelatinization . I 'm also not a fan of scalding milk when I do n't have to , as it can bubble over if you do n't pay attention and/or taken on a bit of a scorched taste . I 've always <URL> in part because that 's the way I learned growing up , but if I 'm thickening a gravy I 'm generally using warmer liquid ( drippings , let to sit so you can separate out the fat ) . I rarely use a roux to thicken something near a boil ... for that , I 'll use a slurry . There are differences when dealing with adding cold liquid to a roux -- you need to add the liquid slowly , and stir it well before each addition , which also gives it a chance to come back up to temperature . Of course , I recommend always adding the liquid slowly , as I find it easier than trying to work out lumps afterwards .
I am not sure if you are confusing roasting with charring but both are the same basically , though roasting the pepper by charring the skin would be a more accurate nomenclature . Roasting brings smokiness to the pepper and softens its bite . It allows you to remove skin more easily . When you char the outside of dried peppers in a dry skillet with spices , then soak , it allows you to remove the pith more constructively than tearing it open and it adds depth to the flavor . For fresh peppers they become somewhat less spicy , for dried peppers it allows them a more expressive flavor ( think of roasted sesame or pumpkin seeds or coffee beans for a comparison ) . Roasted peppers add a different dynamic than their raw counterpart and you should definitely look into the difference ( if you enjoy chipotles end adobo you already have a taste for them without knowing it ) .

Can I pasteurize milk using a microwave ?
The process of pasteurizing milk is to treat it with heat to kill microorganisms such as Brucella , Campylobacter , E. coli O157 : H7 , Listeria , Mycobacterium bovis , Salmonella , and Yersinia that may or may not be in the milk . This is a precautionary step that is taken when you are not 100 % sure whether your source of milk is disease free . Pasteurization can occur at different temperature for a different amount of time but the easiest temperature to pasteurize milk in the microwave is to bring it to 161 F for at least 15 seconds . Pasteurizing the milk in the microwave is a bit tricky because overheating it make cause it to boil over and it also heats the milk very unevenly . In the worse case scenario it can curdle if you overheat it . You will need to buy a thermometer for this method . You first want to microwave the milk for a minute . Then you want to stir the milk and take a temperature reading from the stirred milk . Now you want to continue to put the milk in the microwave in short 15-30 second intervals ( decreasing as it gets closer to 161 F ) and stirring and taking the temperature reading each time . When it has finally reach 161 F , you want to heat it for 15 extra seconds in the microwave and at that point it should be pasteurized . Another thing you can do is to just pasteurize it at home using your usual stove method and store the milk for later use . Once it has been pasteurized , as long as you refrigerate the milk , it will be good for a while . Just remember to quickly chill the milk ( using a ice water bath ) after you pasteurize it before you put it into the refrigerator .
Sometimes . Basically , this is the same as asking if glass is oven safe : Generally , glass is oven-safe if taken from room temperature and put in a moderate-temperature , preheated oven . The key thing is to avoid temperature shocks ( which will cause the glass to shatter ) . Some glass is specifically designed for oven use ( either by being tempered or made of borosilicate glass ) . Often glassware will say if it is safe for oven use or not , and under what conditions -- check the packaging or instructions it came with . You also need to take precautions when removing glass from the oven . Do not set it on something that 'll conduct heat away rapidly , such as a wet countertop . Before heating glassware , inspect it for damage . Scratches , chips , etc. make failure much more likely . This applies to the microwave as well . Note that non-glass parts of microwave-safe glassware may not be oven safe . For example , if it has a plastic lid , that should generally not be used in the oven ( even though its OK in the microwave ) . edit : In response to your update , that oven is what would often be called a toaster or countertop oven . Those change temperature much more rapidly than a larger oven ( which can be electric as well ) . So , generally , you 'd avoid glass in them . But , your glass says it can be used over a flame , from the freezer . So it 's clearly one of the very shock-resistant ones , possibly borosilicate . I would n't expect it to be a problem . Just make sure to preheat the oven . Also , since you know who made it , you can of course contact the manufacturer to confirm .
I seem to recall that in Moroccan cities there are often ' neighbourhood ' ovens where you pay a small amount to have your bread baked , because few people have their own ovens . You cut a distinctive design in the loaf so you can tell which is yours when you go back to collect it ; the whole system is extremely ancient . The ovens are usually wood-fired clay ovens , so you 'll get a nice stone-baked result as well .
No . Sweetened condensed milk has a 40 % sugar content . It is very sweet , suitable for desserts and such . It is entirely too sweet to substituted into a curry . The consistency is drastically different . Evaporated milk is about the same consistency as heavy cream . Sweetened condensed milk , because of its high sugar content , is more the consistency of a warm caramel . Also , they are different colors , evaporated milk is white , sweetened condensed is light brown .
There are cultured soy and coconut milk products ( generally sold with yogurt ) which can be used as a sour cream substitute ; it 's frequently advisable to add a little extra vinegar or lemon juice as these products do n't generally provide as much kick as real sour cream .
I know it 's a old post . . But I just made toast in my microwave/convection combo and its ' good . . I defrosted my bread in the microwave , the put it on a the metal rack for 10 minutes at 425 . It worked !!! I know it 's 10 minutes but it allowed me to cook the eggs etc. . .
Worked fine for us ; we used to cottage with people who did n't want to shop very often , had lots of kids and a big freezer out back . We would buy lots of milk and freeze it just fine . Do let it defrost completely before trying to use it . We never noticed any separation , nor problems with expansion - do be aware of the container the milk is actually in , and if there is room in there for freezing to occur . FYI - this specific experience was in Canada , and milk up here comes in bags that we then place into a pitcher-like contraption to use . Your specific container may or may not have enough space .
Almond Milk for cow 's milk was a really common substitution in medieval recipes . A lot of medieval recipes used almond milk - almonds being a lot easier to store without spoiling and find reliably when a medieval cook needed some . Almond milk was a staple of the medieval kitchen . It was used in a wide variety of dishes as a substitute for milk or cream , especially on " fish days " , when the church placed restrictions on what foods could be eaten ( the most prominent of which were the days during lent ) . from <URL> In the Middle Ages , animal milk was , of course , not refrigerated , and fresh milk did not stay fresh for long . Most cooks simply did not use much milk as the short shelf-life of the product made it a difficult ingredient to depend upon ... Rather than animal milk , Medieval cooks turned to something they could depend upon , and that was the milky liquid produced by grinding almonds or walnuts . This liquid , high in natural fats , could be prepared fresh whenever needed in whatever quantities . It also could be made well ahead of time and stored with no danger of degeneration . Because of its high fat content , it , like animal milk , could be churned into butter , and because it was not animal milk , it could be used and consumed during Church designated meatless days . from <URL> Some dishes can not be made with this substitution , those that depend on the physical and chemical properties of milk - like cheese , or whipped cream . It would take a lot of processing and additives to make the almond milk mimic those products . However , both milks contain fats , proteins , and sugars in solution , and so behave similarly enough in the chemistry of cooking to make them easy substitutes . I will admit that while I cited medievalcookery.com and godecookery.com because the quotes were convenient , I posted my comment originally drawing from David Freedman and Elizabeth Cook 's " How to Milk an Almond , Stuff and Egg , and Armor a Turnip : A thousand years of recipes " which is very well researched and contains a number of period citations and recipes .
I think I found the exact answer somewhere on the net . From my experience , I know frequent stirring and also adding cold milk when it cools down will prevent it . Also , I notice this also happens for soy milk and the layer from soy milk is used to create lots of different soy products <URL> After you 've heated a glass of milk or hot chocolate , sometimes the milk forms a skin on top of the liquid . The skin is comprised of solid proteins that combine with the milk 's fat molecules , which begin to evaporate as the milk is heated . These proteins , casein and beta , clump together when the liquid reaches a temperature of around 113 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit ( 45 to 50 Celsius ) . As the heating continues , the soft protein layer begins to dry out , which is why the milk forms a skin on the liquid 's surface . This layer of skin forms a hard barrier , causing steam to build up beneath it and increase the liquid 's temperature . When left alone , this often causes the milk to boil over . Though milk forms a skin when heated in most cases , there are several ways to prevent this skin from forming . If you plan to heat the milk over the stovetop , frequent stirring will break up the protein and fat molecules , so that the membrane will not develop . If you are heating milk in a microwave , you can place a wax paper lid known as a " cartouche " on top of the container , which will slow the evaporation process and maintain the milk 's liquid form . The milk forms a skin only on heated milk that contains fat . If you are heating skim milk , there is no danger of a skin forming on top . Because skim milk contains no fat , the protein molecules have nothing to bond with , and are unable to coagulate . When made with full-fat , unpasteurized milk , the milk forms a skin that is thicker than the skin on top of low fat milk . The layer of film that develops after heating whole milk can result in a traditional English delicacy called " clotted cream , " which is spread on scones for afternoon tea . To make your own version of clotted cream at home , you can combine two parts whole milk with one part heavy cream , warming the mixture on low heat until the milk forms a skin . Leave the mixture alone overnight , and in the morning , the milk combination will be covered with a rich , creamy layer that can be spooned onto scones or muffins .
For protection against heat , you can stabalize the milk with starches . ( eg , a white sauce made with milk wo n't curdle , even if you boil it ) . I unfortunately do n't know how much you 'd have to add , and of course , it 'll end up affecting the texture of your soup ) . For soups , you 're likely better off making a corn starch/milk slurry before adding the milk , so you do n't have to cook it like you would flour to get rid of the raw flour taste . You may also want to consider the heat that you 're cooking the soup at -- you likely want a low simmer , not a full boil .
Absolutely not . A honing steel is significantly harder than the blade of a knife and is specially textured for honing . Rubbing two knives together is more likely to dull or knick the blades than anything else . The blade of a knife should never touch anything harder than a wooden cutting board . Not glass , not granite , and certainly not steel ( except for honing/sharpening ) .
I do not think your problem is an emulsifier that you are missing , I think it 's just basic temperature and technique ' issues ' . Firstly , you will get a better result if you use a liquid chocolate syrup . It 's like adding granulated sugar to an iced coffee - it will sweeten the cold liquid a bit , but most of the grains will just get wet and clump together at the bottom and not mix together . That 's why using a simple syrup is a better idea , because the solid elements ( sugar ) have already been incorporated into a liquid form so the cold temperature wo n't be a detriment to mixing . However , if you really want to keep using ( or not waste ) your existing cocoa , you have a few options . You can make a slurry of the cocoa powder . Get a container that can be sealed well and add maybe a teaspoon of the cocoa mix to 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk and shake it vigorously . Once it is well mixed , you can add more cocoa , and more milk as needed to keep it totally liquid . After it is fully incorporated , stir it into the rest of your milk and it should mix completely . This other method may not work for cold milk , but it is how I make smooth hot cocoa without having to make a slurry . I take a good quality cocoa and put it in a small bowl and then add granulated sugar - the ratio is n't vital ( and I like a sweet , very chocolatey cocoa ) , but it does have to be enough sugar to fully incorporate with the smooth , powdery cocoa . Basically I am looking to use the grains of sugar to break up the potential clumps of cocoa by having the mixture as thoroughly incorporated as possible , and then stirring very thoroughly as well . I prefer glass mugs so that I can see that I 've gotten all that 's fallen to the bottom . I hope this helps .
It depends on personal tastes ( both aesthetic and flavour ) . Ceramic pots certainly retain heat longer which suits black tea as a pot can be on the go for a while . Clay is for the connoisseur and should be kept for one specific tea . These ideally need to be used regularly so do n't suit most households ( including me ) . I 'd personally have : A western style ceramic pot ( or two , one small , one large ) for black teas like Kenyan , Ceylon or Assam based teas which I 'd only rinse out ( unless it got forgotten and grew mold ! in which case it gets a good scrub ) A glass pot for strongly flavoured teas or heavy tannin tea like Lapsang Souchong or chai ( if i make it in a pot ) which would be cleaned each time An eastern style ceramic pot for green tea as they generally keep the larger leaves back . The biggest difference I 've found is that warming the pot is more significant when using ceramic or clay over glass as the material absorbs more heat .
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .
It may already be an implicit assumption , but I think that time to cook is probably not as important as how to cook . While the power setting does affect the time to cook , the importance of time is to control how hot the parts of the food get . As with all cooking , there is a need to control temperature . Running the microwave at less than full power allows time for the heat to be conducted from the hot parts to the cool parts . It is similar to searing vs. sauteeing . I think that the accuracy of most microwave oven 's power settings are good enough ( my own testing shows about 10 % ) . I would be more concerned about how I wanted the item cooked . Some examples : When I want to reheat things like a thick soup , I run the microwave at full power for a short period of time , stir , and run the microwave again . Stirring the concoction distributes the heat faster than the conduction process . When I want to defrost frozen foods ( think meat ) , I use the lowest power setting . This prevents the edges of the food from getting cooked .
If a wine maker loves their wine , and their customers , they will use screw caps . All the studies have come back positive for screw caps . See <URL> for starters . Some main points are : Corks taint the wine Corks , real or synthetic , have a very high failure rate . Screw caps are basically 100 % effective ( <URL> ) Wine ages better with a screw cap , as there is no chance of seal failure or tainting Screw caps have been physically tested for over 30 years , and are designed to last longer than that You can cellar wine bottles at any angle The energy used in making a recyclable ( aluminium ) screw cap is significantly less than used in making a cork Most corks are n't made in ethical plantations No special tools are required to open and recap a bottle ( cork knives can be a serious health hazard later in the evening ) . Wines age more safely . Corks do not breathe , but they may shrink and let wine out ( bottles stored on side ) . Good vineyards will <URL> , or when corks start failing . The wine is topped up to the correct level , and often the wine/cork gap is flooded with nitrogen to avoid oxygen contamination which will " soften " the wine . All in all , some pretty convincing reasons to go with screw caps .
Flaky pie pastry works beautifully for quiche . You can improve the texture with two techniques . The first is " blind-baking , " or a partial pre-bake to toast the crust lightly . The other is to brush a wash of egg white onto the crust before blind-baking .
Well your chef 's knife should constitute about 90 % of your usage I 'd say . It should be used for slicing , dicing just about anything . Your paring knife is actually the 3-4 " one you describe . Paring knives are typically used for delicate tasks like , coring apples , peeling , and some people use it for mincing garlic because it 's so small . I 've never seen a 2 " serrated knife before , so I 'm not sure what I 'd use that for if anything . If you 're using it because it seems to do a better job on the vegetables , then that 's a sign that your chef 's knife is dull . I have seen tomatoes sliced with a 6 " serrated utility knife due to their tenderness . However , you generally do n't want to use a serrated knife on an onion , this will cause a lot of the gas to be released that makes you cry .
I do n't endorse beef in the microwave , but that said , the best possible way to cook it is going to be on one of the microwave plates that raise your food off the plate . ( the ones that look like the inside of a george foreman grill ) You are going to have to play with your power settings a bit to achieve a optimium patty . In mine , it 's 2:30 at 40 percent power and 1:30 at full power but depending on wattage , your particular times are going to vary . The trick to having an edible patty come out of the microwave is use low power to achieve the desired temp and then hit it at full power to get the outside done . It will always produce a slimy-er patty than cooking it on a stovetop or in an oven . Make sure that you cover the patty during cooking as it is going to spatter like crazy . You do n't want to clean that mess up . If you have access to a toaster oven , you can cook a patty in that in about 15 minutes and you will have a much closer to delicious product .
UHT ( Ultra High Temperature ) processing kills all the pathogens in the milk , so it can be conserved for a long time . However to make yogurt you add bacteria ( lactobacillus ) , so if there are n't other microorganism it should be even better .

Should I refrigerate hot sauce ?
I mostly agree with GdD 's answer , but I 'll add a couple more comments . This may be an obvious answer , but I 'd generally follow the recommendation on the specific bottle . Some sauces will clearly state " refrigerate after opening , " and others wo n't . The Frank 's FAQ <URL> is an example of these sorts of instructions : two specific products recommend refrigeration , but in other cases for Frank 's hot sauces it is n't required ( " but doing so will keep the product fresher for a longer period of time " ) . I 've also seen an occasional product that said refrigeration " recommended " or something on the package . I 'd generally assume that if a manufacturer bothers to say something about refrigeration , it 's a good idea to do it . Sometimes it may be for food safety , but in other cases it may just be a product with ingredients that will lose flavor or degrade rapidly at room temperature . Most hot sauces wo n't degrade noticeably at room temperature even over a period of several months , and many will be stable for a couple years . Others will change flavors slowly over time at room temperature , but not necessarily in a negative way . ( Some sauces are deliberately " aged " or fermented at room temperature for periods from a week to several years , and sometimes these processes will continue to change the product even after it is bottled . Some sauces will undergo natural browning reactions at room temperature as well , which can alter flavor . I know some people who actually prefer hot sauce this way , though I 'm personally skeptical . ) If there 's a " best before " date on your sauce and no instruction to refrigerate , you can probably assume the sauce is supposed to maintain quality at least that long without refrigeration . However , that does n't guarantee that it will stay exactly the same over that period . As GdD said , refrigeration will almost always keep the sauce more stable .

When the grill has cooled completely ( after dinner ) : I take some kitchen paper or some newspaper and clean off as much as possible . I use a wire brush with a scraper to brush the grill , and scrape off any bits that are stuck on . I DO NOT re-oil , and the grill stays nice and greasy for the next usage . Before the snow of winter rolls around , I take it all apart , clean the plates with a BBQ cleaning foam and water , and the cover that goes over the burners gets a good scraping , then I wash and clean the frame . This way , the grill will last years of good use .
Clarified butter is rather simple to make . It 's simply butter that has had the milk solids and water removed . It does last longer than regular butter , and can be stored for several weeks in the refrigerator . It also has a higher smoke point than regular butter , so you can use it when higher temperatures are called for without it smoking or burning . Slowly melt your butter and let it sit for a bit to separate Skim off the foam from the top Gently pour the butter off of the milk solids which have settled You 'll be left with about 75 % of what you started with . I 'm not sure what you mean by huge batch , but I usually make about a sticks worth at a time , as needed .
Yes , you should refrigerate it . Once a commercially bottled dressing is exposed to the air it is contaminated . Your homemade dressing is no different , and is likely more contaminated to begin with . The bottom line is that your dressing is food -- for humans , bacteria , and mold . It might not be the most hospitable of environments , but something is bound to find a home there . This process is arrested by refrigeration . Additionally , the garlic and basil will be going through a decay process that would be delayed by refrigeration . I 'm not sure what kind of olive oil you used , but I 've never had a vinaigrette turn solid in the refrigerator . If you 're in a rush I 'd suggest submerging , or running hot water over the bottle you store it in to quickly thaw it . You 'll shorten the shelf life , but if you 're using it frequently enough ( used all in less than a month ) that should n't matter .
Charcoal can get to 700 degrees F but in normal use you 're more likely to be in the 500F range . In order to get to the higher end of charcoal 's abilities there are a couple things you can do : Use natural <URL> , not briquettes . Lower the grill grate to within 1 " of the hot coals If 1 &amp; 2 do n't get you enough heat , consider using the Alton Brown <URL> ( Setup starts around the 8 minute mark )
Raspberries are n't just seeds and juice , though they 're certainly not as fleshy as some fruits . The difference between apple puree ( apple sauce ) and apple juice is much more obvious . In any case , you should be fine forcing them through a sieve as you suggest .
Short version : If it 's only overnight , and you seal the containers reasonably well , you 'll be okay prepping any of those ingredients ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator overnight . I often leave onions in the fridge when preparing a recipe that calls for only half an onion , or if I 've decided to use less than I prepped , or if I 'm making a salsa and I chop the onions before realizing I do n't have as many tomatoes as I thought , etc. . If you do n't cover them they will dry out a bit , but overnight does n't do much harm ; I find if they 're tightly covered , whether in a glass bowl with plastic wrap or a sealed plastic storage container , they 're just as good the next day . The same goes for carrots and celery . I 'm sure there 's been a time when I prepped too much mirepoix ; but generally speaking , if you have a cut carrot or stalk of celery in the fridge , it does n't suffer too much overnight . More than a day and it starts to dry out ; the cut surface of the carrot will start to look like the end near the tops , and possibly split . The celery dries out more quickly , as it 's got higher water content and more fragile structure to begin with ; more than a day and it 'll lose its color , eventually turning limp and yellow , starting from the cut end . For the veggies , the way to keep them freshest is with a tight seal and as little air as possible . You could put them in a zipper bag and squeeze out any extra air but I think a reasonably-sized glass bowl , covered tightly with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge , is good enough for 12-24 hours . If you do n't have room in the fridge , you 'll probably still be okay , and they may even be less prone to drying out ( the air in your fridge is very low-humidity ; sometimes you have a special compartment for which the humidity can be adjusted , for fruits and vegetables ) . I have less experience prepping meat ahead of time , unless I 'm brining or marinading it ; in those situations , the meat 's covered by a liquid that contains preservatives ( salt , acid ) that help prevent it from spoiling , and it 's always refrigerated . Keeping it cool and minimizing the contact with air or contaminants is the main thing . If you only have enough room in the fridge to store some of your prepped ingredients , use it for the meat . In this case I 'd say a zipper bag with the air squeezed out is the clear way to go ; meat is malleable and you 'll be able to get nearly all of the air out , which means it 'll store almost as well as it did before you chopped it into pieces . The thing to remember about ground , chopped or cubed meat is that anything that contaminated the outside surface of the original cut is now mixed evenly throughout . This is why it 's generally safer to order a steak rare than it is to order a hamburger rare ; the center of the steak has n't been exposed to as much of its environment as the center of the burger , during handling and storage . So even if you refrigerate your prepped meat in a sealed container with the air evacuated , effectively storing it just as well as when it was in the original packaging and in one piece , I would n't expect it to keep the same effective " use by " date because it 's been disturbed and mixed and exposed to the environment of your prep area . You 're better off doing this with a cut that you purchased recently , which has n't been refrozen and is n't nearing expiration .
In general , it is a good idea to go light on spices when trying a new recipe , if you 're not intimately familiar with the flavor and spice combinations in question . It 's a great deal easier to add spice later than it is to mask it once you 've added too much . Assuming you are reading this because you did n't do that , and have now ended up with a sauce that 's far too spicy , then read on . The pertinent question here is where is the spiciness coming from ? There are actually several kinds of compounds that can produce that general aroma and/or sensation . In most dishes they 'll tend to fall loosely into one or more of the following : <URL> , which is the active alkaloid in black pepper . This has poor solubility in water , however , it has better solubility in alcohol . If you can incorporate wine or better yet , brandy or vodka or some other strong alcohol , this can go a long way toward reducing the heat from pepper . <URL> , the heat-producing compound in most types of hot peppers , is the highest on the <URL> ; extremely piquant and can produce a " burning " sensation in very small quantities . It is also poorly soluble in water , but is far more soluble in fat , especially oils . Adding some olive oil or a good quantity of butter to your recipe is a good bet for reducing capsaicin/capsicum heat . Garlic , onion , and other members of the <URL> family put out a volatile sulfur compound called <URL> . Although this is not " spicy " in the same sense as pepper , many people perceive it as such . Like piperine , it is more soluble in alcohol than in water . However , and here 's the catch : That allicin breaks down into various <URL> when cooked , and those polysulfides are fat soluble . So if you 're trying to mask a strong garlic or onion flavour , it 's best if you can add alcohol and fat to cover all your bases . If you 've added too much Ginger - another ingredient often perceived as spicy - then you 're dealing with <URL> and <URL> , the latter of which pack a much bigger punch . One of the things you can actually do with ginger is <URL> which converts those into much milder <URL> . In other words , add some water to the sauce and then boil it to reduce the sauce again - you 'll lose some flavour but in the process you 'll break down the ginger spice . Alternatively ( for ginger ) , all of the above compounds are alkali soluble , so if you add a buffering agent - say , <URL> ( additive E331 ) , it will improve the solubility a great deal . If , like most people , you do n't happen to keep food additives in your kitchen , you can try using something like baking soda , but too much of that will completely ruin the taste , so be careful . In fact , do n't add too much of any buffer because the acidity of most sauces is an integral part of their flavor . I think that about covers it for common " spicy stuff " that goes in sauces . If you want to fix a dish that 's too spicy , you need to know where the spice is coming from and choose what 's most appropriate for that particular sauce . You can also try to mask or balance the spice with something sweet , for example roasted vegetables or plain old sugar . That will not eliminate the heat at all , but does seem to make it more tolerable for many .
Yes , you can refrigerate after the machine has kneaded the dough . Cover the bowl tightly . In the morning , take the dough out of the fridge and let it ' wake up ' in a warm place for an hour , cut and shape , then either prove them again or bake straight away ( a second prove will give you a lighter texture ) .
I would sear . It is not necessary , really , but I prefer the texture and flavor that comes with a good sear . To me , while it would be moist and tender , it would also be rather uninteresting . Bear in mind much of this is driven by personal preference .
I have looked extensively and it seems that whether to boil or steam is determined by region and it is as subjective as the fillings used . See below from this <URL> . Other variations include using black instead of white glutinous rice , or precooking the rice and filling , or steaming instead of boiling , or even wrapping into a cylindrical shape or a flat paddle shape instead of a pyramidal one . You may be able to make a decision based on certain factors of your recipe . For example : Some recipes call for the rice to be soaked while others call for it to be cooked . If I was using soaked rice I would probably choose boiling as the zongzi may become too dry with steaming . Same idea for other ingredients . Another consideration would be how well the zongzi are wrapped . If they are wrapped very skillfully , either way could work . However , if not , the filling could come out much easier with boiling . So , in the end , I would say that there really is n't a really definitive answer . I think I would use the method called for in the recipe as there may be specific reasons the prescribed cooking method was chosen .
I usually assume that if the bottle does n't specify ( and you bought it off a shelf , not out of a refrigerated area ) , then it 's safe to store in the cupboard . You can also ask at the store if you want to be sure , though I suspect unless it 's a small , specialty store with knowledgeable personnel , they will err on the side of caution and just tell you to refrigerate it . For your specific examples : Soy sauce is definitely fine to store in the cupboard , though some brands will recommend refrigeration for " best quality " . Fish sauce I 'd usually store in the fridge once opened .
You will need to be careful about extra liquid in your sauce . Your base recipe should be adaptable . Go ahead and use the garlic and onion , but I would omit the white wine . If you are using canned whole tomatoes , drain liquid before using them . Simmer it to reduce it down until it is " spreadable " rather than " pour-able " . We make a lot of home-made pizza sauce with canned whole San Marzano tomatoes , drained and puree 'd in blender . Salt , pepper , garlic and a few spices . My husband loves bright red color in the sauce so a bit of citric acid does the trick . Enjoy your pizza .
Not long at all . Usually 1 minute is enough . If it starts to turn brown , it 's been in there too long .
Short answer : no , there 's no standard scale . First of all , I 'm pretty sure it 's common enough for stoves of varying power to use the same range of numbers . I see an awful lot of stoves that go up to 10 in the US , and I 'm quite confident they 're not all the same . Second , the real property of a stove is its power output , not its temperature . You can clearly see this if you go look at gas stoves - they 're described in units of power ( BTUs in the US , hooray ) . The temperature resulting from a given power will depend greatly on what you 're cooking . A burner with nothing on it will have a much higher temperature than one with a heavy pot of boiling water on it . To a lesser degree , the temperature will also depend on the environment - a cooler room with some air circulation will keep the burner a bit cooler than a warm room with still air . So , if you really want to know what you 're getting , you have to look up the power output of the stove - or failing that , maybe try to measure it yourself .
<URL> , using olive oil to fry is basically a waste of money . " After I 'd heated them , none of the olive oils had much olive flavor left . In fact , they did n't taste much different from the seed oils . " According to a <URL> I have access to , you could use high oleic sunflower oil for frying as it degrades better .
Two hours is on the borderline , so you will have to assess your risk tolerance . No harm will come to your cookies by refrigerating the dough ; in fact , the later trays may actually be superior due to the additional time hydrating the starches . Baking cold dough will only trivially change the baking time . I would probably err on the side of caution and put the dough in the refrigerator . One thing that can speed up your tray recycle time is to cool the tray with running water on the back side , so that you can reuse it right away without waiting for it to cool . You can also pre-scoop cookies onto a plate , which makes moving them on to the tray much faster . You can even refrigerate or freeze these pre-scooped cookies .
Have you ever eaten something so hot it made you cry and felt like it 'd never stop burning ? Given what you 've said you 've tried , this thing is probably 10-100x as hot as the kind of pepper that would do that to you . Please be careful . In any case , pretty much the sole point of a pepper like this is to try to be the hottest thing in the world . The amount of capsaicin is incredibly huge compared to the amount of other flavor in it ; you 're basically never going to taste anything but heat from it . So if you want to actually use it , just assume that the only thing you can do with it is make something hot . I have a decent heat tolerance and love things with a bit of heat , but I still probably would n't bother . There are plenty of ways to add heat with much less risk of creating something completely inedible . If I really wanted to make use of it , I 'd probably start with a very small quantity in a dish to try to get a sense for the heat level . This means using it in some kind of soup/stew/sauce where you can incrementally add things as you cook , not in something like a cake where you have to just go for it and possibly end up throwing away a whole cake . ( For some peppers I might also try touching it to my tongue first , but I do n't think I 'd recommend that in this case . ) Finally , you can always try to cover it up by using it in a rich , fatty dish , e.g. a sauce with plenty of cream or coconut milk , but honestly , you 'll still be lucky if you can taste anything from the pepper besides the heat .
The exterior coating on an egg is known as the " cuticle " . It helps to protect the ( porous ) shell and minimize moisture loss , but it eventually breaks down as the chick matures and prepares to hatch . The reason that eggs in the US are typically sold under refrigeration is because they are washed with warm water and detergent to remove the large amount of bacteria that are deposited on the shell while being laid . Once the cuticle is removed the egg becomes more porous . Most bakeries that are using whole eggs will typically keep several flats out at all times to have them at room temperature . Eggs will store better and longer in the refrigerator but if being used frequently and fairly quickly , they can also be left at room temperature . Howard McGee in On Food &amp; Cooking says that egg quality deteriorates as much in one day at room temperature as it does four days under refrigeration .
