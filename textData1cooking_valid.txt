At what temperature should monkfish be prepared ?
To be perfectly honest with you , in all my years of cooking in kitchens I never took the temp of the fish . It was always by feel and look . Yes , I know that the gov ' t has guidelines that say 145F for fish but really when it comes down to it , if you have an 8oz cut of salmon/cod/monk in the pan , sticking an instant read into the middle wo n't do you much good . ( Caveat : If it was a salmon Wellington I would shoot for 130F as it 's a fully enclosed package that you ca n't feel for doneness ) The thickness of the cut will make a huge difference in when you should pull it out as you get post-oven cooking during resting in which the heat continues to heat the core of the flesh up to a final cooked temperature . That 's why most chefs will take the roast out at a rare measured temp when they are shooting for a med rare serving state . If your question is what state should monk fish be served , IE med rare ( like salmon ) or rare ( like tuna ) then I would say med-rare is your best bet . Over cooking is a bad thing for monk fish and it goes from a lovely moist state to dry nastiness really quick . A nice way to cook it that helps to give you a little move wiggle room when cooking it is to wrap it in Parma ham ( prosciutto ) . The little extra wrapping tastes great but also gives you a little bit of buffer as you get close to that magical temperature of doneness . Hope it helps .
No , you 're not crazy . You have good taste . The reason for drinking darker beer like stouts and porters is for the flavor . If they are over-chilled , you lose most of that flavor . Do n't obsess over it , but in general a lot of people serve dark beer too cold . That said , you should drink your beer at whatever temperature makes you happy . There is nothing wrong with a nice cold pilsner or Hefe-wizen on a hot day .
Daniel is spot-on with <URL> . I 'll elaborate on it a bit here . As indicated by his bottled water in the freezer trick , a full freezer is a happy freezer . The same applies to the refrigerator too . While I would n't put random bottles of water throughout my refrigerator , it 's important to know that the fuller your refrigerator is , the more it holds its temperature when opening/closing , and the less energy you 'll use . However , you do n't want to jam pack it so full that there is n't any airflow around your stuff , because this can hamper the cooling efficiency as well . The ideal refrigerator temperature is 35 ° F ( 1.6 ° C ) . You 're not hugging the danger zone like you would be at 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) , and you 're distancing yourself sufficiently from 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) that you do n't freeze half the stuff in your refrigerator . That said , the temperature within your fridge can vary rather significantly with normal usage . The coldest parts of your refrigerator are the back , and the bottom . The back because the cooling element is there , and the bottom because warm air rises . If items you do n't want frosty are getting frosty , then move them away from the back of the fridge . I would avoid putting items in the door of your fridge that are particularly sensitive to spoilage . The items in the door of your fridge can easily get as high as 59 ° F ( 15 ° C ) , and do so often . Putting milk and eggs in your door will significantly decrease their shelf life . Butter is OK in the little covered section in the door , because the door actually helps keep it 's temperature a little better . You also generally do n't want rock solid frozen butter . So , put your meats on the bottom shelf in the back , your condiments ( mayo , ketchup , mustard , etc. ) in the door , and put everything else where it fits .
Dish soap will not damage silverware . To remove tarnish you can get special silverware cleaning solutions like tarn-x . Note that the tarnish itself is a form if damage caused by the oxidized metal , so by removing it you are essentially scraping of a tiny layer of silver every time . Edit - A good tip I forgot to mention : tarnish is self-limiting ( meaning that only the surface of silver can get tarnished ) . This means that the best way to prevent tarnish is by leaving on the existing layer of tarnish . If you leave silver for 100 years and remove the tarnish the silverware will lose one layer of silver , then it will be good as new . But if silver is de-tarnished every month for 100 years , you 'd have to remove 1200 layers of silver . So it 's not good practice to de-tarnish too frequently ; only do it when you need to .
You are missing the tiny detail that metal is not the only material which can provide sharp , cutting edges . The reason the Stone Age got its name was the use of stone for tools . Both <URL> stone and <URL> , a volcanic glass can splinter with razor-sharp edges . Both the raw material and the tools made from them were highly prized goods and mined and traded in prehistoric times . Even today , <URL> are still used for some surgical procedures , especially in cosmetic surgery . What works for a face lift in Hollywood should easily be good enough for pemikan - not that I 'm comparing the two tasks . Failing to obtain the stones , bone knifes from long leg bones would also have been able to handle the task of cutting thin meat strips quite smoothly . Not for the squeamish : This <URL> shows the butchering of a deer with a simple , hand made obsidian " knife " . This <URL> compares a flint and a bone knife .
What happens to bread when it is done Yes , there is something particular what happens at a temperature in the mid-90s . Not all details of it are proven , but the major outline is , and the hypotheses about the details are solid enough to make it into textbooks . Starch is contained in tiny granules , a few micrometers in diameter . When heated in the presence of water , there is a specific temperature at which these granules burst . The molecules of starch come in contact with water and the water molecules get lodged in the nooks and crannies of the much larger starch molecules . This process is called gelating . You can observe it easily on the macro level . Just cook a bechamel or starch pudding on stovetop , stirring constantly . The liquid will stay rather thin until all will thicken at once , just before you see the first bubbles of boiling . This is when the starch gelates . The same thing happens in bread too . This is why you want to heat the bread to this temperature . If you do n't , you will have raw starch inside , which does n't taste well . The exact temperature at which this happens varies a bit with the type of starch . It is not the same for rice and wheat , for example , and I think that it is also a bit different between different wheat cultivars . But the range within this variation occurs is not so wide , all references I have seen move somewhere between 94 and 98 degrees Celsius . So the recipe author just picks a temperature he knows to work for the flour used in the bread , maybe also accounting for some additional heat transfer after taking out of the oven . Can you use temperature as an indicator for doneness The theory says yes . My personal experience also says yes . Why did you feel that your bread was too doughy ? There are different reasons why this could have happened . You could have measured it wrong ( with the probe being too close to the surface , where the temperature is higher ) . You could have cut it too early . ( Bread is always doughy before the first starch retrogradation , which occurs maybe 1 hour after baking ) . It is also possible that the bread was actually done in the sense of gelled starch , but that the recipe produced a rather moist bread and that you have grown accustomed to dry breads if you normally bake your breads for a very long time , so your brain perceived the unaccustomed texture as " not right " . Or it is possible that something went wrong with the leavening , making the bread too dense . Dense bread is always doughy , you can not bake the moisture out of it . technical criteria for bread doneness There are two big chemical changes which happen to bread while baking . The proteins in bread ( the gluten ) have to harden . Before that , they are soft and pliable . At some temperature , they become rubber-like . The hardened gluten gives the bread structure . The second change is the starch gelation I explained earlier . When this happens , the liquid part of the dough ( dough consists of a liquid phase suspenede in the elastic gluten mesh ) thickens . Gelated starch gives bread a fluffy , soft body . As the starch gelates at much hicher temperatures than proteins denature , bread is taken out of the oven when the starch is done . The third step is the starch retrogradation . In retrogradation , starch loses the water which it took during gelation . There are three big stages of it , after each the texture changes drastically . The first happens at about an hour after getting out of the oven . This is when the bread is considered done by textbooks . In practice , there are many people ( including myself ) who like the taste of the moist hot bread just out of the oven , and they consider it done at the previous step . The second happens after about 24 hours ; after it , the bread is considered stale . The third step takes several days , and after it , bread is considered inedible , because it becomes hard as wood . So technically , bread is considered done after it has been baked to gelation temperature and then left alone for 1 hour .
The way to make a proper griddled hamburger : Start with beef that is between 70/30 and 80/20 . You need to use a fatty beef because you are going to be doing a few things that will restrict the amount of juice in the burger and the extra fat will mitigate that . Season your beef and roll into balls less than 1/4 of a pound . Let the size of your patties be determined by the size of your pan , you need them small enough that once you smash you wo n't be touching the sides of the pan . You then want to preheat your pan . You want your pan to be as hot as possible . A commercial griddle can range in heat between 375 F and 650 F , so the temp here can vary quite a bit between places , I find hotter aids crust formation and allows the interior stay closer to medium . Do not use oil . I ca n't stress that enough . Your beef will put out plenty and oil will fry the burger instead of allowing a seared crust to develop . Place your balls of meat on the pan and smash them flat with a spatula . You might need a second spatula to remove the patty from the smashing one , as you lack the space space to heat it like you would on a griddle to prevent sticking . Allow it to cook about two to three minutes , then flip and top with cheese , if desired . Two more minutes and remove . As an added bonus , you can toast/fry some bread in the beef juices to create a patty melt style burger that will be oozing beefy goodness . You can drop the bread in right after the flip and it will be perfect by the time the patty is done .
The USDA <URL> that " all plastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time . Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves , they should be discarded . " Other advice they offer for avoiding food contamination from cutting boards : Avoid Cross-Contamination The Meat and Poultry Hotline says that consumers may use wood or a nonporous surface for cutting raw meat and poultry . However , consider using one cutting board for fresh produce and bread and a separate one for raw meat , poultry , and seafood . This will prevent bacteria on a cutting board that is used for raw meat , poultry , or seafood from contaminating a food that requires no further cooking . Cleaning Cutting Boards To keep all cutting boards clean , the Hotline recommends washing them with hot , soapy water after each use ; then rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels . Nonporous acrylic , plastic , or glass boards and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher ( laminated boards may crack and split ) . Both wooden and plastic cutting boards can be sanitized with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented , liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water . Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes . Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels .
Adding fruit will change the ratio of dry to liquid , so it may require more flour . It would also add some sweetness , so you may want to reduce the sugar a tad . But citrus fruits in particular are acidic , which might affect the leavening . I suspect it would depend on the type of fruit and how it 's prepared .
I 've never heard that . I have picked end of season tomatoes when they were green and let them ripen and used them for any purpose that I would normally use ripe tomatoes . And I know others who do also . It 's much better than losing them to a frost or to animals . If there is any downside , it would be that they might not be as flavorful as vine-ripened , but that still beats losing them . Also consider that most of what we get in grocery stores come from large farms where they are picked green . Just for the sake of saying it , many stores now also sell vine-ripened or locally grown tomatoes but they do cost more .
I 've heard a few different answers ( theories ) as to why you should use different temperature liquids to the roux , most of it 's related to starch gelatinization . I 'm also not a fan of scalding milk when I do n't have to , as it can bubble over if you do n't pay attention and/or taken on a bit of a scorched taste . I 've always <URL> in part because that 's the way I learned growing up , but if I 'm thickening a gravy I 'm generally using warmer liquid ( drippings , let to sit so you can separate out the fat ) . I rarely use a roux to thicken something near a boil ... for that , I 'll use a slurry . There are differences when dealing with adding cold liquid to a roux -- you need to add the liquid slowly , and stir it well before each addition , which also gives it a chance to come back up to temperature . Of course , I recommend always adding the liquid slowly , as I find it easier than trying to work out lumps afterwards .
Nature has designed some food-stuff to last a long time . Grains ( wheat , rice , corn , oats , ... ) , which are the seeds of grasses , will last the longest , often more than one year . Seeds need a long shelf-life if the plant is going to make it to the next growing season . Next come roots ( onions , potatoes , ... ) , which need to last from one year to the next . Nuts , in the cooking sense , are seeds surrounded by a shell , will also last several years if they are dry . So almonds , peanuts , pine nuts will keep , but not coconuts or chestnuts . Other food types are going to need some help , which basically means getting rid of the water in the food-stuff ( lentils , beans , peas , chick peas , soybean , ... ) or slowing down bacterial growth ( through dehydration , freezing , irradiation , canning , cooling , ... ) I have cooked grains and dried beans and lentils from my pantry that were over a year old . They all made good meals .
Agree with @Daniel that fillets can be done on the grill , but in my experience a tender fish like Tilapia will break up and fall through the grill . Unless you have a finely meshed grill and a lot of cooking experience I would avoid it . Tuna , swordfish , mahi-mahi and salmon steaks all work well on the grill . But this should not stop you from grilling Tilapia or any other tender fish , just put it on the grill whole ! For Tilapia I would do something like below . Make shallow slashes in the thickest parts of the flesh , coat with olive oil , season with your favorite spices , and then grill for 3 to 5 minutes max each side on a hot grill . You can mostly judge by sight . When it still looks like it needs another minute I always sacrifice my piece , take it off the grill , and pry off one of the thicker parts . If it 's still raw looking on the inside , let it and the others go for another 30 seconds on each side . Nothing better than perfectly cooked moist fish and nothing worse than dry overcooked fish and the difference between the two can be as little as 1 minute . Note : it might be obvious to many , but using a whole fish implies that you 've " cleaned " the fish first by removing it 's innards before any other preparation . If you really want to do fillets for a delicate fish on the grill then just coat them in oil , and wrap in tinfoil with a slice of lemon or whatever you prefer . Again , sacrifice a piece to check for doneness . Tinfoil will not magically keep the fish moist if you overcook it . Using foil you wo n't get the flavor of the grill , but then again picking all the broken pieces of each fillet off the hot coals is a bit too much grill flavor IMHO .
Yes , you can . If the frozen salmon is of high quality , there is no reason based on the food science that it should not work . Many of the recipes and articles on the web indicate that you should ( or sometimes can ) start with frozen salmon . Some , including <URL> , specifically recommend using frozen salmon to reduce the risk from parasites : Parasites , such as roundworms , can naturally reside in salmon regardless of if it was frozen or fresh . For safety , use salmon that has been commercially frozen or freeze the salmon yourself to at least -10 ° F ( -23 ° C ) for at least 7 days .
There are a variety of ways to make yogurt . One that might be " easy " would to use a thermal cooker ( giant thermos flask ) if you happen to already have one , which would be under the " maintain temperature " ( actually temperature will fall , but slowly ) classification - but if you already have one , it 's no extra cost or equipment needed . Others have a thermostat and heater , but it 's rarely an adjustable thermostat . I am currently using a dehydrator which is adjustable as my temperature control device ; I have in the past used an oven with a standing pilot light ( not adjustable , but a good temperature . ) Regardless of which type you use , you need to cool the milk ( after scalding ) to 35-40c before adding the yogurt culture ( a small amount of any yogurt with live culture ) or you will kill the culture - so you ca n't just dump 80C milk into " whatever " and expect yogurt , regardless of temperature controls or lack of temperature controls . My research and personal testing W.R.T. the tradeoffs of time and temperature has lead me closer to 35C ( for up to 24 hours ) than 40C as a default setting . On the other hand , some go as high as 45C .
My friend makes coconut crusts all the time and she bakes them at 350 degrees . But AllRecipes.com bakes their crust at 325 degrees for 15 minutes .
A properly formed loaf , before it is baked , has a network of gluten strands stretched tightly around its perimeter . This network is in tension , helping maintain the shape of the loaf . There are several reasons to score the loaf : The tension in the outer network of gluten strands limits the ability of the loaf to expand , especially in the " <URL> " or final excited burst of activity that the yeast go through as the temperature of the dough rises at the beginning of baking . The score creates a slit in the network , allowing the loaf to expand , permitting more oven spring to take place . The scores provide a weak point ( due to the cut in that gluten net ) , controlling where expansion takes place oven spring proceeds . This may prevent cracks that would otherwise be unattractive . Furthermore , the score allows aesthetically pleasing shapes or patterns to created on the loaf , as the the dough exposed during oven spring will have a slightly different texture ( it is n't surrounded by the in-tension gluten network , and will have been baked slightly less as it comes to the surface of the loaf during the oven spring ) . This means it will tend to have a different ( often lighter ) color than the main crust where the in-tension network was in place . For example : ( <URL> ) Another example , taken farther for a more artistic statement : You can see the attractive pattern on the loaf from the scores ( which are also functional in the first sense ) -- the look like a leaf . ( <URL> ) . Scoring is more important and effective in free form loaves which will have good oven spring .
I love swordfish grilled with a little olive oil and Montreal steak spice . All the firm fish are great on the grill . Firm fish like ahi tuna and swordfish can pretty much be treated like really good steak , just cook them carefully because you want them left on the very-rare side of things . If you do it in a pan make sure there 's hot oil or butter ( or both ) before you add the fish and do n't move it around too much . If you fuss too much with the fish it will fall apart . As delicious as swordfish is a lot of the fish on the market is n't being sustainably caught . Make sure to ask where its coming from . Most of the US and Canada fisheries are pretty good .
If your carrots are going soft after just a few days , you 're not storing them properly . Mine keep for weeks and weeks . I leave them in the plastic bag , and keep that in one of the vegetable drawers in my fridge . How are you storing yours ? A rubbery soft carrot is n't bad for you , it just is n't very pleasant . A slimy carrot is bad for you , do n't eat it .
Smell . Really , this is the most reliable criterion for practically any fruit . Flavor contains both taste and smell . For a strawberry , you want a fragrant smell together with enough sweetness . For both , the berry has to be ripe enough . If it was picked underripe , it wo n't smell good enough yet , and it will also be hard and sour . If it was picked long ago and is not fresh any more , it will have lost the more volatile components of its fragrance . So ripe , fresh strawberries smell great . I have had occasions when I entered a supermarket to quickly buy one thing , aimed at the correct aisle , but when the smell of good strawberries reached me near the produce , I turned and added a pack of them . I have never been disappointed with such strawberries . Also , if you smell the slightest hint of mold , fermentation , or foulness , you know they may not keep even one night . Another sign is that a ripe strawberry will be red through and through . A strawberry picked underripe will be white or even slightly greenish at the top . It does n't taste good then . But this is a negative sign , because not all red strawberries taste good . Do n't ever go by shape . The tastiest sort of strawberries my grandparents grew produced ugly , lumpy strawberries of a light , slightly orange color . They also had a few rows of a sort which produced perfectly conical , deep red strawberries , they looked like an advertisement - but they were hard and dry , and did n't have much aroma . Probably , there are some strawberries which both look and taste good - just do n't think that looks or color predict a good strawberry , because they are independent . And of course , any strawberries which have visible mold or fouled spots are not good any more . You can usually also recognize overripened strawberries in their appearance , but I do n't know how to describe it well . They just look old .

Any advice to help me form and shape stuff more uniformly ?
Use something that will help you measure the dough or mix uniformly . Some possible tools to co-opt for this task : Ice cream scoop , melon baller , measuring cups or spoons : all depending on size of course . You should be able to get to where you can eyeball the size in relation to the tool you are using .
The air pressure is lower at higher altitudes ; when you add extra flour to your baked goods , it prevents them from rising too quickly or too much . ETA ( about the water ) : Water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes , so the extra water called for in high-altitude baking is to compensate for all the water turning to steam faster than it would at sea level .
Bananas ! I grill it as 1 piece with the skin on . When the skin gets dark it is ready .
Nigel Slater 's book <URL> might be useful to you . He devotes each chapter to a separate vegetable , and for each one he includes : Specific recipes Discussion of different varieties Comments on different cooking techniques Comments on effective seasonings and pairings There 's also some discussion of his attempts ( successful or not ) at growing different vegetables in his own garden .
A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread . If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads wo n't raise much . You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens . The more temperature you can give it the better . Another possible factor may be the yeast . Are you waiting enough ? Are you using enough ? Like temperature , more yeast and longer fermentation times ca n't go wrong .
The <URL> suggestions : To ripen a California Avocado , place the fruit in a plain brown paper bag and store at room temperature 65-75 ° until ready to eat ( usually two to five days ) . Including an apple or banana in the bag accelerates the process because these fruits give off ethylene gas , a ripening reagent . Soft ripe fruit can be refrigerated until it is eaten , but not for more than two or three days . The California Avocado Commission does not recommend using a microwave to accelerate the ripening process .
Gummy candy is essentially just water , sugar , gelatin , and a few other additives like food colouring . Gelatin 's gel strength <URL> is partially dependent on its concentration . The more concentrated , the harder it gets . Gummy candies left sitting around will lose water due to evaporation , which makes the gelatin more concentrated and thus harder , and if you watch carefully you 'll notice that the moisture loss also makes the gummies shrink . To soften them , you need to rehydrate them . Toss them in a bowl of hot or warm water ( do n't use cold water - gelatin is only soluble in warmer water ) until they reach the desired consistency - usually around 20 minutes or so . The longer you leave them in the water , the more water they 'll absorb , the more they 'll grow and the softer they 'll get .
Depending on how far overcooked it is , then you might be able to resuscitate it by cutting it into smaller pieces and cooking it low and slow in some liquid . For example , you could use it as the meat in a stew , or slice it thinly and then braise it with some vegetable to make a pot-roast . This also gives you an opportunity to introduce additional flavor , as it sounds as if that may have been lacking as well .
The excellent <URL> to the question <URL> points out that one of the key reasons for using applesauce in quick bread type recipes such as pancakes is the pectin . Pumpkin <URL> contains pectin . Therefore pumpkin should provide a similar effect on your recipe as the applesauce . What the pumpkin puree wo n't provide is the sugar that applesauce provides . You will likely want to up the sugar provided by your recipe to account for this , unless you routinely use unsweetened applesauce . The water content between pumpkin puree and applesauce will also be different , as will the exact proteins . I would suggest starting with a one to one replacement of pumpkin for applesauce for a very pumpkin-y taste , but you will have to experiment . You will also want to add sugar to taste . If you want a more subtle flavor , consider substituting only part of the applesauce with pumpkin .
There is certainly a difference between different yeasts . Different kinds of yeast react differently , are happy at different temperature ranges , produce different amounts of gas , live for different amounts of time . In my little world , however , it 's better to use a yeast that you use commonly and understand than it is to experiment with a different yeast that may not behave the way you expect . The thing is , " bakers yeast " is a generic term . If it called for rapid rise yeast , and all you had was active dry yeast , I 'd say to go out and buy some , or your bread would end up flat . Chances are you have one of those two kinds . They 'd both work in most recipes , but each have their peculiarities , and you 'd need to adjust . I 'd give it a shot , and see how it comes out . If your bread ends up whacky , then try something else .
To answer your last question : yes . Regarding the previous question , it 's because the temperature at which the cocoa butter in the chocolate crystallizes affects the overall consistency of the chocolate . If you 've ever eaten a chocolate bar that was left in a car on a hot day after it has cooled down again , and who has n't , you 'll know about this . Sometimes chocolate tastes fine but has a definite ' grittiness ' to it : other things being equal , that 's usually because the cocoa butter crystals are too large . Cocoa butter has a number of different crystal forms , each of which will have a slightly different effect on texture and melting point . When melted chocolate sets , the cocoa butter crystallizes , and it will generally all crystallize with the structure that it starts to crystallize with . ( This process where crystals start to grow is called nucleation . ) So you want to have control over the temperature at which crystallization starts . The optimum crystal form for nice chocolate will tend to predominate when crystallization starts somewhere between 18-25 degrees C ( around 64-77F ) . So if you think about it : when you add room temperature stuff ( like a pretzel ) to chocolate that is considerably hotter than room temperature , the resultant temperature on the surface of that pretzel will likely be way higher than 18-25 degrees . On the other hand , if you are dipping an item that is significantly below room temp , then your chances of hitting that window are much higher . The surface structure of the thing being dipped can of course make a difference to crystallization as well , but for normal purposes that is marginal . To put it another way , it does n't matter what ingredients you 're dipping - temperature is key !
I agree that you can get some good meat from the head and could use it to flavour Bouillabaisse , i would n't however use it for stock as oily fish can lead to a cloudy fatty stock rather than the clearer and more flavoursome fish stock that can be derived from the off cuts and bones from white fish .
I make gingerbread houses every year . Walls should be approximately 1/4 inch thick . I have found that cutting the pieces first to work best . Yes there is some spread , but when they come out of the oven , I replace the stencil and trim up any spread ( for the straight outside edges , a pizza cutter works well ) . I know it sounds redundant , but sometimes I do n't cut quick enough , or I am distracted by the phone , or any other number of things , if I only cut after baking . With the items pre-cut , if I get distracted , I at least have a usable part . Granted I may have to shave any spread very gently with a microplane or the edge of a knife , but that is just what works for me . I also will roll the dough out on parchment paper , cut and remove the excess , then slide the whole thing onto a pan for baking . This way , you do n't get any " stretch " of your pieces . I have several square cookie cutters that I will use to cut out the windows and such . I make the windows rectangular by using the cookie cutter and cutting a square then moving it and cutting another half square . This is helpful because when the gingerbread comes out of the oven , you do n't have to spend a lot of time with a knife trimming the inside of all the windows ... you just punch any spread out with the cookie cutter . As Sobachatina mentioned , melted sugar makes beautiful windows . I however , will lay the walls on a silicone mat and pour the sugar directly into the window holes . No need to " glue . " I 'd hate for you to make a gingerbread house with the " wrong " icing . You want an icing that will dry rock hard , like cement . For this you will want to use " Royal Icing . " For larger houses , use canned goods to hold the walls in place while the icing dries . The house should be built at least one day before you start decorating , to be sure it has set up really good .
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
The biggest issue 's your facing is the lack of Gluten which helps trap the air created by the baking powder ( Fluffy ) and the lack of fat ( Moisture ) . I also sure the sugar would be adding a little extra strength . However the Picture on the original recipe looks dense and dry anyway . I 'm assuming you 're not using butter purposely , for much the same reason you 're using honey instead of sugar . Taking these two as a basis and working on the recipe you have provided . I think the following may work for you : <URL> Mix the warm Milk , Syrup , Milk , Oil and Yeast and leave to ferment for a while ( 15-25min ) Mix the dry ingredients , sieving to trap some extra air . Beat the eggs until fluffy and pale ( This would be easier with a couple of teaspoons of sugar if your willing to add a tiny amount ? ) Mix beaten egg to yeast mix , then add to dry mix , mixing well preferably with a dough hook if you have one . It 's going to be hard to do by hand as it 'll be sticky as hell . Add to baking dish ( es ) and leave to prove for an hour . Then beat it back down and leave a further 40min . Bake as described in the original recipe . May need a little longer . We 're aiming for more of a brioche type dough rather than a soft batter or firm bread dough here so more flour may be needed . The above recipe should work well . The only issue may be trapping the air , if this is the case adding 2tsp of Xanthan gum to the dry ingredients will make it work much better . The texture will be much lighter ( Fluffy ) , the additional Oil and Egg should increase the moisture side of things . Hope this works well for you :) , I see no reason it should n't .
I guess it depends upon the definition of " crushed " If by crushed , you mean using a garlic press , then there is quite a difference between chopped and crushed garlic . When you crush garlic , no need for a garlic press , the flat of a knife and a little salt is all that 's needed , you release the essential oils , resulting in a stronger flavour . You can also purée the garlic . It 's also important to consider the type of recipe , in some recipes , such as a pasta sauce , chopped garlic is fine . In Asian cooking , especially Indian cuisine , it 's common practice to use minced or puréed garlic . In roast dishes , using the whole cloves in the roasting tin with the meat , can produce an incredible sauce .
Sure , just roast them in a pan with oil for few seconds , not long enough to darken , and remove the nuts . As soon as you remove the cashews from oil they are sticky , then you need to sprinkle salt on it . Do n't add much -- add slightly , checking the taste , and then mix according to the taste you require .
Egg whites need to be heated up to a certain temperature in order to coagulate ( " set " ) . Lowering the pH ( increasing the acidity ) of the cooking liquid is one way to lower the temperature required for coagulation of the egg whites . So , in a way , this does prevent " feathering " of the eggs , but not because of any direct reaction ; rather , the reason the eggs feather less is because they have less time to feather , because they do n't need to get as hot . Any acidic liquid will have a similar effect . White vinegar is probably the most effective , but you could also add lemon juice or wine to the poaching liquid . In fact , eggs poached in red wine sauce ( " Oeufs en Meurette " ) is quite a popular preparation method . For reference , the coagulation temperature is also proportional to the salinity ( add salt to lower the coagulation temperature , add sugar to raise it ) , and inversely proportional to the number of eggs used ( more eggs = lower coagulation temperature ) .
A sausage stuffer , perhaps ? Your standard food mill attachment type more typically seen in a home kitchen : <URL> Unless you 're seeing some product I 've never met , I would not call that stuff " rolled in tubes " - I 'd call it a tube ( or log ) of dough , and I expect the filling process is VERY like a ( large , automated ) sausage stuffer , and involves no rolling at all . <URL> In making refrigerator cookies , one simply makes a log out of the dough , wraps it , and places it in the fridge to harden before slicing . The dough is not liquid to start with , so it does not pour , and can be shaped without a form . If your " dough " " pours " I 'm dubious about your recipe or method .
Fats adhere to broad or flat areas nicely ( fettucini , linguine ) and press the creamier sauces against more tongue surface to enhance/emphasize their smoothness Pooling sauces needs nested , medium pasta ( round or flat ) that help to punctuate the sharper and more diverse flavors of a smooth , acidic by alternating between pasta and sauce Angel hair and other fine pasta do well with a chunky sauce as it is effective with pick up but does n't obstruct the sauce 's texture once you get it in your mouth My basis for this is ( 1 ) ease and volume of transport , plate to mouth of sauce ; as well as ( 2 ) how the pasta interacts with the sauce to create mouth feel and churn of sauce against tongue . As for gnocchi and other variously shaped pasta ; if it has a cavity , it should have fats , if it has a textured surface acidic sauces will cling nicely . Obviously , I would shy away from pretending any of these were definitive answers , they are reasoned and seasoned , based on sauce/pasta dynamics and experience preparing them . This book has a listing of <URL> . This book , upon which Geometry was based , also has a <URL> . I do n't seem to be able to find any good , objective maxims for when to use what ; but , considering the variety of pastas and the prolific diversity of sauces ( i.e. a different ragu for every house ) , it seems only appropriate that every person should have an opinion on why a particular sauce works with a particular pasta .

Is there a difference between Kansas City strip and New York strip ?
The Kansas City Strip and the New York Strip refer to the same cut of meat . Apparently restaurants in New York City in the 1930 's decided they could n't sell a fancy steak named after Kansas City ( where the stockyards and slaughterhouses were located ) . So , they just started calling it a New York Strip . If you want a steak renamed by a egotistical chef , order the New York Strip . If you want a steak named for the cut of beef originally selected by butchers working next to the stockyards , order the Kansas City Strip .
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .
<URL> has a nice description of Devil 's Food Cake . Originally , Devil 's Food Cake had a medium dense texture . The colour had a reddish tint that was probably caused by baking soda reacting with cocoa powder . In fact , I have an old cookbook ( The Day by Day Cook Book , 1939 ) that contains a recipe for Red Devil 's Food Cake . This recipe calls for 2 oz . unsweetened chocolate and 1 tsp . of baking soda .
Old fashioned oats are rolled whole-grain oat kernels . In quick oats , on the other hand , the oat kernel is first cut into smaller pieces before being rolled . This makes it much easier for quick oats to absorb water than an old fashioned oat . You can visibly see the size difference . For baking quick oats can be used in place of old fashioned oats . However , if a recipe calls for quick oats , you may not get expected results using old fashioned oats . Typically , a recipe that calls explicitly for quick oats generally has too short a cooking time for regular oats to fully cook ( e.g. pancakes ) . Another thing altogether is instant oats . Do not substitute these in any recipe . Instant oats are parboiled , dried , and often has sugar and salt added . Nutritionally , quick and old-fashioned oats are identical .
There are several factors that increase price . Some are related to the objective quality of the wine , some indirectly linked , other are rather disconnected from quality ( but not necessarily irrelevant , as we 'll see ) . It 's also worth noting that being of high quality does n't necessarily mean being appealing to the average consumer . Apart from the stuff listed below , mass-market wines tend to be made in a non-challenging , easily accessible style . Lower tannin levels , less acidity and a generous amount of residual sugar ( say 10-30g / l ) makes for easy quaffing but little complexity or elegance . They can be very well-made , but the agriculture may not be very sustainable , and the fruit probably is n't of the highest quality . ( If you visit a winery at harvest when they bring in the bulk wine fruit , the meaning of " quality " becomes rather apparent . ) Wines targeted at connoisseurs , wine snobs and wine geeks ( such as yours truly ) tend have more structure ( tannins , acidity ) and are more often completely dry ( although there are of course high-quality off-dry , semi-sweet , and sweet wines ) . There 's a limit to how much a producer can spend to increase quality , a limit which varies with location ( because of salaries for workers etc ) but around $ 100 per bottle is probably in the right order of magnitude . This does not mean that all wines above this magical limit are equally good , though . A dirt-cheap wine will also have a cost associated to it which will be payed for by someone else , like under-payed harvest workers , the environment around the vineyard , etc. . Below are some factors that have a more or less direct link to wine quality and/or character : Yield per acre : Limiting the vineyard 's yield per acre ( which can be achieved by sparser planting , thinning / <URL> , old vines , etc ) increases the quality of the fruit , but you will produce less wine with more or less the same amount of work , which means you 'll have to adjust the price . Number of harvesting tries : At harvest , you can pick all the fruit of one vineyard at the same time and be done with it . Unfortunately , not all bunches ripen at exactly the same time , so to avoid over - or under-ripe grapes , you can make multiple tries ( French , pronounced " trees " ) over several days and pick each bunch at optimal ripeness . More tries inevitably means more work , and so , price increases . Selection : When the harvest is brought in , you can throw all the fruit into the press , or you can select the best grapes to make your wine ( and make brandy or a <URL> of the discarded grapes , or sell them on to a bulk wine producer ) . Being picky reduces the amount of wine produced , and so , prices increase . Drying : Some wines , like <URL> and <URL> , are made from partially dried grapes , and drying decreases the amount of wine you produce ( apart from being extra work ) which means - more expensive wine . Sparkling : Sparkling wines made with the <URL> - like <URL> and <URL> - need to be disgorged after bottle fermentation , which leads to a certain amount of waste ( a Cava producer I talked to said that around 10 % of the original wine is lost in disgorgement ) . Oak aging : Many wines are <URL> , which greatly affects the character of the wine compared to other types of containers , like concrete or stainless steel vats . ( More oak does n't mean better wine , of course . ) Oak barrels are horribly more expensive than the alternatives ( and European oak is more expensive than American , and they impart different character ) , and so , the more oak you use , the more expensive the wine gets . Aging in general : Most high-quality wine receive a bit of aging before consumption to let all components integrate ; some designations of origin even require aging prior to selling . <URL> Gran Reserva , for example , must be aged at least three years , with at least one of those years being on oak , while vintage <URL> is mandated to rest three years on the <URL> , etc. . Apart from time being money , you also need a suitable storage location ( cool and humid but not too cool and humid , secure but accessible to yourself , etc ) which is far from free . The price increases . Other factors are n't causally linked to higher quality , but tend to be connected : Reputation : If you 're an unproven winemaker you will be able to charge more if you 're operating in a district of high repute than if you 're working in an area where no-one has made quality wine before . Conversely , a well-known , high-quality producer expanding their operations to a somewhat less proven district will likely be able to charge more than their new neighbours . Brand : Marketing can take many forms , such as it advertising , tailoring wines to suit <URL> , and tends to push prices up . Wineries can even try <URL> . You can also be lucky and find some great , undiscovered producer ( do n't tell anyone ! except me , that is ) selling their wines at more-or-less cost price ( which probably still wo n't be dirt cheap , though ) . Land prices : Some spots are better for growing grapes . If you 're in
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
No , spices are commonly sold as " X powder " or " ground X " . As far as I can tell , they are likely the same thing . The only thing I might imagine would be different would be the size of the grind . I would imagine yes , you can substitute one for the other . eg : <URL>
<URL> is a style / kind of a sauce that originated in Napoli usually made with tomatoes , garlic , herbs , and onions . A spaghetti sauce only says where to sauce is used ( obviously on <URL> ) but does n't say anything about what the sauce is exactly like . There are <URL> which are basically spaghetti + sauce : <URL> -- which literally translates to " spaghetti mariner 's style " <URL> -- " spaghetti with garlic and oil " , originated in Napoli <URL> -- " spaghetti whore-style " <URL> -- " spaghetti coal worker 's style " and , uhmmm ... <URL> -- an Italian-American invention
Yep , cocoa and cacao are the same thing . The 72 % has sugar making up the rest of the mass . The description on amazon actually mentions that it 's 27 % sugar and 43.5 % cocoa butter . The rest is cocoa solids , the chocolate-y stuff . As you say , that particular brand is pretty expensive ; it 's also pretty popular and well-regarded . Since it has plenty of sugar in it , you can use it for pretty much anything , including things like coatings , or even just eat some . The 100 % is unsweetened ( there 's no room for any sugar in there ) so it 's really only usable for things like baking , where you 'll add some sugar . It 's unlikely to be pleasant to eat on its own . For what it 's worth , usually in English you 'll hear cacao only when referring to the overall cacao seeds and their use as a component of chocolate . It 's not common in non-culinary contexts . For example , we 'll say " cocoa powder " not " cacao powder " .
Olive oil degrades over time so freshness is important . Some of the higher priced olive oils sit on shelves for a very long time and by time they are sold they can be of lower quality than some mass produced olive oils . I 'd say you 're in the right frame of mind and would recommend finding a brand with a local representative who can trust and know the source and timing of the oil . Many smaller olive oil producers do n't bother with organic certification because of cost , but they have same or better standards . Therefore there is a sweet-spot where you can get quality olive oil similar to organics at decent prices . Keep in mind good olive oil is produced in many places , including Greece , Spain , and Lebanon . Not just Italy .
Both crispy and caramelized onions are cooked for a long time , and will be very brown . However , they are cooked slightly differently . Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture , and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan , stirring infrequently , so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel . Depending on the onions and desired result , you may even cover them , an add a little liquid and/or sugar . The end result is very soft and very sweet . Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions . They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan , stirring regularly . This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy , even burning on thin ends . These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy , and more savory than sweet .
First of all , the names vary a bit from country to country , or the ingredients do . I 'll explain the most common names/ingredients . The main difference is in the ingredients used . Sorbet is basically water + sugar + fruit , while ice cream and gelato is milk/cream + sugar + fruit . So the last two are more ' creamy ' , while sorbet is more ' icy ' . You can say that ice cream is a type of gelato , but there still is a difference . More sugar in gelato , more butterfat ( the percentage of fat in the milk/cream ) in ice cream . You can read quite a lot about ice cream on <URL> .
In their various parts of the world , all of these words mean sauce , at least some of the time . They come from different cultures , though , and carry different connotations at least in US usage . Short answer , though : there are no absolute differences that you can count on . Salsa This is a generic term in Spanish , and in South American cuisines . It can cover everything from a thick , dark mole , an adobo , a light and piquant salsa verde , or the typical tomato , onion and pepper sauce often served with chips in the US . Some salsas are smooth ; others are chunky . They can be cooked or raw . Many people use the word to indicate the red , fresh or lightly cooked tomato salsa with onions , garlic , peppers and usually cilantro often served in Mexican restaurants in the US , but this is only the beginning of what salsas can be . Sauce The generic term . Almost any flavorful liquid put on another food to enhance it . These range from elegently smooth ( such as hollandaise ) to quite chunky such as putanesca sauce . Gravy Gravy tends to be a sauce made from meat drippings , and thickened to serve with the meat or its accompaniments . In Italian-American usage , it often covers " Sunday Gravy " or a ragu made from tomatoes and one or more ( or many meats ) that in some communities was traditionally made on Sunday ; and more generally , any sauce with meat in it . I am told that in Italian in the context of pasta sauces , the actual word is ( forgive my spelling ) accompanimento , an accent for the pasta which is the star . Chutney The word chutney derives from the India/Pakistan region , where again there are a myriad different sauces that carry the title . In the US , it tends to be used for a chunky , acidic sauce made from fruit and/or vegetables . This overlaps considerably with jam or preserves , in this sense , although chutneys tend to be much more strongly spiced , and may contain complex combinations of complimentary ingredients . Still , this does n't cover the full range such as a chutney of pureed cilantro and/or mint , which is much more thin and sauce-like than the above more typical US usage . Conclusion You can not really draw strict distinctions among these categories . You have to know what the specific sauce or item is that is being discussed to strongly draw inferences about it .
Depending on where you are , the word <URL> can mean a few different things . In Mexico it refers to a flatbread made of either wheat or corn and a few other ingredients . These flatbreads tend to come in standard sizes in the United States at least , one of which might be labeled the " burrito " size . A <URL> is one use for a tortilla . A burrito consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped around a filling . Often the filling might include beans , cooked meat , rice , and perhaps vegetables .
I had to consult my copy of Bread Baker 's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart to be sure , but here is a quote : There are two types of firm , or dry , pre-ferments and two types of wet pre-ferments . The firm pre-ferments are known as pâte fermentée and biga . The wet pre-ferments are called poolish and levain levure . ... Biga , an italian style of firm pre-ferment , differs from pâte fermentée in that it does n't have any salt in it . Also , rather than cutting off a piece of finished bread dough to hold back as an improver , a biga is made specifically to be used as a pre-ferment . So , it seems the main difference lies in the hydration of the dough , where a poolish is made with a ratio of equal water and flour . There also seems to be a few other differences . A biga apparently uses .5 percent yeast to flour , while a poolish uses .25 percent . Mr Reinhart does not say anything about a concrete difference in final result between these methods - just that a ' wet ' pre-ferment is faster . Faster in the sense that in the same time-frame a poolish will develop more flavor and character than a dry pre-ferment . Sadly I 've personally only used a wet pre-ferment , since it is easier to handle . Just whisk it prior to bed time with a wire whisk and mix in the rest of the ingredients the next day . Having a full blown dough makes it more difficult to incorporate the rest of the ingredients .
I believe that the following study provides a definitive answer : <URL> From the abstract : High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) was applied to the analysis of caffeine , trigonelline , nicotinic acid and sucrose in Arabica and Robusta coffee . Green and roasted coffee samples were used in this study and the degradation of sucrose and trigonelline , with the formation of nicotinic acid , was followed during roasting . Caffeine did not undergo significant degradation with only 5.4 % being lost under severe roasting . Roasting does in fact lower the caffeine content , so bolder coffees will have less caffeine if they come from the exact same bean . But even under the worst conditions , the impact of roasting is trivial compared to the impact of bean selection , brewing method , etc. . What does degrade is sucrose ( sugar ) , which is why heavily-roasted beans tend to taste so bitter ( or " bold " ) . Bottom line : Make your roasting decision based on flavour preference , not caffeine content . Because the effect on caffeine is so small , you really ca n't compare the caffeine content of light roasts vs. dark roasts categorically unless you have a controlled sample , which you do n't unless you 're working in a lab .
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
Potato pancakes are held together , usually with egg , sometimes flour as well . Hash Browns are usually just the potato , maybe onion and seasonings .
There does n't appear to be any difference . Wikipedia says " In English-speaking countries , Berliners are usually called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam , jelly , custard or whipped cream " , and <URL> says " The English translation of krapfen is cruller or doughnut " . There are so many variations of filling , topping , shape and so forth that it is hard to establish a single identity anyhow .
It becomes quite confusing when talking about the difference between chow mein and lo mein mainly due to the error in translation . In Chinese chow mein literally translate as " fried noodles . " However when buying chow mein at a chinese restaurant , you get vegetables with a side of deep fried noodles . Somehow the title of a dish is referring the to side rather than the main dish which leads to much confusion . When talking about chow mein at a grocery store , it also gets confusing because you can get two types of noodles . The first kind is a fried noodle that looks something like this : This is definitely not what your recipe is referring to . The second type of chow mein you will find is very much similar to lo mein . It should be a raw noodles that is still semi-soft . It should look like this : If the chow mein you have at your grocery store resembles the second type of noodle , then you may use that as a substitute . If it resembles the first type , do n't . The first type is used as a topping sort of like chinese croutons .

Can I safely freeze my yogurt marinated chicken ?
I have been in this situation before and I did try freezing it . When I used it later on , it did taste and feel OK , but as you would expect , not the real fresh taste . I do not think the ingredients in the marinade will have any effect while it is frozen . While thawing , the yogurt might split , leaving more than usual water , but that shouldnt alter much of the outcome . It will be still good after defrosting ; I would normally defrost by leaving the item in the refrigerator overnight , rather than quick methods like microwaving or even leaving at room temperature on the kitchen counter .
I suppose that depends on what you 're defrosting it for . The microwave ( on low power ) is safe and quick . The downside is that you 're using a microwave , which means there 's a good chance you 'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process , and you 're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour . The lower the heat , the less the impact of this , but it 's still a problem . If I 'm preparing the meat for marinating , stir-fry , etc. , something with a powerful or thick sauce , then I would n't worry about it , but if it 's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning , you might want to avoid this . Running it under warm water would seem to work , but I 've found that it takes forever to defrost this way ( the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen ) , and you 're soaking it in the process . This really is n't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it . I would use the microwave if desperate , but it 's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or , if you 're in a bit of a hurry , the sink . It takes longer , but it 'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness . P.S. . One other word of advice : If you 're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced , it 's best not to defrost it all the way . It 's easier to cut when frozen , and will defrost very quickly once it 's in pieces . I 'm mainly talking about the breast here , this does n't work so well with meat stuck to bones . Update : I 'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something . Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be immediately cooked after defrosting and that the defrosting is done over a period shorter than 2 hours . Raw chicken must not be kept at any temperature above 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) for more than an hour or so . Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge . Definitely do n't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water . As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly ( up to an internal temperature of 165 ° F ) , you 're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning , even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today is contaminated , for the record . If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason , then you need to either thaw it very fast ( using the microwave ) or at a very low temperature ( using the refrigerator or cold running water ) .
Yes , you can freeze either the wrappers or the pre-made rolls and they will work fine . The wrappers I buy are typically frozen .
I 'm not sure if its dangerous , but if you are worried about the can you can get various tools , designed to cook a chicken like this .
The BBC lists strong white flour as simply flour made from hard white wheat , which tends to have a higher gluten content . By mixing all purpose flour ( German : 550 , French : 55 ) with the package recommended amount of vital wheat gluten or by using bread flour you should be able to make bread in your machine just fine . I usually use either AP flour or a mixture of AP and whole wheat ( German : 1600 , French : 150 ) , or even all whole wheat ( although with all wheat I find adding gluten is extremely helpful for getting a well-risen loaf ) . You can also buy other types of high gluten flour , either with that label or listed as bread flour . If you live in a part of the world with " 0 " and " 00 " flour , the protein content of " 00 " flour is similar to that of all purpose flour , but the grind of all purpose flour will be more coarse . " Panifiable " 00 flour has the gluten content of bread flour ( <URL> ) .
As a rule , avocado should only be frozen in <URL> . When frozen , it should be placed in an air-tight container ( such as a sealable dish or freezer bag ) with only enough room for expansion as it cools . The variable fat and water content of avocados is not well suited to freezing , and renders the thawed product <URL> , a far cry from the normal texture of avocados . The thawed puree , however , can be used as a sandwich spread , in the creation of dips ( such as guacamole ) , or any recipe where solid pieces of avocado are either not desired or not required . If a dish has avocado cooked into it -- again , non-solid form is preferable -- the freezability of the dish would be dependent on whether or not such a dish is normally freezable ( if not normally containing avocado ) .
What you got is more properly characterized as buttermilk ( in the current usage of the term ) than yogurt . Pasteurization does not sterilize milk , and it can have been any kind of bacteria which can survive in milk . The process was the same as in any other cultured dairy : bacteria started multiplying , producing lactic acid which curdled and soured the milk . The harsher the pasteurization , the less chance that you happened to have an abundance of a benign culture . You could have gotten something dangerous , or harmless-but-gross . Traditional buttermilk making by leaving raw milk unseeded with any culture out and hoping that it harbors no baddies is also unsafe by today 's standards . So , if you want to produce buttermilk or yogurt , you are much better off starting with a culture . A few spoonfulls of prepared yogurt or buttermilk should work ( unless their culture was killed ) , but for best results , you should match culture and fermentation temperature .
You can substitute one to one . Many brands of " light sour cream " ( Which is an oxymoron . Cream without the cream ? ) have a lot of gums and starches to stabilize the liquid as the fat would have done . Brands that do n't have gums dilute the fat with skim milk and are basically just yogurt anyway . Regular yogurt is fragile . It is a delicate mesh of proteins filled with water . When it is blended the water washes out . However , greek yogurt has already had this done ! So there is less water and it stays creamy and loses relatively little extra liquid even when blended .
The <URL> suggestions : To ripen a California Avocado , place the fruit in a plain brown paper bag and store at room temperature 65-75 ° until ready to eat ( usually two to five days ) . Including an apple or banana in the bag accelerates the process because these fruits give off ethylene gas , a ripening reagent . Soft ripe fruit can be refrigerated until it is eaten , but not for more than two or three days . The California Avocado Commission does not recommend using a microwave to accelerate the ripening process .
Yes , you can freeze stew . You may find that the vegetables are a bit softer or broken into smaller pieces after thawing . If you used a thickening agent ( flour , cornstarch ) , it may separate as it thaws in the refrigerator overnight . To remedy that , remove a bit of the liquid , simmer with a bit more thickener and whisk so that it stabilizes . Then , gently stir into the stew as you reheat it . And , you 're correct , ' do n't refreeze ' applies to the raw meat , not to when it has been cooked .
Yes , you can freeze parmesan cheese . Even without freezing , Parmesan is very durable since the low water and high salt content prevents mould from growing . The younger varieties may be more prone to mould growth ( having a higher water content ) , but I 've kept ripe Parmesan ( 30-36 months ) for at least a year in the fridge without problems ( and it would probably have stayed good much longer ) . Just remember to keep it wrapped in paper , not in a sealed plastic container to prevent a buildup of condensation .
The possible risks I can think of are ( 1 ) the large thermal mass may mean that the soup cools off too slowly , leading to spoilage in the middle , and ( 2 ) freezer burn on the top of the soup , because there 's no truly effective way to seal out air from a pot . In practice , ( 1 ) is unlikely unless you 're talking about a 25-gallon pot or something , in which case it would n't fit in an ordinary freezer anyway . ( 2 ) on the other hand will be a problem , unless you 're only freezing the soup for a short period . The only risk to the pot is that it may not quite fit in the freezer comfortably , so as people take things out and put things in , they may shove the pot about and maybe break a handle or something .
Panko wo n't stick to chicken ( too dry ) , but will stick to egg . Egg wo n't stick to chicken ( too smooth and non-absorbant ) , but will stick to flour . Flour will stick to chicken . Dredge first through flour , then through ( well beaten ) egg , then through panko . It 's a tricky combination , but if you do it right the results are excellent . Any dry spices you want to put in can go in the flour . While I do n't know for sure , I would certainly would n't include any oils in the coating , as none of flour/egg/panko will stick to oils .
Sour cream could work . It has a similar flavor to plain greek yogurt , although the consistency is somewhat different . In fact , My fiance and I have switched to using greek yogurt in place of sour cream because of this since sour cream is higher in calories . I think it would be just fine for a sauce .
The best way to remove the aphids is to submerge the vegetables in cold water for at least 10 minutes . Then drain , rinse them off , and dry them . Salad spinners are perfect for this . Once the aphids have been drowned and rinsed off , the greens are perfectly safe to eat . Actually , it should be safe to eat the aphids as well , it 's just unappetizing .
Soak in a mild borax solution . fill the sink and throw in gummed up juicers , colanders and tea-stained spoons as well . If your kitchen is humid , a bit of an oil rub after thorough drying should slow down the rust .
Once you 've got your wet ingredients in there the timer is running . The chemical rising action only lasts a little while , and you want as much of that as possible to happen while the muffins are in the oven . If you wait past that window your muffins are n't going to rise very well , if at all , and I think you 'd definitely run into that with freezing the mixture . Even if freezing the batter would stop the chemical reaction ( which I seriously doubt ) , you would n't be able to make use of that fact . Using a conventional freezer , the cooling process is going to be fairly gradual . Your batter is going to be at an active temperature for quite a while before eventually reaching the mythical non-reactive temperature -- far longer than the chemical rising action lasts . And then as you thaw the batter you have another lengthy period where your chemical clock is ticking , long before you can get it in the oven .
You will have the best results if you prep by cutting and blanching prior to freezing . This should ensure that moisture content in the veggies does less damage over time in the freezer and improve color duration . I find it helpful to freeze vegetables separately rather than as mixes as you can always grab from multiple bags , but you ca n't unmix mixed vegetables without more work . The majority of vegetables for stir-fry ( e.g. broccoli , peas , etc ) will freeze well enough , the ones in your freezer aisle obviously freeze a bit better than others . If a vegetable has a high water content ( i.e. lettuce , which I hope you are n't stir-frying with ) that is more integral to its structure than the cellulose it is likelier to burst cell walls in freezing ; these vegetables are better to avoid .
A piece of muslin/cotton/fine-tissue-of - your-choice will do the job nicely . You can easily find it in kitchen stores or <URL> .
Try throwing some baking soda and lemon juice in it and run an empty load without soap . Repeat as needed . I 'd try about half a normal sized box of baking soda and half to a whole cup of lemon juice .

What are good ingredients to put into a Scrapple soup stock ?
The purpose of stock is to dissolve collagen out of the meat and bones into gelatin . The liquid is then not so watery , collects a lot of flavor , and can be reduced for sauces if desired , etc. . The problem with the scrapple is that , while it does have a some gelatin , it also has a ton of fat and starch . The fat would melt and have to be skimmed off again . The starch would gelatinize . This would result is not a stock but a gravy . The solution would seem to be to find recipes where the starch and fattiness would be desirable . The first thing that would come to mind would be a thick stew . I would cube and sear the scrapple before adding it . It might take some experimentation to figure out how long to let it stew to thicken the stew without turning the crapple to mush .
I have the brand of juicer ( Champion ) mentioned by the OP in comments . It 's a rather unusual design that is n't used by most other companies . They are somewhat notorious for producing a lot of foam . I bought it perhaps 15 years ago , but rarely use it for this reason . ( It still has other uses other than juicing . ) Anyhow , the solution I found to this problem was simply to strain the juice through a fine-mesh sieve . It wo n't go quickly and will get clogged with the pulp , so you 'll need to a take a spoon or something and stir it around to force the juice through . It takes a long time , but it 's effective because the bubbles dissipate when they go through the sieve . Given the construction of these types of juicers , I would generally just place a bowl underneath and a large sieve in the bowl to catch the juice coming out . After finishing juicing , you can turn off the machine and then spend 5 minutes stirring and straining to get rid of the foam . I have seen others on the internet mention success using a French press to do a similar straining action to destroy the foam . I tried it once but it did n't seem to work as well ( perhaps the stirring action within the sieve also assists with the foam ) . Nevertheless , it still made an improvement .
I dug around a bit , and most people seem to agree that this is normal caper behaviour , though no one has made any real assertion as to why , other than that capers have varying density , and the brine does not . The usual tests for freshness ( do they look/smell/taste okay ? ) are recommended . Brined capers should last ~ 9 months from the time the jar is opened , or 3 years in a dark pantry unopened .
I have the <URL> and it works well for sweet potato fries . The product spec for them lists " Yams " which are sometimes what sweet potatoes are called in the U.S. ( technically , yes , yams are different but real yams are not often available in the U.S. ) . The <URL> specifically lists sweet potatoes : Makes French fries , sweet potato fries , zucchini sticks and other favorites
' You should n't eat mussels that do n't open ' is an unfounded myth . It was first mentioned in a book by the British food writer Jane Grigson in the 1970s and grew through repetition to the point that 90 % of cook books mentioned it in the 1990s . The fact is , mussels that do n't open after cooking are more likely to be safe than those that do . You should , however , be careful to remove any mussels that have opened before cooking , as they 'll be dead and likely to make you ill .
A foam is just a liquid with plenty of air incorporated into it . You can incorporate air into any liquid ; in order to be able to create an actual foam , however , you need to be able to incorporate the air faster than it escapes . What makes a liquid able to hold the air you 're incorporating ( and hence form a foam ) is a foam stabilizer , also commonly called an emulsifier1 . I know of no specific taxonomy of stabilizers , but the vast majority are hydrocolloids AKA gelling agents and belong to some family of protein . Agar , carrageenan , alginate , xanthan , and pectin are all types of <URL> ; Lecithin is mostly a random collection of <URL> ; Gelatin is denatured collagen , i.e. animal protein ; Whey protein is the prevalent protein in dairy products ; And so on . Really almost any emulsifier will do . Basically everything in your list either is , or contains , one of the the additives mentioned above : Chocolate is almost always emulsified with soy lecithin ; Eggs contain high amounts of lecithin ; Milk and cream contain whey protein ; Most " supermarket cream " also has emulsifiers like carrageenan already in it . ... you get the picture , I hope . The most basic answer I can give to this is that if you want to make a foam , you need to either use something that 's already an emulsion ( milk , butter , chocolate , etc. ) or use an emulsifier/stabilizer additive ( such as gelatin , lecithin , etc. ) If you want a relatively complete list of all of the food additives that qualify , you 'll want to look at the E number , and specifically <URL> ( thickeners , stabilizers , emulsifiers ) . 1 . As commenter Erik very correctly points out , an emulsifier is not the same thing as a foam stabilizer . However , by convention , the terms seem to be used interchangeably all over the place , to the extent that I get blank looks when I refer to a " stabilizer " as opposed to " emulsifier " . So , know the difference , but do n't get too hung up on it .
The veggies are n't very palatable after such a long simmering ( unless you like celery paste , I guess ) , but if you 've thrown a whole chicken in the resulting meat is wonderfully tender and flavorful .
It 's probably OK but there are a lot of variables here so from where I sit , it 's difficult to be certain . Cooking will kill most bacteria . If the soup went from the pot , hot , to the container and capped immediately , the risk of airborne bacteria getting in is reduced . It takes more than a couple bacteria to get you sick but when conditions are right , bacteria multiply exponentially in a short period of time . If the container was at 72F , that 's better than if it was at 90F ... as if it was outside in the sun . You can give it a sniff to check if it smells OK . Reheating to a boil will kill most bacteria , but depending on the specific bacteria , not all . What 's more , certain bacteria leave behind toxins that are not easily destroyed . If you have a pressure cooker , that 's the best way to kill whatever bacteria might be in there . You would need to keep it in the cooker for a period of time ... 30 minutes perhaps . Seems like a lot of trouble to go to . Dry bouillon cubes should not have any bacteria ... assuming a clean manufacturing plant . Same goes if you used dehydrated chicken . It 's more likely bacteria got in if fresh uncooked chicken was used . Unwashed hands , contaminated utensils , used hand towels , unclean work area ... all that stuff comes into play . You probably already know about cross contamination . But here 's the thing ? Why risk it ? Salmonella will not likely kill you but your stomach will be churning and you 'll be spending some time in the bathroom . There are other bad actors out there and they are worse than Mr. Sal Minella ... Staphlococcus , E. Coli , Botulinum . My answer is , to be safe , toss it .
While this is n't a substitute , you can get better deals on saffron and make it go further . First of all , do not buy it at a normal grocery store . It tends to be very expensive there . Instead go to a farmer 's market ( not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church , but rather the big store ) . I 'd imagine most major cities will have one or more . Atlanta has at least 4 . Saffron is much , much cheaper at the farmer 's market . Second , thoroughly grind the saffron before using it . This will help the saffron more completely flavor a dish , requiring a smaller amount of saffron to get the flavor . A quick Google suggested Tumeric , but I ca n't really imagine that working , nor did a lot of the comments on the internets .
I look for a few things ... Colour : There are many different varieties of mangos . Some go from green to red , some end up Orange , some start off yellow and end up orange . So once you 're familiar with the type of mango you 're buying , you can get an idea of what a ripe one looks like . Smell : A ripe mango will smell sweet . Check near the stem end , the smell should be stronger there . You should smell it and think " mango " . Smell is a large part of your taste , so it should be very familiar . Firmness : Mangos , like peaches will soften as they ripen . Just as it starts to go from firm to soft , it is just about ripe . Weight : With most fruit you can tell their ripeness by their weight . A riper fruit will be slightly heavier than an unripe one . As an aside , if you 're at a grocery store , and you see a few different types of mangos , look for these Ataulfo mangos : <URL> . They 're my personal favourite . The flavour is richer , and they are a lot less stringy . Finally , DO NOT refrigerate if you want them to ripen . <URL> ( There is also some generic mango info there )
According to <URL> , the melting point of piperine - the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper - is 130 degrees celsius , so it 's definitely not a given that anything you 'll be cooking will heat all of the piperine above 130 degrees celsius - at which point you 'd begin to get significantly faster decomposition ( and lose the peppery flavor ) . Now , the maillard reaction does n't occur until around 155 celsius , so for cooking steak it 's pretty much a given that the outside of the steak ( including all of the pepper on the surface ) will get hot enough to melt and begin to decompose , so it 's certainly possible that you 'd lose much of the pepper flavor from the actual peppercorns . So the two questions are , how much is actually lost ? and where does it all go ? Most recipes that call for crusting cooked meat with black pepper call for a coarse grind . One good reason for this is that by minimizing surface area , you are not allowing the piperine to heat up and decompose as quickly , so depending on how coarse your pepper is , and how hot you sear your steaks , you may have a not-insignificant amount of piperine left in your pepper . I have n't found a good source for how fast piperine breaks down at various temperatures so you 'd have to test this a bit to see how much of the flavor you could expect to lose . Probably more important is the " where does it all go ? " part of this question . For this you have to consider that even though the ultimate tempurature of the pepper is far above its melting point , during cooking it has heated up slowly , not instantly , leaving a good portion of time where the piperine was melting but before it was hot enough to decompose very quickly . During this phase , piperine can escape from the peppercorn , while still intact ( not decomposed ) and migrate through the steak ( or other dish ) . While cooking a steak , piperine should migrate far enough into the steak that it does not ultimately reach a temperature where it decomposes . This will cause that portion of the steak to be flavored with piperine . So , the benefit of heating the pepper is specifically so that it will melt and migrate into the dish ( i.e. meld with the foods ) , something that you do n't get by sprinkling it on the top afterwards .
Depending on exactly the recipe you are using it in , I 'd either go for a meaty white fish such as Cod , haddock , or the cheaper fish like pollock . You may also be able to get away with something like mackerel , which is n't as white and chunky but is much cheaper . You should be able to get all of these in a UK supermarket . You could also try a fishmonger ( either in the Supermarket or independent ) - ask them what you could use instead .
If you have a gas stove , you need a hood to send the exhaust outside . One that recirculates is not sufficient . In my experience , the recirculator hoods work OK if you 're not doing a lot of cooking . If you do , however , you 'll end up with a nasty , greasy dusty coating on everything in your kitchen . I would n't bother with a recirculation hood if you ever cook things that involve grease or smoke . For someone who mostly heats up processed foods , it 's probably good enough .
There are three major properties of the liquids : Fat based ( oil , melted butter , bacon drippings , and on ) versus water based ( milk , juice , water , and so on ) . Flavor - some liquids , juices and to a lesser extent , milk have a distinct flavor that will effect the bread Acid - Some liquids , like orange juice , are more acid and affect the pH of the dough Not every liquid falls neatly into these exact categories . Milk , for example , is about 87 % water , 4 % fat , and the rest is sugars and proteins . These differences are often insignificant compared to the overall bread recipe . In general , you can substitute fat-based liquids for other fat based ingredients , and water based liquids for other water based liquids . Most breads also have the capacity to carry additional fats and sugars ( called enrichment ) , which at its extreme leads to breads like brioche which are very sweet and fatty . Eggs are a complex ingredient in that the whites are mostly water , with some protein ( albumin ) , and the yolks are about 50 % water and 50 % fat . See related : <URL> Note that in a bread recipe , with so few ingredients and a deceptively complex chemistry , all of the ingredients have a role to play in the chemistry , so the major factors you are looking at are the overall total ratios of fat , sugar , and water to the flour . Accent ingredients would be add ins like carway seeds in rye bread which do n't incorporate into the dough . In regards to your desire for more olive oil flavor , you almost certainly can substitute olive oil for any fats already in the recipe with comparable results . Most dought can even carry a little more fat , although this will inhibit yeast growth and gluten development , so that you will need more kneading and more proofing time . You can also brush the crust with olive oil before or after baking . The very best way to get olive oil flavor into your bread is to dip it in oil when you eat it . This also allows you to get the full flavor of a quality oil , as many nuances would be lost if it was baked into the bread .
Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom , along with cinnamon and cocoa . Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world , not just in India . If you have reason to want to try this particular recipe , then try the recipe as written . There are thousands of beloved recipes for all kinds of chili . There is no reason to say , " That one looks good , I 'll do it just like that but omit a certain ingredient 'cause it makes me nervous . " Your friend 's advice is a bit odd to me because Garam Masala usually contains cardamom ( sometimes black , green and brown ) My advice is to either try the recipe as written , or find another with which you 're more comfortable . Or come up with your own . There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chili . BTW , I love cardamom in savory . I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup ( Pho ) that I crave if I have n't had it for a while . It would n't be right without cardamom .
Most of the recipes I 've made for Sri Lankan curries typically have pandan , dry curry leaves , fennel , green cardamom , mustard seeds , cloves , cumin , coriander &amp; black peppercorns .
Thierry , Stainless steel French presses work fine . In fact , you can construct a French press out of any chemically inert material : stainless steel , class , ceramic , high-temperature plastic , enameled copper , even marble , and it will make perfectly good coffee . I myself have a collection of porcelain and stoneware presses . What material you choose is really a matter of aesthetics and how you use the press . All of that being said , my experience is that high-quality glass carafes do not break regularly unless you drop them ( which is , admittedly , an issue ) . I 'm wondering if you bought a cheaper carafe with inferior glass , like one from Ikea . I have a Bodum which is at least 8 years old . Also , for brand name presses , you can usually buy replacement carafes , since breakage ( due to dropping ) is a frequent issue . Sometimes the replacements cost as much as a whole new press , but you should at least check it out .
I wok on an electric stove and have found there 's a few tips to really help - its not perfect , but it helps : Preheat , preheat , preheat . Before you start any of your prep , put your wok on the stove and crank the heat . Let it heat up before you do anything at all to it . Make sure everything is at least at room temperature . We often use frozen stir fry veggies , but we thaw them out first and they 're at least at room temp before they go in . The same goes for meat . For sauces , we 'll often microwave it so that its a bit warm before it even goes in . If you have a screaming hot wok , and you add cold food - then for a long time it will only steam the food . Do it in batches . Do n't crowd your wok until everything is already hot . If you 're doing meat and veggies - do the meat first , take it off , let the pan reheat , and then do some of the veggies . Work in batches so that the pan temperature does n't drop and give it time to reheat between batches . Assemble it all at the end .
Assuming that there were stock pots manufactured with handles that broke off , they would likely have been recalled by the CPSC . It <URL> that the CPSC has only ever recalled <URL> that was based on a single report of a handle breaking off . The problematic stock pot was sold by a liquidation company . Based on this , I 'd assume that any NSF certified stock pot that you buy from a reputable retailer is going to be safe .
I think you 're misunderstanding the claim slightly . You do not heat an already pureed soup , you puree and heat in one step . You can indeed make a hot soup from cold ingredients using certain high end blenders . The only one I 've verified this with is the vita-mix . To do this , you put your ingredients in to the blender , turn it on , and let it run about 5 minutes . The friction from the blades heats the soup while chopping the ingredients . The soup will get piping hot . Why would you do it ? It 's easy . It takes about 2 mins to get the soup really smooth , so it 's 3 more minutes to get it hot . That 's faster than you would be able to do with a stove , although maybe slower than a microwave . Is it more efficient ? I do n't know , but I doubt the difference in electrical efficiency is really sufficient to drive a choice one way or the other . In terms of cleaning , you already need to clean the blender because you pureed the soup . There 's no additional cleaning to do if you cook it there too , versus additional cleaning for stove or microwave . And the blender is easy to clean as it 's one piece ; you just add soap and water and turn it on for 30 seconds , then rinse . Personally , I do not think this is " one of the main selling points " . It 's a neat trick , and it 's useful . However , I think that it 's more interesting as an indication of the blenders power . You can use these blenders to make exceptionally smooth soup , make peanut butter , properly crush ice for frozen drinks , etc. . They do this much better than a ' normal ' home blender , but just saying ' better ' probably would n't sell a lot of these things at 4x the price , so they focus on something that the standard home blender most certainly can not do .

How would you make a roux efficiently ?
In a roux , the starches are not normally gelatinized during the production of the roux -- in fact , if you make your roux with oil rather than butter , there is no water present ( other than latent moisture from the flour ) to do so . Roux thickened sauces must normally be brought to the boil ; this is when the actual gelatinization takes place . ... Roux is easy to prepare in larger batches , stove top . Simple use a larger pan , such as a six quart dutch oven . Melt your butter or add your oil , then whisk in the flour . Cook for a couple of minutes ( after the bubbling subsides if using butter ) , and you are good to go . Do n't be afraid to turn the heat up as long as you are standing by , watching and stirring to prevent burning from hot spots . Butter can foam up considerably , so use a large pot in comparison to the quantity of roux . For dark roux , I would start stove top , and finish in the oven to reduce the likelihood of taking the browning too far , and reduce the labor of stirring required . The roux can be refrigerated . You can scoop it with a spoon and add it to sauce at the simmer and whisk , and it will thicken almost instantly . See also : <URL>
I just found the <URL> for it . The name of it is Bak Kwa ( Sweet BBQ Pork Jerky ) . Here 's the <URL> ( boy it 's easy to find things when you know the name ! ) . The recipe actually grind up the pork . They use about 70 % meat and 30 % fat . But according to the wikipedia entry there is also an expensive version where they slice of a solid piece of meat . Sugar and salt was originally used and then the meat was smoked ( this sounds really close to BBQing , which generally cooks the meat with smoke ... yummy tender ribs ) . These days , people make them in the oven at low heat . In the recipe , they put the minced mixture between two sheets of parchment paper , which probably keeps it moist and tender !
What most people do n't get when it comes to food safety : Spoiled food has a chance of making you sick . When food is visibly spoiled , it has large bacterial colonies growing in it . This means that it has been exposed to conditions which were promoting bacterial growth . Anything which was present on your food will have grown , unless outcompeted by something else . The bacteria which make food gross are rarely the ones which make you sick . But if they had the chance to grow , the real pathogens had a chance to grow too . If they were present , then they grew , and you will consume them , together with whatever waste products their colony produced . Assuming that there were infectious bacteria on your food , you will ingest them . From there on , it depends on a ton of factors whether you will get sick or not - the amount you ate , the acidity of your stomach contents , the state of your immune system . The last does not mean " you 'll only get sick if you 're immunocompromised " - it is like being around a person with the flu , even if your immune system is intact , you can still catch it . There are pathogens which can not infect you , but simply produce toxins . Botulinum is the poster child for these , but I think B. cereus also works through a toxin . In this case , eating the food poisons you . Depending on the type and amount of toxin ingested , as well as the current state of your body again ( mostly liver function ) , the symptoms can run the entire spectrum from " so weak you do n't notice them " to " you die despite being correctly diagnosed and treated " . Then there are a few more exotic possibilities , for example Hep C can not cause liver cancer alone , but it does so ( sometimes ) in the presence of a type of toxin produced by moulds . But this is not actually considered foodborne illness any more , even though it 's possible that eating mouldy food was the trigger . It falls outside of the scope of food safety , as the fault can not be pinned on a specific dish you ate . Nevertheless , it 's one more reason to not eat spoiled food . There is also the possibility that your spoiled food has no pathogens at all , and the spoilage microbes outcompeted all the bad guys , and then of course nothing happens . So , to sum it up : if you eat spoiled food , there are four possible outcomes : You get sick ( right away or with an incubation period of 2-3 days ) and notice it You get sick ( right away or with an incubation period of 2-3 days ) but the symptoms are so weak you do n't even notice it You get a different health problem , soon after eating or even years later , without knowing that it was the spoiled food which caused it Nothing happens . There is no way to predict which one will occur . Actually , these outcomes are possible with any food you eat , including safe food , but eating unsafe food increases the probability of the first outcomes a lot , and eating spoiled food increases it even more .
Frozen spinach has been boiled/blanched . You can do this if you really want it to be as much like frozen spinach as possible , but really , you can just cook it with the water left on the leaves from washing - effectively a bit more like steaming . There 's no need to freeze it . This will result in something with fresher flavor and a bit more substantial texture than frozen spinach ( not as eager to disintegrate ) . And you do n't have to worry about moisture much - a lot of the water will cook off - but you can certainly drain it additionally if it 's too much for you . If you really want it exactly like frozen spinach , you could boil it , and maybe even freeze it to help mess up the texture , but I 'm guessing you 'd prefer cooked fresh spinach anyway . In this case , you 'd have to squeeze and drain it just like with frozen spinach to get the water out . ( If it 's unclear how to do this , see <URL> . ) Based on nutrition facts for <URL> and <URL> , one 10 ounce package is approximately the amount you 'll get from cooking a 340g ( 12 ounce ) bunch of spinach - that weight is probably after removing the stems you 're not actually going to cook , though . This fits with my experience cooking down spinach . Most things you 'll use it in are really forgiving , so probably best to err on the larger side with your bunch of spinach !
There is no problem at all doing this . At a restaurant where I worked , we would make up a couple pounds of butter worth of roux at a time . The main thing you want to do is use a pan with a lot of surface area , so it cooks evenly . A whisk will work fine . You do n't have to stir constantly , just frequently .
There are several advantages to using a pressure cooker other than speed , the first of which address your concerns about skimming . If operated correctly the water in a pressure cooker will never come to the boil resulting in a clearer stock than one made by convention means . From Modernist Cuisine ( 2-291 ) : The liquid inside the pressure cooker will not boil , despite the elevated temperature , unless you let the heat get out of hand . A liquid boils when its vapor pressure exceeds the ambient pressure around it . Inside a sealed pressure cooker , as liquid water vaporizes , it raises the ambient pressure , which in turn increases the boiling point . So long as water vapor is not escaping the pressure cooker , the pressure inside will stay high enough to keep liquid water from boiling . Never reaching a boil is important because it keeps the stock clear . Turbulence from boiling emulsifies oils and small food particles from the ingredients into a stock , thereby making it murky . A telltale sign that the stock is at a rolling boil inside a pressure cooker is a jet of steam or fog from the overextended pressure valve . This jet means that the pressure cooker is overpressurized , and for safety 's sake the valve is relieving the pressure . You can further increase the clarity by adding some raw meat to your ingredients to act as a filtering agent . From Modernist Cuisine ( 2-295 ) : Dispersing a small amount of raw ground meat along with the other ingredients when making a pressure-cooked stock yields a stock with the clarity of a traditional consommé . This works because protein extracted from the uncooked ground meat acts just like protein in egg white : it sponges up tiny light scattering fat globules and other small particles . Another benefit comes from the sealed nature of the cooking environment , which prevent volatile aromas from evaporating into the air . Heston Blumenthal cites this as one of the reasons why The Fat Duck began using pressure cookers for their stock in <URL> : Now , this may seem obvious , but when you smell those wonderful odours while you 're cooking , it 's a sign that you 're losing flavours through those volatile elements that disappear in the air . A pressure cooker , however , keeps the aromas and flavour molecules sealed in the pot ... In a normal stockpot , by contrast , water evaporates at boiling point , taking flavour with it . Modernist Cuisine ( 2-292 ) concurs : When the the pressure-cooking step is done , you must let the cooker cool before removing the lid ... Cooling first means that volatile aromas in the vapor above the liquid will condense back into the liquid rather than escape into the kitchen . However , not all pressure cookers are created equal and some will release vapor to maintain pressure resulting in a poorer quality stock . Dave Arnold and Nils Norén from Cooking Issues have done extensive experiments into this phenomenon <URL> : in blind tastings vented pressure cookers produced inferior results to both conventionally cooked stocks and those made with more advanced spring valved cookers ; however , the non-vented vessels produced the best results out of all three methods . Finally , the elevated temperature increases the rate of Maillard reactions resulting in a more flavourful stock . In the Cooking Issues article above the resulting browning was significant enough that it was easy to tell which stock was pressure cooked and which was n't just by visual inspection : The aroma of the pressure cooked stock was clearly superior . The color was deeper as well ( because of this all future tests were done actually blind -- with our eyes closed ) . Unfortunately the conventional stock tasted better . It had a stronger chicken flavor and was better balanced overall . ... I took 4 liters of conventional chicken stock from the restaurant and pressure-cooked half while the other half simmered on the stove . This time , I did n't use the school 's pressure cooker , I used my own . When I compared the two stocks side by side the pressure cooked one was far browner . I had n't thought the pressure cooker would change the color of a pre-made stock . When we tasted them the pressure-cooker won .
Kosher salt and a small amount of vegetable oil . Scrub the pan with the salt on a rag or paper towel , if there are stubborn bits mix a couple drops of oil with the salt , wipe dry with clean towel . If you use a wet method to clean the pan re-heat it after cleaning to make sure it is completely dry before storing .
Really , this is just to even out cooking times for vegetables that do n't have a surface area to volume ratio consistent with the other things you 're stir-frying . If you were to shred those green beans , as is sometimes done , you could put them in at the same time as raw , julienned carrots , and they would finish at the same time . If you put them in whole , you 'll end up with beans that are burned on the outside and raw on the inside , as there 's not enough time for the heat to penetrate to the center of the bean before the outside burns . Or , if you fry at a lower heat , you could get the beans cooked , but would have to add the carrots later ( which means a lower temperature , too , since the beans are dragging heat out of your pan ) in order to have them not turn to mush .
There 's no fixed number , as you have too many other variables : How big are the people eating ? ( athletes are going to eat more than kids or people on diets ) What are they being served with ? ( If it 's just a table filled w / crabs , they 're going to eat more than if you have other side dishes available ) How experienced are the people with eating crabs ? ( Some folks are so slow at picking crabs they 'll give up in annoyance . Others are so skilled they 'll wolf them down quickly . In high school , some folks I know from the Eastern Shore would pick the backfin out then trash the rest , ignoring the flake and the claws ) How are they being served ? ( very spicy will slow most people down . And you have to remind the crab newbies to wash their hands before using the bathroom ) What temperature is it ? ( on really hot days , people eat less ) How long is it going to be ? ( if you 're hanging out all day , people might get a second wind and go for more crabs ) I 'm going to guess that if they 're ' mixed ' , they 're probably mediums , so maybe 7 or 8 dozen per bushell . 3 or 4 crabs per person is about typical , adjusting mostly based on the the factors above . ( large , physically active folks or experienced pickers might eat 6 or more ... inexperienced folks often give up by the second one ... but you 'll want more if you 're doing it as an all-day thing , or if it 's almost all crabs and hardly any sides ) I guess just make sure you have plenty of drinks and some sides for those that give up on the crabs or if you run out . ... And do n't just go and pitch the shells afterwards ... you can generally get quite a bit more meat going them a second look through ( the folks who skipped claws if nothing else ) , and picking whatever 's left over . Freeze that meat , then rinse the legs ( most people do n't crack and suck them ) to get most of the seasoning off , crack them , and simmer them to make a crab stock for bisque . If you have a really large pot , go for the rest of the shells , too ... strain , boil it down to concentrate it , then freeze . You 'd be tempted to add extra stuff to the stock besides the shells , but as we do n't know how much seasoning 's still on the crabs , you really need to wait 'til it 's done , then add other stuff when using it to make the final dish .
I think you 're a bit unclear what meningitis is . It is n't something like smallpox or salmonella , which are caused by a specific pathogen . Meningitis stands for an inflammation of the membranes covering the brain surface , and it can be caused by a number of pathogens . There is bacterial meningitis , viral meningitis , parasitic meningitis , and even meningitis where it is n't possible to find out what caused it . As such , it is just wrong to say that a food can be a " meningitis carrier " . If you want to say that every organism contaminated with a pathogen which can potentially cause meningitis is a " meningitis carrier " , then everything is a meningitis carrier , including the lips of your significant other . If a significant proportion of contacts with a " meningitis carrier " lead to meningitis , humanity would have died out before it discovered fire . So first , you ca n't react to such news as to a statement like " escargot can carry salmonella " . Second , if " meningitis carrier " was the real wording of your source , this is a red flag for its credibility . If the material which you read says that " escargot is sometimes contaminated with bacterium X , which has been known to cross the blood brain barrier in a big percentage of infected people and cause meningitis " , you should look up the combinations of time and temperature required for a 6-log10 reduction of this bacterium ( the USDA publishes such data ) and make sure that this temperature has been maintained at the core of the food for at least the time indicated . Just throwing into boiling water and waiting is n't enough , because you do n't know when the core of the food reaches the temperature prescribed . If your source does n't mention the type of pathogen , you ca n't assume that boiling will kill it . There are bacteria on Earth which proliferate in hot geysers , and while it is unlikely that they can both live in escargot and cause meningitis , making the assumption that boiling can kill any pathogen is reckless . If the source was credible , you need to hunt more information , until you know which pathogen is meant , then follow the previous paragraph . If your source was n't especially credible , something like a tabloid saying " A child ate escargot and landed in hospital with meningitis ! We will all die with our brains converted to swollen puss if we eat escargot !!! " , then it was some common pathogen which happened to somehow reach a victim 's brain in a single case . Disregard the meningitis scare , look up the guidelines for cooking escargot , and stick to them in order to eliminate the common pathogens contained in it . edit : now you have updated your question , it was possible to do some research . The parasite was the easy one . This paper is used as a basis for the safety guidelines of some government organs , e. g. the public health agency of Canada : <URL> . As it does n't say how the 2-3 minutes are measured , I 'd wait until the core of a snail is at 55 ° C , and measure at least 3 minutes after that ( or more , for added safety ) . This will make you safe from the parasite infection , which sometimes causes meningitis ( and is probably unpleasant even if it does n't reach the brain ) . As for bacteria , I did n't find any special information about escargot or any kind of land snails . As all the mentions of escargot and meningitis together I found pointed to the parasite as a cause , there probably is n't an escargot specific bacterium which causes meningitis or other unusual illness . So the usual food safety guidelines apply . Sadly , the various food safety organs of different countries do n't seem to have published specific guidelines for escargot ( maybe the French have , but I do n't speak French ) . You can use the guidelines for seafood , because for food safety purposes , <URL> Foodsafety.gov is a good place to start for the home cook - even if you do n't live in the USA , you can trust them to have chosen good guidelines . <URL> also contains good information , it lists 145 ° F internal temperature for seafood , but , strangely , no time period .
Some essences and herbs need alcohol to be extracted , but not strawberries . Extracts from berries can be made in the pressure cooker , to later turn into syrups or jellies . Here 's a step-by-step photos and instructions on how to do it . <URL> You could then mix the syrup with vodka , instead of mineral water as in the recipe , to make a strawberry cocktail .
Sure ! You can make jerky out of any meat that is n't too fatty . Jerky is just meat that has been flavored and dried . The drying has to be done with care no matter what kind of meat you use , experimentation is playing with food-safety fire . Homemade chicken jerky for dogs was loudly in the news a few years ago because a lot of dogs got sick and even mysteriously died after eating chicken jerky dog treats imported from China . To my knowledge , the mystery has never been solved , but a lot of people started making their own chicken jerky at that point . I have no idea if there is any benefit to using a stewing chicken vs a young chicken for jerky . I rarely see stewing chickens , and if I got a hold of one I 'd stew it , but that 's just me . At least in the US , they are not common . <URL> The USDA does not endorse using any method for drying other than a dehydrator or an oven . They also ( in a step not included in many recipes ) recommend fully cooking the meat or poultry before dehydrating . <URL> Beyond taking proper safety precautions , your choice of meat for jerky is your own . My favorite is salmon .
If you just want to change the color - just some <URL> should be fine . If you ca n't find it in a store locally , you can always see if a bakery that does cakes will give you just a tiny bit or if they 'll blend a few colors to make a dark gray .
I make steel cut oats in a slow cooker , stick them in the fridge and then slice off a chunk to eat each day . In a slow cooker add 2 cups steel cut oats 8 cups water 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon cinnamon Cook on low for 8 hours . When complete , let cool some and transfer to another container and refrigerate . The next morning , scoop out a hunk into a bowl , splash a little milk on it and heat it up in the microwave . Add fruits and toppings as desired . For safety , the cooked porridge should be discarded after 5 days .
You 'll want to temper the melted chocolate . This means holding it at 88 ° F ( 31 ° C ) while it cools until it is completely hardened , then finally allowing it to return to room temperature ( or lower ) afterward . If you temper the chocolate this way , it will be much harder and last indefinitely at room temperature . The easiest way to temper chocolate is the " seed method " , which means adding a piece of solid ( never-melted ) chocolate to the fully-melted chocolate after removing it from the heat source and stirring thoroughly until the temperature reaches 88 ° F / 31 ° C , and then keeping it at that temperature until you 're ready to use it . ( Note that this is for dark chocolate ; for temperatures for other types of chocolate and for a more detailed guide to tempering , I suggest you check out the <URL> . ) The technical explanation for this is that the temperature at which melted chocolate hardens determines its final consistency as a solid . If chocolate hardens at room temperature , it ends up forming a very weak crystalline structure that begins to melt at even the slightest rise in temperature ( i.e. in your hand ) . Allowing it to solidify at the highest possible temperature below the actual melting point ensures that it forms a denser crystalline structure and will not melt at room temperature .
There are noted resources for flavor pairing , many of which you can find on this site . Check out <URL> . You 'll find : <URL> <URL> , including suggestions for <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> ( here 's a start for your <URL> ) <URL> <URL> For your specific question of what goes well with citrus rind , you already know chocolate is a good match and that you are putting the sauce on brownies . Nuts in your brownies will be a good match too , especially pecans . Caraway , thyme , cardamom , or black pepper might add an unexpected note with orange . Rosemary is a very nice match for lemon . I recently made cookies using orange zest and black pepper that came out quite well . If you want the citrus flavor to dominate I would leave out the berries . Otherwise I 'd definitely use the raspberries , which go well with citrus . The bluberries would be fine , but I would n't consider them your best choice .
Hot peppers wo n't work with brine , as brine is water-based and capsaicin ( the pepper hotness ) is not soluble in water . You would need an oil-based marinade to pass the ' heat ' .
Melting carob is a bit different from chocolate . The sugar crystal formation is not the same for tempering chocolate . One suggestion is to add paramount crystals ( which is a combination of palm kernel oil and soy lecithin ) to help start/control the process . I would also recommend not keeping the double boiler actually on the double boiler for the entire time . Heat it up until some of the carob melts . Remove from heat and stir . Add it back to the heat and continue removing to stir as each bit melts a little more . It takes longer but it allows you to control the heating and crystallization process . End the end , you should have a smoother and more even end result .
Why the doming happens When you heat leavened dough , two things happen : leavening agent creates bubbles , causing the soft dough to rise . For chemically leavened doughs ( baking powder or baking soda ) , the amount of lift mostly depends on the time the bubble creating reaction goes on and the concentration of non-spent leavening agent . The gluten in the dough sets , building a sturdy 3-d mesh of long , branchey molecules . When the mesh is strong enough , further bubbles can not stretch it more , despite the fact that the leavening reaction is still going on . The setting of the mesh depends mostly on heat and the amount of gluten present in flour . The pattern you are seeing means that your cake gets hotter on the sides than in the middle . The sides get set early and stop rising , while the middle is still soft and continues rising . This happens because the walls of the pan conduct heat to the sides of the cake quicker than heat is conducted inside the cake . You see the phenomenon in an exaggarated form in a muffin , which is usually higher than wide : it is always rounded on top , and often split , because the liquid core from the middle continues to rise after a crust has formed on the surface . How to prevent it Slower heating One good solution could involve a slower , more even heating method . This can be accomplished by using a pan which insulates well . With an insulating pan , the sides will stay liquid longer and rise more . Unfortunately there are no insulated drop-out-bottom pans . Porcelain I have had good results in a porcelain or Pyrex pan . The pan insulates the cake from the bottom and the sides , but not from the top , so you will need to bake it on a lower rack and/or reduce temperature on the upper heater in order to not burn the upper surface . Getting a cake layer out of the pan in one piece can be hard . To deal with this problem , if your batter is not too sticky , the bottom of the pan can be lined with parchment paper . The sides can be lined with a strip of parchment or well lubricated with fat . This approach is a hassle . Insulate a metal pan Perhaps , when combined with other approaches , a metal cake pan with thicker walls will work well enough . You could also try a more DIY solution , like attaching 2-3 layers of a cut-to-fit silicone rolling mat stripes to the outside of the walls of a metal pan . However , it is quite hard to come up with a good attachment method ( glue could release toxic fumes at oven temperatures , if it holds at all ) . So this method should work , but is somewhat hard to apply . Glass and silicone pans There are pans with glass bottoms and silicone walls but I think these would not help because the glass would insulate better than the thin silicone . Preheating Perhaps preheating the detached bottom of a metal pan with the oven could help , but I have n't tried it . Minimize the center A second approach is to minimize the liquid core by making a thin cake . If the middle of the cake is heated quickly enough from above and below , it will set shortly after the walls do , and there will be no unset center to " bloom " . Use a bigger pan . I think that Americans mostly use 9 inch pans , but if you used an original sacher recipe from Austria , it is probably meant for a 26 or a 28 cm pan . Bake the two layers separately Divide the batter into two pans instead of making a single layer and cutting it . This is unorthodox , as you get more crust but it 's better than a hunchbacked sacher . You should use a scale or at least a measuring jug to divide the batter , or you 'll end up with different thicknesses . Also remember to reduce the baking time , as the core will heat up faster . Use a toothpick for probing doneness . Reduce the leavening The third idea is to reduce the amount of leavening agent . The walls will always set before the core and , if there is enough baking powder , the core will still expand a little bit more . If the concentration of baking powder is low you 'll get less bubbles , so less lift . Of course , using too little baking powder will also ruin the cake , so you 'll have to be cautious and experiment a bit before hitting the correct amount . Lower heat The fourth approach is to give the outer portions of the cake more time to rise by baking at lower heat . This is somewhat risky , as it can result in a different texture of the final product , due to the different rate at which water will evaporate from the dough and a longer baking time . Also , if your temperature is too low , you wo n't get a golden crust on a light-coloured dough . This should not be a problem for a frosted cake like the sacher . Less gluten The fifth approach is to use a flour with less gluten . With less gluten you get a mesh which is less dense and needs more time until it gets firm enough to prevent rising . Use cake flour instead of all purpose flour . A bit more fat will also help to inhibit gluten development but too much will change the taste and texture . All methods I described should attribute t
Tomato paste is just tomatoes with the water removed , essentially . I 'd slice the tomatoes in half and roast them ( cut side up ) at 350 degrees F for an hour ( this will concentrate the flavour nicely and you can add s &amp; p/olive oil/herbs/garlic if you want ) . Then mash them through a sieve or food mill to get a smooth consistency . Then put that tomato puree in a pot and just boil them down until it 's as thick as you want . As it gets thicker , you 'll need to stir it regularly to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning .

Why was my Last Word cocktail red ?
More likely is that he used the syrup that <URL> are stored in . It 's sometimes used by those who do n't know better in things like <URL> . It is bright , bright red , very sweet , very strongly flavored of cherries ( or more properly a sort of sickly , artificial interpretation of the flavor ) . I hope it 's obvious that I 'm not a fan of this stuff . If this was his first time making the drink , it seems likely that he misinterpreted the term <URL> , which is altogether different . It 's distilled from <URL> ( which are actually quite sour and bitter , not sweet ) and has a much more subtle , complex flavor . Quite frankly , I 'd consider this a pretty dumb error - it 's like using orange juice instead of orange liqueur . If the bar does n't carry maraschino liqueur , then they ca n't make a proper Last Word . Brands like Luxardo are pretty ubiquitous at good cocktail bars in the US these days , so there 's not much excuse for lacking it . My advice is either to buy this fellow a good craft cocktail book , or stick to ordering beer and wine from him from now on .
There are a few things I can think of . The first is , are you sure your oven is at the right temperature ? Although your oven may beep that it 's preheated , without checking it with an oven or infrared thermometer you ca n't be sure that it 's actually at the temperature you need - and even if it is at that temperature where the sensor is , it might not be the same temperature elsewhere in the oven . Try moving the rack you 're using one or two levels closer to or further from the element and see if it makes a difference ( further will probably be better if you 're trying to increase spread ) . My oven has a 50-75 & deg ; F range from the top rack to the bottom - a major difference when it comes to baking ! Understanding my oven 's temperature range changed my baking outcomes significantly . Second , are you letting the dough come to room temperature before baking ? I 've found that the colder my dough , the less spread I get . On Betty Crocker 's site , there is <URL> and under " Why do n't my cookies spread " , they recommend using an aluminum sheet - the darker the cookie sheet , apparently , the less spread you will get . I have n't tested this personally , but I trust the source :) I get good spread on my silpat baking sheets , for what it 's worth . The only other thing I can think of is your butter , is it truly softened , or is it a hard block , or is it melted ? I 'm not an experienced enough baker to explain the science behind the differences as they relate to baking , but I do know that those three options will produce significantly different results . I believe that if your butter is too cold , they wo n't spread as much as they could - but hopefully someone can chime in and confirm or deny that . Oh , and I asked a friend of mine who 's a baker - she said that it 's possible that your baking soda is old , and that could cause it , but I do n't know from first hand experience if that 's possible or not . I trust her judgment though , as she 's my go-to with baking questions and she 's never led me astray .
I 've never made seitan , but just like when making bread , gluten needs water to activate . I do n't know the precise amount . Oil , if anything , has the opposite effect , coating the gluten molecules and keeping them from linking up , which is why we use fat in pastries to keep them from getting tough .
I think it all got too hot , but there might be other problems . Did you mix the cornstarch in completely ? Leaving undissolved cornstarch is a sure way to obtain ' blobs ' . Did you pour the hot milk onto the egg-mixture ? You should do that very slowly and whisk vigorously ( while trying to splash everything ) . If the eggs get too hot , they will coagulate . Did you use a double boiler ? Putting the pan on an open flame will make the bottom too hot and the eggs will coagulate . Even if you did use a double boiler , did you whisk regularly while heating ? The eggs at the bottom will become far warmer than the eggs in the center ... As rumtscho mentioned , a thermometer will be useful for monitoring the done-ness of the custard . Generally , a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 ° C ; it begins setting at 70 ° C. Source : <URL>
I think you probably used too much flour for the amount of liquid in your gravy -- instead of gravy , you made pudding . You might be able to thin it down by whisking in some additional liquid such as milk or water before reheating it . However , next time use half ( or even less ) percentage of flour to liquid , and you 'll have better results .
It 's caused by the high amount of potassium in the banana . Microwaves react with metals , bouncing off and cause arcing . You can even create a cool light show by putting a raw peeled banana in the microwave . Do n't worry , it wo n't explode , but it will make a mess , it 's also harmless . This can also happen in some <URL> depending on the soil conditions they grew in . As noted in the linked article , other high concentrations of metals such as magnesium , iron , and zinc can be the responsible mineral . Momentary brief sparking is harmless and wo n't harm your microwave , but the USDA recommends turning off your microwave if you see sparks nonetheless . If it does start a fire , unless it 's a very small fire , do not open your microwave door . The safest thing is to turn off the microwave and let the fire burn itself out by consuming all the oxygen . Opening the door could create a dangerous backdraft induced fireball . Edit : Found a <URL> . See Also : <URL> <URL>
Gravy is supposed to be opaque and is a result of using flour as the thickener . If you want clear gravy , like what you would get in a Chinese restaurant , then you need to use corn starch or arrowroot as your thickener . But the opacity is considered to be a good thing . It 's the canned stuff you buy in the store that is clear .
The pigments that give onions the colour behave like a litmus test . They are red in the naturally acidic onion . They turn green/blue in an alkaline environment . It sounds like when you cooked the beans it created that alkaline environment to cause the colour change . <URL>

Minerals , naturally found in salt whether it 's mined or evaporated ; and believe it or not , water . <URL> In the US , the FDA requires that salt must not contain more than 2.5 % minerals other than NaCl and still call itself salt . That 2.5 % does not include water . <URL> Your numbers for sodium content seem a bit low , but not extremely so , especially for a very unrefined , wet salt . The more refined the salt , the less trace minerals it will contain . Outside the US , it 's possible that your salt also contains added iodine , fluoride , folic acid and/or anti-caking agents , but in the US those would be listed among the ingredients , and would be included in that 2.5 % . Only iodine and anti-caking agents are common in the US . Plus , nutritional information labels have legal margins of error . If and when they can , they 'll be slick . Lower sodium looks good on a nutritional label .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
The recipe 's goal is to use the natural bacteria in the beets and beet peels to cause the fermentation . The thing about using natural bacteria is that you never know what these are going to be , so it 's a crapshoot what flavors you are going to get . Beets produced in one farm may have radically different bacteria in them , different varieties grown in the same patch of land could also vary significantly . It 's the same process as making a sourdough bread starter using natural yeasts - you may get a nice smooth and delicate flavor , or you could get something that will take the paint off of a door . The point is that you may be doing everything right , it 's just that 's what you are going to get from the process . Looking at the science of the natural yeasts and assuming the recipe writer is not talking complete BS , it could be that the delicate bacteria spoken of in the recipe is being out-competed by the other natural bacteria in the water you use , and on the surface of the container , lid , and airlock . The thing to do in this case is to reduce or eliminate these other bacteria so that the beet bacteria will be the only game in town . To do this use sterilized water ( buy distilled or simply boil your water for a few minutes before letting it cool completely ) , or run your water through a filter which will remove or kill bacteria . Then use a chlorine solution to sterilize every single piece of equipment you will use . That means the container , lid , lock , spoons - anything that will come into contact must be very clean . Wash your beets in sterilized water as well . I 'd do that to the equipment even if I used a culture , it will increase my chances of a good result . If that does n't work you may have to accept that is the way natural kvass will taste . It could be that the writer of the article likes it that way , or simply does n't know what he/she is talking about . In that case consider using a culture - there 's no dishonor in it and you 'll get something drinkable .
It 's simply not ripe yet Do n't buy avocado 's or any other fruit and vegetable in pre-packed bags , you can not tell what state they are in Buy from a local grocer whom you can trust , and therefore can get honest answers on the state of the produce Avocados are usually sold unripe for shipping reasons . Buy ahead of need , and let them ripen at room temperature ( 2 to 7 days ) . They will keep in the fridge if you need them latter than that To recover an peeled unripe avocado , you can cube it , and then cook it in the microwave in short bursts to soften it . It 's only good for salsa or sauce at that point though . One advantage of slightly cooking avocado is that the green colour becomes more intense , I suspect this explains the guacamole colour from many fast food vendors :-)
Welcome . According to the excerpt below from <URL> , kidney beans are an acceptable substitute . azuki bean = adzuki bean = Tiensin red bean = aduki bean = asuki bean = field pea = red Oriental bean = feijao bean = red chori Equivalents : 1 cup dried yields 3 cups cooked beans Pronunciation : a-ZOO-kee Notes : The Japanese use these small red beans to make sweet red bean paste , but they 're also good in rice dishes or salads . Azuki beans are sweet and relatively easy to digest , so they wo n't make you as gassy as other beans . They also do n't take as long to cook . Substitutes : black azuki beans OR red kidney beans OR Tolosana beans That said , while you may be able to substitute them you may need to make adjustments to end up with a similar bean paste . For example you may need to add more sugar as adzuki beans have a natural slightly sweet flavor . Also , even though you have canned beans , they may require a bit of cooking to get them to the right softness . ( Adzuki beans tend to have a very creamy texture . ) Note that dark red kidney beans tend to be more firm than light red . All said and done , you can probably make adjustments and end up with a slightly different result . But as for me , I would get the adzuki beans .
You need to 1 ) increase the emulsification , and 2 ) reduce the amount of time the sauce is very hot . You can try adding honey or mustard to the sauce , that will improve emulsification . You can also hit it with a stick blender which will do a much better job of breaking it up than can be done by hand . Also it may look ok after a few hours but who knows how much separation is starting to happen at a very small scale and will accelerate when it hits heat . Add the sauce at the last possible moment before plating . It is n't going to benefit from cooking , and it is n't going to marinade into the cooked food , so do n't have it in any longer than it takes for it to warm up . 20 seconds is probably all it will take .
I 've done it before without problems . Even if they 're peanut butter &amp; jelly ( something that 's typically stored in the fridge ) , it has so much sugar in it that it 's inhospitable to microbes . If you want to play it extra safe , and the sandiwiches wo n't be easten shortly after you leave , you could place them in the freezer and then let them thaw in your bag . ... all that being said , if you 're in the US , the TSA considers peanut butter to be a gel , so wo n't let you fly with a container of it . I have no idea what their rules are in sandwich form . ( I 've never tried it , as I typically fly w / cold cut sandwiches , and just take them straight from the fridge before I go ) .
If the yeast is n't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water . It should be between 105-110 . If it 's too cool then you wo n't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you 'll start to kill it . Another possible case can be when you 're adding the salt . If it 's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast . Get the yeast , sugar , water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour . Add the salt as you 're starting to bring the dough together so that it does n't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development . If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator , make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast .
<URL> is the bark of a tree . It is either sold as rolled strips of bark ( = cinnamon sticks ) or ground . It will not dissolve , neither in water nor in alcohol . What you want to do is basically the same as was done commercially with the vanilla extract you are already using : Extract the taste , then discard the bark itself . Alcohol is a good choice for extracting volatile aromatics . You could try and soak a few cinnamon sticks or a few tablespoons of ground cinnamon in a " neutral " alcohol like vodka or - if you are using it exclusively for your signature drink - use the brandy . This process might take from a few days to a few weeks , so nothing you can do " on the spur of the moment " . Another good carrier for the cinnamon taste would be water . You can simmer a few cinnamon sticks in water , then sieve . This is the same method that is used for mulled wine or mulled cider . To extend the shelf life of the " cinnamon water " , you might considering turning it into simple syrup by boiling it with an equal amount of sugar . Whether you use water or alcohol is a question of personal taste and planned other uses . The shelf life of an alcohol based extract might be longer , but with a sufficiently high sugar content , clean handling and refrigeration the syrup will last long , too . Time is a factor : The syrup can be ready and cooled in an hour or so , whereas the alcohol will take significantly more time . Both methods work for vanilla , too - you could even make a " instant mix " for your drink . Be warned , though : Filtering ground cinnamon from a liquid can be quite a hassle . It tends to clog coffe filters , but is too fine to be held back by a sieve . If you decide to use ground cinnamon because that 's what you have at hand , consider letting it settle at the bottom of your container and carefully decanting the liquid from top . A coffe filter or a cloth-lined sieve can catch stray particles . You should get much better results by using whole or coarsely crushed cinnamon sticks . There has been an ongoing discussion on what kind of cinnamon to use , so a short wrap-up here : Cinnamon is derived from a group of plants , which vary in their properties and compounds . Especially <URL> , a substance also found in tonka bean , woodruff and other plants , has been widely discussed for its toxicity and is regulated in the EU . <URL> has the highest content whereas <URL> contains only traces . From a culinary point , the cheaper cassia , which contains more bark and is usually sold ground or in pieces , is often considered inferior in taste to the true cinnamon , which often comes in sticks . I will not venture a statement here , neither on health nor culinary claims . I am sure every reader of this post is capable of making an informed decision .
Try heating the cream and milk to just below a simmer . Right before adding the milk mixture to the yolks whisk the sugar , vanilla , and eggs together . Pour the hot milk mixture into eggs very slowly . It 's best to strain it through a fine strainer . If you use vanilla bean make sure to add it after straining it . Let cool a little before putting it into the fridge . It should be cold before making the ice cream . It 's not necessary to fully temper ice cream base like crème anglaise .
I have this recipe on my short list to try : <URL> Few things I 've noticed in her recipe and my own experience with pies containing whole lemons . The meyer lemons as she notes make a huge difference . Mind you their growing season is short and they are not available everywhere . If you have access to them , then all the better . Otherwise find the sweetest variety you can . If you can , select lemons with as thin rinds as possible . That all said , the shaker pie is designed to be sweet , sour and bitter . How bitter depends on the above .

How do you stop limes from drying out ?
Cook 's Illustrated recommends storing lemons in the fridge in a tightly sealed ziptop bag with the excess air removed . I would imagine that the same applies to limes . As I understand it , the idea is to prevent air circulation in order to reduce the rate of dehydration . <URL>
In my experiment , blue potatoes were substitutable for Yukon Golds . However : Blue potatoes are smaller than Yukon Golds . Therefore , cooking time should be lessened by a between half to a third , particularly when parboiling . Rather than having the subtle creamy flavor of Yukons , Blue potatoes have a distinctly nutty flavor . This flavor may drown out more subtle flavors that are common to recipes calling for Yukon Golds .
For Easter , a friend and I cooked rabbits . We marinated for 72 hours in buttermilk , dijon , rosemary , and sage ( NO SALT ) . Then boned them out and spatchcocked them ( sort of a butterfly , with skewers to hold the flat spread out shape ) , seasoned , and roasted at 350 until done . Moist , flavourful . Served with parsnip puree , rosemary potatoes roasted in duck fat , and sorry but I forget the other veg we used .
you know better than I do , it depends on the orange and type of orange . My mom , an executive chef , used to say that you 'd allow 1-2 lb of oranges for 1 drinkable cup of orange juice . I really think , that it 's highly dependent on the type of orange . I know naval and blood oranges are the juiciest compared to other varieties .
There are three factors when cooking oats or similar like cooked pudding or flan : Stirring You have to be fairly diligent because if you do not stir constantly or at least in quite short intervals , the starchy mix near the bottom will stick . You need to " scrape " the entire bottom , not forgetting the outer areas or some streaks in the middle . This is somewhat connected to : Heat The lower your heat , the lesser the risk of burning - simply because you have a bit more time until you need to stir up the layer closest to the pot 's bottom . Less splatter is a nice side effect , too . If you initially bring your milk to a vigourous boil , you might still have too much residual heat even if you turn down your stove . Sugar Yes , you did n't mention it , but in my observation adding sugar early during the cooking process might sweeten " the inner parts " of your oats better , but it heightens the risk of burning . Adding sugar at the end allows me to use less sugar for the same percieved sweetness as well . You could also consider a non-stove technique like cooking them in a microwave , but you need to watch it closely the first few times to figure out the ideal power / timing combination for your serving sizes and microwave power , otherwise the oats have a tendency to " creep out " of your bowl and we 're back at the " a pain to clean " stage . Soaking the oats overnight ( - > overnight oats ) can reduce the cooking time , because they are already soft .
The best way that I have found to cook okra , and prevent it from being slimy is to avoid cooking it with moisture . If you dredge it in seasoned cornmeal , then pan fry it , you get none of the slime that is common to okra . I have n't done any tests to verify if a quick fry would then prevent it from developing slime if you then add liquid , however . If you 're trying to add the okra to a soup or a sauce , you might still need to spend some time cooking it to break down the slime .
Based on comments , the likely culprit is moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and into your other ingredients . Mushrooms contain a surprising amount of liquid , and when cooking them you 'll see that they shrink down significantly due to moisture loss . If you 're adding them to other ingredients , some of the resulting liquid is hanging around in the pan long enough to discolor other , lightly colored items like eggs or tofu . What I would suggest is sauteeing your mushrooms by themselves for at least a couple minutes , to release their moisture prior to adding everything else . <URL> . Be sure you salt them to draw out moisture , and make sure that you do n't crowd the pan ( see <URL> ) so that the moisture can cook off effectively . Both eggs and tofu should cook fairly quickly , so you can add them after the first couple minutes and the mushrooms can continue to brown and cook afterwards . If you have other ingredients that need to cook for an extended amount of time , you may want to cook your mushrooms separately if the color bothers you . If you 're using a separate pan , this wo n't really add additional time , but you will have extra cleaning to do . Mushrooms are funky that way - common sense might indicate that they be cooked like vegetables , but there 's a reason why <URL> instead .
As you suggest , there are a number of factors , but the best rule of thumb I 've found for pan-frying is to use just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan by swirling it around . In general , you do n't want puddles ( you 'll get splashed with hot oil ) , but if the pan is n't covered then your food might not get cooked evenly . These days I mostly just eyeball it , and err on the generous side . Using slightly too much is n't likely to hurt your dish - unused oil just wo n't get absorbed - but using too little will result in under-cooked or inconsistently-cooked food and probably a lot of gunk stuck to the bottom of your pan . So if you 're not sure , just add a little more than you think you absolutely need .
Sure ! You can make jerky out of any meat that is n't too fatty . Jerky is just meat that has been flavored and dried . The drying has to be done with care no matter what kind of meat you use , experimentation is playing with food-safety fire . Homemade chicken jerky for dogs was loudly in the news a few years ago because a lot of dogs got sick and even mysteriously died after eating chicken jerky dog treats imported from China . To my knowledge , the mystery has never been solved , but a lot of people started making their own chicken jerky at that point . I have no idea if there is any benefit to using a stewing chicken vs a young chicken for jerky . I rarely see stewing chickens , and if I got a hold of one I 'd stew it , but that 's just me . At least in the US , they are not common . <URL> The USDA does not endorse using any method for drying other than a dehydrator or an oven . They also ( in a step not included in many recipes ) recommend fully cooking the meat or poultry before dehydrating . <URL> Beyond taking proper safety precautions , your choice of meat for jerky is your own . My favorite is salmon .
One strong possibility is that the recipe is overleavened , which will cause it to blow up fast and then collapse . <URL> recommends 1 teaspoon baking powder or 1/4 teaspoon baking soda per cup of flour as a guideline . If your recipe is much beyond that , suspect that is the issue .
Fill a basin or hotel pan with water . Place in your smoker . Ensure the smoker heat is set below 100C/212F ( adjust as necessary for distance above/below sea level ) . Um ... smoke . An hour should do fine . More if you want more . Optionally strain through a superbag or muslin to remove any deposited particulate matter .
This can be a hard one to get right . There are three important phases of baking these : An brief initial high heat phase A longer lower heat phase A brief slow cooling phase For the initial phase I go with 400 ℉ for 15 minutes . The high heat provides a rapid rise with a hollow center . For the second phase I reduce the heat to 350 ℉ for 30-40 minutes . This phase allows the shells to firm up and dries out the center . At this point you should cut one of them in half and see how moist the center is . It 's important that the center of the dough be as dry as possible here , having an undercooked center is what causes the dough to deflate . A little bit of moisture is ok . For the final phase , turn the oven off and let them cool with the door ajar for 10-15 minutes . With the door fully open the rapid cooling can also trigger deflation .
You can use Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening : its is on PETA 's ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) shopping list of baking goods , but can work just as well for frying as lard .
Hot gasses such as steam and CO2 trapped inside the dough by the crust are important to help properly bake the bread , as well as to give it form and structure . If you cut a slice off the end of the bread before the bread has finished baking , you completely change the conditions under which the bread finishes baking : steam will escape rather than building up , the internal temperature probably wo n't rise as much , and the bread will tend to dry out rather than cook . If you 're not sure whether your bread is done , you should take its temperature . An instant-read , digital thermometer with as fine a probe as possible is best because it compromises the crust the least . For the same reasons , you should let bread cool as @justkt suggests before cutting into the loaf . Bread smells great when it 's hot , but it tastes best when it has cooled somewhat .
Optimal texture is about optimal heat transfer . When a vegetable releases so much water that it simmers in its own juices instead of pan-roasting , you should increase the heat transfer . To achieve that , you need to 1 ) use high heat , 2 ) not overcrowd the pan , and 3 ) use a pan which is capable of better heating . Cast iron is perfect for these situations , heavy steel pans too . Aluminium is much harder to work with , especially if it 's thin . Also do n't use a nonstick pan , you 'll destroy the coating at the temperatures needed . This technique can be used on its own , or combined with something else , for example oven drying . But note that a zucchini is over 90 % water , so you wo n't be able to simply get it dry enough to resemble a dough noodle .
If you want to turn your cold butter spreadable quickly , patience is about your only option . You can try microwaving it very briefly , and maybe on the " defrost " setting , but you run a strong risk of melting it too much . If I 'm thinking of the same thing you are , a butter conditioner is really just a unit that allows you to keep your butter in the fridge but still keep it closer to room temp -- so that 's more about storage than turning hard butter into spreadable butter on the spot . A storage option that allows you to keep your butter fresh for a pretty long period , but still leave it out on the counter so it 's soft , is a butter bell . You can look them up online -- many shops have them . It 's basically an inverted cup that sits inside a larger one with a little water at the bottom . The butter is packed into the inverted cup and stays put when you place the cup so the edges are under the water in the other cup . The water keeps air out so the butter stays fresh even at room temperature . You could do the same thing by mashing a bunch of butter into a teacup , then setting it upside down in a saucer full of water . If it 's too hot in your house , though , the butter will slip out of the inverted cup , so I mostly only use our butter bell in the winter . One thing to note about butter itself : Some butters are more spreadable at cooler temperatures . The Irish and French butters we can get here are much closer to spreadable at refrigerator temperatures than the regular US supermarket brands . I 'm not sure what the difference is , though .
You would use raw corn . You can either grill it on the cob , or use a <URL> .
Well , if it was a boat , you 'd swab it every few days ( " swab the desk " ) so it stayed wet and swollen . You could also treat the bucket with a food-grade mineral oil . You can find it in most kitchenware stores for protecting cutting boards . The oil will evaporate much slower than water will , but it will still evaporate . You might try putting the whole thing in a large plastic bag or similar container , so whatever moisture evaporates stays in the air surrounding the bucket , slowing further moisture loss ... but moist , stagnant air is n't good for long periods of time , either , as you could end up with mold that would be even more annoying to deal with . Or , as the bucket 's only touching the ice &amp; salt mix , and not coming in direct contact with food , you could always use wood treatments available from any hardware store . update : I was reading up on walnut oil , and wikipedia linked to a woodworker <URL> for finishing wood that would come in contact w / food , but that you should re-coat each year . I assume the beeswax would give it longer durability as compared to straight mineral oil sold for cutting boards .

I think the key here is that you 've been buying oversized lettuces . Bitterness of lettuce plants is not something under your control . When the lettuce matures ( on the plant ) , it eventually starts flowering ( called " bolting " ) as a way to perpetuate its genes . Once this sets in , the <URL> . The process of bolting is irreversible and if it has commenced in the plant , it will continue on in the cut lettuce head ( perhaps at a diminished rate ) . Big lettuce heads are invariably more mature than the smaller ones , which is why you experience a higher occurrence of them turning bitter . You could try the other suggestions here , but I can not say for/against any of them as I have n't heard of any of them being used to control bitterness . My advice would be to buy small to medium sized lettuces . <URL> . One might be tempted to buy the biggest lettuce on the shelf so as to " maximize " the leaves/dollar , but in the end , you have to decide whether the bitterness is really worth it .

' Espresso ' Maker - Base turned dark , is it bad ?
What you 've got there , is a Moka pot . They are unable to produce the amount of pressure that gives the Espresso its character , in particular the crema . I have owned several , and all of them have had this happen . That has had no impact on the flavour or mouth feel .
I have an old SoyaQuick ( mine has a filter , newer models do n't ) , and I think it was largely a cleaning concern . The tiny perforations in the filter clogged very easily , and the instruction manual had a whole section of bizarre tips for cleaning it ( soak it in bleach ! squeeze a soapy sponge to one side to force the suds through ! ) There 's also some marketing speak about " leaving in the perfect amount of pulp for your taste ! " but that sounds like bull to me .
I suspect " warm " is meant to maintain temperature , rather than raise it . My crock pots are too ancient to have anything other than " high " and " low " , so I ca n't assert any real authority . However , if you reach 145F within the first hour at the highest setting , then keep it at " warm " , and test the temperature after about 30 minutes with an instant-read thermometer and it stays around 140-160F , you 'll probably be fine . Personally , I 'd test the temperature first by cooking water . If the temperature stays above 140F at low , the worst risk you 'll have is overcooking . Beans and vegetables like carrots and celery can overcook fairly easily in a crock pot , but higher collagen meats meant for stews tend to be fine when cooked for extended periods . Most crock pot recipes for stews and soups usually hold fine when at low for a full workday , although that 's presuming a somewhat 70s-era soup aesthetic , which is probable for a crockpot recipe . However , I would be inclined to attempt the recipe using the low setting rather than reducing it to warm , if you 're not going to test the temperature first . If it turns out to be overcooked , you can always puree the ingredients with a blender ... I also doubt that switching to " warm " would be dramatically less likely to overcook the food than " low " , unless it holds at a pretty stable 140F , and low ends up somewhere around 160F .
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
Simple : it has no water . Chocolate is a suspension of cocoa solids and sugar in cocoa butter . It is made from fat and carbohydrates only . Bacteria , as everything else , need water to live . They ca n't survive in something hygroscopic ( like jam or honey ) or something with no water at all ( flour , chocolate , pure fat ) . Similar for molds . So , independent of temperature , chocolate wo n't go bad in the sense that it will never grow colonies of bacteria . As Hobodave mentioned , it can " grow bad " in another sense . If held at high temperatures ( somewhat above 30 ° C ) , the chocolate butter will separate from the mix and form a dull yellow-grayish crust on the chocolate surface . Also , if you leave it in contact with oxygen for long enough ( many months ) , the cocoa fat will go rancid . In both cases , it is perfectly safe to eat the chocolate without risking food poisoning . However , the taste is much worse than in normal chocolate .
To me , the key to your question " five minutes . " I 'm no scientist , but I ca n't imagine that this is harmful . I agree with Aaronut 's answer in that I think it takes a much , much longer period of time for problems to develop . When people warn you about thawing in hot water , they 're envisioning something more like taking a solidly-frozen piece of meat from the freezer , and thawing it in hot water .
There is not really a turning point . The way that wine goes bad is the process of making vinegar . From wikipedia : The word " vinegar " derives from the Old French vin aigre , meaning " sour wine " . The Canadian government limits things that can be sold as ' vinegar ' to something with an acetic acid content of 4-12 % , so you could do the technical-bureaucratic thing and wait for the acetic acid to get up to 4 % . If you are n't hung up on technicalities , then you can use it as soon as it gets sour enough . It is done when all the alcohol has been changed to acetic acid , but it is a bit hard to taste since the acetic flavor dominates .
No , you 're not crazy . You have good taste . The reason for drinking darker beer like stouts and porters is for the flavor . If they are over-chilled , you lose most of that flavor . Do n't obsess over it , but in general a lot of people serve dark beer too cold . That said , you should drink your beer at whatever temperature makes you happy . There is nothing wrong with a nice cold pilsner or Hefe-wizen on a hot day .
Dark roast has a heavy bitter taste . As espresso usually is served pretty strong , people expect the bitter taste . Most bars serve 70/30 or 80/20 ( natural/dark roast ) blends . If the roast is made of the cheaper robusta bean , the coffee shop can save money . But , you can make an excellent espresso from 100 % natural roast arabica beans ( I do it all the time ) . People will notice the difference , even though they 're not conscious what it is .
It sounds like it was gassed to stay bright green and firm but the seeds are showing how old it actually is . The pith ( the whitish veins on the sides ) is also firm on a fresh pepper , if its limp probably due to age .
<URL> says no , you can enjoy your shot for a little while : In reality , there are only a couple of things that happen to espresso over the course of a few minutes . First , the crema or foam that sits on top of the espresso reintegrates with the liquid . Crema , on its own , contains some of the best flavors and aromatic qualities of the espresso in high concentrations . Drinking it straight can be overwhelming but , it stands to reason , that having the crema reintegrate might actually be a good thing . Second , the espresso cools down . The temperature of espresso has a lot to do with how we taste the various flavors contained within it ... I am not an espresso fan myself -- I like regular coffee , but not after it has cooled down , and never reheated . Many folks are perfectly content to microwave a cold cup and drink it . I imagine that older , colder espresso is palatable to you to the extent that you are willing to tolerate it . A small shot of coffee -- and lets face it , that is all espresso is , even if it is brewed in a fancy manner -- is going to cool off much more rapidly than a full cup , or a full pot .
Your question : is it good to use . My answer : yes . You say it smells and looks normal . That 's an important clue . We are talking about a dry product . No moist means no growth , no toxins ... Best before date . <URL> : Most shelf life dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling and exposure to temperature . Use prior to the expiration date does not necessarily guarantee the safety of a food or drug , while a product is not always dangerous nor ineffective after the expiration date
If you 're drinking the espresso shot on its own , you could drink it straight from the shot glass - or , better yet , buy an <URL> , which should be about the same height as your shot glass . ( A <URL> will help keep it warm . ) If you 're pulling espresso shots to be used in other espresso-based drinks ( i.e. , if you 're adding some sort of milk or water to it ) , you could try an <URL> , which basically looks like the sort of small pitchers you 'd use to serve cream ; they 're normally about 3 oz , small enough that it would probably fit under your espresso machine . You could brew the espresso into the pitcher , then pour into your mug ; the spout/lip of the pitcher should help preserve the crema once you figure out what the optimum pouring speed is . It should work similarly to pouring steamed milk : pour too fast , and the foam and milk come tumbling out all at once and you ruin the foam , too slow and the foam gets stuck in the pitcher . But if you pour just right , you should be able to pour most of the liquid first , and wind up with just enough liquid left to slide out the foam so it lands on top of your drink .
For a chewy pizza base , use bread flour . Do not use oil . Bread flour has a higher protein content that will help gluten form . Gluten makes the connections that keep dough together . Fat inhibits gluten formation . A recipe of just water , flour , salt , and yeast mixed , kneaded , allowed to rise until doubled , and then rolled out will get you what you want . Make sure to roll out quite thin . Preheat your oven absolutely as high as it goes with a stone inside . Put your toppings on maximum one minute before they go into the oven so that the sauce does not make your dough soft . Place pizza on preheated pizza stone - cooking time at high temperatures will be quite short ( max 10 minutes ) .
Looks like FAO ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ) does a formal testing <URL> . One of the easier methods : 2.4.5.3 . The Alcohol Test The test is quick and simple . It is besed on instability of the proteins when the levels of acid and/or rennet are increased and acted upon by the alcohol . Also increased levels of albumen ( colostrum milk ) and salt concentrates ( mastitis ) results in a positive test . Procedure : The test is done by mixing equal amounts of milk and 68 % of ethanol solution in a small bottle or test tube . ( 68 % Ethanol solution is prepared from 68 mls 96 % ( absolute ) alcohol and 28 mls distilled water ) . If the tested milk is of good quality , there will be no coagulation , clotting or precipitation , but it is necessary to look for small lumps . The first clotting due to acid development can first be seen at 0.21-0 .23 % Lactic acid . For routine testing 2 mls milk is mixed with 2 mls 68 % alcohol . Simplified for home use : This test is likely to be adaptable to household alcohol drinks such as vodka or similar beverages . For example the number of teaspoons of Vodka an ounce or two of milk can hold before it clots .
Real Worcestershire sauce has a very long shelf life , many many years Some people even age it , in a dark cellar ! Be warned though , many brands of Worcestershire style sauce are not actually Worcestershire sauce , they are just sugar with flavourings , no sign of rotten fish etc :-( See <URL>
Tearing is NOT worth the extra effort , tested experimentally . Others have explored the theoretical reasons behind this , so I decided to test it in real life . I did this like so : Green leaf lettuce from the local CSA Cut one leaf with a sharp knife ( stainless ) , and tore the second leaf carefully by hand ( fast , clean tears ) Pieces were both wrapped in moist paper towels and left out at room temperature Photographs were taken at 30 minute intervals After 2 hours , the 2 leaves still look identical ( picture below ) . Cut ( on the left ) , Torn ( on the right ) : Provisos : knife was sharp and leaves were fresh and kept moist . A dull knife or more abusive handling of the leaves may yield bruising and faster browning . I am currently repeating this on a longer time scale , and may attempt with a dressing . Practical take-away from the experiment : I have found that in real life , it does n't matter how you divide your leaves , as long as you do n't apply dressing before storing for a prolonged period . The acidic dressing will wilt leaves and cause discoloration , and leading to a limp , soggy salad . The experiment supports that neither method leads to unacceptable browning within a short timeframe . In practice , I 've only seen browning when lettuce is left overnight or longer , or when it is stored with dressing . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> with their experiment to see if plastic lettuce knives are worth it . They found that : Though all lettuce began showing some browning on the ribs after 10 days , none showed any signs of browning on the cut or torn surfaces . After 12 days , the heads cut with metal knives showed faint signs of browning on these surfaces , and the lettuce cut with the plastic knife followed a day later . The torn lettuce was last to brown on its ruptured edges , starting to turn at 2 weeks . Given that lettuce is browning on the ribs before it does on cut edges , the difference between cut and torn is no longer important . You 're only adding 20 % to the time before browning appears on cut surfaces . Most people will agree that after 2 weeks lettuce no longer has its full flavor . I have found that to get the freshest , best taste it should be eaten no more than 4 days after harvest . So , if there difference between cut and torn is insignificant , why cut rather than tear ? It 's faster and more consistent , especially if you have good knife skills and a sharp knife . You can cut a head of romaine in under a minute by knife , versus several times this by hand . You also do n't have to worry about bruising leaves or making irregularly shaped pieces by accident , and you can choose to do large pieces or fine , fluffy shredded mixture . In my time in professional kitchens , I came to rely on the knife as an extension of my body , and you should too .
Manufacrurers measure the rim , so I guess the recipe calls for a pan which is 20 cm across the rim . It may seem counterintuitive that the recipe specifies such a small pan ( that 's less than 8 inch for you Americans ) . But it can have good reasons . Most recipes are n't dependent on pan size ( much ) . But if you make a small quantity of some sauces , you want it to be thick enough in the pan to heat evenly , instead of a thin smearing of stuff on the bottom of the pan which will overheat quickly . So if you suspect that this is the case , it makes sense to actually use a small pan . For many other recipes , overcrowding the pan is not too good . If you say what you are trying to make , we could give you an indication whether the size is important in your case .
Its called chocolate <URL> . There are two types : Fat blooming - cause is not known for certain , but probably the type VI chocolate crystals are more thermodynamically favored , so spontaneous conversion ( and exit from the surface of the solid solution constituting the chocolate body ) may be possible . Sugar blooming - the sugar in the chocolate is dissolved by humidity , and the precipitates on the surface . Fortunately , there are no safety problems with bloomed chocolate , and it can be remelted with no inherent loss of quality . So bloomed chocolate is perfectly useful in recipes where it will be melted ; or it can be melted and <URL> if desired .
Taste them . Bouillon cubes contain enough salt to preserve them from spoilage , but the flavor ( which , after all , is why you 're using them ) may weaken , dull , and change over the years . If you still like their flavor , then go ahead and use them .

Do I need to season a stainless steel saute pan ?
I 've never heard of doing anything other than giving it a good cleaning , as you would with any new item before first use . I 've only heard of seasoning used for cast iron and carbon steel , not for stainless steel . Looking online , I did find <URL> , but I 'd be inclined to look at the paperwork that came with the pan -- if the manufacturer recommends doing something , follow their instructions . If they do n't , just give it a good wash .
You do n't need to grease the paper . However , if you really want to , you can grease it , but beware that the bottom of your cookies can bake quicker due to the extra fat that transfers heat . In most cookies , there is already a lot of fat which prevents them from sticking on their own .
There is empirical support for the effect of temperature on pitting corrosion , although from what little I 'm able to understand of the very complicated metallurgy , the common explanation given is far too simplistic and the actual behaviour is not nearly as clear-cut as " colder = more salt crystals = more pitting " , but rather due to something called transpassive dissolution ( searching for this will give you lots of scholarly results on stainless steel corrosion ) . I 'll get straight to the point by referencing this <URL> from the Metals Handbook ( textbook ) which has the following convenient graph : More pitting happens at lower temperatures . As the link explains : At low temperatures , extremely high breakdown potentials are observed , corresponding to transpassive dissolution , not localized corrosion . Just above the critical pitting temperature ( CPT ) , pitting corrosion occurs at a potential that is far below the transpassive breakdown potential . But you can see from the graph that that 's not the whole story , either . Excluding what happens at very high temperatures ( above the CPT ) , the impact of temperature looks to be maybe 20-30 % , but there are much more significant variations based on other factors , the most notable kitchen-applicable examples being the material ( described as the <URL> - Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number ) , surface condition ( grit ) , and inhibitor elements in the solution ( traces of which may or may not be found in tap water ) . While this does certainly support the conclusion , it 's also obvious , if you read the explanation of pitting or look at the lovely reaction diagram on page 2 of the textbook link , that it has literally nothing to do with undissolved salt . In fact , pitting is caused by the Cl - ions specifically , and so can only happen after it is dissolved in the water . If you just poured salt on a dry pan in a dry environment , it should n't corrode . Moreover , pitting is a <URL> - it 's quite literally random even when you know all the other parameters , so while one can certainly average it out over many experiments and thus quantify the correlation with temperature , that ends up having little meaning in a kitchen setting because you are cooking with one pan/pot and the random variation seems to be a lot more profound than the effect of the temperature variable . Anyway , in case anyone was thinking that it sounds pretty simple so far - it 's not . The experiment that produced the graph above was performed under one set of conditions - using just salt , water , and stainless steel . While that 's certainly comparable to cooking , it 's interesting to see what <URL> ( Inﬂuence of the electrolyte composition and temperature on the transpassive dissolution of austenitic stainless steels in simulated bleaching solutions - PDF warning ) says about oxalic acid : The addition of oxalic acid has accordingly a much bigger impact on the transpassive corrosion rate at 70 ° C than at room temperature [ ... ] In the solutions containing organic additives at 70 ° C , transpassive oxidation starts at significantly lower potentials than at room temperature . In case you 're not familiar with oxalic acid - or wondering why you should care - it 's the primary ingredient in <URL> , which many " premium " stainless steel cookware brands such as All Clad recommend using to clean your cookware - and nearly every cleaning guide recommends warm , but not hot , water . Admittedly , I just looked at the label and BKF does n't specify a temperature , so the warm-water recommendation is entirely anecdotal - but looking at the above , it makes sense ; you want to use warm water in order for it to be more effective , but using hot water ( or even warm water for more than a minute or so ) increases the risk of corrosion , especially if what you 're trying to clean is caked-on salt or charred food . The effect of pH is more generally supported by <URL> , where neutral is better ( i.e. less corrosion ) , not to mention that strong acids cause the other type of corrosion ( called intergranular ) , and <URL> , although the effect is very slow , but still appreciable over time if you like to deglaze with boiling vinegar , for example . Even of the type of salt makes a big difference , if you scroll further down on that same previous link . Ammonium chloride is , for example , often found in sea salt , and it would appear to cause pitting corrosion much faster than the sodium chloride in table salt or kosher salt . Here 's what really does matter in a practical sense : Pitting is a reduction reaction , it 's caused by a lack of oxygen available to the metal surface - unlike , for example , rust , which is caused by oxygen . Quoting the last link : If debris of any kind is allowed to accumulate on the surfaces of stainless steel equipment , it will reduce the accessibility of oxygen to the covered areas and pits may develop in such locations because of the reduced oxygen concentration . [ ... ] ... carbon deposits from heated organic compounds are typical examples of t
As others have said , the issue is the hot oil and water interacting . You need to reduce or eliminate one in order to prevent the splatter or find a way to mitigate the damage . Remember the basics - allow the meat to warm up to room temperature before cooking and pat it dry before you begin . That should allow you to use less oil without it turning into a charred lump with a raw center . You can use a lid or a screen to prevent splatter ( you might need to adjust cooking time with a lid that will trap more heat ) .
When I make quiche ( and for a while at an old restaurant I was baking them almost daily ) to which I am going to be adding anything other than the actual custard and flavouring , I look for three things : will these other ingredients release a lot of water when cooked ? Will these other ingredients release a lot of fat when cooked ? Will the other ingredients be fully cooked ( if desired ) in the final product ? In the first instance , most vegetables will release a significant amount of water when cooking . This has two unpleasant side effects : first , it creates steam pockets around the vegetable , preventing the custard from adhering and leaving empty spaces . Second , the steam itself can mix into and loosen the custard , preventing it from setting properly . Neither of these , as Brown would say , are good eats . Of course some vegetables let off more water , e.g. tomatoes , than others . Second , dealing with fats , we generally have meats . Many meats will release fats while cooking , a process known as rendering . Bacon is of course the fattiest of meats you are likely to use ; sausage would be similar . The release of fats into the custard will have many of the same effects as the release of water . In addition , quiche is often served cold , and excess animal fats feel unpleasantly greasy in the mouth when cold ; unpleasantly oily and greasy when hot . Cheeses are not , for reasons I do not fully understand , generally a problem when the release their fats into a quiche . That being said , I have never tried baking a quiche with very fatty liquid cheeses such as brie or camembert ; cream cheese and the similarly textured soft goat cheeses present no problem at all . Finally , we must consider whether the ingredient ( s ) will end up cooked in the final product . Custards set at quite low temperatures , so this is an important safety consideration when dealing with meats . It is less important for safety with vegetables , and becomes an issue mainly of texture ; do you want your vegetables to be crisp and crunchy or soft and limpid ? For all of these reasons , I always cook meat before including it in a quiche , unless it is charcuterie which is relatively low in fats and is safe to eat without further preparation , such as prosciutto ( but not , I 'd point out , jamon Iberico , if cut traditionally by hand , as it so often includes so much glorious fat that just melts lusciously ... I digress ) . And I almost always cook vegetables ; tomatoes , spinach ( and other leafy greens ) are always fully cooked to remove as much water as possible . Other vegetables depend on what I feel like . I generally will only blanch broccoli long enough to set a vivid green colour , as I like the contrast of soft custard with the crunchy broccoli . Your tastes may vary , of course . Short version : Meat : always cook ! render out excess fat ! Vegetables : always blanch at least ! cook out excess water !
It really depends on the length of time recommended . Due to the usual long length ( > 4 hours ) of slow-cooker recipe cook times most elevation differences would be negligible . However if a recipe calls for a cook time of less than 4 hours you may see some foods not cooking as usual . Legumes might especially be sensitive to this as they take a very long time to cook completely . Below is a table from <URL> on elevation vs water boiling temperatures . Altitude , m Boiling point of water , ° C ( 0ft ) 100 ( 212 ° F ) ( 984.25 ft ) 99.1 ( 210.3 ° F ) ( 1968.5 ft ) 98.1 ( 208.5 ° F ) ( 3280.8 ft ) 96.8 ( 206.2 ° F ) ( 6561.68 ft ) 93.3 ( 199.9 ° F ) ( 13123.36 ft ) 87.3 ( 189.1 ° F ) ( 19685.04 ft ) 81.3 ( 178.3 ° F ) ( 26246.72 ft ) 75.5 ( 167.9 ° F ) You may need to experiment with longer cook times for foods that you are having trouble with .
White peppercorns are used purely for aesthetic reasons - just to avoid black specs in a pale dish . Unfortunately , in my opinion , white peppercorns taste absolutely terrible . They have a sour , astringent , flavor not at all similar to black peppercorns . I do n't think black pepper looks objectionable so I always use it .
My best recommendation is to taste as you go . Taste the initial product ... raw vegetable , ingredient from the can , bottle , etc. and then continue to taste and sample a dish throughout the cooking process to see how flavors develop/diminish and enhance one another through the cooking process . Learning to season food is a process of educating your palate and developing a " flavor memory " One of the most important factors is to use enough salt . Food that is properly seasoned with salt should n't taste salty but will have a brighter more vibrant flavor of the ingredients that are in the dish . Food must be cooked with salt for this to occur . Food that is seasoned at the table will merely taste salty as the salt does n't have a chance to dissolve and pull the juices out and help them mingle with one another as happens during cooking . The more of the basic flavor profiles that you can incorporate the more lively and flavorful anything will be . Even before cooking you can take a look at a recipe and " disect " its flavor profile by determining which ingredients will add sweetness , sourness , etc. . If you notice that it 's heavy in one direction or another , the flavor profile of the item ( s ) missing will likely improve the dish . Then it 's a matter of deciding what ingredient with that flavor profile would be best to add to that particular dish . Shameless ( but applicable to the question ) plug : If you 're ever in Savannah , GA I offer a class called " Flavor Dynamics " . It is focused entirely around understanding how flavor develops , what affects our perception of flavor , and how to create well rounded flavor in your food .
Butter melts at such a low temp that this would work . You would want as low a flame as you can . I would not recommend it , however . If you forget it the metal is thin enough to burn through and at least make a mess - worst case it will ignite the butter , atomize the aluminum which will unverifiably hasten the onset of Alzheimer 's , and burn your house to the ground . Butter melts at 90-95F . You can just leave the butter in the sun for a few minutes .
This is the last write-up on the topic , and it 's much simpler : For hand-pulled noodles , you need : Bread flour ( wet gluten 29-30 % , protein 11 % -12 % ) 45 % added water 1 % alkaline solution kansui powder or ( Lye Water + Baking powder ) or Peng or Baking Soda Ingredients ( Alkaline solutions ) kansui powder 55 % sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) , 35 % potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) , 10 % sodium biphosphate dodecahydrate ( NaHPO3 .12 H2O ) Lye Water potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) 74.5 % in 100ml sodium biphosphate ( NaHPO3 ) 3.4 % in 100ml Instant ash Peng sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) 90 % Sodium chloride ( NaCl ) 1.15 % It is recommended to use bread flour because of its higher wet gluten content compared to normal white flour . You will also need a small amount of alkali . One recommendation is to use kansui powder , due to its ph of 11 . If kansui is n't available , the next option would be baking powder and lye water . If either is n't available , the next option would be to use sodium carbonate 1 % of total weight flour weight ( e.g. if you use 100g of flour , use 1g of sodium carbonate ) . If you 're using a lower gluten dough like all-purpose flour , then baking powder will do just fine . If you 're using cake flour , use baking soda . ( Remember to add the kansui/baking soda/baking powder/sodium carbonate to the flour and mix it in before adding water . ) Sodium carbonate vs. potassium carbonate : I 've have n't had success with bread flour , plain flour or all-purpose flour with potassium carbonate . Even though it increases the ph of the dough , it still does not give the dough its stretchability . Why use alkaline solution in the first place ?! Alkaline solution will increase the water absorption and gluten creation of the dough to enable it to be pulled sooner than normal by leaving the dough to rest at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes . The downside of the alkaline solution is that it also breaks down gluten after the peak absorption is achieved . So on one side you have faster absorption but on the other side the dough will become more resilient to pulling if left too long . For a non-alkaline solution , use <URL> . It will cover all the basics that you will need to learn , and you WILL need to use all-purpose flour or plain flour . Noodle flour works best . In conclusion : Without sodium carbonate it 's possible to have hand-pulled noodles with any flour . The downside is you will have to knead the dough for 45 minutes and leave to rest for 2 hours until you can start pulling your noodle strands . Without sodium carbonate the noodles are harder to pull and I had most success with cutting each strand and going from there from the video .
Honey , for me , makes zabaglione terribly heavy . However , you can buy Crumiel , a dehydrated honey product from the Texturas line by Albert and Ferran Adria . My understanding is that it can essentially be used as a substitute for sugar while retaining the honey flavour .
The answer is that it will depend on your personal preference for the strength of your coffee , the beans themselves , the type of brewing , and so on . Many coffee bean bags have a reference on the side of them . The standard guideline for most medium roast coffee bean bags is 2 tablespoons per 6 fl . oz . ( 1 cup in your liquid measuring cup ) . The Specialty Coffee Association of America has some interesting info on this , per this <URL> . What the Specialty Coffee Association of America ( SCAA ) has to say : A cup is defined as 6 ounces of water before brewing . This will produce 5.33 ounces of brewed coffee . Or 125 ml &amp; 110 ml for Euro style coffee makers The SCAA defines 10 grams or .36 oz per cup as the proper measure for brewed coffee if using the American standards . If using Euro standards the measure is 7 grams per 125 ml . To further confuse things I will add a few more measures : 3.75 oz per 1/2 gallon 55 grams per liter 2.25 gallons per 1 lb . If you want to know more check the SCAA 's web page at www.scaa.org .
There are lots of different techniques for preparing rice , and all are equally valid . They do lead to different results , but it is up to you do decide which one you prefer . There is not one " right " way we can recommend over the other . Yes , there is a noticeable difference . Rice pre-fried in fat has a different texture . It is less fluffy , and can be even slightly slimy if cooked in too much water . It does not dry out as quickly as rice cooked in watery liquid only . It also has a slightly different taste , especially if you use a non-neutral oil . But this difference in aroma may be too subtle to notice if your paella is heavily seasoned , it is most pronounced when the rice is cooked on its own and served as a side .
I wonder where you have read it . Your link does n't help , maybe you linked the wrong question ? It talks about using a stainless pan with oil . If you are talking about true saute ( very quick movement of bite-sized pieces of food on a very hot pan ) , it is completely impossible without oil . If you are misusing the term to mean shallow frying , you can do it without oil in a coated pan , if you take care not to overheat to the point of damaging the coating . Stainless steel pans have to always be used with oil or other fats , else they will stick . The taste of food browned without fat ( in a coated pan ) will also be different from that of food browned in fat , because fat is needed for important flavor-producing reactions . It is up to you if you like the different taste or not . You can braise food in a broth , meaning that you put a small amount of broth in the pan , add the food and wait for it to cook through . This works with stainless steel pans too . But this is not comparable to either sauteeing or shallow frying . The temperature does not exceed 100 Celsius , which is way too low for Maillard and other flavor-developing reactions . So , if your recipe calls for sauteeing , browning , grilling or frying the food , you can not use this method as a substitute . In summary , you seem to have been misinformed . This is not possible , frying always requires oil , and browning without oil requires a PTFE coated pan ( or a fresh ceramic coated one - they tend to lose their antistick properties with time ) . Update You can sweat vegetables without oil , as mentioned in the corrected link . This is very different from both the true sauteeing you will find in textbooks and the quick browning usually meant in recipes which call to start with sauteing the ingredients . The result are softened vegetable pieces suitable for e.g. stir frying or mixing into chunky sauces . If you are going to make a soup or stew , do n't bother using it instead of browning , as it does n't add flavor and a soup does n't mind the vegetables weeping into it . For other applications , you can try it and decide if the taste is good enough for your purposes . The process is simple . Cut your vegetables finely ( in the 4-7 mm range ) . Pour 3-5 mm of water into the pan and add a level layer of vegetables , up to 1.5 cm thick . Turn on the stove on slow to medium heat and leave them largely undisturbed . Wait until they are done - they will have softened and lost some moisture . As you are not using oil , you have to watch the food closely , because if all the liquid evaporates , the food will heat enough to stick and scorch . But do n't stir much , because the vegetables need time in contact with the pan/broth to heat through , not to get a new side exposed to the heat each second . You could do it with constant stirring , this is the risotto method , but you will end up with preparation times similar to risotto ( > 40 min ) while waiting for the vegetables to heat through despite the stir . So it takes a little experience to know when the bottom of the vegetables is done but the liquid is not yet evaporated , without stirring to take a look at what is happening on the bottom . In the end , it is up to you to decide if you really want to bother . You get a higher probability of failure ( risk of scorching it ) , higher effort ( the need to watch it closely ) and less taste . If you feel that the fat reduction makes up for it , do it .
I 'm going to assume that " country style ribs " are the ones where you cut them apart first before cooking ... I 'd wager a guess that everything is near bone , and a thermometer might have problems with this particular dish . If nothing else , as you ca n't insert it deeply enough into the thing you 're taking a measurement of , there might be enough conduction along the probe for the oven temperature to throw off the reading . Could you tell us how far the probe was in the meat ? I 'd assume anything less than about 1/3 the probe might be problematic , with 1/2 or more being better . ... All of that being said , are you sure it 's an issue with the placement of the probe , and not a problem with the probe itself ? I 've had a number of them go out over the years . I 've actually given up on them , and gone back to an instant read thermometer , as I 'm up to 4 of the bases ( can still use 'em as a timer ) , and no working probes . ( if anyone knows any brands that sell the replacement probes individually , or even better in multi-packs , I 'd be willing to go back to using them ) To calibrate -- mix some ice water , and put the probe in there . It should read 32F or 0C . ( if it even goes that low , not all do ) . Boil water , and read the temperature of it , and it should read near 100C or 212F ( possibly lower , if you 're above sea level ) . Compare it to another room thermometer after it 's been sitting for a bit ... they should read the same . Do n't try to put it into the oven directly ... you could melt the probe ... that 's how I lost the first one , so you ca n't try to compare it to your oven thermometer .
In general , ceramic knives are great for what they do , but too fragile to do everything . They can shatter if dropped on a hard surface , and can easily get get notched on bone . I use my ceramics exclusively for vegetables for that reason . If you 're strapped for funds , you really only need to by one expensive knife ( a steel chef 's knife or santoku ) , and one cheap one ( a serrated knife for cutting bread ) . After that , picking up knife skills is more important and will make your cooking better than any investment in more knives .
( Storage note : do not wash the bulbs before storing them ; place in plastic bag in the refrigerator . Wash just before using . ) Young kohlrabi is great raw . Peel first , then add to salads ( sliced or grated ) serve as part of a veggie platter w / dip grate it and add to slaw ( but after grating it , put some salt on it &amp; let it sit , then squeeze the water out of it ) puree it - here 's someone who really loves it pureed : <URL> Cooked kohlrabi can be steamed or boiled . Remove the skin after cooking . You can eat the leaves , if they are still firm and green ; use them within a couple of days . Wash the leaves &amp; remove the tough stem parts ( ribs ) . Blanch in boiling water for a couple of minutes , drain , chop , and serve with a bit of butter , salt , and pepper . A little vinegar or lemon juice is good on them , too .
The main thing you need to do to prepare a plank for grilling is to soak it in water first . Otherwise , it can catch on fire and you 'll have a mess . For seasonings , you can use anything that you would use when roasting something . For salmon , you could put down some lemon slices and rosemary .
You absolutely do n't need a bread maker for good bread . They have been making bread for at least 22,000 years and I promise , in the vast majority of those , having a bread maker would have gotten you stoned as a witch ( if you had electricty to run it ) . However , a good bread maker will vastly cut down on the time you have to spend making bread . Basically , bread by hand requires a few hours and lot of physical kneading to develop the gluten that gives bread it 's structure and in a bread machine , you dump the ingredients in , turn it on and walk away , then come back and enjoy some fresh bread .
Many stainless steels are ferric , so will work with induction cooktops . Aluminum can not interact with magnetism , so can not work on induction , so many companies offer stainless steel non-stick pans for the induction market . You wo n't see much difference in performance , and since it 's not what you want in the first place I 'd send it back unused .

Can I leave out raw already-formed cookies for close to an hour while I wait for the oven to be available ?
You 're going to have more issues with cookie-spreading than anything else , because your fat is going to get all warm . If you have a lot of fat in your cookies , you 're definitely going to want to put the dough back in the fridge . If the dough is a hard dough , and you do n't expect your cookies to significantly change shape during cooking , I would n't worry about it . There is no concern for spoilage for an hour or less on the counter .
Applesauce has little flavor and almost no nutritional value . It is added to baked goods for the one thing it does have - pectin . Pectin interferes with gluten in a similar manner to fat although by a different mechanism . For this reason applesauce is often used to replace some of the fat in recipes for health-conscious bakers . <URL> . Or if you are <URL> . Other banana bread recipes are very similar to cakes and rely on a huge amount of fat - often creamed with a large amount of sugar . Your options are then to : Replace the applesauce with some other oil substitute . Another puree of high-pectin fruit would work . Switch to a recipe that just uses the fat and enjoy a richer banana bread .
I 'd say there are basically two material options . Plain ( seasoned ) cast iron or enameled cast iron . I prefer enameled , because you do n't have to worry about keeping them seasoned -- just wash as you would any other pot -- and the enamel surface is easy to get clean . But they 're also more expensive by a significant margin . A properly maintained plain cast iron one will be awesome too , and do everything enameled will do for less money , so do n't rule it out . What you should consider : The foremost thing you want to look for is a heavy pot . Heavy bottom AND heavy sides and lid . You want something that holds a lot of heat when you need it to , and heavier often means more even heating and better searing ( crucial for braises and pot roasts ) . Consider the lid . It should fit well , without gaps or sliding around . Some have loop handles on the side or on the top , some have a knob on the top . All are fine , but keep in mind that a metal lid handle will be more durable with all the oven time your dutch oven will likely see . They say the plastic ones are OK ( Le Creuset , a trusted brand , uses them so they ca n't be that bad ) but I 'm not 100 % convinced . Whatever handle you get , think about how easy it 'll be to grasp wearing an oven mitt . Handles on the pot itself are a potential issue . Some plain cast iron pots will have a bucket-style bail handle , which I do n't think is that great for the kitchen , especially the oven . These are really intended for campfires and camp stoves , so I 'd avoid them . Sturdy , compact but easy-to-grip handles of any type are good . It 'll be heavy , so make sure you feel secure holding on . Size is another consideration , and it 's a tough one because it 's so individual . I think between 5.5 and 6.5 quarts is pretty standard and works for most cooks . A dutch oven is n't like a stock pot , where big is always good . You want one big enough to cook the things you want , but you do n't want it to be too huge for what you have in there , or you 'll give up a lot of cooking liquid to evaporation too fast . This is less crucial for soups and stews ( I 'd do soup in a regular stock pot ) , but for a braise it 's kind of important . So I would resist going too small , but do n't go too far , especially if you 're always cooking for two people . Also , bigger = heavier , so do n't let your eyes get bigger than your muscles ! Another option is shape , as they generally come in round or oval . Oval sometimes helps people who ca n't decide how big to go . With roasts being generally oblong , an oval pan can fit a proportionally larger roast without getting really huge . With a round pot , your whole pot needs to be at least as big around as your roast is long . Ovals are a little less common , however , and generally do n't come as big as round ones . They 're often more expensive too . Finally , do n't compromise too much on size or cost . Any halfway decent dutch oven , properly looked after , will last much longer than you will . Make sure you 're getting what you want , because you 'll be living with your decision a long time .
Fenugreek seeds are intensely aromatic and go quite nicely in curries , and any dish where such a flavour is required . In the middle-east they use it quite a lot , often as a condiment . Highly used in spice rubs , pickles , marinades , anything where a strong spice flavour is required and often in puddings as an aromatic like nutmeg is used in English cooking . The leaves have a similar flavour , but not quite the same , you could use the seeds in their place adding them in to the spice mix if there is one , but the leaves I prefer personally . The flavour of methi leaves in thepla or in curry is wonderful in my opinion .
While you can easily melt a foil pan over a hot campfire , yours will be filled with juicy peaches - so assuming you do n't over-cook it , you should be safe . 40 minutes directly on the coals might be pushing it though - consider using a gridiron to control the heat by elevating the pan slightly , and stick around to keep an eye on things ... Remember , dutch ovens are thick , heavy , and slow to transmit heat , and the recipes reflect this . I would avoid doubling either the pan or the foil : you 'll end up with an air gap between the two layers , which will likely just end up ruining the outer pan . Pay a little extra for the thicker " heavy-duty " foil and you should be fine . Wet sand between two pans is an interesting idea ... If you try it , report back ! My biggest worry here would be burning the peaches before they have a chance to release their juices ( no slow warm-up with aluminum - you 'll essentially be frying them ) . If you can elevate the pan , you should be fine ; otherwise , consider macerating them first ( if you have very ripe , juicy peaches , count your blessings and ignore this suggestion ) . Finally , consider that Harbor Freight sells cast-iron dutch ovens for $ 25 . The quality is n't stellar , and it 's extra weight to lug around , but you 'll probably end up with better food all the same .
For most oils , you can re-use them several times , if you 're OK with ( or want ) the flavors the oil takes on from the food cooked in it . The thing to watch is the smoke point . That 's when the oil starts sending off whisps of smoke . For coconut oil , that 's 350F . As oil is re-used , that smoke point starts to drop until it 's no longer able to stay hot enough to properly fry food . We 're dealing with an oil that has a relatively low smoke point in the first place at 350F , as opposed to 450F for peanut oil , and proper frying needs to be pretty close to 350F in order to have the moisture in the food hold out the oil from rushing into the food like a sponge . That , unfortunately means that coconut oil is n't a great candidate for re-use .
Flour paste . Mix flour with water and a bit of salt . Go for a thick glaze-like consistency , and use it instead of the egg . Give it at least 10 minutes to hold before frying , and try to hold the edges closed with tongs when initially frying .
The <URL> clearly recommends not leaving cooking appliances unattended when no one is home : Based on 2006-2010 annual averages : Unattended cooking was by far the leading contributing factor in home cooking fires . [ ... ] Ranges accounted for the largest share ( 58 % ) of home cooking fire incidents . Ovens accounted for 16 % . At the time this <URL> was written , the Fire Administration said ( they have since updated the page ) : The leading cause of fires in the kitchen is unattended cooking . Stay in the kitchen when you are frying , grilling , or broiling food . If you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time , turn off the stove . If you are simmering , baking , roasting , or boiling food , check it regularly , remain in the home while food is cooking , and use a timer to remind you that you 're cooking . Stay alert ! To prevent cooking fires , you have to be alert . You wo n't be if you are sleepy , have been drinking alcohol , or have taken medicine that makes you drowsy .
Joe , Whole wheat puff pastry . It 's expensive , and hard to find , though . Or try another recipe . If the recipe you 're using calls for puff pastry , then the flavor and texture of the puff pastry is going to be a big part of the dish . It never works very well to substitute a primary ingredient in a recipe .
The okara has some unextracted protein and sugar but it also has a large quantity of fiber . That fiber will prevent the protein from properly coagulating . If you leave in all the okara you get soybean porridge . I imagine you could leave in a portion of the okara and you would get a fragile but hearty tofu . The problem with this is that , with most tofu recipes , the beans are not cooked long enough for the okara to be palatable . With all that sugar it would also give rise to much more flatulence . You do n't have to throw the okara out . There are many recipes that make use of the okara for its fiber . It is pretty straight forward to use it in baked goods . Toasting it gives it more interesting flavor . If you want to look into tofu-like products that use the entire bean you could research tempeh . The whole beans are fermented so you get a meaty product with all the nutrition of the whole soy bean .
I would leave the peel in . It can continue to improve the flavor , and makes it look like citrus sugar instead of just plain sugar ( important for a gift ) . Be sure to include a note that it should be used within a few weeks , though .
Even if you just pull them out for about 30 minutes once you get home that will be better than not letting sit out at all . The main benefit is that it will cook easier and you 'll have a natural gradation from brown to pink on the inside rather than the gray color that often occurs . I myself do n't typically pull meat out an hour before cooking it . But As long as they have n't previously been sitting out for an extended period of time , most likely you 'll be ok for 1 1/2 hours since the steaks will be cold when set out . Make sure that they remain tightly wrapped/covered to minimize exposure to air .

When we have had garlic in our garden I have used the garlic leaves . They do have a garlicky flavor but are milder than garlic cloves . I tend to use them more as I would chives or garlic chives as in addition to having the milder flavor than the cloves they make for a quite nice presentation . Regarding drying them , I have never tried it . Off the top of my head I ca n't think of any reason not to dry them for later use but there may be issues that I just do n't know about .
Sounds like you want <URL> . If you search google you will undoubtedly find recipes for this abomination . It is designed to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the need for utensils . You did say taste and texture were n't important .
You can do anything with charcoal . One trick that we used to do when we were camping was to line a cardboard box with foil . Several metal grates or skewers would be stabbed into the box walls and a grate with a few coals hung near the bottom . We would use it to bake bread and pizzas . To control the temperature use more or fewer coals . <URL> As long as you are building things - another option to consider is solar oven . They consist of an insulated container , a transparent window , and a reflector . There are a <URL> to choose from . Some of the more permanent models can get above 350F as long as there is direct sunlight . This model was just one of top results from Google but it is a typical design : <URL>
Absolutely , go ahead and use it . I always ignore the " white and light green parts " instruction anyway , and use the leek up until the point where it feels dried out instead of firm and fleshy -- well into the dark green parts -- and it 's always delicious , even when cooked for significantly less than several hours .
You can try to set up my at-home on-the-cheap monkey-at-the-controls sous-vide machine . I take a nearly full 22 quart stock pot with an analog instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature and watch the temperature and adjust the dial accordingly . With this only needing 30 minutes you probably just want to get the water to exactly 72 degrees C and then immerse the potatoes without adding any heat . The amount of energy in 20 quarts of water is phenomenal and you wo n't lose a lot of heat to the air . Alternatively you could get 72 degree water and a beer cooler and try that way for the extra insulation .
You can make your own crème fraîche . Just inoculate heavy cream with buttermilk . From <URL> : Ingredients 1 to 2 tablespoons cultured buttermilk 2 cups heavy cream ( pasteurized , not ultra pasteurized or sterilized , and with no additives ) Instructions Combine the buttermilk and cream in a saucepan and heat only to tepid ( not more than 85F degrees on an instant reading thermometer ) . Pour into a clean glass jar . Partially cover and let stand at room temperature ( between 65F and 75F degrees ) for 8 to 24 hours , or until thickened . Stir and refrigerate at least 24 hours before using . The cream will keep about 2 weeks in the refrigerator . The results from doing that are so close to " real " crème fraîche that I ca n't tell the difference unless I 'm tasting them side by side . If you want absolute authenticity , you can order the <URL> , follow their instructions , then use that crème fraîche to culture many further batches of real Crème fraîche . EDIT : HA ! :) Here 's Kenji 's $ .02 on the subject : <URL>
Basic answer : it 's generally recommended to sterilize jars before storing low-acid foods at room temperature . ( Many canning procedures effectively sterilize the jars during processing . ) In your case , you should be certain the jars are clean and thoroughly dry as well . Regarding your overall proposal : I 'd only give away food gifts like this if I had prepared them according to an established procedure and recipe tested by a reputable food safety and preservation organization . Your proposal sounds like it could be safe , but I ca n't find any such recipes at the <URL> or similar sources . Generally , most food safety websites do n't recommend storing any homemade flavored oils at room temperature or for more than a few days in the refrigerator . ( There were some older recommendations that allowed for dried herbs and/or herbs that were strained out of oil after a brief infusion , but even these were found to have a small risk -- because only lab testing can determine whether herbs are dried sufficiently or whether you 've managed to strain out all the small particles -- and are no longer listed on most food preservation sites . ) Commercial preparations of flavored oils almost exclusively involve prior acidification of the additives to ensure safety . Also , I would note that heating the oil hot enough to kill botulism bacteria will cause it to degrade somewhat in quality and flavor . ( This is another reason why commercial preparations use acidification . ) Lastly , just my opinion : I do n't want to overstate the risk here ( which is likely low ) , but without a tested procedure it 's impossible to know for certain when storing low-acid foods at room temperature . And botulism toxin can be deadly . I know it sounds like a nice idea , but I personally would not give flavored oils as gifts . Even if I found a reputable recipe from a food preservation site that had been scientifically tested , the people I give these things to have to trust that I know what I 'm doing . Personally , I tend to discard any flavored oils I 've received as gifts before using ( unless I would trust the person and know how the food was prepared ) .

Why are avocados so expensive ?
Supply and demand . Supplies of avocados are declining due to droughts and unusual weather patterns . Not only drought can reduce crops , but unusual cool weather patterns can as well . Avocados dislike temperatures lower than 10 ° C and have absolutely no frost tolerance . Demand for avocados is going steadily upward as more people enjoy cuisines in which they are popular , such as Mexican and many South American dishes . Avocado oil is becoming more in demand as people consume it for its healthy omegas , and cooks use it due to its high smoke-point . Declining supply + rising demand = high prices .
Salt is perhaps the most basic and effective flavour enhancer , and so it 's fairly obvious why we have it on our dinner tables . The popularity of pepper is down to the Romans , who were crazy about it . Thanks to the longevity of the Roman Empire , pepper was imported for hundreds of years , helping to establish it as the most popular spice , and keeping the price high . Bill Bryson reports in At Home that : When the Goths threatened to sack Rome in 408 , the Romans bought them off with three thousand pounds of pepper .
The generic term for sugar-water pastes used to decorate food is <URL> . Rollfondant sounds like ready-to-roll icing , but it could be <URL> , which contains egg white . Modellierfondant sounds like modelling paste . There are various recipes which use different additives to the core ingredients of sugar and water in order to obtain a suitable consistency and to dry without cracking .
All crisp-bread recipes use water ( or at least some ingredient with a high water content ) , but the bread is baked and then hung from the ceiling to dry further until the water content is very much reduced . The real mystery is how structure is introduced without leavening . Wikipedia has good information on this point , [ ... ] bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically . Traditionally , this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough , which then evaporated during baking . Today , the dough , which must contain a large amount of water , is cooled and mixed until bubbly . Another method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder . The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate , creating bubbles in the dough . Presumably knäckebröd was only made during the winter months before its production became industrialised . For the modern home cook , the difficulty of introducing structure still remains , so it is unsurprising that you did n't find many recipes with very basic ingredients . Some recipes for home cooks introduce structure in the form of seeds and whole grains . Others , as you noted use yeast . Some Swedish crisp breads such as <URL> , have no leavening , no gas incorporated into the dough and are wafer thin . These can be made at home with a very short ingredient list , no specialised equipment and during any season :-) At least some of the major Swedish manufacturers do use yeast . My favorite , <URL> , for instance uses , swedish wholegrain rye flour , fresh water from our own spring , yeast and a pinch of salt . So if you are considering baking your own knäcke , you do n't necessarily have to avoid recipes using yeast .
In comments you note that you last bought a jar of green , pitted olives in brine . Those tend to be much saltier than the versions served as a <URL> in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants , in part because the restaurant versions are usually whole and thus have less surface contact with the storage brine . They 're also fresher ; restaurants that go through larger quantities of olive can afford to purchase higher-quality olives that have n't been sitting in their brine on a shelf somewhere for months ( or years ) . Olive variety may also be a factor . The picture you 've provided looks closest to me to a <URL> , which have a very mild , almost buttery flavor . This mildness comes from its processing , which is close to the preparation of the black California olives familiar to Americans . They 're washed in a lye solution , which flushes the bitterness of the fresh olive , and are then rinsed to remove any traces of lye ; they can then be brined for a short period of time , but they 're typically much fresher and less salty than other olives . I know a few chefs who like serving them as a starting course specifically because they 're not overwhelmingly salty . As others have suggested , you can seek out similar higher-quality olives in bulk at boutique grocery stores . You 'll have to pay a bit more for the privilege , but the other advantage is that such stores are usually happy to let you try some of the varieties before you buy .
Some <URL> produce pink or white seeds so yours sounds perfectly normal . I have had white seeds and they are as delicious as the red ones . Go for it .
It 's my opinion that the " proper temperature " is a number set by lawyers , not by chefs . The government standard for a roast bird is 180 ° F ( 83 ° C ) ! Are you kidding me ? HTST pasteurization is 161 ° F ( 72 ° C ) for 20 seconds , but my turkey has to get to 180 ° F for safe human consumtion ? What the hell kind of bacteria do they think live in there ? 165 ° F ( 74 ° C ) is a common number , and a pretty decent one , though I always take mine out before that for the reason below . You need to remember that the internal temperature of the bird will continue to rise for a while after you take it out of the oven : the heat on the outside is still migrating inward . If you wait to take it out until the internal temperature is the " right " temperature , by the time it peaks , it 'll be 10 ° F ( ~ 5 ° C ) HIGHER than the right temperature , and that 's in the dry zone . We 're talking 190 ° F ( 88 ° C ) thanksgiving football . Blech . Dark meat almost always handles being overcooked better than lighter meat . The breast is the hardest part of the turkey to cook correctly . If you haggle with the temperature , and your white meat is still on the dry side , you might try brining the bird for 24 hours or so . It makes a big difference in terms of juiciness .
As baka has said , more volatile components of the wine will be released with more wine surface exposed . Also , this not only releases aroma but also helps the wine to " breathe " and oxidize , which is why you open the red wine bottle half an hour before serving it ( so that this process starts ) , and why you might pour the wine into a decanter . This process accentuates the flavors and aromas of the wine . It is not very much necessary with younger , colder served wines ( e.g. vinho verde ) . In young , sparkling wine , a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster , as well as warming it . This is undesireable , hence the smaller , narrower glasses . Aged white wine should behave similarly to aged red wine , although it does n't need to breathe as much .
This should depend greatly on what the item is . Hamburgers generally run clear , possibly slightly bloody if undercooked . The only example of this I can think of would be the odd orange drippings from " taco meat " . The cause of that is soluble coloring agents or spices in the drippings .
There are several factors that increase price . Some are related to the objective quality of the wine , some indirectly linked , other are rather disconnected from quality ( but not necessarily irrelevant , as we 'll see ) . It 's also worth noting that being of high quality does n't necessarily mean being appealing to the average consumer . Apart from the stuff listed below , mass-market wines tend to be made in a non-challenging , easily accessible style . Lower tannin levels , less acidity and a generous amount of residual sugar ( say 10-30g / l ) makes for easy quaffing but little complexity or elegance . They can be very well-made , but the agriculture may not be very sustainable , and the fruit probably is n't of the highest quality . ( If you visit a winery at harvest when they bring in the bulk wine fruit , the meaning of " quality " becomes rather apparent . ) Wines targeted at connoisseurs , wine snobs and wine geeks ( such as yours truly ) tend have more structure ( tannins , acidity ) and are more often completely dry ( although there are of course high-quality off-dry , semi-sweet , and sweet wines ) . There 's a limit to how much a producer can spend to increase quality , a limit which varies with location ( because of salaries for workers etc ) but around $ 100 per bottle is probably in the right order of magnitude . This does not mean that all wines above this magical limit are equally good , though . A dirt-cheap wine will also have a cost associated to it which will be payed for by someone else , like under-payed harvest workers , the environment around the vineyard , etc. . Below are some factors that have a more or less direct link to wine quality and/or character : Yield per acre : Limiting the vineyard 's yield per acre ( which can be achieved by sparser planting , thinning / <URL> , old vines , etc ) increases the quality of the fruit , but you will produce less wine with more or less the same amount of work , which means you 'll have to adjust the price . Number of harvesting tries : At harvest , you can pick all the fruit of one vineyard at the same time and be done with it . Unfortunately , not all bunches ripen at exactly the same time , so to avoid over - or under-ripe grapes , you can make multiple tries ( French , pronounced " trees " ) over several days and pick each bunch at optimal ripeness . More tries inevitably means more work , and so , price increases . Selection : When the harvest is brought in , you can throw all the fruit into the press , or you can select the best grapes to make your wine ( and make brandy or a <URL> of the discarded grapes , or sell them on to a bulk wine producer ) . Being picky reduces the amount of wine produced , and so , prices increase . Drying : Some wines , like <URL> and <URL> , are made from partially dried grapes , and drying decreases the amount of wine you produce ( apart from being extra work ) which means - more expensive wine . Sparkling : Sparkling wines made with the <URL> - like <URL> and <URL> - need to be disgorged after bottle fermentation , which leads to a certain amount of waste ( a Cava producer I talked to said that around 10 % of the original wine is lost in disgorgement ) . Oak aging : Many wines are <URL> , which greatly affects the character of the wine compared to other types of containers , like concrete or stainless steel vats . ( More oak does n't mean better wine , of course . ) Oak barrels are horribly more expensive than the alternatives ( and European oak is more expensive than American , and they impart different character ) , and so , the more oak you use , the more expensive the wine gets . Aging in general : Most high-quality wine receive a bit of aging before consumption to let all components integrate ; some designations of origin even require aging prior to selling . <URL> Gran Reserva , for example , must be aged at least three years , with at least one of those years being on oak , while vintage <URL> is mandated to rest three years on the <URL> , etc. . Apart from time being money , you also need a suitable storage location ( cool and humid but not too cool and humid , secure but accessible to yourself , etc ) which is far from free . The price increases . Other factors are n't causally linked to higher quality , but tend to be connected : Reputation : If you 're an unproven winemaker you will be able to charge more if you 're operating in a district of high repute than if you 're working in an area where no-one has made quality wine before . Conversely , a well-known , high-quality producer expanding their operations to a somewhat less proven district will likely be able to charge more than their new neighbours . Brand : Marketing can take many forms , such as it advertising , tailoring wines to suit <URL> , and tends to push prices up . Wineries can even try <URL> . You can also be lucky and find some great , undiscovered producer ( do n't tell anyone ! except me , that is ) selling their wines at more-or-less cost price ( which probably still wo n't be dirt cheap , though ) . Land prices : Some spots are better for growing grapes . If you 're in
The <URL> has several diagrams - a current one in the main section apparently originally derived from the German wikipedia , and two others from older Russian sources . I was also able to find <URL> with another diagram , and translations of some of the cuts into English , which is helpful because the names are difficult to translate to similar English cuts via Google Translate , which simply gives anatomical terms for many of them . <URL> discussing the subject , largely from the perspective of someone who only knows the American name for the cut they are looking for .
There 's no reason to peel besides the aesthetics of it . There 's no major flavor or nutritional difference either way . If the ginger is going to be seen then peel it , if not do n't bother . The best way to peel ginger is to use the edge of a small spoon to rub it off , it works really well , takes seconds , and does n't waste as much as using a knife .
Take a look at this photo : The feet are the ruffles on the edges .
There 's nothing magical about garlic that causes it to be especially prone to botulism - it 's just commonly found as an example because it 's commonly used to prepare flavoured oils . All low-acid foods must be acidified or pressure-canned before long-term storage . Storage in oil creates an anaerobic environment which further promotes botulism , and room-temperature storage is even more risky . Chili peppers are low acid , like all peppers , so yes , they 're a risk .
<URL> tells us this is a myth : Many tea companies , and even some reputable entities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture , have made misleading generalizations about the caffeine content of broad classes of tea . It is a widespread myth that black tea contains more caffeine than green tea , and another myth that white tea contains the least caffeine of all teas . They indicate that brewing method is the main determiner of caffeine levels in the brewed tea . The source article goes on to cite various credible scientific sources , which raise the credibility of this assertion . Unfortunately , most of their links have gone bad , which makes it harder to check the background science . This <URL> does indicate slightly different levels , but that is likely to be a result of different brewing details across tea types rather than fundamental to the tea plant itself .
Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it ( it 's not quite vinegar , not quite wine ) . I 'd probably try a blend of some other mustard + a little white wine vinegar ( not white vinegar ; white wine vinegar ) or champaigne vinegar or apple cider vinegar . ( Maybe even a dry white wine , if you have that on hand ) . If you have dry mustard powder , and some time to let it sit , you could also try making your own ; most of the recipes online seem to use a dry white wine as their base , a few use white wine vinegar .
Mostly it comes down to practice . However there are some tips and tools that can make it a lot easier . If you have a cake stand ( the kind that spins ) then you set the cake on the stand and slowly turn it with one hand while cutting forward and back with the other ( trying to keep the cutting hand as level as possible ) . Another option is to buy a cake leveler <URL> - if you make a lot of cakes it can be very handy .
One answer to this is that Americans have a reversed understanding of the relationship of pasta to sauce compared to Italians . In Italy , the sauce is called the condimento , meaning literally it is a condiment to the noodles , which are intended to be the main source of enjoyment in the dish . When you begin to understand it that way , it makes sense that you would want to have a wide variety of sizes , shapes and textures . ( What Taeraresh said is also true , there are functional differences in how the different shapes hold sauces . )
Supply and demand . Supplies of avocados are declining due to droughts and unusual weather patterns . Not only drought can reduce crops , but unusual cool weather patterns can as well . Avocados dislike temperatures lower than 10 ° C and have absolutely no frost tolerance . Demand for avocados is going steadily upward as more people enjoy cuisines in which they are popular , such as Mexican and many South American dishes . Avocado oil is becoming more in demand as people consume it for its healthy omegas , and cooks use it due to its high smoke-point . Declining supply + rising demand = high prices .
Use less heat . It 's not clear if you used any fat here . If you do , you have to be aware of the <URL> of whatever oil you 're using . By turning down the heat you 'll decrease the amount of fat you are burning , and turning into smoke . If you want to still get a nice crisp exterior you can briefly sear your sausages on high heat prior to fully cooking . Although , his might be irrelevant since you do n't really get good sears with a non-stick surface .

What vegetarian substitute for prosciutto could I use in Carbonara ?
well veggie/cheese wise , i would recommend either of : Chickpeas drained in salt water and paprika and grilled in the oven for about 10 minutes Portobello mushrooms cut into large chunks fried halloumi large chunks of celery sauteed in salt pepper , and chili
Joe , Whole wheat puff pastry . It 's expensive , and hard to find , though . Or try another recipe . If the recipe you 're using calls for puff pastry , then the flavor and texture of the puff pastry is going to be a big part of the dish . It never works very well to substitute a primary ingredient in a recipe .
Here , in Turkey , cabbage dolma is also very popular . I have no clue about cooking , but probably you may need to cook it differently .
The kind of oil you use in baking is mostly a matter of personal preference . Any neutral oil ( no strong flavor ) will do . I suggest you use an oil that you keep around for another purpose , which is not too expensive . Some good candidates include : Canola oil Peanut oil ( refined , except for those with peanut allergies ) Generic " vegetable " oil Grapeseed oil is also excellent but tends to expensive . Oils you would want to avoid due to the fact that they bring more flavor which may not be what you want in baked goods include : Olive oil Sesame oil Unrefined oils of all sorts
Well , at least here in germany it really is common to make liverwurst with beef liver ( or more often and expensive : calf liver ) . So go ahead - you really wo n't regret it ! Taken the percentage of actual liver in liverwurst you wo n't taste any difference , though I 'd say beef liver tastes better .
Sort of . If you have sesame seeds on hand , grind some up . You could also use toasted sesame oil , and even combine it with the ground seeds . You can also use all-natural peanut butter . Do n't use mass market crap with sugar and other additives . The ingredients should list only : peanuts , salt . Obviously , this will taste like peanuts . It will still taste good in a hummus , but it will be a distinctly different hummus than with tahini .
Any recipe where the water is part of a sauce or is expected to be absorbed ( including rice , couscous , and yes , pasta too ) , you can use stock instead to increase the deliciousness . If you have an opportunity to add flavour , why waste it ? Of course , there are some caveats to consider when making the substitution : Stock is going to contain a certain amount of gelatin ( how much depends on how the stock is made ) . This is often a good thing , leading to a richer mouth-feel , but if the thickening effect would be detrimental to your recipe , then do n't use stock . Stock can clash with other flavours , although less often than you 'd expect , since it 's effectively a mega-dose of umami . In particular I 'd probably avoid using it in recipes that are either very sour ( sour meat is the taste of rancidity and highly displeasing ) or very sweet ( since the sugar will overwhelm the flavour of the stock ) . So do n't use it in your candies or in your pickling solutions , but any dish based primarily on meats , vegetables , and grains , is definitely fair game . Because it 's a meat product , it has a limited life span . I would n't recommend substituting it for water in anything that 's going to sit in the fridge for several days and/or be re-frozen , due to food safety concerns . Oh , and I probably would n't use it in baking . The effects of using homemade stock when the primarily role of the liquid is to develop gluten would be unpredictable , to say the least . And somehow the thought of turkey-flavoured cake just does n't sound very appealing to me . As for the right ratio - that depends entirely on what went into the stock , how long it was simmered for and whether or not the stock itself was reduced prior to storing/freezing . You 're definitely going to want the same total amount of liquid , but if the stock is highly gelatinous then you might want to dilute it , and conversely , if the stock is very weak then you might want to reduce it . There really is no golden ratio , but I 'd probably stick with 1:1 for a " typical " stock .
More or less , yes . Just know that eggs of different species have different " flavors . " There may be some issues with substituting in dishes due to varying fat content of the yolks and such ... I 've had duck and goose egg quiches . I 've had fried quail eggs on toast . I have yet to try an ostrich or emu egg .
When we have had garlic in our garden I have used the garlic leaves . They do have a garlicky flavor but are milder than garlic cloves .

Oxtail would be your most likely substitute , but you have indicated you can not obtain it . The next best choice ( of those widely available ) is probably chuck , which is the shoulder muscle , and is well worked and flavored . It requires low and slow cooking for best results , much like shanks and tail do . Some stores -- even the chain grocery stores -- will special order for you if you ask them to , so you might be able to get shank . Depending on where you live , you may also try butchers at farmers ' markets , Dutch markets , or similar .
Cocoa powder is made by baking the cocoa beans and then removing all the fat from them , then milling the rest to a powder . In fact , semisweet chocolate is a solid sol ( a colloid formed from homogenically dispersing solid particles ( cocoa dry matter ) in a solid ( cocoa fat ) ) . What you should add is not water , but fat . Before you start , you must be aware that cocoa fat has some very special properties . It melts at a very convenient temperature , so it is solid in the air and melts in the mouth . Plus , it has a very special form of crystalline structure , which allows [ tempering ] . <URL> This means that the substitution wo n't work for some very specific uses like making Belgian chocolates . For chocolate cake or brownies , the texture will be somewhat off , but not too much , so it should deliver acceptable results for the home cook . The taste will also be different ( there is a reason why pure chocolate is so expensive , it only uses real cocoa fat , bars with other fat types like Milka ca n't compare with the original ) . There is also the question of choosing the fat . It should be solid by room temperature . Butter is often used in desserts and has a really good taste , but it does n't mimic cocoa fat that well , because it is n't a pure fat , it is an emulsion of ~ 17 % water in milkfat . So texturewise , shortening is probably a better choice . You can use either , based on whether texture or aroma is more important for you , plus your camp in the this-type-of-fat-is-bad-for-you debate . " Semisweet chocolate " is a loose category . I usually count anything with 40 % to 60 % cocoa mass as " semisweet " . So on average , your mixture should contain 50 % sugar . The ratio of cocoa powder to fat is trickier . Luckily , I have a 90 % chocolate bar here and can tell you that it contains 55 grams of fat ( as given on the package ) . This means that pure chocolate mass has 60.5 % fat . Assuming that your cocoa powder has 15 % fat ( " weakly de-fatted powder " is my best attempt at literal translation ) and that you are using shortening ( 100 % fat ) , we arrive at a ratio of 54 % fat to 46 % cocoa powder . You probably do n't have to be that exact , especially considering the fact that the fat content of cocoa powder is n't exactly 15 % . I 'd just go with a 1:1 ratio - easy to measure , and it gives you a bit more cocoa taste . So the final proportions should be 1 part cocoa powder , 1 part vegetable shortening , and 2 parts sugar . If you feel very mathematically inclined , you can calculate it more exactly for butter and a specific cocoa powder fat content . It is also important to note that in baking , you ca n't just throw everything in and mix . Different mixing sequences result in a different air distribution in the batter , which has very important results on the final texture . So do n't try to imitate chocolate by mixing above ingredients somehow and then dumping them into the bowl . Your recipe already has a correct technique for combining the ingredients , e. g. by creaming the butter with sugar and then slowly adding the flour . It also describes a technique for adding tempered chocolate to the batter , and this one wo n't work for a homemade mixture of sugar , cocoa powder and shortening . To achieve best texture , stick to the recipe 's technique for the components . Whatever they say to do with the original butter in the recipe , do it with a mixture of the butter and the chocolate-substituting fat . Use the original sugar amount together with the chocolate . Treat cocoa powder like flour , best mix them in a separate bowl before adding to the rest . Your result wo n't be exactly like a recipe created with real semisweet chocolate , but only the most discerning eaters will notice it , and most cake eaters are not that discerning . A last word of caution : throughout the answer , I assume that you have actual cocoa powder ( I 'd use non-dutched for a stronger choco taste , but this is a matter of personal preference ) . Instant drink powder like Nesquick does n't contain much real cocoa and is unsuitable for this kind of substitution ( or for any baking purposes ) .
There are two main types of provolone : piccante ( sharp ) and dolce ( sweet ) . Most braciola recipes I 've seen call for the sharp version . Sharp provolone tastes very similar to cheddar , which I assume is abundant in the UK . The issue is that " real " cheddar is a hard cheese and provolone is only semi-hard . Here in the US , we have a softer version of sharp cheddar-style cheese that is made in Wisconsin . If a similar semi-hard sharp cheddar variant is available in the UK , I would recommend that . It should also be noted that the term " braciola " ( or sometimes " braciole " ) means a lot of different things to different people . <URL> , likely including the author of your book , it takes on the Sicilian meaning of an involtino . Sometimes the meat will be filled with a soft cheese mixture like mozzarella mixed with grated pecorino romano . However , if the recipe calls for a harder cheese like provolone , it is likely referring to a variant that is very popular in the US in which the provolone is cut into thin slices ( usually using a deli slicer ) and layered on the meat before the meat is rolled . Therefore , any substitute for the provolone should ideally be thinly sliced .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .
Drinking chocolate is a bad way to flavor a cake . It consists of cocoa powder mixed with sugar , and has nowhere near enough chocolate taste . The correct way to flavor a cake is either baking chocolate ( the real thing , not " fat-containing cocoa glaze " ) , or cocoa powder . You should choose the one to use depending on the recipe ; do n't just add it to a normal sponge cake recipe , both change the texture . Cocoa powder is easier to use , as it will only add starch to the cake . Baking chocolate will give you a richer texture due to the cocoa butter it contains , but finding a good recipe for it is more complicated , as the classic proportions have to be adjusted not only for the starch , but also for the fat and sugar it adds . Also , the fat it adds ca n't be creamed , which interferes with leavening , and it has to be melted before adding it to the cake , which requires some skill ( mostly temperature control ) and is something I would recommend for an intermediate rather than a beginner baker . In short , find a good recipe which uses cocoa powder . Drinking chocolate is not only prohibitively expensive , it also gives an inferior result . After you feel more comfortable with cake baking , you can consider advancing to recipes which include baking chocolate . My personal favorite are Desaulniers ' recipes , but the Gourmet magazine recipes are probably more accessible , as many of them are freely available online ( try searching on Epicurious ) . You can also look around for other sources ; I would advise against trying out random recipes off the Internet before you have gathered enough experience to be able to judge the quality of the results by just reading the recipe .
Looking at this recipe I do n't see any reason why you could n't use puff pastry as the container . The only ways that the preparation would be different is : puff pastry does n't dry out as fast as filo so you do n't have to worry about the wet towel in the instructions . You would n't want to do multiple layers of puff pastry as the recipe calls for . You would just form a single pouch to hold your filling and seal it well . Know that the texture will be different of course . The filo will be a bit more crisp and the layers larger and more distinct - filo is also a lot more work . You may find that the baking time needs to be adjusted a little but I do n't think it will be very different if at all . Cook them until they 're golden using the recipe 's time as a starting point . This recipe is in a Mediterranean style and filo would be more traditional but puff pastry would produce something tasty .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
On first blush , you will probably want a fat or oil with similar qualities as the " vegetable " oil you 're replacing , such as olive oil . Butter has a much lower a smoke point , however , cornbread recipes exist that use butter or lard . I 'd be willing to experiment , particularly if you 're used to cooking with butter . ( Just be careful with heat . ) As far as quantity , I 'd use a bit less than 1/3 of a cup , but that 's me being defensive as I do n't know the recipe you 're using .
So I have a method that I just worked out but it is insanely labor intensive and only suited to small batches . With that said , here you go . Also , steps will be slightly out of order so make sure you read completely through . To create filled french fries : First , you need to cut your potatoes into slightly larger fries than normal . You are looking for about 1/2 to 2/3 of an inch on each side . You need to preheat your grease to 275 . Once your grease has preheated , parcook the french fries . They should be cooked but not crisped or browned . Lay fries in a layer on a pan and place into fridge . Prepare your injection . I used sour cream but you can add whatever you want . ( I thinned the sour cream down with a little milk till it got to the consistency that I wanted ) Load your injection into a syringe and inject into the now cooled but not cold fries . Do n't over-inject or you will ruin fries left and right . Inject by running the needle fully in , then slowly removing while slowly deploying the filling . As you inject , lay on a pan in the freezer . This is important because you need to get the fries frozen as quick as possible . While you wait , prepare your seasoned flour . I tried some with out the flour and the fries tended to lose the filling . Your are going to be working the fries in small batches . It is imperative that the fries be frozen through , if they are n't you will lose your filling . Toss a handful of fries into the flour and coat thoroughly . Alternately , you can coat fries in an egg wash then flour , but the results were a little too far from traditional fries for me . Toss the fries into 375 degree oil until fries brown and are crisp on outside . You need to watch carefully and as soon as they start floating count to ten then remove . You ca n't over cook them or you will not have any filling remaining . A couple of extras : I do n't know how a filling that is predominately water will work in these , but I would conjecture very poorly given how fries cook . Your hole in the potato is only going to be sealed with flour so you might see some leakage . I could n't figure out a way around that . You benefit from the freezing with a much improved bite texture over my normal fry prep . The final result has a high wow factor , and was pretty tasty . I am not sure the results are worth the effort , but I think if you try a high flavor filling it will go a long way to making it worth while .
The bowl is n't absolutely essential ; it 's part of the aesthetic . The shape does serve a purpose , as most of them have nicely curved bottoms that will minimize the chance of the powder from clumping near the edge of the bowl . I 've used a normal whisk when preparing " matcha latte " drinks for a client of mine back in the day . There 's an advantage to having the 80-120 " tate " ( bristle ? ) because they make it easier to break up beads that form as moisture contacts the tea . But a normal culinary whisk will do the trick , perhaps with a bit more work . I do n't see how the silicone brush would help whisking ; they tend to be pretty floppy ( and mine has occasionally had some of the silicone strands break off when I 've used it for brushing food ) .
In all honesty , I think that apple juice is just a euphemistic way of saying sugar-water . The braising happens due to the sugar content mostly , which is why it does n't really matter what type of juice it is ( citrus excluded ) . The flavour of the apple juice will be almost completely lost during cooking , so you do n't need to worry about it too much .

I 'm baking an acorn squash . How long should I bake it for ?
To roast acorn squash , set your oven to 350 and roast for about 30-35 minutes . I normally roast cut side up , unless I am using some kind of sauce to go with it . I find that the squash cooks to a more even color than when you place it directly against a metal pan which can develop diffrent temps across the surface . You can also baste with some butter as long as it is face up , which is pretty good .
I fill a tall frying pan ( or pot ) with water . Add some white vinegar . Let it come to a boil Add the eggs . Do n't make it too overcrowded Take it out with a flipper or a spoon with holes when they look done .
Sounds like you want <URL> . If you search google you will undoubtedly find recipes for this abomination . It is designed to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the need for utensils . You did say taste and texture were n't important .
Yes , you can save it and add it to soups such as Minestrone for additional flavor . Once the soup is done , remove and discard the rind . For extended storage , keep it in a bag in the freezer until you have need for it .
I ca n't speak specifically to the shelf life of salami , especially considering all of the factors that come into play ( source , type , age , storage , etc. ) , but when dealing with meat in general , you should never eat it if it smells or tastes " off " . Smell is really the most reliable means of determining whether or not meat is still good - far more reliable than the use-by date . It 's unusual for meat to smell or taste sour as a result of foodborne bacteria ; sourness is more likely to be due to rancidity of the fats , which is of course equally dangerous , albeit in a different way . Oxidation is very likely if the meat was not properly wrapped and/or stored in an airtight container . Of course , many people have trouble telling the difference between spoilage due to rancidity and spoilage due to bacteria , and so what you 're perceiving as rancid ( sour ) may really be bacterial spoilage . Either way , if it tastes off , it 's spoiled ; do n't eat it .
To my knowledge wasabi paste is just wasabi powder that has had the water added to it by the factory . So if you are looking at paste vs powder I would go powder . The question to me would be to make it a paste before you add it to your ice cream base or to add the powder directly to the ice cream base . I would venture to say you should be just fine adding the powder directly to the ice cream base . Now , for the ugly truth . Pretty much all you wasabi powder sold in the US or Japan for that mater is n't really wasabi ( or contains very little wasabi ) . It is horseradish , that is colored green and has some sort of mustard or turmeric added . And really not what I would want to try in an ice cream . Plus the flavor of the pastes are not like fresh ( even with horseradish ) . If I were doing an ice cream , I would want to stay away from the powder all together . I would visit my local specialty food market or online specialty market and see if I could source real wasabi . But cost might be prohibitive for you as it is very expensive . Next the good news is , there are some powders out there that are actually dried ground wasabi powder such as <URL> . It was most likely something like this that your friend used if she did use a powder . Anyway , I hope this is helpful to you . And good luck .
I have cooked rice that was used for weighting a pie crust with fine results . I should have cooked some that was n't baked to see what the difference was , but in any case it turned out fine . Of course it may matter what temp the rice was baked at and for how long , and this could also affect the duration needed to cook the rice itself . I have also boiled beans that were previously baked , and they turned out fine , too .
Generally that sort of treatment is to get rid of any moisture the stone may have taken on during storage/handling -- if it were n't kept dry , there could be moisture deep in the stone that would not be an issue in normal home use . I would expect the instructions were also that you should put the stone in the cold oven then turn it on -- that would be the safest way to do the whole process , avoiding thermal shock , etc. . There might be some proprietary reason to do this also , but my vote goes to driving out deeply absorbed moisture .
There are <URL> ( usually of Italian origin ) specifically made with olive oil . In breads , you can certainly use it , although there often is not enough olive oil for its flavor to truly be appreciated . New York style pizza dough , for example , is traditionally made with some olive oil .
To roast acorn squash , set your oven to 350 and roast for about 30-35 minutes . I normally roast cut side up , unless I am using some kind of sauce to go with it . I find that the squash cooks to a more even color than when you place it directly against a metal pan which can develop diffrent temps across the surface . You can also baste with some butter as long as it is face up , which is pretty good .
You can do anything with charcoal . One trick that we used to do when we were camping was to line a cardboard box with foil . Several metal grates or skewers would be stabbed into the box walls and a grate with a few coals hung near the bottom . We would use it to bake bread and pizzas . To control the temperature use more or fewer coals . <URL> As long as you are building things - another option to consider is solar oven . They consist of an insulated container , a transparent window , and a reflector . There are a <URL> to choose from . Some of the more permanent models can get above 350F as long as there is direct sunlight . This model was just one of top results from Google but it is a typical design : <URL>
I feel your pain . If only I liked summer squash better ... You definitely can freeze squash -- thick slice it , blanch it in salty water briefly until almost tender , transfer to an ice bath until it 's chilled , bag it , and put in the freezer . Later , thaw and use with recipes that do n't require ultra-crisp squash .
The term " bad " , when applied to cheese , can actually refer to a <URL> ( p. 14 ) , several of which are caused by improper or over-aging and only some of which are dangerous . The issues that you most likely need to worry about are : Moisture loss applies primarily to soft cheese and is probably the first negative effect you 'll see . In a sealed package , it will " sweat " as Ivo points out , caused by water evaporating and then condensing again on the packaging , forming little droplets . Unsealed , it will simply dry out and become hard . This is not spoilage , and the cheese is still perfectly good to eat , it just might not have as pleasant a texture and might have a slightly flat flavour . You can just cut off any hardened edges . Oxidation gives a slightly metallic taste but more importantly leads to rancidity - discoloration and a sour smell/taste . This is caused by light and is why you should store cheese in a dark place . If you left it in the car during the afternoon , it may have been exposed to a good deal of light . However , <URL> and wax paper in particular is an oxidation inhibitor ( that 's why cheese is often wrapped in it ! ) . Light exposure also would have been minimal at night . You 're probably fine in this respect , but use your nose . If it smells sour , do n't eat it . The chemical process itself results in peroxides and free radicals , which are obviously not good to eat , although there seems to be some debate about just how dangerous they are ( some say it raises the risk of cancer , although I 'm unable to find an authoritative source , and this might just be an urban myth ) . Mold is the most obvious form of spoilage and usually also the last . Although most mold is technically aerobic , many strains are capable of growing with very little oxygen , and I personally have seen mold growing on an unopened package of cheddar that I 'd forgotten about for several months . I 'm sure I do n't need to tell you that mold is n't safe to eat ; however , by the time there 's enough mold to be dangerous , you 'll be able to see it . Contrary to what Ivo 's post suggests , the mold you 'll see growing on spoiled cheese is not the same as the mold that the cheese was made with - some cheeses , like parmesan , are n't made with any mold at all , although they can certainly grow mold later on . The molds used in cheese-making are typically some variety of <URL> , which is safe to eat . The mold that grows weeks later could be anything , and is not safe to eat . Ivo is also partially correct in saying that the packaging does not prevent mold growth ; however , it does slow it down by restricting the available oxygen . On the whole , I tend to agree with the other answers that your cheese will almost certainly still be good after only 1 day . Keep in mind that cheese is thought to have been popularized as a <URL> before refrigeration existed - the whole idea is that it lasts a long while , usually well over 24 hours before food safety becomes an issue .
Two things - If the marinade is very strong or salty then the meat could simply become over flavored . If the marinade includes a meat digesting enzyme such as papain then leaving it too long could turn the meat to mush .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
Anything that outgasses ethylene should be kept away from other items ( both fruits and vegetables ) , in a well-ventelated area , if possible . Apples and bananas are the two most common culprits , but the list is much longer . Subzero has a <URL> , which I 'm reproducing below in case of link rot : Ethylene producing foods apples apricots avocados ripening bananas cantaloupe cherimoyas figs honeydew kiwifruit mamey sapote mangoes mangosteen nectarines papayas passion fruit peaches pears persimmons plantains plums prunes quince tomatoes Ethylene sensitive foods unripe bananas green beans Belgian endive broccoli Brussels sprouts cabbage carrots cauliflower chard cucumbers eggplant leafy greens lettuce okra parsley peas peppers spinach squash sweet potatoes watercress watermelon
Smaller breads are usually called rolls or sometimes buns . There are also a lot of names for specific kinds of rolls , beyond obvious things like " sourdough rolls " . You can certainly take an existing recipe and just form in to more , smaller pieces , and reducing baking time . They 'll look funny if you just cut it into pieces , though ; you should reform them into something rounder . It 's hard to say exactly how much less baking time it 'll take , since it depends on exactly how small you make them . It might be anywhere from roughly a quarter to half the original baking time , and especially for smaller rolls with shorter baking times , you 'd probably want to increase the temperature so they 'll still brown by the time they 're done . Very small ones will be on the low end of the time range , and need more increase in temperature ; larger ones will take longer and not need as much temperature increase . Given all that , you might want to just look for a recipe for rolls that suits you . Simpler , less chance of messing up !
I 'd use the recipe they have on their site for <URL> as a guideline , since it 's very similar in terms of size and shape to a beef roast ( just not as heavy ) . They estimate 10 minutes per pound , which is more or less consistent with the per-side estimate of most broiler recipes ( which is very similar to infrared cooking ) . So start with an estimate of 40-50 minutes but do what they recommend and monitor the temperature very carefully . I have to point out that 4-5 pounds is very heavy/large for high-heat cooking methods like broiling or grilling ( or infrared ) ; it 's not the same as infrared " frying " a turkey or a leg of lamb which has a very high surface area/weight ratio . Steaks would no doubt come out great this way but larger roasts respond better to roasting , so do n't be too surprised if your roast starts to get seriously charred on the outside before it 's sufficiently cooked on the inside . You might want to consider starting with smaller , 2-3 lb roasts , and move up the weight next time if those come out perfectly . Based on their claims , it should take roughly the same amount of time for one large item vs. two smaller items anyway .
The pretzel originates in Germany , where it is called Laugenbrezel . It was originally prepared in a alkali solution , which is where the " Laugen " part of the word comes from ; typically , lye was used , but baking soda gets you most of the way there without a trip to the pharmacy ( a Mexican or Asian market may do the trick if you want culinary lye ) . The alkali solution is what causes the crust to brown so deeply , and it 's most of the difference between a pretzel and a bagel . A bagel would typically be boiled in a malted sugar solution instead . The flavor is also affected , but I do n't know how to describe the difference ; there 's a very pronounced aroma difference if you skip this step . To me , you end up with nothing more than a pretty breadstick unless the dough gets that alkali bath . If you do use culinary lye , use gloves and do n't rush anything . Traditional Laugen are n't boiled , so you just need a cool 3 % lye solution ; no boiling step . In Germany , the pretzel shape is n't the only option for Laugen . Little rolls calls Laugenbrötchen and longer , roughly baguette-width sticks called Laugenstangen are also popular . On my most recent trip last year , the Laugenstangen were frequently sold in the form of sandwiches , though I do n't remember seeing many of those when I was first living there in the mid-90s . ETA : Having done this a few more times since originally posting , I 'd also add that the utensils you use in lye-based pretzels need to be wood , glass or plastic . Eye protection is important too . Metal will likely corrode or oxidize when it contacts food put in contact with lye , even if it 's after the wash . I 'd recommend setting the washed pretzels on a wooden surface after dipping if you want to minimize damage/discoloration on your baking sheet .
The kind of oil you use in baking is mostly a matter of personal preference . Any neutral oil ( no strong flavor ) will do . I suggest you use an oil that you keep around for another purpose , which is not too expensive . Some good candidates include : Canola oil Peanut oil ( refined , except for those with peanut allergies ) Generic " vegetable " oil Grapeseed oil is also excellent but tends to expensive . Oils you would want to avoid due to the fact that they bring more flavor which may not be what you want in baked goods include : Olive oil Sesame oil Unrefined oils of all sorts

Why would IQF shrimp say " do not force thaw under running water " ?
Update Jeff Axelrod commented ( much thanks ) that the Costco IQF shrimp come with most of the shell removed . In that case , " DO NOT FORCE THAW UNDER RUNNING WATER " most likely means if you do it , you 'll end up with " shrimp pulp " with some of it even down the drain . The shrimp can absorb the water and get mushy and disintegrate . This , I have seen in our kitchen and tried to erase from memory . This also means the trapped bacteria under the shell is less of a concern . the original answer/caution regarding safety : Besides the fact that the shrimp can absorb the water , get mushy , and fall apart under running water , it could be a safety issue . It may be possible that the pressure from running water will force or push some bacteria that would normally be on the on the outside of the shells ( and destroyed ) in and under the shell ( e.g. between the belly and the shell ) where it may be shielded from heat and not fully killed during cooking . Bacteria going from outside of the meat to inside has caused Costco <URL> . In the meat case , it was forced in mechanically by the needles of the tenderizing machine . They might also be hedging against a similar thing happing with the shrimps and running water . If you thaw them in a tight freezer bag placed in water ( even running ) , it should be safe .
Some ingredients do not dissolve well in hot water - the starch swells and thickens , forming lumps that may have raw powder in them and are nasty . They need to be added to cold or lukewarm water and heated after they are dissolved . Other ingredients , most notably pasta , will partially dissolve in cold water making a thick gloppy soup . But if you add them to hot water they will " seal " ( in a way ) and stay together as they cook .
Bear in mind that I 'm using an electric kettle , rather than a stove-top one . First , the advantage of a kettle is that it is quite efficient , and turns itself off once the water is boiling . This as opposed to the microwave , which only stops after a set time , rather than relying on the condition of the water . Second , a microwave can cause water to superheat , particularly in a ceramic or glass container . This means that there is a certain risk that the water will " jump out " at you once you add something to it or put a spoon in . Additionally , most kettles have more power than the average microwave , so the kettle is probably faster to boil water .
Legend has it that the inventor of the ring shaped donut with a hole came up with the idea because he was dissatisfied with the raw centre of regular donuts . <URL> . Having done quite a few doughnut experiments recently , it 's true that having shapes where the distance from the centre to the surface is smaller increases your chances of properly cooked doughnuts . So toroids make sense , but then so would thin cylinders . You can however , fry up donuts will no hole , that are cooked all the way through . Look at Berliners or jam-filled doughnuts .
Gluten is what makes doughs chewy , and gluten is associated with high protein flour , so you should try and get low protein ( " soft " ) flour . Also , the colder your fat ( i.e. , butter ) the flakier and crispier your crust will be . You also may want to substitute some of the butter for lard or shortening ; the lack of water in the lard will also help the crust become crispy and avoid gluten formation associated with hydration of the flour . Note that you can not substitute lard/shortening for butter in an equal ratio ; you should try and find a recipe that specifically calls for it to get the ratio correct . As <URL> noted , you can also blind bake the crust to start its cooking process ( but as <URL> warns , you may not be able to call it a " pie " after that ! ) . Finally , it may be the case that your pie filling is too moist and therefore makes the interior of the crust very soggy . I 've found that almost all good apple pie recipes call for pre-cooking the apples to remove a lot of their moisture before putting them in the crust .
This is how shrimp is frozen for transit and sale . The packaging should have a weight that includes the ice aswell as the shrimp , and a weight that is shrimp only weight : The weight after they have completely thawed . There will also be a size grading . No of shrimp per lb or per KG based on whether they are HOSO Head On Shell On HLSO Headless Shell On or Peeled <URL> The ice coating prevents freezer burn to the shrimp , so they 'll be juicy when you defrost them rather than dry and hard ! If the have freezer burn they 'll be a opaque white discolouration on the surface . They 're still OK eat like this - they 're desecated / dried - they 're just really tough . Having said all this I am assuming that the packaging they 're in in undamaged , before I say that they should be fine !
There really are a couple separate issues that come together here : What is collagen to gelatin conversion ? When collagen converts to gelatin , it is not melting ( which is the same type of molecule , just as ice and liquid water are the same thing ) . Instead , it is being hydrated which is a chemical conversion process , where water is actually being added into the overall structure of the protein molecule , converting it into a different protein molecule . This does not happen just because of temperature , but rather because a water molecule with the right level of energy to power the process ( that is , moving fast enough ) hits the collagen molecule at the exactly proper spot to interact with it and become part of the molecule . The new molecule is called gelatin . Why does a pressure cooker facilitate effectively higher temperatures than an oven ? Most foods contain a great deal of water . On of the fundamental properties of water is that it takes a relatively large amount of energy to convert it from liquid water just at the boiling point ( 100 C / 212 F at sea level pressure ) to vapor just at the same temperature . This is called the <URL> . When a food containing water is heated in air at normal pressure , even if the air temperature is much hotter than the boiling point of water , the surface of the food can not get hotter than the boiling point , because any additional energy goes into converting the water into steam , and drying the surface . Only once the surface is dry can browning and other processes that happen above 100 C begin . However , in the inside of the food , which is still wet , the temperature continues to never be able to exceed the boiling point . Very few foods are normally cooked to the point where the interiors are dry enough to get hotter than this . In a pressure cooker , the boiling point of water is higher once the pressure is achieved ( for brevity , I will not discuss why this is so ) . For example , at 15 bar ( typical of a pressure cooker , one additional atmosphere of pressure above normal sea level pressure ) , water will not boil until about 250 F / 121 C . This permits both the surface and the interior of the food to reach higher temperatures than at normal pressure . Some cooking processes are accelerated due to this difference . Why does collagen convert faster ? Collagen conversion to gelatin is a time/temperature dependent process . That is , the higher the temperature ( within reasonable limits , before it burns or decomposes otherwise ) , the faster the conversion . Collagen will convert to gelatin at 140 F , but it will take literally several days . At 170 - 180 F ( typical internal temperatures in sea level braising ) , it takes several hours . In a pressure cooker , this time can be reduced , because the internal temperature can go higher than it can at sea level temperature . The reason for this is that collagen to gelatin conversion is a stochastic process . What this means is that it is essentially random . As a gross over simplification , imagine that the collagen molecule is a giant molecule ( it is ) with a button on it . All of the water molecules are moving around randomly , bouncing off one another . The higher the temperature , the faster they move on average . That is , at a low temperature , most molecules are moving relatively slowly , but some are almost stopped , and a very few are very fast . At a higher temperature , they move faster on average , and a slightly larger number are moving relatively very fast . Now imagine that the button will not be pressed until a water molecule happens to hit it while going fast enough to hit the button hard enough . The higher the temperature , the less time it will take for this to happen on average , because more of the water molecules are moving fast . Take this process over many , many , many collagen molecules , and you have the time/temperature conversion curve : the hotter the temperature , the faster the conversion overall . Conclusion Collagen to gelatin conversion is faster in a pressure cooker because the internal temperature of the food gets higher than is possible at atmospheric pressure , and this higher temperature speeds the stochastic gelatinization process .
Iron is simply an element , so it can not be destroyed by cooking ( or generally temperature changes ) , as vitamins and other organic structures potentially can . Cooked spinach inevitably has a much lower water content , thus the relative density of all other components must increase . So gram for gram , it makes sense that cooked spinach should have a higher concentration of iron ( and possibly some other things ) than raw . However , the actual process of cooking does nothing to change the amount of iron .
Contrary to what several folks have said , garlic is not crushed primarily to help peel the skin . For example , garlic can be peeled easily with the clove intact , by cutting the small hard circular bottom of the clove ( the part that 's attached to the base , opposite to the pointy end ) . This will help loosen the skin , which should then come off very easily or will separate if you gently slide the blade of your knife in and loosen it . While it certainly is true that crushing helps separate the skin , making it easier to peel ( perhaps some folks might do it for that reason at home ) , that is n't the reason why professional cooks do it or the reason why recipes suggest it . Why crush garlic ? Garlic is primarily crushed to release its oils , which in turn infuses subtly different flavours to the dish than if you did n't crush . <URL> above explains the chemical reaction : ... within the garlic cells are alliin and alliinase , which when combined , form allicin , which is the ' strong ' flavor ... You might also find <URL> from the Washington Post , where the author talks about the art of cooking with crushed garlic in Italian restaurants , a really good read . Specifically , the author addresses some of these key points which are very relevant here . 1 . Crushed vs. Minced From basic physics , something that is broken up into several tiny bits has a much larger total surface area than the whole intact piece . Since the oils extrude from the cut surface , it stands to reason that minced garlic will release them sooner and readily , often leading to a more pungent taste than desired . In addition , minced garlic can be quite temperamental and you might often end up over cooking/burning . As the author notes : In its customary minced or chopped form , garlic can impart a pungent flavor that is difficult to harness . Add it too early to a sauté or stew and garlic burns and becomes acrid . Add it in the latter stages of cooking and the garlic steams or boils , leaving it raw-tasting and unpleasant . On the other hand , slightly crushed garlic is more versatile and heat tolerant . Left whole and partially smashed ( just enough to release its powerful oils ) , garlic adapts to a range of high-heat techniques , cooking steadily and lending a mellow richness to a dish . 2 . Usage in dishes Crushed garlic is pretty standard in several Italian dishes . The advantage of having one or two large crushed pieces ( in addition to those mentioned above ) is that you can easily remove them from the dish once you 're satisfied with the aroma/taste of the dish . This can be extremely annoying to do with minced garlic . Some of the dishes that are enhanced by using crushed garlic are : In [ roasts , stews , quick meals and stir-fries ] , smashed garlic cloves are remarkably flexible , absorbing high heat and in turn giving off subtle but substantial flavor . What happens when you crush ? To answer why crushing garlic works , let me quote a bit from <URL> to the very popular question on <URL> ( since we all understand onions better ) : The enzymes and amino acids involved in producing the Onion Lachrymatory Factor ( seriously ! ) are normally contained in the cells , and only become a problem when released in volume . Using a sharper knife will avoid mangling cell walls , creating more clean separations between layers , and reducing the amount of enzymes released . Garlic , along with onions , shallots and leeks belong to the group of plants ( genus ) called <URL> and being very closely related , the above is more or less true . Indeed , it makes sense that if you want large volumes of oils/enzymes , you 'd do exactly the opposite of the above advice , which is to crush it and break all the cell walls ! This also aids in the mixing of the chemicals per Joe 's comment above . Note that although a large volume is " released " or ready to be released due to the crushed cell walls , they make their way to the dish slowly because of the smaller surface area .
The reason it tastes sweet is the presence of sugar , ie because it is sweet . Cinnamon is thin tree bark , and it is not uncommon for tree bark , or the layer near the bark to be sweet because of sap . Birch is another example of a tree that is sweet , you can suck on a peeled birch branch for the same reasons as stated in your question .
let them sit in a sunny window with southern exposure until they get a little soft . Then put them in a paper bag for a couple of days and they should be edible
I believe that the " clichéd image " you refer to is popular ( and cliché ) because of chili con carne 's long history of being cooked outdoors in big cauldrons or at least over an open flame . As any camper will tell you , iron is the traditional material of choice when cooking with fire . As for what actually happens - cast iron is a porous material , unlike stainless steel or aluminum . The seasoning in cast iron is essentially a layer of baked-in grease that fills those pores and over time absorbs the flavor of everything you cook in it . It absolutely does impart a characteristic flavour , but what that flavour is depends to no small degree on what 's been cooked in it before . If you do n't care properly for your cast iron , that flavour might very well be rancid fat . So whether or not the flavour you get with your chili makes it better , worse , or just different is largely a matter of personal taste and habits . As for the acidity : Yes , acids can react with the iron , but cast iron is fairly corrosion resistant . Cast iron is also used for pipes , so this is pretty well-documented by engineers ; you need <URL> to corrode cast iron to any significant degree . Pure tomato juice is not a strong acid ; it has a pH of <URL> , which is just at the threshold ; when you consider that this is being diluted with tomato purée , water , meat juices , and various other lower-acid substances , it 's evident that you 're well within normal tolerances and can cook chili and other tomato products for as long as you like . Also , the seasoning itself provides some measure of protection for higher-acid foods , since the acid has to penetrate the grease , and water is not good at penetrating fat - that 's why food rarely sticks to well-seasoned cast iron . Now this is not to say that the iron wo n't react at all , it just wo n't noticeably corrode or make your sauce/chili taste like metal . Consensus seems to be that you 'll end up with up to <URL> , which comes out to about 160 mg for the whole 3 quarts . That 's not good for you if you eat it all at once , but <URL> every day for a prolonged period of time , so unless you 're eating an entire quart/litre of chili or tomato sauce a day , it 's not going to be a health hazard . So do n't fill your cast iron pot with lemon juice or dump half a cup of vinegar in there - but do n't worry about a few tomatoes either . If anything , it just improves the nutritional content . As far as heat distribution is concerned , <URL> . It 's far more prone to hot spots than reasonably-priced aluminum - or copper-bonded stainless steel . What it does do is retain heat very well , so it 's excellent at maintaining just the right simmering temperature for something like chili , which you would otherwise need some fairly expensive stainless steel to achieve . But you have to be very careful of scorching when you cook chili in cast iron ; stir often . A few times I 've left my cast iron chili pot sitting around unattended for just a little too long and found some of the meat stuck to the bottom . Last but not least is the seasoning and the answer is no , you would n't season it any differently . As I alluded to above , the seasoning really does n't have much an effect when you 're cooking a sauce or stew as opposed to a piece of meat or something else that has a tendency to stick . The only function it really has here is to impart a tiny bit of flavour and insulate the iron from some of the acidity of the tomato juices , which is n't necessary anyway . All in all , I find cast iron to be very good for chili and other stews primarily because of its heat stability , but it 's no panacea , and if you 're only using the pot for chili then you wo n't get many of the benefits ( in particular the beautiful " black " seasoning that accumulates after hundreds of rounds of greasing and cooking ) . So by all means use your existing cast iron for chili and stews , but I would n't recommend for anybody to run out and buy a cast iron pot just for that purpose .
Expensive knives can survive a trip through the dishwasher , but like others have mentioned , they can bump into things , end up with coatings of detergents and such , suffer damage to wood , etc. . Why would you do that to an investment ? Cheaper knives will just straight out rust/corrode , even if you remove them and dry them right after the cycle . Yeah , you can scrub it off , but you 're also losing metal from the blade , possibly starting rust in areas you ca n't dry , and generally degrading the knives .
To me , the key to your question " five minutes . " I 'm no scientist , but I ca n't imagine that this is harmful . I agree with Aaronut 's answer in that I think it takes a much , much longer period of time for problems to develop . When people warn you about thawing in hot water , they 're envisioning something more like taking a solidly-frozen piece of meat from the freezer , and thawing it in hot water .
As you can see at the Chapter 7 : Storage of horticultural crops of the book <URL> : If you look p. 166 ( p. 173 on the PDF ) , you can see that the onions need to be stored in this conditions : between 0-5 ° C with a relative humidity ( R.H. ) of 65-70 % If you look p. 168 ( p. 175 on the PDF ) , you can see that the potatoes have different needs : Fresh market : between 4-7 ° C Processing : between 8-12 ° C seed potatoes : between 0-2 ° C But must of all , potatoes need very highest relative humidity ( R.H. ) : 95-98 % versus 65-70 % for onions So , if you store them together , either one or the other will be in bad storage conditions . Further , as you can see at <URL> : Dry onions ( Group 3 ) are very sensitive to moisture , which makes their storage incompatible with the high R.H. needed for potatoes . New potatoes ( Group 6 ) may also produce ethylene , which will badly damage green onions ( Group 2 ) if stored together . Anyway , storage of horticultural crops can not just be resumed by " do n't put this or that together " , as you may have seen : it is important to consider R.H. , temperature , and many other factors . If the subject interests you , all this ( and many other things ) is pretty well explained in the following references : <URL> <URL> <URL> Ethylene is also a " critical factor " , and this topic is more developped in the following resources : <URL> <URL>
If you cut it with a knife , you 'll tend to get a very smooth surface . If you tear it open , whether by hand or with the aid of a fork , it 'll tend to break on more natural places in the crumb , giving a bit rougher surface . When toasted , that tends to result in more contrast of texture - the bits sticking up will brown more and get crunchier .
Yes , the freshness is the factor . In the US eggs are sold in three grades : AA , A , and B ( rare ) . The grading is based primarily on age . AA are the freshest , and B the oldest . Here is a diagram depicting the internals of an egg : The characteristics of the freshest eggs are : A large thick albumen ( white ) A small thin albumen A sturdy thick chalaze A small air space A sturdy round yolk when lying flat As the egg ages the following things happen : Thick albumen breaks down , getting smaller Thin albumen gets larger Chalazae degrades getting thinner and weaker Air space increases Yolk membrane weakens , when cracked it lies flatter Embryo may become visible as a red speck As a result of the weakening membrane the yolk is indeed easier to break . Michael 's suggestion to use your fingers to separate the eggs is spot on . The edge of an egg shell is a little too risky for reliable separation of eggs .
Really , this is just to even out cooking times for vegetables that do n't have a surface area to volume ratio consistent with the other things you 're stir-frying . If you were to shred those green beans , as is sometimes done , you could put them in at the same time as raw , julienned carrots , and they would finish at the same time . If you put them in whole , you 'll end up with beans that are burned on the outside and raw on the inside , as there 's not enough time for the heat to penetrate to the center of the bean before the outside burns . Or , if you fry at a lower heat , you could get the beans cooked , but would have to add the carrots later ( which means a lower temperature , too , since the beans are dragging heat out of your pan ) in order to have them not turn to mush .
I do n't claim that this is a canonical answer , but it seems to be a bit like the situation with apples . You have cooking apples and eating apples , which have been bred for different traits . Similarly you have juicing oranges , eating oranges , and bitter oranges ( used for marmalade ) . The other citrus fruits which taste most like oranges ( mandarins , clementines , tangarines ) are more suited for division into segments , and you 're more likely to see them used for decoration . You could juice them if you do n't have a better option , but recipes will tend to use the most suitable commonly available option . Grapefruit has a very different flavour , so you have to take that into account when substituting . It 's also not necessarily sweet , and certainly I have never seen grapefruit sold as " sweet grapefruit " or " bitter grapefruit " .
Compared to corn starch , arrowroot : Results in a clearer , shinier texture ; Survives the freezing process much better ; and Works better in acidic liquids ( certain sauces , soups , etc. ) Where it does n't work so well is in many fruit pies and some other baked goods ( because it tends to break down under high heat ) , and in dairy dishes ( you 'll end up with a " gooey " texture ) . Use arrowroot in place of corn starch whenever your needs match the above . P.S. . Many people are also allergic to corn , and this is probably one of the most common reasons to use arrowroot . If this applies to you , and you 're making a dish that is not suited to arrowroot , tapioca flour/starch is another great thickener and actually thickens better than corn starch .

How do I recognize a silver utensil ?
This is n't a perfect test , but a magnet wo n't stick to a silver utensil whereas it will stick to most other metal utensils ( i.e. , stainless steel ) .
First , finely chop the onions . This makes them smaller , faster-cooking , and less of a textural presence in the dish . Do it by cutting straight through the poles of the onion , resulting in two halves . Then chop off the knobs and peel off the outer layer . Run the knife 8 or 9 times along the vertical ( from pole to pole ) , but do n't sever one end completely . Cut finely across these verticals to make a fine dice . Run the knife over the pile a few times if your cut is n't small enough . Second , cook the onions . The purpose of sweating is to draw moisture out , concentrating the flavor and enhancing conversion from starch to sugar . Heating the onions releases their aroma and reduces the chemical bitterness they exhibit when raw . Heat up some oil in a pan to medium-low heat . Add the onions . Add salt . I would n't cover the pan , since the lid will prevent steam from escaping . Stir/shake to prevent sticking or burning . The onions will get soft and then translucent . ( Eventually , if you kept going they would get limp and browned ; this is referred to as caramelized and considered a different thing than sweated , so although it 's just further along the same spectrum , you should n't go that far for this recipe ) . That 's how I 'd do it and why . I do n't know if it 's a textbook answer .
As SAJ14SAJ said , the best solution is to simply not live in a place like that - it can be a bit dangerous . But since you 're there , about the only thing you can do is get a decent fan and use it to direct air out of the kitchen toward rooms with open windows . Depending on the layout ( and the fans ) you may need multiple fans , and might want one of them to be a box fan in the window helping push air out . For things you think may be smoky , you might also consider cooking outside if possible , on a hot plate , a camping stove , or a small grill . ( Or you could just not do them at all . )
Most dishes require a chopped leek in any case , but for an uncut leek you will have to separate by hand and wash each leaf separately . If you want the leek in an untouched form I think you 're out of luck . You could try reassembling it after separating and washing :) Depending on the form you want your leaves in there are different ways . If you want them in strips you just cut lengthwise from above the root - keep the root on for now . Then you can rinse the leaves as they should be easy to separate . After rinsing remove the root . For ' chopped ' leaves cut the leek lengthwise and chop crosswise , removing the root in the process . The leaves will separate , and you can then wash the dirt from them in a colander . Skipping the lengthwise cut will usually make the leaves stay together , trapping the grit you want to get at . If you want to make doubly sure , you could first place the cut leeks in a bowl and swirl it around . The dirt will separate to the bottom . You can then take out the leeks and finish rinsing in the colander . Do n't pour the bowl into the colander as this just pours the grit over the leaves .
I trim the stem and remove the outer leaves till they snap to get to the fresh inner core and steam them the night or morning before grilling so they are cold and moist . I prefer steaming because I want all of the nutrients to remain in the artichoke . I cut them in half for the grill , remove the choke and brush them with grapeseed oil where they come into contact with the grill . First , facing down grill them till they feel hot on top then ; flip them over to keep the yummy inner side tender . fill the cavity with garlic butter and ... lemon if you wish . I prefer the brown color to the lemon flavor . I cook them till the butter melts . I like mine barely smokey because artichokes take on the smoke too easily and will taste burned . You ca n't taste the flavor of the artichoke if it gets too smokey .
Honestly , do n't grill . Do n't run away ! Hamburgers were originally cooked in pans , not on grills . One of the reasons for this is thta with grilling you lose any fat and moisture that comes out of the burger . So I use Heston Blumenthal 's method now . While I tend to ignore the preparation elements ( I have neither the time nor the money to hand-grind my burgers with a specific ratio of this cut to that cut to the other cut ) , the cooking method is flawless : Make your burgers . Over very low heat , place a pan with just a little oil ( or bacon/duck fat , which is lovely ) . introduce burgers to pan . As soon as they release easily from the surface , flip . Thirty seconds later , flip . Repeat until cooked through . ( fifteen to twentyish minutes ) . This will give you the juiciest , most tender burgers you have ever had in your life . I promise . Essentially what you 're doing is basting the burgers in their own fat . Alternatively , if you have an immersion circulator , cook your burgers sous vide and then just mark on the grill when done . I 've had burgers done this way and they are excellent . Burgers will flare on the grill -- that 's all the fat ( and therefore flavour ) being squeezed out by the action of cooking and burning away .
I 'm going to take a wild guess at what 's happening , based on what I know of thermodynamics , ( but I could be wrong about the whole thing ) When a cakes and bread bakes , it bakes from the outside ... as it forms a crust , it can no longer rise . ( for yeast breads , this is why we slash the top , so it can get a little extra rise out of it ) With a cake , as the sides set , it 'll continue to rise in the middle , creating a domed top . With a metal tube pan , the heat from the outside of the pan conducts to the middle of the pan , so the middle will set shortly after the outside . ... With the silicone pan , you 've actually got an insulator ... the heat 's not going to conduct to the inside , so it 's going to be able to rise longer than around the inside -- basically , the domed cake , but you 've got something for it to stick to , so it does n't fall back down as it sets . As I do n't think the issue is distribution of the batter , I 'd recommend trying other techniques to reduce the domedness of the cake -- cook it at a lower temperature ( try 25F / 15C lower ) for a longer time . You ca n't remove the problem entirely , but you might be able to reduce it . I 'd also look at the instructions that might 've come with the pan -- it 's possible that they have reommendations on how to deal with the problem . ( and it 's possible that this might not be as significant a problem in convection ovens , but replacing your whole oven for a set of pans is kinda silly )
Doing a bit of Googling , it seems that there are a couple of different methods but I think the one that will please you best is to : put a piece of plastic wrap on the cut side only place it cut side down on a plate or plastic container leave it on the counter Some recommend putting it in the fridge regardless , as the cut side is prone to bacterial infection . I would probably recommend using it within 24 hours , though . Maybe add it to a salad at dinner ? Personally , I just eat the rest of the tomato along with the rest of my lunch sandwich . Source : <URL> Among others . There was a good deal of consensus on this issue .
Try freezing the oreos first and then cut with a sharp knife . Let the oreos warm to room temperature again . They will not lose any texture or crispiness . Update : In the name of science , I froze some oreos and tested the outcome . Freezing the oreos made the cutting much more ... achievable . A room temperature oreo just wants to crumble in too many places , but a frozen one holds together better .
Pickle recipes meant for longer-term storage will include instructions for sealing the jars . While some recipes may have you use hot jars and hot brine that will result in a fairly reliable seal ratio ( meaning most of the jars will properly seal ) , other recipes will have you put the filled and closed jars in a boiling water bath to be processed for a specific amount of time . I 've found this method to yield an even higher ratio of properly sealed jars . In either scenario , the sign of a sealed jar ( assuming you are using canning jars with a lid and ring system ) is an indented dome on the lid . Jars that do not seal properly will still have a protruding dome . Most recipes will have all the specific information you need to make pickles including the shelf life of sealed jars . The Ball canning jar company has a good website : <URL> Best of luck - I hope your pickles are a tasty success !
It would be nearly impossible to gauge the effect of a different fruit on a quick bread without knowing the types and amounts of other acidic things in the recipe . Milk or buttermilk are also acidic , as are some other things you 're likely to find in a quick bread batter . Your recipe is going to be calculated to have enough leavening action for the bread , using whatever acids are initially required . Most likely this is partly the fruit and partly things like milk or buttermilk ( both of which are acidic , buttermilk being more so ) . Using more acidic ingredients than intended will just leave your final bread slightly more acid -- probably not enough to bother you , particularly if the fruit was to your liking to start with . You may find that a more acidic batter causes the baking soda to rise faster than you want , so you should watch for that . You will not be able to make the baking soda release too much carbon dioxide by acidifying more -- it 'll do as much as it can then stop . If you use less-acidic ingredients , you risk making the baking soda underperform . What I would resist doing in that instance is adding more baking soda , however . You wo n't increase the leavening action and you may find you introduce an unpleasant metallic taste . Better in those cases to let the batter sit just a little longer to give it more time to leaven , or add more of another acidic ingredient . Ultimately , I 'd be more concerned about the varying moisture levels in the fruits used than the acidity . Apples are relatively dry compared to , say , strawberries or blueberries , so you may find that your batter is too wet to cook properly at the time and temperature prescribed .
A <URL> perhaps ? I 've no luck finding the term for your specific description , but that seems to be an umbrella term for utensils that basically hold something so you can more easily grill it .
If you <URL> , you will find many , many recipes and descriptions . The basic idea is that you use a half-empty beer can as stand for the chicken , placing the chicken 's cavity on top of the can before roasting or grilling . The idea is that the aroma from the beer will transfer to the chicken , and the steam will help keep it moist . You can even buy commercial racks to do the same thing without the beer can . My personal opinion is that both of these ideas are bunk : Very few if any aromatic molecules will transfer to the chicken , and even if they do , they will not penetrate past the surface The steam will not keep the chicken moist , as the dryness of the meet is essentially a function only of the temperature to which you cook it , and very little else . If the chicken is cooked to too high a temperature , then the proteins will tighten up and express water making the chicken tough , rubbery , and dry tasting . The minimal amount of steam can not change this fact .
Mayo that splits is typically from one of two things : Insufficient water Insufficient mixing leading to large droplets ( It 's hardly ever insufficient emulsifier , as one yolk can do many cups of mayo . ) The lack of mixing can happen fairly easily with a whisk , but it wo n't happen if you 're using a food processor , blender , or immersion blender . You 're probably normally making mayo that is on the border of insufficient water , so it 's fairly easy to get it to break . When you added more water , the emulsion actually became more stable . That explains why you ca n't get it to break , I have a few suggestions on how to fix : Freeze it . It should break upon thawing . If hand-mixed , use an immersion blender on it . That should thicken a little , by better mixing . ( Assuming you 're not using extra virgin olive oil , which should not be blended ) I 'm sure there are some thickeners that could be added , but I 've never tried thickening mayo like this . Keep in mind that some flavors are fat soluble , some are water soluble , so if you discard part of the water , you may be changing the flavor balance .
The difference between sweet and tart cherries is not so much the sweet , but more the tart . If you look at the nutrition information you 'll find that tart cherries have about 2/3 as much sugar as sweet , but twice as much Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) which is what gives them their tart flavor . With this in mind , most sweet cherry pie recipes include lemon juice , while tart cherry pies recipes do n't need the lemon juice for balance . Recipes for both type seem to use between 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar , so as Stephie says , " It 's mostly a matter of taste " From personal experience - I made 2 cherry pies using a tart cherry pie recipe , except substituting Bing cherries . I got more great reviews for those pies than you would believe . ( It might have something to do with the sweet tooth gene on that side of the family )
( Storage note : do not wash the bulbs before storing them ; place in plastic bag in the refrigerator . Wash just before using . ) Young kohlrabi is great raw . Peel first , then add to salads ( sliced or grated ) serve as part of a veggie platter w / dip grate it and add to slaw ( but after grating it , put some salt on it &amp; let it sit , then squeeze the water out of it ) puree it - here 's someone who really loves it pureed : <URL> Cooked kohlrabi can be steamed or boiled . Remove the skin after cooking . You can eat the leaves , if they are still firm and green ; use them within a couple of days . Wash the leaves &amp; remove the tough stem parts ( ribs ) . Blanch in boiling water for a couple of minutes , drain , chop , and serve with a bit of butter , salt , and pepper . A little vinegar or lemon juice is good on them , too .
I 'd recommend letting it cool to near room-temperature , then place it in an airtight sealed plastic freezer bag before it dries out too much . You can spoon some of the juices from cooking into the bag with the steak so that when it defrosts again the juices will be in there working to keep it moist . When you defrost it , do so in your fridge leaving it overnight so that it defrosts gradually , keeping it in the freezer bag so it does n't lose any more moisture . It should then be good to reheat , probably best in a shallow pan rather than a microwave to retain moisture .
It 's very difficult to give an answer , as the size and shape of the casserole can greatly affect the reheating time . I 've found to get the best results , I start the casserole covered in a cold oven ( put it in the oven , then turn the heat on ) , and cook it at low heat ( 300 ° F / 150 ° C ) until it 's heated through . Once it 's up to temperature , I uncover the dish and turn the oven to broil ( called ' grill ' in some areas ... when only the top element is on at very high heat ) , and brown the top . If you need to , once the dish is warmed through , you can turn the oven down to its lowest setting and hold it there until you 're near time to serve it . ( it only takes a few minutes to brown the top , especially if you adjust the oven rack so the casserole is an inch or so ( 2.5 cm ) from the heating element ) I 'd probably give myself an hour minimum to heat it , preferably 1.5 hours , and 2 hours if it 's an especially large dish .
Buy whole bean coffee ( preferably freshly roasted , maybe even from a local roaster ) . Start with a rough grind . Use a burr grinder to achieve a more consistent grind . If the grinder has a french press or coarse setting use that , else experiment with it to find a consistency that produces coffee you like . Take out your plunger and place 1 T of grounds per 4 oz ( 115 g ) of coffee that you are making . Again you can experiment with the amount of coffee you put in to get something that suits you taste . Use 4 oz of water per T of grounds that you put in the press . Fill your press with water no more than about 1 " ( 25 mm ) below the spout ( if you have a smaller press you go a bit higher , but not too much or you 'll spill ) . The water temp recommended is ~ 200 ° F ( 95 ° C ) ( just short of boiling . Stir gently , if you have a large pot use a chopstick . If you have a small pot a plastic spoon or coffee stirrer will work . Put the plunger in the coffee and press down slightly so all of the grounds are below the water level , this will press out some of the air in the grounds and also ensure even wetting . Wait ~ 4 minutes ( again , experiment here to determine best flavour ) . Press your pot slowly and gently . If you encounter too much resistance wait a moment ( or even pull back on the press a bit ) and then continue ( too much resistance can indicate too fine a grind , try a larger grind next time ) . When your plunger is all the way down wait a few moments and then pour . Waiting a bit allows some of the sediment to settle out of the coffee so you get less in your coffee cup . Some sediment is normal and provides body , but too much can be a turnoff . If you will not be drinking all of the coffee you made , decant it into a different pot so that it does not continue to steep in the grounds . While there is some <URL> here . A lot of what you do is informed by your own tastes and preferences . Experiment with it and see what you like . Spend some time deciding what kind of coffee , how long it steeps , how fine a grind you need and even how much sediment you like .
Perfect . Sounds like your pizza stone is nicely seasoned . Scrub it with your stiffest brush , rinse with water , no soap , done . If you 're paranoid about germs , cook it before cooking on it . Throw it in the oven at a few hundred degrees , for 15 minutes or so . Ideally , you 're supposed to heat the stone ( thus sterilizing it ) before slapping the pizza upon it anyway ( although that requires a <URL> ) .

What is the optimal temperature for making coffee , specifically in an AeroPress ?
When making espresso with a machine , normally the ideal temp is around 200F . So I would most definitely not use cooler water . 175F is very hot for steaming milk -- for me that would be way over-steamed and scalded . Most of the resources I 've found say to steam to 150-160F . I 've actually found that even when the thermometer says 150F , it 's over-cooked for my tastes . What I do now is go by feel . I steam in a stainless pitcher and keep my fingertips on the sides . When it 's too hot for me to hold for more than a second or so , I stop .
Take a look at this link from <URL> , it 's not a standard , per se , but it provides useful information . Table from article :
The person who wrote <URL> , agrees with you on the 80-100 ° part . However , in his salmon recipe , he advices to smoke below 85 ° . So my guess is that it depends on the food you 're smoking .
If you 're using cheap knives ( which you suggest to the answer you linked to , and I admit , I have quite a few ) , feel free to sharpen them yourself ... I have both a stick-style diamond dust sharpener , and a set of whet stones . But I do n't sharpen my good kitchen knives myself , and I tend to go a few years between sharpenings ( but I also have two chef knives and a santuko , which get the majority of the use , but it 's spread across three of 'em , so they likely do n't get as much wear if I only had one ) ... but I agree with @hobodave -- I hone 'em , but I 'm not going to sharpen them myself .
Another route for day to day cleaning is vinegar . I use a spray bottle with half white vinegar and half water at night on my counter tops before bed . ( Use soap after cooking or prepping . ) The vinegar does a good job cleaning bacteria , mold , and germs . Once you get accustomed to the smell of vinegar , you will realize it deodorizes after the vinegar smell goes away . A nice touch is rubbing a lemon on the counter beforehand , but it really does n't do much other than smell nice and break down oil .
There are actually two dishes being sold , and neither is " Phở " . The words that she yelled and had Gordon do the same were " Hủ tiếu , Bún riêu " .

I found a quote from <URL> One thing you may not want to do with a press pot , especially a larger model , is use beans roasted less than 2 or 3 days before . What , am I crazy ? Nope . There 's a problem with ultra fresh beans and it is called " bloom " . When beans are only a day or two off the roast , they contain heaps of Co2 . Heaps of it , I tell you . That Co2 will translate into a massive bloom of brown suds on top of your press pot , possibly overflowing , but also making it easier for big particulate matter ( your ground coffee ) to hop and skip over the top of the filter portion when you first apply it . Bloom looks cool , but can make using a press pot more difficult . The poor filtering part sounds questionable to me , so I googled it and found a few bloom-related comments <URL> . It seems like some people start timing their soak time only after they see bloom . This seems like the real reason to me . I know for sure that the air content in ground substances can vary significantly : one cup of flour can contain double the volume of another if one is loosely sifted and the other is compacted . The above quote is accurate about that in my opinion . Apply this logic to coffee and in order to produce an accurate , general recipe for how long some compounds take to come out of coffee grounds , you need to factor out a variable between coffee grounds : how much air is in the grindings . Maybe the first small pour will saturate with coffee compounds , or drop in temperature quickly , reducing how much it can extract from the grounds . Once it squeezes out all the air , the rest of the water is poured in to do the real extraction work .
The USDA recommendation for a safe internal temperature is 165 degrees for chicken . The breast , being leaner , should n't be cooked to any higher than that or it will dry out and be tough . The thigh can be cooked to a slightly higher temperature ( 165-175 ) . That is the Kitchen Network 's preference for taste and texture ( <URL> ) . Getting the thigh to a slightly higher temperature ( and keeping it there for longer ) helps the collagen break down , which will make it more tender and taste more moist .
Perhaps you can use one these ? <URL> Buying one these might be little over the top : <URL> <URL>
If you take your coffee sweet , ice cream works wonders , and it lasts in the freezer . Chocolate is my favorite . I recommend melting it before adding the coffee . This makes sense because ice cream is mostly milk and cream , with some flavorings -- usually of higher quality than are in artificial coffee creamers . I should add the trick I used in the dorms some years ago , when I had no refrigerator ( and an aunt to buy it ) : Bailey 's Irish Cream . Of course , the effect is somewhat different :-)
Reducing the amount of charcoal used in the Orion Cooker and cooking longer can produce a more tender result . Specifically , using 6 lb of a 12.5 lb bag of charcoal and cooking for 120 minutes for 3 racks produced ribs that were not quite as tender as desired , but much better than the normal Orion recipe ( 12.5 lb of charcoal for 70 minutes ) . The temperature profile was as follows : The above shows that the meat temperature was held between 195 and 205 for 60 minutes . This profile is not optimal for the most tender ribs , so additional changes toward lower/slower may improve the result . Note that the charcoal reduction required a minor modification to the equipement since unless the charcoal is adjacent to the Cooker 's wall , the wood chips will not smoke . The modification is shown in a you tube video entitled " Orion Cooker Charcoal Saving Mod And Improved Tender Rib Cooking " ( <URL> ) .
350F is the magic temp . Just about every casserole cooks at 350 , and you cook it until it starts being bubbly which will probably between 30 minutes and an hour ( in this case , you should check to make sure it 's hot in the center as well , since you 're starting from frozen ) . I 'd cover it early , and then uncover it near the end so the top wo n't get dry .
You could try agave nectar -- but I 'm not sure if it will be that much of an improvement over honey . A tiny pinch of salt might also help make the smoothie <URL> . Usually though , if I want my smoothies to be sweeter I just add more juice or fruit ( e.g. ripe berries , peaches etc ) .
I think for Indian recipes you should in general look for an unstrained , set yoghurt . There are other factors that determine the final taste and texture of the yoghurt ( the bacteria , the type of milk , length of fermentation , ... ) but you may not have much choice w.r.t. other factors than these two : Production process : Set yoghurt is yoghurt that 's made the traditional way , it 's fermented in the pot that it 's sold in . Stirred yoghurt on the other hand is fermented before being packaged ; it 's a more industrialized production process which is cheaper , but results in a more sour , thinner yoghurt . Stirred yoghurt has a smooth , pourable consistency ; whereas set yoghurt is firmer . I got a bit confused when I was using stirred yoghurt the first time I tried making <URL> and the recipe told me to whisk the yoghurt till it was smooth . The pretty sour taste of the yoghurt also did n't go well with the spices , and the juice from the cucumbers made the already-thin yoghurt too watery . You could try fixing both problems by straining the yoghurt a bit and adding sugar , but it 's better and easier to just buy set yoghurt . The yoghurt 's packaging might say explicitly what type of yoghurt it is , but if it does n't or you do n't understand the language : avoid yoghurt that comes in " milk carton " - like containers , that most definitely means it 's stirred yoghurt . A plastic pot does n't mean it 's set yoghurt though , but it 's a better bet . Thickness : Strained yoghurt ( like " Greek-style yoghurt " in Europe and the USA ) is yoghurt from which the whey has been removed . It 's pretty thick and sometimes also referred to as " yoghurt cheese . " In India it 's used for example in the dessert <URL> , but if a recipe does n't specify that you should strain the yoghurt , you should assume it 's unstrained or briefly strained . Wikipedia <URL> : " In south Asia , regular unstrained yoghurt ( dahi ) , made from cow or water buffalo milk , is often sold in disposable clay pots . Kept for a couple of hours in its clay pot , some of the water evaporates through the clay 's pores . But true strained yoghurt ( chakka ) is made by draining dahi in a cloth . " Should you really only find strained yoghurt , you can probably just thin it back with water or milk . I should maybe add I do n't have first-hand experience with what yoghurt from India tastes like , but I 've observed that the ethnic shops in my area and one Indian take-away where I could peer into the kitchen all sell/use the exact same brand of yoghurt , which is an unstrained , set yoghurt with a mild ( not too sour ) taste .
Searing on a grill to " seal in juices " has largely been disproven . Meat loses juice at roughly the same speed regardless of searing the meat first . Searing does produce the Maillard reaction and caramelization which enhances flavor ; however , searing first does n't produce better results . A test performed by Alton Brown in 2008 demonstrated that searing at the end of the cooking process loses less water than searing at the beginning . For more information see <URL> . For the Alton Brown results see <URL> ( video ) .
See this <URL> page , it states that if not crumpled aluminum foils is generally safe , so make sure you do not crumple it . Then it says The USDA recommends that aluminum foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object , and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards . The <URL> states However , small pieces of aluminum foil can be used to " shield " areas of foods , such as poultry drumsticks and wings , to prevent overcooking . It also states General Rules for Safe Use of Aluminum Foil : Use new , smooth foil only . Wrinkled foil can cause arcing ( sparks ) . Cover no more than 1/4 of the food with foil . Shape the foil smoothly to the food so no edges stick out It makes no difference which side of foil ( shiny or dull ) is facing out . Do not place the foil closer than one inch from the oven walls . If the microwave oven has metal shelves OR a metal turntable , do n't microwave food in foil containers or metal pans , and do n't let foil used for shielding touch or be close to the shelves or turntable . If you see arcing ( sparks ) , immediately remove the foil shielding ; transfer frozen food from foil container to a microwave-safe utensil . My bolding . So make sure you only cover the top of the cup and make the foil smooth , do not crumple it and it should be safe . The reason to use this as stated in the blog is speed , a few minutes compared to much longer .
A few principles for re-heatable food that I 've found over the years : Things with or in sauces heat nicely Dry things do n't heat as well ( plain rice , for example ) Liquid distribution in the dish is important for even heating Dryer things like meats heat better when they have glazes or toppings ( keep steam in ) Things you can stir up mid-heat are nice for even heating Flavours improve over time , use this to make reheated dishes better Food continues to cook in the microwave ( and dry out ) , so avoid overcooked . This goes double for noodles ( nothing worse than mushy noodles ) Thickened sauces ( especially with flour ) reheat thicker than when cooked
If you 'd like to make something with cauliflower and/or broccoli , try this : trim and wash the florets ( keep the stems for something else if you like ) . Blanch them in boiling salted water for 3 or 4 minutes ( a little longer maybe for cauliflower ) . Drain them and dump them into some cold water , then drain them . Now ( or before now ) : get a heavy roasting pan ( like a big earthenware or cast iron lasagna pan , or something like that - the heavier the better ) hot in a 375 degree ( F ) oven . That should take about 15 or 20 minutes - we want it hot . Pull it out of the oven carefully , and then add some oil . Spread the oil around with a silicone brush or by tilting the pan ( carefully please ; do n't burn yourself and sue me ) and then add the drained broccoli/cauliflower . Sort-of toss those around ( if you 've got some spray olive oil , you can squirt them with that ) and then add kosher/sea salt and black pepper . Roast those in the oven for about 20 minutes , possibly tossing them around halfway through . Now what you 've got is the best tasting cauliflower/broccoli in the world . You can add those roasted florettes to a quiche or to a pot pie or to anything like that . I add thusly roasted cauliflower to Indian " dal " preparations and it 's awesome . Here 's another tip : if you want to add cubed potatoes but you do n't want them to turn to mush , try this . Cube the raw potatoes . Get some water warming on the stove , but when it 's still just warm ( less than 130 degrees F ) add the potatoes . Keep the fire on , but monitor the temperature very carefully . When the water gets up to 138 degrees F , drop the fire a lot and try to keep it at that temperature for about 10 minutes . After that , raise the fire and let the potatoes boil as you normally would . That trick will allow a natural enzyme in the potatoes to " firm up " the starch , and they 'll end up cooked but not mushy . You can then add them to your pot pie with the confidence that they 'll more-or-less hold together . ( Beets do this kind-of automatically ; it 's really hard to cook a beet until it 's mush . )
If you use your whole beans within a week it 's probably not worth storing it in the refrigerator or freezer . Coffee beans should be stored in a cool , dry place . They can last 1-3 weeks in your pantry . Ideally you should store them in an airtight opaque container . They degrade quickly in the presence of light , heat , or oxygen . If you want to store them longer , then they will last 3-4 month in the freezer . Source : <URL>
I 'm not so lucky as to be able to get whole raw milk & hellip ; Wait , then there 's a flaw in your premise . Check the label . Any milk treated using high-heat processes like UHT , pasteurization or ultra-pasteurized milk does n't sour like it used to in your grandmother 's days ; it spoils & hellip ; goes rotten . Spoiled milk is not the same as soured milk . The ultra-pasturized milk sold in the supermarket is essentially a dead product , with little to no live bacteria . When it goes bad , it rots and should be thrown out ( or you can <URL> with it ) . Modern industrial pasteurization kills the " good " bacteria that once made sour milk a wonderful thing for cooking and making bread and cheese . Substituting " Sour Milk " If you have a recipe calling for sour milk , put a teaspoon of vinegar in a cup of fresh milk and let it sit for a few minutes . That 's about the best you can do if you do not have access to raw milk .

Do I need to cook the meat filling before stuffing ravioli ?
Yes , cook the meat before stuffing into the ravioli . If you are worried about your mixture being too fatty ( which I did n't experience with a non-traditional beef and bacon ravioli ) , make sure to drain the meat well after cooking , perhaps patting it with clean paper towels to remove excess grease .
My opinion - I have n't done rigorous testing : Canning softens the interior of the peach but when I have ( in my laziness ) left the skins on they stay tough and quite unpleasant tasting . I doubt it has any effect on the longevity of the product but it would make it a little less pleasant and versatile .
Most people I know who cook scallops actually overcook them . I always buy sushi-grade diver 's scallops from my fishmonger . These can be eaten raw , and are most delicious when done so . However if you want to add a little extra flavor , and liven up the appearance of these then sear these briefly on a high heat . If you can get these from a quality source ( probably not a supermarket ) and you 're not hung up on eating raw/rare seafood you 'll never look back . Unless your scallops have been soaked in a brine , and you 're buying the quality scallops I recommend you do n't need to rinse them . Otherwise , rinse them thoroughly and pat dry with a paper towel . To sear these properly I simply melt a Tbsp or two of butter in a non-stick pan . I use as high a heat as possible ( med-high to high ) you want to put the scallops in just as the butter begins to barely smoke . I 've often seen people suggest using clarified butter , but I 'm too lazy to try . Place your scallops in the pan and cook them for 30-60 seconds per side . Do n't move them around in the pan , otherwise they wo n't sear as nicely . This is for scallops that are the size of a small childs fist . If you have smaller ones you might need to cook them less . Just a brief update because I feel I did n't stress this enough . Fresh , quality scallops are absolutely not intended to be cooked well done . They will be chewy , period . If you are used to them this way , well you 're really missing out .
The reason for doing delayed fermentation in the fridge is that the yeast development is slowed down , while still allowing the enzymes that naturally occur in the flour to do their work ( converting starches to sugars , making a more flavorful dough ) . The risk of doing it on the counter instead of the fridge is that the enzymes are working AND the yeast is working , which can over-leaven the bread , and they 'll eat up the sugars you are trying to create with enzymes . Over-leavened bread is n't ideal , but it is n't the end of the world either . There is a lot to learn about bread baking if you want to really excel at it , but " just bake it , it 'll be fine " is always present as you experiment - glad the loaf turned out well ! " No-Knead " bread is a great introduction to " rustic " doughs ( very high water content ) , and to cold fermentation . Cold fermentation is about the best thing you can do for your bread as a home baker , whether or not you are using the no-knead recipe - I cold ferment nearly everything I bake . If you want to learn more about the process and jump off the deep end , Peter Reinhart 's book " The Bread Baker 's Apprentice " is a great place to start . It is detailed without being pedantic , simple without being over-simplified , and oriented for the home baker without forgetting the reasons that professionals do things the way they do .
Nope . Haha :) Brining will give you a softer texture . I have brined duck for varying times ( depending on how much of a rush I was in ) and brining really does help with the texture . You can sear it beforehand , some Maillard reaction will help in flavour development , but when I cook sous vide for more than 8 hours , I do n't bother : the meat will go green/grey , which means I need to sear afterwards anyway . So I usually just sear at the end . If your meat does n't have that much fat , or anything to keep it moist , it can go dry . Adding some butter , or maybe rendered Wagyu fat in the case of your steak , might help . As for bacteria , the longer you cook sous vide , the more you kill off the nasties . It so happens that Douglas Baldwin has a short bit about flat iron steak : <URL> Hope that helps :)
Recipes for preserving tend to be very specific . They 're calibrated to balance factors like pH and sugar content in the final recipes , and of course to minimize the risk of spoilage . In general , you should always follow the steps as written in your recipe . What I 've generally observed is that jam-type recipes do n't always include the final boiling step because the jam is already cooked ( edit : and because <URL> , the sugar content is generally high enough to be inhospitable to bacteria ) . That differs from canning fresh fruits and vegetables which are largely raw . The purpose of the boiling step here is to kill off pathogens before they get a chance to settle in and spoil the contents , as no matter how well you clean them , there are likely to be some spores , bacteria , etc. remaining . Even a tiny initial population can grow and spoil your preserves over the length of time they 'll be put away . So , initial sterilization is always required to clean the jars themselves . The second boil <URL> the contents . If you 've already done this as part of your preparation , as with a jam , then it most likely is n't required . It probably wo n't hurt , especially if you plan to put up your jams for an extended period of time ( i.e. months or years ) but you 'll have to weigh the convenience of skipping that step against the potential risk of spoilage . That said , let me state again for the record that if your specific recipe says to include the final boil , then there 's likely a very good reason , and you should follow that instruction .
One kitchen I used to work in had a dry store that was basically a shed and in winter when the flour would be particularly cold we would always warm the flour before making bread . It always worked beautifully . The thing is you 're looking for the overall best temperature for your dough for the yeast to be active . So it 's no good mixing warmish water with cold flour - your dough temp will keep the yeast sluggish . That was our theory anyway .
Braising gently in milk will also , I find , help with bitterness . The radicchio becomes wonderfully succulent , very nice with a firm-fleshed fish .
This <URL> shows the technique very clearly . Place place the filet skin side down . Grasp the tail end , and slip your thin , flexible knife into the filet by the tail end , scraping against the skin , cutting down the length of the fish . Turn the fish over , and inspect . If any pieces remain , removing them is similar to removing the silverskin from a pork or beef tenderloin . Slip your knife under the end of the remnant , pulling the blade up against the skin and cutting down its length to remove . I recommend watching this video or others , because the technique is easier to see than understand from a written description .
It should be fine to use . It is probably dusty , perhaps greasy from other kitchen sources . If it 's self cleaning , go for it ( and avoid using any harsh cleaners ) It might get smoky at first , so you should have ventilation possible ( window , fan , or whatever ) If not self cleaning , give it a good wiping-out with an ammonia based cleaner or use commercial oven cleaner ( nasty stuff ) . If its possible that you have mice , you should probably make sure that they are n't nesting in the cabinet - get a technician if you are n't comfortable removing panels , etc. . And buy an oven thermometer to check the oven thermostat . Self-cleaning or not , it will probably be smoky at first . Good luck .
It 's not so much the taste as the texture . If they have n't been sauted first , the onions stay relatively crunchy during the rest of the cooking . The same is true of the garlic , but you 'd usually have cut the garlic into much smaller pieces so it does n't take as long to soften up , hence kicking the onion off first and adding the garlic a bit later .
Yes , it is true that we do n't add oil to the boiling water . I 'm not aware of any good reason to waste extra-virgin olive oil that way ! Some oil is always added at the end , over the sauce , when the pasta is already in the plate ! It has to be raw , so that it retains its fruit nuances and texture . If you are doing cold pasta salad and want to avoid sticky pasta , adding oil in advance wo n't help . You have instead to wash pasta under cold water to wash the starch away ( you can put the pasta in the colander directly under the running cold tap ) .
I take the question to mean how you can best preserve the fresh-made texture with microwaving ? I would make , cool and store ravioli in single layers on parchment/waxpaper in a container for transport . Separately , the sauce transported in largest microve-safe container that will fit in office micowave . Heat sauce to boiling then gently add in ravioli and continue to reheat on defrost if stirring would damage ravioli , or higher setting if you can stir halfway through time .
When cooking in a slow cooker , you do not have to precook the leeks . I made a potato leek soup not too long ago that called for throwing everything in the pot and it came out great . The only thing I cooked before hand was the bacon , rendering out much of the fat and giving the nice golden brown and crispy bits to sprinkle on top . You CAN precook anything to help reduce the cook time and I always sear meat , but unless you are going to caramelize the leeks , you will not notice any difference in flavor or texture . As for the pureeing part , you want to be careful pureeing potatoes as they can turn into a nasty gluey mess . Just keep it to a minimum or use a food mill and you should be fine . I typically just use a potato masher and leave my soup a little on the chunky side .
Honey , for me , makes zabaglione terribly heavy . However , you can buy Crumiel , a dehydrated honey product from the Texturas line by Albert and Ferran Adria . My understanding is that it can essentially be used as a substitute for sugar while retaining the honey flavour .
For baking potatoes Do n't just wash them , scrub them . Otherwise you 're eating dirt . No , that 's not a joke . Potatoes grow in dirt , and are usually sold coated with dirt . Yes , really . Either salt them and wrap them in tin-foil , or simply bake them on a bed of salt . Dessication of the skin is important . You 'll probably want to bake them longer and higher than most recipes say . I find 425F for 1 1/2 hours is optimal ( and 2 hours is fine ) . That results in skin which is dry , crispy , and slightly caramelized , while this inside still is fluffy ( albeit , according to some , overcooked ) .
I often use this technique at home to cook proteins . It shortens cooking time by using steam as a heat transfer medium to cook the top of the item at the same time as the bottom . You can also use this method on frittatas , dumplings , etc. . You can also use flavored liquids to impart flavor as well . I particularly like hard cider with chicken and pork .
One technique , but not the only , is velveting . Here the meat is tenderized in an egg-white/cornstarch mixture for 20 + minutes , then cooked briefly ( a minute ) in oil or simmering water with a small amount of oil prior to using in stir fries . I 've never velveted in straight oil but water/oil definitely gives the chicken that smoothness that Chinese Restaurants obtain and the shorter stir fry cooking time makes it much more tender . Super thin slicing ( you 'll need to cut the meat semi-frozen to get such thin slices ) , plus cutting across the grain also lead to tenderness .
It takes more heat/time to safely cook sausage than it does to fully cook eggs . This would be especially true for omelettes , where the egg is in contact with the hot pan , and the filling only warms indirectly . Add your expectation to start with cold sausage , and cooking the sausage and egg at the same time seems like a really bad idea . ( Yes , you could just cook the whole assembly longer , but you 'd end up with seriously vulcanized eggs . ) Be safe : cook the sausage , and then add the eggs .
Unless there is local regulation that requires labelling of items unsafe for raw consumption , the only 100 % sure way would be to ask the manufacturer . However , a non-perishable sauce being unsafe without being boiled , but safe if doing so ( just reheating will not matter much anyway ! ) , would be an odd enough ingredient that you could expect a warning on the label . If there was a severe risk of microbial problems , that would either spoil the sauce right in the bottle , or make it unsafe in a way that heat will not fix . Non-perishable but unsafe raw is more typical of DRY goods , since they can perfectly well harbor spores or small amount of bacteria without actively spoiling .

If you brine a chicken and then boil it in soup , how much salt , if any , will come out and go into the liquid ?
I 'm not exactly sure why you 're trying to brine then boil ; you should be able to simply boil your chicken in salty stock and get plenty of salt into it . It wo n't take nearly as long as brining , because things happen faster in boiling water . Assuming you boil for any significant length of time , much of the salt will indeed come out into the cooking liquid , and you 'll end up with your soup approximately as salty as the chicken . ( If the chicken is in large pieces , this of course only applies to the part the brining and cooking liquids can actually reach . )
Do n't wrap the chicken in foil . Instead you can use a steamer basket inserted in a pot with the lid on ( making sure your liquid does not touch the chicken ) and steam it that way . If you do n't have a steamer basket and what you are trying to do is replace one , instead of wrapping the chicken roll that foil into balls or strips and use it to elevate the chicken above the cooking liquid in your pot . If you wrap in foil , the chicken will be cooking via the heat transfer from the foil rather than from the steam .
That release of moisture is due to breakage of chicken 's cell structure , and further moisturing will not repair it - so it 's not about the pores , and there 's no " going back " from that state . Still , if You cook Your chicken in a liquid with agents that affect osmotic pressure ( salt , for example ) , it will lead to release of liquid through membranes , and further cooling will cause the reverse effect ( chcken absurbing released liquid ) . That 's why stew/soup-like dishes often taste better after cooling/reheating . Hope I got the point )
To toast walnuts , pecans , pistachios , macadamias , and other nuts , follow the same procedure as for toasting almonds : spread them in a single layer on a baking pan . Bake at 325F until they are light brown and fragrant , about 5-10 minutes depending on the amount of nuts . Check the nuts frequently and stir them to ensure even toasting . Always cool your nuts before chopping them . Nuts have a great deal of oil that has been brought to surface by the heat , and the oil must be allowed to be reabsorbed , or the nuts could turn greasy during chopping . ( information found at : <URL> )
I 'd deglaze the pan after each pan and transfer the juices to a small bowl to make a sauce I would wipe/clean ( no soap ) the pan after each batch . After the last batch , transfer the bowl content and make a sauce with the last pan drippings and what you already have .
I believe that I have made some of those conflicting comments . It is definitely possible to make an excellent pan gravy with the drippings from a brined turkey . It is also really easy to have the gravy turn out inedibly salty if you are n't careful . Make sure you follow the brining recipe . Do n't have too high a concentration of salt and do n't brine for too long . Rinse off the bird , inside and out , before roasting . I have also read , from reliable sources such as Harold McGee , that gravy is impossible . My own experience would suggest otherwise .
You will be fine . As the chicken softens , and with a bit of a stir , it will all get cooked . the steam and conductive heat will cook and keep safe even the minuscule portion above the water line .
Wilting in greens is triggered by temperature , pH , and salt content . To reduce wilting , you can cool the vegetables or shrimp , make the vegetables more acidic * , or decrease their salt content . My suggestion would be to cool the shrimp with an ice water bath or cold running water . This is the most traditional approach for shrimp salad . Alternately , you could apply an acidic dressing before topping , but wait to salt it until the shrimp have cooled to 140F . Alternately , wilting of vegetables adds a rather interesting variation in flavor or texture to a salad . This technique has been desirable and in vogue at various times . Why does this all happen ? Plant cells wilt when cooking breaks apart the cellulose-based cell walls , and allows water to escape , causing them to soften . To quote On Food and Cooking ( pp 282 ) : When the tissue reaches 140F/60C , the cell membranes are damaged , the cells lose water and deflate , and the tissue as a whole goes from firm and crisp to limp and flabby . Acids will impede wilting , because the cell walls are held together with hemicellulose , and it is " not very soluble in an acid environment " ( pp 282 ) . Table salt is a problem , because " its sodium ions displace the calcium ions that cross-link and anchor the cement molecules in the fruits and vegetable walls , thus breaking the cross-links and helping dissolve the hemicelluloses " ( pp 283 ) . Calcium has the opposite affect , so if you can use hard water or add calcium salts , do so . * Acidic solutions will reduce green colors ( On Food and Cooking , pp 280-281 ) , but preserve texture ( 282 ) .
You can put things in the cavity to help flavor the chicken as well . A bundle of fresh herbs , garlic , an onion , fresh fruit , etc. . Stuffing from a cavity is divine though , do n't knock it until you 've tried it !
Do n't worry about the pork contaminating the chicken , but rather vice versa . A good rule of thumb with chicken is to treat it as a biohazardius contaminant . Because it is . Salmonella is present IN chicken meat , unlike other meats where you will only find microbes on the surface . Your marinade does n't seem particularly inhospitable to pathogen growth , so cross contamination would be a nontrivial concern . OK , if you overcook your pork chops as some insist on doing , it should n't be much of a concern . However , may as well be safe and split the marinade between two ziploc bags . It 's a small effort to mitigate risk .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
Personally , I 've never made a dish that required greasing of the crockpot - even if it called for it , I 've ignored that step and had no problems . I can only imagine the step is added to ensure nothing sticks - but my crockpot ( and all others I 've seen ) are glazed porcelain or ceramic , and the recipes always include a liquid of some kind , so I do n't think that 's going to be a problem . If I were going to grease it , however , I 'd do it in the method you described , and use a very light touch .
The major difference between butter and oil is that butter is only 80 % oil , with the rest being milk solids and water ( <URL> ) . This means that using oil you will lose some of the water content that your cake should have , possibly resulting in a dryer cake . On the plus side , cakes made with oil tend to dry out slower than those made with butter . The other possible different , but one that is unlikely with a mix I 'd think , is that it depends on the method of mixing in your fat . If the butter is to be whipped or creamed while softened this creates a different texture than one you could get with oil or melted butter . Whipped butter or especially butter creamed with sugar provides a network of air bubbles that act as a raising agent during cooking , and the result is a pound cake like crumb . If your recipe calls for melted butter , though , this is not a concern - the result is more like a traditional muffin or quick bread crumb . Finally , a vegetable oil has a fairly neutral taste . Usually when a vegetable oil is called for , this is desirable . Butter on the other hand has a more interesting flavor . Your cake may be a bit bland without it .
Iodine is commonly added to table salt , hence the term " Iodized " . This is purely a public health issue , much like fluoridation of water . The human body needs small quantities of Iodine for good health , and salt was the method chosen to give it to us . Just as fluoride is added to water , and Vitamin D is added to milk . It actually has nothing to do with the product , it 's just a convenient carrier . See : <URL> for more information .
This step is not about food safety , it 's about consistency and in fact about three properties of your jam : Jam comes in a wide variation of consistencies , one parameter is " stiffness " , another " water content " and a third " smoothness " . In baking , you want smooth ( no lumps ) jam that is speadable enough to form a thin layer ( especially if used as a " glue " ) , yet thick enough not to " bleed " into your baked layers . What you basically do is play with the <URL> in your jam - a warm pectin solution ( aka jam ) is soft , cold pectin solution is solid , softening goes quickly , re-solidification takes some time . But enough " kitchen chemistry " , here 's the practical approach : Warming your jam makes it liquid enough to be easily spreadable and , if necessary , to strain out any lumps of fruit . Sometimes a good stir can give similar results , but stirred jam wo n't solidify again afterwards . Boiling the jam lets water evaporate , thus thickening or " hardening " the jam ( once it solidifies again ) . This can be advisable if you have a rather thin or soft ( " watery " ) jam in the beginning . Especially under marzipan you want no excess liquid in the jam to avoid softening the marzipan layer or cause it to slip . The boiling is optional , it needs some experience to determine whether it 's really necessary for the specific brand of jam and the specific use . Cooling down the jam again has two reasons : Not all baked goods take well to being drenched with hot liquid and the possible thickness of a layer is partly determined by the consistency of the jam . Especially sponges etc. tend to soak up liquid jam , resulting in a coloured stripe of dough instead of a distinct layer of jam . ( Note that there is also the technique of brushing hot baked goods like danishes with hot apricot jam for a glossy sheen , but that 's not what we are talking about here ) But you also do n't want to wait until the pectin has solidified the jam again , because then you would be back to square one . Depending on the intended use , you let the jam cool until it has reached the desired consistency - still rather liquid under marzipan ( as it will solidify on the cake quickly ) or almost solid but easily spreadable for a distinct layer in your sponge that still can hold the cake layers together . Note that most recipes say " cool " but not " cool completely " .
Yes , as you said , the increased surface area makes it go bad faster . Not only that , but bacteria on top of the meat can now go to the middle with little resistance . Consider the expiration date of ground beef and whole beef slabs . Pork tends to go bad faster than beef , and freshly butchered pig smells of feces ( especially right beneath the skin ) , but they still go bad faster .
I suppose that depends on what you 're defrosting it for . The microwave ( on low power ) is safe and quick . The downside is that you 're using a microwave , which means there 's a good chance you 'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process , and you 're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour . The lower the heat , the less the impact of this , but it 's still a problem . If I 'm preparing the meat for marinating , stir-fry , etc. , something with a powerful or thick sauce , then I would n't worry about it , but if it 's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning , you might want to avoid this . Running it under warm water would seem to work , but I 've found that it takes forever to defrost this way ( the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen ) , and you 're soaking it in the process . This really is n't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it . I would use the microwave if desperate , but it 's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or , if you 're in a bit of a hurry , the sink . It takes longer , but it 'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness . P.S. . One other word of advice : If you 're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced , it 's best not to defrost it all the way . It 's easier to cut when frozen , and will defrost very quickly once it 's in pieces . I 'm mainly talking about the breast here , this does n't work so well with meat stuck to bones . Update : I 'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something . Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be immediately cooked after defrosting and that the defrosting is done over a period shorter than 2 hours . Raw chicken must not be kept at any temperature above 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) for more than an hour or so . Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge . Definitely do n't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water . As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly ( up to an internal temperature of 165 ° F ) , you 're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning , even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today is contaminated , for the record . If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason , then you need to either thaw it very fast ( using the microwave ) or at a very low temperature ( using the refrigerator or cold running water ) .
If a magnet sticks to it , it 's ferrous . I 'd like to give a more elaborate answer , but there is n't anything more to it .
In most cases , curdling occurs because proteins in the sauce are denatured and bind up with each other forming clumps . In cooking , proteins are denatured by excessive heat , acid , salt , or enzymes . Heat and acid are the usual culprits for me . For example , when making a hollandaise sauce - the egg yolks are slowly cooked to allow them to set . In most recipes the lemon juice is added later . If the sauce is heated too abruptly or too high then the egg proteins will curdle . To prevent curdling you have a few options - Do n't expose the sauce to as much heat . Be careful to not overcook egg rich sauces . If possible add the protein rich ingredient later in the process - for example adding yogurt to a sauce just before serving . Heat the sauce gently . Heating too fast will also make proteins denature . Many sauces are cooked in a double boiler - not to keep the sauce from overheating but to ensure that it heats gently . Do n't expose the proteins to too much salt or acid . Dropping a couple tablespoons of lemon juice into warm milk is a recipe for paneer not sauce . Take out some insurance . Proteins bind with each other after denaturing when there are a large quantity of similar molecules all together . One solution then is to introduce a lot of dissimilar molecules that will interfere with the protein 's ability to bind to itself . Common candidates for this are starch or fat . It is difficult ( but not impossible ) to curdle the milk protein in cream based sauces with just heat because the high concentration of milk fat gets in the way . This is why reduction sauces can add cream to a very hot liquid and let it reduce . However , adding acid and heat can still be enough to curdle so be careful if your reduction sauce is very acidic . Many otherwise fragile sauce recipes will call for a little bit of corn starch as an insurance policy . In the related question that you posted - yogurt sauces are particularly susceptible to this because low-fat yogurt is very high in protein and low in fat , and starch .
I would shred one or both leaves ( depending on size ) and garnish the soup right before eating it .

First slicing , then cooking , or the other way around ?
With a gratin , the idea is that the vegetables ( traditionally just potatoes ) are sliced so thinly that they cook very easily in the cream/cooking liquid while retaining some texture . If you pre-cook the vegetables , they will just disintegrate into a mush during baking .
As your question stands , the possible answers are essentially : You used too much liquid or too little cornmeal . You did n't cook it long enough . You did n't cool it enough for it to firm up . Polenta is the sort of food that you should make by trusting your senses over a recipe . You should be able to tell , with a little bit of experience , whether it 's too thin and wet after cooking for it to set once it cools . If it is , you can cook it a bit longer on low heat to get more water out of it , and the next time you can compensate with more cornmeal or less liquid . Also , since I do n't know what recipe you used , do note that there are also recipes out there for soft polenta ( usually described as such ) , which is intended to be served soft , not cut .
Consider what the " no cheating " version of the ingredient is , and get the closest thing to that , that 's convenient enough for you . For things like garlic , ginger , etc. , the " no-cheating " version is to get the fresh ingredients and crush/grate them - what you end up with is a paste . The paste you can buy in jars is this stuff , with preservatives added to make them last . Some flavour will be lost . To make powder , the paste is dried , and more flavour is lost . But the powder will keep for a long time in the cupboard . Note that some spices take on different , desirable flavours when processed . Paprika powder has its own properties when compared to fresh paprika peppers . You 'd use fresh ginger in many curries , powdered ginger in many cakes , candied ginger in some other sweet dishes . Recipes will specify what to use . For things like black pepper , cumin , turmeric , coriander seeds , the " no-cheating " version is to get whole seeds , roast them and grind them in a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar . So buying the ready-ground version is only one step away from the ideal . Try grinding your own at least once . The extra depth and complexity of flavour is striking . But for convenience , ready-ground spices are fine . " Roasting " , for small quantities of whole dry spice , involves briefly heating them on a hot dry pan . It brings out spice flavours you do n't get from just frying or boiling the spice . Of course , it 's optional . Ground spices have a shorter shelf life than whole dry spices . If you open a jar of powdered spice and it does n't have a strong aroma , throw it away -- you might as well use dust . Whole spices have the aroma " locked away " , to be released when you grind . To make a paste , these are sometimes mixed with wet ingredients ( like garlic and ginger ) , water and oil . That 's the basis of the jars of " spice mix " you can buy in supermarkets . It 's also the first step in many curry recipes -- grind your spices , mix with oil to make a paste , and gently fry before adding the onions .
Usually it 's best to cook dried noodles in boiling water , and drain and rinse them in cold water when they are done . This does a couple of things : helps ensure that the noodle is equally cooked all the way through ( instead of getting overcooked on the outside by the time the centre is cooked ) . by using separate water , you do n't fill your broth with starch , which would adversely affect the taste , colour and consistency . If you want to add the noodles directly to the broth , I would recommend rinsing them in cold water first ( like you would with rice ) until the water runs clear . This will prevent excess starch from being added to your dish . You could also try adding a stock cube to the water that you boil the noodles in , if your goal is simply to make the noodles more flavourful .
More sodastream bottles is the best option if you are starting from a sodastream . The best other alternative is to act just like a really old-fashioned soda counter . Mix and store your syrups/flavors . Measure syrup into the glass . Add plain soda-water and mix . Thus , your sodastream bottle only ever has plain carbonated water in it , not a specific flavor .
To further add to this . Here 's an explanation from the Chefsteps site on brining The Effects of Brining Charged chloride ions from the dissolved salt in a brine will repel , destabilize , and unravel various proteins within the muscle fibers of meats and seafood . This is not altogether different than what cooking with heat also does to these proteins . The combination of dissolved salt and heat combine to increase the juiciness of flesh by drawing water in during brining and squeezing less of it out during cooking . Brined foods that are cooked have a telltale texture because the combination of salt and heat creates a firmer , more elastic gel than heating does alone . But avoid overdoing it , otherwise the flesh can become too firm and chewy , as well as too salty . <URL>
If you are only using it three times a month then this 25lbs bag may last a very long time indeed . The problem is that even white rice can eventually develop off flavors when exposed to light and air . Additionally - even if pests do n't have access to the rice , it is not unlikely that the rice has some eggs on it that can hatch and spoil the whole bag . The solutions to these problems all make it difficult to use the rice in the short term . For long-term food storage dry foods are typically sealed in either # 10 cans or mylar bags . An oxygen absorbing packet is also included . This will prevent spoilage and pest growth . Mylar bags are less expensive and you can open one bag at a time for short term use . Alternatively - if you can freeze the rice to ensure there are no pests then the rice can be stored , sealed , in a cool , dry place as others have described . Given how cheap rice is - it might be acceptable to you to just take your chances and replace it if it spoils after some months .
First off , when reheating soup , it wo n't matter much . If you get the pan too hot before you add the soup , you could get some spattering , but that 's about it . As for making a fresh batch , there are those who believe that browning the ingredients before adding the liquids will develop more flavor . This will be a lot easier to do with a hot pan , than trying to get a cold pan full of stuff up to a heat sufficient to cause browning . Overall , it 's a tradeoff . If you 're in a hurry , it might be worth saving the few minutes to just throw everything in the pan and heat it up . If you really want to develop every last bit of flavor , you 'll probably be better off heating your pan , browning ingredients , then adding liquid .
It 's definitely a sign that the oven is cooking too hot somewhere ; the under-done tops and middles are the give-away . I suspect your oven has a malfunctioning thermostat , which is quite common . Try setting temperatures 50 degrees below suggested , and see if it solves the problems . Failing this , purchase an oven thermometer to check it . Another possibility is that there is poor airflow within the oven . In this case , hot air is heating the bottom of the pan , but can not get around the edges of the pan to heat the top of the baked good . The solution to this is usually to use a smaller pan , and ensure only one pan at a time is loaded into the oven . My oven has problems of this nature when I try to bake in both racks with half sheet pans .
Oil is dry heat because oil contains no water . Wine does . The " moist " in moist heat really means water . In moist heat cooking , water acts as a solvent and actually dissolves much of the solid matter in the food - hence the reason why steaming and boiling tend to make food rather soft or even soggy . Oil , on the other hand , is very rarely a solvent . There are certain food compounds that are fat-soluble , but most are water-soluble and oil , being <URL> , actually blocks any contact with water , thus preventing any dissolution , and generally making the food crispier as well as promoting the <URL> ( which can only occur with dry heat , due to the low boiling point of water ) . It may seem counterintuitive , but oil is n't wet . It just looks that way .
Either would be safe . You will get better quality by freezing them uncooked . They should not get soggy due to the freezing , as neither the meat filling , nor the wrappers , are particularly subject to ice crystal damage . Gyoza are very small , so you should not need to thaw them : just begin the steaming phase right out of the freezer , and they will thaw while cooking . If you do wish to thaw them , do it in the refrigerator and they will be perfectly safe , despite the raw filling . You are correct that if you freeze them after cooking , you will loose the crispy bottoms -- this would be true if you save them as left overs in the refrigerator as well .
There are a variety of ways to make yogurt . One that might be " easy " would to use a thermal cooker ( giant thermos flask ) if you happen to already have one , which would be under the " maintain temperature " ( actually temperature will fall , but slowly ) classification - but if you already have one , it 's no extra cost or equipment needed . Others have a thermostat and heater , but it 's rarely an adjustable thermostat . I am currently using a dehydrator which is adjustable as my temperature control device ; I have in the past used an oven with a standing pilot light ( not adjustable , but a good temperature . ) Regardless of which type you use , you need to cool the milk ( after scalding ) to 35-40c before adding the yogurt culture ( a small amount of any yogurt with live culture ) or you will kill the culture - so you ca n't just dump 80C milk into " whatever " and expect yogurt , regardless of temperature controls or lack of temperature controls . My research and personal testing W.R.T. the tradeoffs of time and temperature has lead me closer to 35C ( for up to 24 hours ) than 40C as a default setting . On the other hand , some go as high as 45C .
What I do is use a big plastic bowl . The bowl is about 18 " in diameter at the top and holds about 2 gallons of water . I fill the bowl about 1/2 to 2/3 full of blueberries and then fill it to the brim with water and leave the water running into it . As the bowl is filling and when it 's full I gently agitate the berries with my hands . Most of the chaff naturally floats to the top and spills over the edge of the bowl . As I agitate the berries , I also try to direct any leaves to the edge and pull any berries back from the edge . I lose a few good berries , but not too many and since I 'm dealing with a lot of them I do n't worry about it too much . As I 'm agitating the berries , I can feel a lot of the squishy ones and pull them out to look at them and discard if they 're too far gone . When most of the chaff is gone , I dump the berries into a colander and let them drain . I 've tried spinning them in a salad spinner , but for the amount of berries I 'm trying to process , I 've found that in order to remove any appreciable amount of water I can only put a small amount at a time in the spinner so it takes forever to spin them all . So I let them drain , and then since I 'm usually freezing these berries , I put some paper towels down on a tray and spread out a layer of berries . When they 're spread out I can pick out most of the squished or shriveled ones that I missed earlier , then I pull the paper towels out and freeze them . I have n't ever looked for one , but I 've always wondered if there 's such a thing as a colander or sieve or screen with really big holes - i.e. just slightly smaller than a blueberry - that I could just dump the berries into and rinse off all the debris . One big limitation to this technique is that it bogs down if you 're dealing with less than fresh berries . Picking out all the squished or moldy ones if they 've been sitting around too long is problematic .
I think this is a problem with all oils . When something burns , it produces smoke . Smoke is generally indicative of something that is n't particularly good for us if inhaled . Same holds for oils . It seems that all oils will begin to produce toxins once they hit their smoke point . However , before that , they are completely fine . So pick an oil that will handle the temperature you 're using by checking the <URL> . There 's also a difference between producing toxins and toxic . Does burning oil produce toxins ? Yes . Will that actually make you sick ? I do n't know . But my inclination is that it 's unlikely to cause you harm under " normal " usage or else we 'd be hearing about people actually getting sick from burning their oil rather than just getting scare stories on the news about free radicals . And to get very sciency ( stop reading immediately if your eyes glaze over , I think that 's a sign of toxicity ) , from <URL> : Researchers investigated processes of oxidative degradation - notably that caused at 70 ° C with ventilation - of a broad group of oils with very wide-ranging compositions . Another degradation process studied was that which is caused by microwave action that does not heat greater than a temperature of 190 ° C . In both processes deterioration of the oils takes place . In the first type of process ( 70 ° C with ventilation ) hydroperoxides are first produced and subsequently aldehydes . In the second kind of process ( microwave ) it is basically aldehydes produced . It has to be pointed out that both the oxidative conditions and the composition of the oil determined the velocity of the degradation and both the nature and concentration of the compounds produced . These studies have shown , for the first time , that degradation of lipids in foods can produce toxic oxygenated aldehydes . These compounds , well-known in medical studies for their geno - and cytotoxic activity , considered as markers of oxidative stress in cells as well as being causal agents of degenerative illnesses , had not previously been detected in foodstuffs . Researchers have shown that some oils produce these toxic substances in greater quantities and at a greater rate . Virgin olive oil was , amongst all the oils studied , that which took longer to produce this type of compounds and produced a lower concentration of them .
Batter for pancakes is often nicer if it is left in the fridge for a few hours . I 'd make them fresh tonight with the batter you 're making for the couple you want now . Enjoy !
In general lard can always be substituted for butter , but you will not get the same flavour , obviously . Lard is perhaps a bit more ' savoury ' than butter , so it may be worth trying a pie out just to see if it works with a sweet filling . You should be able to convert straight from butter to lard . Another alternative is vegetable shortening , which you can use in all kinds of baking .
Red bell peppers freeze really well after being roasted . This is the method I would recommend for you . The problem with freezing first is that it can degrade the peppers ( breaks the firm cell walls ) and would likely make them more difficult to roast afterwards . If you roast them first , the cooking starts the cell collapse itself and the peppers do n't tend to degrade more afterwards , plus your peppers are already roasted , so you 've saved yourself that step in your pasta making process . The process is pretty simple ... roast as usual , parcel into recipe-sized portions in small zip top bags ( do n't forget to date the bags ) and freeze or roast , put on a cookie sheet ( if you have one that fits in the freezer ) , and freeze in a single layer . Once frozen , they can all go in one big bag and they should n't stick to each other too badly . <URL> that explains the process with some roasting tips . And another <URL> .
Several sources as <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> practically insist that you salt steaks before cooking them . I do n't think McGee experiments with or discusses exactly when to season/salt a steak in his books , but <URL> that he is also in favour of pre-salting . The fact that so many people seem to prefer this technique would seem to indicate that there 's at least some merit to it , even if the science is n't well-understood . All of the arguments I 've heard against salting steak ( or beef in general ) before cooking seem to be <URL> in nature . When pressed for an explanation , many of these people claim that the salt draws out moisture which will subsequently dry out the cut . In practice , the amount of moisture it draws out is practically negligible unless you actually cure it , which means using lots of salt and letting it sit that way for a long time . I do n't know anybody that does this . Well , <URL> ( warning : do not follow the advice on that page unless you are fully prepared to ruin a perfectly good steak ) . When pressed , most of these people ( including Anita Lo , above ) say that the water it draws out to the surface will inhibit the <URL> . This is true - the presence of water does inhibit the Maillard reaction and any significant quantity of water will give you a steamed gray steak instead of a delicious seared brown one . But the key word here is significant . No reasonable amount of seasoning will draw out so much moisture that you actually end up with a puddle of boiling water underneath the steak , and even if it did , you would simply pat the steak dry before searing it . You do pat your steaks dry , do n't you ? Also note that this applies to dry seasoning . When marinating a cut of beef it is another story entirely . Salt in a marinade really does create brining and that will tend to make the meat juicier . When meat brines , it absorbs extra moisture - the meat still loses moisture when cooked but the added moisture from the brine helps to offset it ( this , again , is all in McGee ) . A saline solution also dissolves a portion of the tougher proteins in the meat , resulting in a more tender result . Salt is a great thing to have in a marinade , which is why some of the simplest of marinades - soy or teriyaki sauce - are so effective . Just , again , make sure to pat that beef dry before pan-searing it if you want to get any sort of browning going on . Anecdotally - for what little that 's worth - I find that there 's very little difference in tenderness whether seasoning with salt briefly before or shortly after cooking ( before resting ) . I 've done both and I honestly do n't think I could identify which was which in a blind test , except perhaps for the consistency of the " crust " that forms when you really pile on the salt - this is a favourable result for many , and I 'll often do this if I 'm in the mood . But all in all , the scientific data on this subject is scant ; the results are very inconclusive . And it just does n't matter that much ; the debaters seem to put entirely too much emphasis on this point when there are far more important factors in preparing a great steak or roast , such as additional seasonings , what it 's seared in , temperature and heat distribution of the pan , and let 's not forget the cut and grade of meat . These things have profound effects on the final result , and if I were obsessive about beef to a fault , then I would concentrate my efforts more on finding better quality ingredients and equipment rather than fussing over the salt issue .
Golden Syrup improves with age according to Heston Blumenthal 's " In Search of Perfection " . Here he analyses a 70 year old glass jar of Tate and Lyle Gold in the lab finding that the " older treacle contained the same flavour compounds as the normal stuff , but each was intensified " . In his recipe he fakes the ageing process by baking the tin at 70ºC ( 158ºF ) for 24 hours noting that the flavour will continue to improve up to 100 hours .
Frying the chicken tends to set the muscle fibers by drawing moisture out . An example of this would be taking a thin ( 1cm ) cutlet and frying it until both sides start to turn golden . It will be pretty dry and hard . Pressure cooking it on the other hand tends to soften the muscle fibers without drawing moisture in ( if anything , its putting moisture in ) . So , ideally , you should boil/pressure cook your chicken prior to frying in oil ( though do make sure to drain the chicken first to prevent splatters ! ) . Additionally , you should undercook the chicken slightly in the pressure cooker since you 'll be finishing it in the fryer . If you are broasting the chicken , then you are going about the recipe incorrectly by frying then pressure cooking it . When broasting , you should pressure fry - if that makes sense .

Browning beef for beef stew ?
The idea is to brown the outside of the meat in order to develop the flavour via the <URL> . This flavour will add to the richness and meatiness of the stew as a whole . Go ahead and give it a good crust . Do n't overcrowd the pan or you will just end up steaming the meat in its own juices and it will never brown up : fry it in small batches instead . Two hours braising in the stewing liquid will easily be enough to cook one-inch cubes of beef all the way through and will easily see off most nasty stuff .
Bolted lettuce tastes bitter ; I 'd suggest putting it in your compost pile if you have one . Of course , if you like bitter greens , you could make a salad of your lettuce ( perhaps with a mix of other greens ) with some dried fruit , toasted nuts , and a little goat cheese ; the flavors might marry well .
It is an excellent book . I pretty much learned how to cook out of it . All the recipes are wonderful . My favorite thing about it is the discussion of what else they tried in order to get to a particular recipe . Finding out what did n't work about a recipe and why you 're doing things the way you are has taught me more about cooking than any other single source . There are no pictures , if that 's your thing . But I do n't really find them necessary . The book has tons of standard recipes and is well organized . I highly recommend this book to everyone ... ... except you . Actually , that 's not entirely true , but the book has a strong meat focus . I do n't know what the standard is for a vegetarian to buy an omnivore cookbook , but I 'd guess that at least half the stuff in this one has meat . If you 're comfortable subbing out ingredients and ignoring large portions of the book , then it 's great . But you will need to ignore quite a lot of it .
Rendered beef fat can be used in a lot of ways . You can use it in place of oil in a lot of recipes , but finding out which ones you like will take some experimenting . Around our house , I use rendered fat from beef or bacon in place of oil when sautéing , for example with onions and peppers , garlic or mushrooms . I 've also used it to add some kick to gravies . You could use it to pop popcorn , which I 've heard is delicious but unfortunately have never tried . I 've had <URL> made with beef fat , and they were delicious . Mashed potatoes as well . As far as fat ratio goes , it 's better than butter , but not as good as other fats . Beef fat has a high smoke point and is suitable for frying . The table below is based off of 1 tablespoon . Ratio means saturated to unsaturated . Smoke point can vary depending on a lot of factors ( olive oil <URL> from 300 when unrefined , to <URL> depending on quality ) but the table below should be a good guide . For the oils , I took the refined numbers . sat mono poly ratio smoke Canola Oil 0.9 8.2 4.1 1:12 470 & deg ; F Olive Oil 1.8 10.0 1.2 2:11 450 & deg ; F Chicken Fat 3.8 5.7 2.6 1:2 375 & deg ; F Duck Fat 4.3 6.3 1.7 1:2 375 & deg ; F Lard ( pork fat ) 5.0 5.8 1.4 5:7 365 & deg ; F Beef Tallow 6.4 5.4 0.5 1:1 400 & deg ; F Butter 7.2 3.3 0.5 7:4 350 & deg ; F ( <URL> ) ( <URL> ) A lot of people mix it into their dog 's food , or use it to feed birds .

Yes , you can freeze stew . You may find that the vegetables are a bit softer or broken into smaller pieces after thawing . If you used a thickening agent ( flour , cornstarch ) , it may separate as it thaws in the refrigerator overnight . To remedy that , remove a bit of the liquid , simmer with a bit more thickener and whisk so that it stabilizes . Then , gently stir into the stew as you reheat it . And , you 're correct , ' do n't refreeze ' applies to the raw meat , not to when it has been cooked .
I believe it 's another name for the tenderloin . <URL> Also , if you check out this other fillet of beef recipe from the same show : <URL> You can see a much better picture of the meat . That one is clearly a tenderloin . So The Fillet Mignon is part of that technically ...
I found a link that will provide the explanation you are looking for : <URL> Here is a direct quote from the site : Masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater ( cal ) , soaked overnight , and then ground up while still wet . Sold in this form , it 's called fresh masa , and it makes the lightest , fluffiest tamales . In Mexico , it can be purchased at tortilla factories in two ways : with smooth consistency for making tortillas and , upon request ( if you are lucky ) , with a coarser consistency for making tamales . ( Be careful to differentiate between masa para tamales and masa preparada para tamales ; the latter , available at some tortilla factories and large Mexican groceries , is the coarse-textured masa mixed with lard and flavorings .
One potential downside to this method is that with a thick coat of flour , you 're mostly browning the flour , not the meat , and thus possibly creating different flavor compounds than if you were searing the meat directly . <URL> are <URL> . If you 're doing this , you should probably shake off excess flour to leave a very thin layer so that you still get browning on the meat itself . The related problem is that you 're less able to accurately measure the amount of flour , less able to make sure it 's easily browned , and thus less able to control the overall balance of thickening power and flavor it contributes . Roux ( flour cooked in oil as a base for sauces ) <URL> , but <URL> as it cooks . You could monitor this over the surface of your meat , but that goes against the typical wisdom of not moving meat around the pan as it browns - that is , you ca n't see how browned the floury surface is getting when it 's face-down . Personally , I 'd prefer tighter control over both of these processes over the convenience gained by browning the meat and flour together . You can easily brown the meat , remove it from the pan , then add the flour and some additional oil to create a separate roux without losing much time . A slurry will work too , but takes plenty of cooking before it loses its raw , grainy flavor .
Since ovens cook by heat radiation , you want to expose as high a proportion of the surface area as possible , which is why most roasts are vaguely cubic or cylindrical in shape . Any part of the meat that 's pressed against the pan ( i.e. the bottom of the roast ) is n't going to get that nice brown crust . It 's also very important with slow-cooking methods that require you to put some liquid at the bottom of the vessel ; obviously you want as little of the meat as possible to be in the water , so that most of the work is done by steam . Tying ( or more accurately , trussing ) the meat is simply how you maintain the shape in the oven . If you do n't truss it , then you 'll not only end up with a very flat roast , you 'll also end up with uneven cooking , and only the top will be browned since there are no " sides " to speak of . It 's similar with chicken and other birds ; you truss the legs so that the oven has a chance to crisp them up on all sides , not just the top .
If you 're cooking low and slow , with enough liquid , you 'll end up with a style of stew called ragoût . The trick is to not add the vegetables during the cooking , unless they 're either something that you want to break down , or you 've added enough acid to the cooking liquid to prevent onions and potatoes from fully disintegrating . Personally , I prefer to take pot-roast to this stage , as it 's what I grew up with . You might not get the ' cooked to rags ' quality of the meat , as you may not have agitated the meat before cooling . In the Good Eats episode ' Stew Romanace ' , <URL> . It 's possible that this might happen in your case ( although in his , he drains the liquid before cooling ) .
You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders . It 's just the cooking times are shorter , that 's all . Set your oven to 250-275F , and roast those ribs until they 're done . I 've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours , but as many as 5 . Optionally , you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook , with some liquid in the foil pack . Just be aware that they 'll cook faster if they 're foiled . And depending on your preference , you may want to take them out of the foil to finish them .
Pretty much no , they are totally non-alike . The beauty of brisket is that it is full of connective tissue and other odd stuff that translates to succulence when cooked low and slow . Round is pretty much the opposite , it has very little in the way of interest .
Your assumption that there is nothing living inside the package is incorrect . Food irradiation does not sterilise the food . It is very , but not totally effective . Therefore , given enough time , the meat will still spoil . Irradiation does effect the quality of the food , so I imagine a balance needs to be struck between safety and quality .
Several sources as <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> practically insist that you salt steaks before cooking them . I do n't think McGee experiments with or discusses exactly when to season/salt a steak in his books , but <URL> that he is also in favour of pre-salting . The fact that so many people seem to prefer this technique would seem to indicate that there 's at least some merit to it , even if the science is n't well-understood . All of the arguments I 've heard against salting steak ( or beef in general ) before cooking seem to be <URL> in nature . When pressed for an explanation , many of these people claim that the salt draws out moisture which will subsequently dry out the cut . In practice , the amount of moisture it draws out is practically negligible unless you actually cure it , which means using lots of salt and letting it sit that way for a long time . I do n't know anybody that does this . Well , <URL> ( warning : do not follow the advice on that page unless you are fully prepared to ruin a perfectly good steak ) . When pressed , most of these people ( including Anita Lo , above ) say that the water it draws out to the surface will inhibit the <URL> . This is true - the presence of water does inhibit the Maillard reaction and any significant quantity of water will give you a steamed gray steak instead of a delicious seared brown one . But the key word here is significant . No reasonable amount of seasoning will draw out so much moisture that you actually end up with a puddle of boiling water underneath the steak , and even if it did , you would simply pat the steak dry before searing it . You do pat your steaks dry , do n't you ? Also note that this applies to dry seasoning . When marinating a cut of beef it is another story entirely . Salt in a marinade really does create brining and that will tend to make the meat juicier . When meat brines , it absorbs extra moisture - the meat still loses moisture when cooked but the added moisture from the brine helps to offset it ( this , again , is all in McGee ) . A saline solution also dissolves a portion of the tougher proteins in the meat , resulting in a more tender result . Salt is a great thing to have in a marinade , which is why some of the simplest of marinades - soy or teriyaki sauce - are so effective . Just , again , make sure to pat that beef dry before pan-searing it if you want to get any sort of browning going on . Anecdotally - for what little that 's worth - I find that there 's very little difference in tenderness whether seasoning with salt briefly before or shortly after cooking ( before resting ) . I 've done both and I honestly do n't think I could identify which was which in a blind test , except perhaps for the consistency of the " crust " that forms when you really pile on the salt - this is a favourable result for many , and I 'll often do this if I 'm in the mood . But all in all , the scientific data on this subject is scant ; the results are very inconclusive . And it just does n't matter that much ; the debaters seem to put entirely too much emphasis on this point when there are far more important factors in preparing a great steak or roast , such as additional seasonings , what it 's seared in , temperature and heat distribution of the pan , and let 's not forget the cut and grade of meat . These things have profound effects on the final result , and if I were obsessive about beef to a fault , then I would concentrate my efforts more on finding better quality ingredients and equipment rather than fussing over the salt issue .
As a substitute for untoasted sesame oil , most light oils will work ( light olive , peanut , canola , sunflower , etc ) . Any nut or seed oil should be pretty close . Toasted sesame oil has a much bolder and nuttier flavor . It could perhaps be approximated with a light oil and adding toasted sesame to your dish .
You want to use an oil that will handle the hotter temperatures of a wok . This <URL> suggests that most refined oils will work fine . Do n't use unrefined oils or butter because they 'll burn . Once you 've got an oil that will handle the heat , you want something that will taste good . I think that 's the main issue with olive oil . There are n't olives in asian cuisine and I think that would taste a bit funny . I tend to use vegetable or canola oil for the majority of my stir-frying and then add a little sesame oil towards the end ( generally when sauteing garlic and ginger ) . The sesame oil adds a strong asian flavor to the food . I 've tried just using sesame oil , as a recipe sometimes recomends , but I find the flavor overpowering . Unrefined sesame oil is fairly common at the grocery store , and you do n't want to use that as it will burn in the wok ( but it could be drizzled on the food after cooking ) .
To some extent , this is a question to which the answers are necessarily quite subjective . However , as a general guideline , I would suggest that you look at the bread as just another ingredient in the dish -- not as somehow distinct from the filling choices . Like any other ingredient pairing , you can evaluate the characteristics and choose things to complement each other . So if you pick your bread first , evaluate if it 's rich or mild , savoury or sweet , dense or light , crusty or soft , thin or thick , etc , and then choose fillings to complement those properties . For your fillings , there 's not only the flavour pairing of the filling and the bread to consider , but also the texture/properties of the filling . A dry filling might not be as pleasant on a dense bread because the texture would be too much the same . Similarly , a saucy filling needs an appropriate bread selection to contain it and make it easy to eat . Many pairings that are considered standard will just taste " good " to us because of tradition and familiarity , but originally , someone probably put them together for a reason . That does n't mean it 's not worth trying something different , though . With the globalization of cuisine , we have many more filling/bread choices available and you might find a new favourite by pairing a bread from one culture with a filling from another , based on their complementary qualities .
If you use self-made beef stock , try boiling a bit longer , so that the flavour of the beef is a bit more concentrated . Boil your soup a bit longer . Use more beef stock and/or cubed beef . I do n't know how much herbs you put in . Maybe a bit more pepper or rosemary can make a difference .
Generally speaking when speaking of " stew beef " , the meat will break down more the longer you cook it . I often make shredded beef for tacos out of that cut by simmmering it for a few hours or more . At 1 hour , I 'd say it was undercooked . For example : <URL> In there he recommends using stewing beef , browning it first and then " ... stew until the meat is tender and can be cut with a spoon . This will take at least an hour and a half . "
I 'm not going to comment on whether or not it is safe , because that could be any number of issues other than the brown coloring of the meat . However , the brown in and of itself is not an issue . When meat is exposed to air it turns a brown color . This does not effect the falvor of the meat , but the color turns a lot of people off . Grocery stores will actually throw this meat away , not because it is bad but just because people wo n't buy it . Terribly wasteful . From the <URL> : Optimum surface color of fresh meat ( i.e. , cherry-red for beef ; dark cherry-red for lamb ; grayish-pink for pork ; and pale pink for veal ) is highly unstable and short-lived . When meat is fresh and protected from contact with air ( such as in vacuum packages ) , it has the purple-red color that comes from myoglobin , one of the two key pigments responsible for the color of meat . When exposed to air , myoglobin forms the pigment , oxymyoglobin , which gives meat a pleasingly cherry-red color . The use of a plastic wrap that allows oxygen to pass through it helps ensure that the cut meats will retain this bright red color . However , exposure to store lighting as well as the continued contact of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin with oxygen leads to the formation of metmyoglobin , a pigment that turns meat brownish-red . This color change alone does not mean the product is spoiled

How do I make my bread/buns super soft ?
Soft bread is soft because CO2 produced by yeast and water that gets turned to steam by the baking process gets trapped into pockets by a mesh of gluten , causing the dough to expand . The dough then solidifies , keeping its shape . If your bread is not soft then it has n't expanded enough for one or more reasons : Dough too dry : as much as the yeast , water is responsible for getting a good rise in your bread . Gluten requires moisture to relax and stretch , forming the structure that traps the air that causes a rise , dough that is too dry wo n't form good gluten . Also , dough that is too dry wo n't have the elasticity to rise . Yeast needs water to do its work , dough that is too dry will inhibit the yeast . Also , the expansion of water into steam is as important for a good rise as yeast . If there 's one mistake many bakers make ( including myself for years ) it is making dough too dry . Yeast inactive or inhibited : if your yeast is old , came into contact with salt , or does n't have enough water to work then your yeast wo n't work well for you . Yeast does several things for you : it converts sugar into CO2 causing a rise , it improves the structure of your dough , and it adds flavor . Put the salt on the opposite side of the bowl from the yeast to avoid inhibiting it . Also , adding the yeast to sugary water does n't work well , especially with more modern yeasts . Just get quick acting yeast and add it to the flour bowl , then add water to that . The dough is not worked ( kneaded ) enough : Kneading improves the structure of your dough by stretching gluten molecules and getting them to link together , making your dough stretchy and pliable , and forming a structure that will trap air for a rise . Under-worked dough wo n't have enough structure the dough has been worked too much : as a home baker using hands this is unlikely , but still possible . Once you have the structure of the dough you need , stop and let it rise as any further working will form too much of a structure , making it too strong to expand Dough under-risen : the times in baking recipes are just guidelines , you need to go for a result rather than a time . I 've had books say 45 minutes but it takes 3 hours , especially if my yeast was old Dough over-risen : if your dough rises too long the yeast will exhaust the sugars in the dough and die out , leading to the loss of all the air . This will make the dough dense . For a nice soft sandwich bread I start with a really sticky dough . I then use it 's stickiness to stretch the dough , smearing it all over the countertop and using a pastry scraper to bring it back together . This is a really quick way to build some gluten . Then I knead in flour bit by bit , kneading for at least 1 minute between adding flour until I have a soft dough that still sticks a bit to the counter . That stickiness means that there 's enough moisture in the dough . I 'll add a bit more flour to that and then stop adding flour to avoid drying the dough . If I want to knead it more I 'll knead with a bit of vegetable oil instead to keep it from sticking . It 's consistency you 're looking for , not time . Time is relative depending on your strength and kneading technique , 5 minutes for a skilled and strong baker may translate to 15 minutes for normal humans , so knead until you have the consistency you want . When you start kneading the dough it will pull into pieces easily , and have a rough texture . As you knead that roughness disappears and it will stretch longer without breaking . For a sandwich loaf I 'll knead until I can stretch the dough from the middle of my torso to my knee without it breaking . Next , rising your dough may take much longer than recipes say as it all depends on the ambient temperature of the room , humidity , the activity of the yeast , and other factors . Again , make this results driven , not time driven . A good sandwich bread dough should rise a lot , not the " doubled " many recipes say . For me tripled is more like it . Make sure you put it in a big enough bowl ! This advice goes for the initial as well as the secondary rise in the pans . Let it rise enough in the pans until it looks like the recipe picture , that 's about right . Ideally your oven will have been pre-heating for 30 minutes by now . Now , slash your loaves the long way with a razor blade like a carpet knife , about 1/2 an inch down . Do it quick and avoid punching down the dough . Slashing will split the top skin and allow the dough to rise efficiently after you put it into the oven . Once you put it in the oven it 's going to rise a lot as the yeast goes crazy before the heat kills it , and the moisture in the dough is going to vaporize into steam . If you do n't slash you wo n't get as good a rise .
Real cheese crackers are always going to be a little greasy . You can reduce this by using a lower fat cheese like mozzarella . I think you 'd benefit by adding some flour to absorb some of the oil . Try starting with a 1/4 to 1/3 ratio of flour to cheese . From what I understand , whole wheat , whole grain , and oat flour are much more friendly to diabetics . You could even try something exotic like mesquite or yellow pea flour .
Yes , you can refrigerate after the machine has kneaded the dough . Cover the bowl tightly . In the morning , take the dough out of the fridge and let it ' wake up ' in a warm place for an hour , cut and shape , then either prove them again or bake straight away ( a second prove will give you a lighter texture ) .
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .
We have been eating turkey burgers for years . The super secret is to not let them dry out while cooling . I take a pound of ground turkey , mixed 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce , 1/2 teaspoon salt , 2 shakes garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of water . Then mix thoroughly by hand . After patty-ing them to 1/4 inch thick patties , I grill for about 5-6 minutes per side , turning a quarter turn at 2-3 minutes . After removing from grill , I wrap in foil and let sit for 5-10 minutes . Voila !
The tangzhong is composed mainly of gelated starches . According to Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " During the baking of bread and cakes , the starch granules absorb water , swell , and set to form the rigid bulk of the walls that surround the bubbles of carbon dioxide . At the same time their swollen rigidity stops the expansion of the bubbles and so forces the water vapor inside to pop the bubbles and escape , turning the foam of separate bubbles into a continuous spongy network of connected holes . If this did n't happen , then at the end of baking the cool - ing water vapor would contract and cause the bread or cake to collapse . In the Tangzhong , the starches are already swollen before mixing begins . This means that they do not need to compete with the proteins to absorb water as the completed dough warms up in the oven . As you mix the ingredients the plump starches perforate the gluten-water sheets . As McGee mentioned , these starch granules ' rigidity accounts for the spongy , close structure of the tangzhong crumb , dough with less perforated gluten mesh forms larger bubbles and a more open crumb . The gluten in the flour used in the tangzhong is denatured by the process before it can form into an extensive network . However , since the tangzhong accounts for only a small portion of the total flour used , there is plenty of gluten left to maintain structure during rise and oven spring until the starch structure sets .

The absolute time a stock will take depends on the quantity of stock you are making and also on the ratio of solids to liquid with which you started ( along with the strength of your burner , the starting temperature of the water , the geometry of your pot , ... ) . Intentional variation is also possible depending on your intended use . The best advice I 've heard comes from Judy Rodgers in the Zuni Cafe Cookbook : taste the stock often as it cooks , more and more freqently as it starts to taste good . When it does n't taste better than the last time you checked , it 's done .
The " moistness " of the bread - the soft texture - is actually from oils and fats as well as water - grain has some of these naturally , especially whole grain . Adding in extra fat , such as butter , shortening or cooking oil , makes the baked good seem extra moist and soft - here is a <URL> , and the role of various ingredients in dough . Fats are a tenderizer when added to a dough - it makes the baked good softer , which we associate with " moist . " Fats and oils also evaporate much more slowly than water , and prevents water from re-absorbing into the bread , keeping the bread from becoming brittle and hard and off-tasting ( stale ) for longer . Without extra fat , the bread relies on the oils and protein found in grain , and the water content of the bread . This water will eventually evaporate , leaving the bread brittle - and worse , it will slowly re-absorb some moisture from the air , and this can lead to a dry , mealy , chewy texture and unpleasant flavor - staleness , in other words . ( This is why croutons should be baked for best flavor rather than just left to go stale . ) The natural oils and proteins will likewise firm up and stiffen as the bread cools . For leavened flatbreads , <URL> is a common technique to extend shelf life ( and improve flavor ) - this method of leavening does a good job of locking water-moisture into the bread without requiring extra fat or other preservatives . <URL> of prefermenting naan . For unleavened bread , Mexican cuisine is where you should look for <URL> - in some regions , flour tortillas are eaten with every meal , but generally only prepared once a day . Air-tight storage is key . A zip-close plastic bag with a cloth to absorb excess moisture is ideal . Re-heat the bread in a microwave . It will soften the proteins and oils , without drying out the water content the way an oven or toaster will .
Thinking about this from first principles , a banana is about : 75 % water 20 % carbohydrates ( mostly sugar and a small amount of starch ) Less than 5 % combined fiber and protein Trace amount of fat ( generally considered to be zero ) . The anti-crystallization effect of guar gum works on the water component , so adding a small amount of guar gum actually should be of some benefit . The hard part is getting it all dispersed ; you do n't want to over-process the banana ( you 'd lose the creaminess ) but you also need to hydrate the guar gum in order for it to work its magic . You also need to avoid over-thickening , which might be difficult even with the very small starch content in a typical banana . Bananas convert more starch to sugar as they ripen , so I suspect you 'd have more success trying this on very ripe bananas that are , essentially , little more than sugar and water to begin with . Incorporating and maintaining air is something that I just do n't think you 're going to be able to do . Proteins and fats can both participate in foaming ( egg whites being an example of the former , and heavy cream being the canonical example of the latter ) , but bananas have neither of those . There 's simply nothing to whip , and thus nothing to stabilize , so neither xanthan gum nor any other emulsifier/stabilizer is going to do you much good here . If you really want to incorporate air then you 're going to need more than one ingredient . My instinct would be to say coconut milk , which has relatively high fat and pairs well with banana ( and obviously is also vegan / non-dairy ) , but I can say from experience now that coconut milk just does n't have enough fat . You could try cooking it down first to get the fat ratio up , or using coconut oil , but I 'm not sure how it would taste . Traditional ice cream is about 60 % water , which means the amount of guar gum that most people seem to get the best results with ( about 1 tsp/qt ) is about 0.87 % of the total water . For a small ( 100 g ) banana , that 's about 75 mL of water corresponding to very close to 1/8 tsp of guar gum . So , I 'd give this a try with 1/8 tsp of guar gum , forget the xanthan gum . Try adding it after you 've frozen the banana for the first time , when you first pop it into the blender . No guarantees , but , you can probably afford to waste one banana in the attempt . Update : I thought I 'd give this a try myself since ( a ) it seemed pretty easy and ( b ) I can always use more non-dairy dessert recipes . Here 's how it came out with 1/4 tsp of guar gum for 2 bananas , after being frozen for two days : You can see that ice crystal formation is pretty minimal , and although some parts did harden a bit ( much like ordinary homemade ice cream with low overrun ) , they returned to normal consistency within just a few minutes . Of course it still tastes like frozen bananas , so if I were to do this again I think I 'd probably try adding a few other flavours . Also note that even though the texture is decent , the colour is getting dark , and I have no doubt that this would eventually turn black after enough time in the freezer - and the lemon juice trick does n't really work so well when the whole thing has been blended up .
There 's a few types of salsa -- salsa fresca ( aka pico de gallo , aka salsa cruda ) , which is " fresh salsa " and uncooked , and if made fresh , it should n't be too watery ( unless you add to much liquid , eg , lime juice ) , but letting the vegetables sit after salting will start to draw out extra liquid and could become watery . For truly thick salsa , you have to treat it like a jam , and cook it to release the pectin in the tomato . ( or I guess you could use some other thickeners ... I 've never tried . tomato paste , maybe ? ) You do n't necessarily have to cook the other ingredients , too , but I personally like roasting the peppers and onions to sweeten then up and remove some of the extra liquid . ( halve the peppers and seed them , lay them on a tray cut side up with the onion cut into wedges , roast 'til they 're softened , then dump into a food processor and either pulse or liquify it , depending on how chunky you like it . And the skin falls off the peppers , so I leave 'em out ) . You can do the same roasting with the tomatoes , and it 'll be thicker from the food processor , but you wo n't get the same cling without letting them cook slowly in liquid to develop the pectin . If you roast the tomatoes , I like to use plum tomatoes , as they have more " meat " to the gel around the seeds , and take out the gel and seeds .
If the meringues are coming out of the oven sticky , you might lower the temperature slightly and extend the drying time ( to avoid browning ) -- they should feel quite dry and very light coming out of the oven . Sugar is <URL> -- if the air is humid , any condensation -- even when you can not see it -- on the meringues will dissolve the sugar , and then they will start to feel sticky , and the downward spiral will begin . According to all my searching , it is best to make them on a low humidity day . Of course , where I live in the summer , we pretty much do n't get those . If you are having trouble with them in storage , you might try to buy some <URL> packets , and put them in the container . Most desiccant is not food safe , so it should not touch the meringue . Amazon has lots of options .
The primary coloring agents in a traditional black Russian loaf are molasses and dark rye flour .

I would guess your main problem is the protein in the flour . To get that stretchy dough that will not tear you need bread flour . Your water , the proportion between kneading and resting of the dough , and the salt also matter . The recipe you are using has way too much fat in the dough . The <URL> suggested by bonCodigo is closer to the needed proportions . <URL> on roti canai . Flour . You can buy roti flour from an ethnic grocery store , but many of the chain supermarkets in the US now carry bread flour . It has higher protein content without being whole grain . Different flours have different proportions of gluten . Those with lower content ( called weak flours ) being better for cakes and those higher content ( strong flours ) , better for breads . Gluten is not one protein , but a mixture of two protein families : gliadins , which give the dough its plasticity , and glutenins , which give the dough its strength . Different strains of wheat have different ratios of gliadins to glutenins , hence the need to find an appropriate flour . In the US and Canada , high protein flours tend to be optimized for loaf breads and not flat breads , so some hunting around for a good brand may be needed . Ghee The recipes on the net vary dramatically in the amount of fat added to the dough . The basic process of dough making is to get the water to break up the gluten in the flour and then stretch those giant molecules to create a network of stringy , tangled molecules . Too much fat interferes with this process . About 5g of fat for every 100g of flour is a good ratio . As ghee adds flavor , the trick to make a dough with higher ghee content is to think of it as a croissant and fold the fat in after the dough has incorporated some water . This is done by brushing the ghee in later stages of stretch and fold . Kneading and resting Making the network of gluten proteins requires energetic changes . Lots of water and rest could do it ( as in no-knead breads ) and so could a little water , a little rest , and a lot of kneading . With flat breads one does not need to wait for the yeasts to create the bubbles in the dough . The resting is for the water to do its work of untangling the gluten . The trick is to know if the water activity , resting , and kneading have brought the dough to the right point . There are many <URL> that are better explained through a video . The dough in the leaner recipe is a wetter dough that is a bit trickier to knead by hand . <URL> is to place it on an oiled countertop , pinch a corner , and fold it over . Repeat a few times and it will become easier to handle without having to add extra flour as it often suggested . Water . Do n't use tap water . It may be too alkaline , to hard , or too chlorinated . Andrew Whitley in his Bread Matters book has a chapter on how guilty he felt using Evian to make his bread , but it improved his bread . For flat breads one is less worried that the chlorine in the water will kill the yeast , but depending on your tap water composition , the other chemicals could be an issue .
I think you may reach the point of diminishing returns if you try and fix your oven because there 's lots that could be going wrong . It could be that your oven design is just bad , in which case you ca n't fix it anyway . It could be a faulty temperature sensor , or a bad gas valve , or a faulty burner . Your gas supply pressure could be inconsistent . By the time you replace all these you 'll have spent more than a new oven would cost . I 'd first clean it really well . Get all the dust and gunk out and see if that helps . Then you should see if you can find a pro who can have a look at it , test the gas supply , see if there 's any quick wins . One suggestion I 'd make would be to post this on the <URL> forum , the home improvement site . As this is more a question about mechanics and repair you 're likely to get a better answer there .
Add baking powder to the mixture , if needed , as it will cause them to puff up and lighten when cooked . Adding a little cream may also help . I have a Gulab Jamun recipe from " Dance of Spices " by Laxmi Hiremath , pg 412 , which lists the following for the dough : 0.5 cup ( 120 mL ) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 cups ( around 470 mL ) powdered nonfat dry milk 1 tsp ( 5 mL ) baking powder 1 cup ( 236 mL ) heavy whipping cream ( probably listed as " double cream " where you live , see <URL> ) about 1 TBSP water ( 15 mL ) The dry ingredients are mixed , then the cream is gradually mixed in , and the water is added to make a smooth , pliable dough .
You could put them in a pan of boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes ( not so to they 're cooked through ) before putting them in the oven . The potato on the outside of the wedges will soften and cook a little bit which will help the outsides crisp up a little . Make sure you allow them to drain completely before you put them in the oven .
Making Mozzarella is not fantastically difficult , but certain things during the process are critical , probably the most important is temperature . If it 's your first time making cheese , you might find the buying a ' starter kit ' the easiest way to get up and running . These will provide you with all the important items you needm such as rennet . If you feel brave , then you forego the kit and dive right in . For Mozzarella try to find Buffalo milk , which is what ' proper ' Mozzarella is made from . It 's lower in cholesterol than cows milk , has more protein and makes a much richer cheese . If you ca n't get Buffalo milk use the best full fat , non-homogenized milk you can find . Here 's a recipe I 've used before <URL> Here 's a link with the differences between Buffalo milk and cows milk <URL> Whilst it 's quite possible to make virtually any variety of cheese at home , some cheeses , such as blue cheese , require a place to develop at the correct temperature and for quite long periods of time . ideally , this would be a temperature around 10c with a humidity around 70 % and a time for maturing at around 2 to 3 months . Here 's a good place to start : <URL>
My wife loves bacon that 's cooked to the cusp of burning , so I 've got a good knowledge of the properties of bacon on that fine line . It 's so brittle , you can powder it very easily . I myself would probably just stick it in a plastic bag , and whack it a few times with a pan , but I do n't see any reason why you could n't put it in the blender . I have a nice mortar and pestle I use for powdering things , but that 's probably overkill in this case .
Your technique is going to be critical here . Leaning scones are n't necessarily indicative of improper technique , but flat ones are . Keeping your ingredients cold is important when creating scones in every recipe I 've read or tried . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> as to grate the butter and then freeze the grated pieces and use a <URL> to provide layers . Many other recipes use cold butter ( frozen or simply very cold out of the freezer ) in chunks and a pastry blender to cut them in . Your milk should also be cold , not room temperature . You may also want to chill your work bowl and utensils . You do n't want your butter melting before those scones hit the oven . When your scones hit the oven and the butter does begin to soften and melt , it will leave behind layers of air in your scone which will help it to rise . You do n't want to handle finished scone dough very much . Use a light touch and minimal work . I 'd also check the date on your self-raising flour . The ingredients will lose their activity over time , causing the flour not to rise as well any more .

Are there health issues with sous-vide cooking ?
If you do it properly , no there are no health issues . A combination of two things are required to kill beasties : heat and time . The higher the heat you expose them to , the faster they die . Generally any temperature above 130 F is enough to kill most beasties , it just requires a significantly larger amount of time compared to a higher temperature . I go into a lot of detail regarding Salmonella in this answer of mine : <URL> I have several tables there to show exact timings , etc. . If you think I should copy/paste that here , then let me know in a comment
Short answer : yes . Long answer : depends on what you 're cooking . Grilling some popular food items can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) HCAs , a family of mutagenic and cancer-causing compounds , are produced during the cooking of many animal products , including chicken , beef , pork , and fish . In January of 2005 , the federal government officially added HCAs to its list of known carcinogens . Cancer Project nutritionists determined that many commonly grilled foods contain alarmingly high levels of HCAs . This table lists the five foods containing the highest levels . ( Source : <URL> )
Since temperature control is so vital to sous vide cooking , the circulation serves to make sure that all of the water is moving and of an even temperature . If you just had a heating element submerged without a circulator , you would get some convection currents , but there would be hot and cold spots in your water bath . If these differences were even just a few degrees , you could end up with proteins not hitting their coagulation temperatures , connective tissues not softening , pectin not broken down , etc. . All in all , it would defeat the purpose of this cooking method ! As for the differentiation between " circulators " and " water ovens " , there may not be one . Frequently the actual thermal unit and pump is referred to as the " circulator " and the whole assembly with a vessel and water is referred to as the " oven " , but I 'd check the specs of each model to see whether it has all the parts you 're looking for .
Commercial kitchens use a few methods that are hidden from the camera during kitchen shows . First , there are cutting boards for meats , and separate cutting boards for vegetables . These are often color coded so they are n't mixed up . If there is room , raw meats use an entirely different table . Any possibly contaminated board is sanitized before reuse . Second , the cloths you see are stored in a bucket of sanitizing fluid which kills microbes on contact . When a surface is wiped down , or hands are cleaned , they are being sanitized by the liquid on the cloth . Finally , there is usually more than one person working behind the scenes and labor is divided so the raw meat people are not the same as the green salad people . At home , planning is the key . Try to do all of your non-meat prep first . Then you can contaminate your cutting board without having to wash it again . Then try to take care of all of your meat prep , so you only have to wash your hands once . And remember that if you drop a vegetable on your raw chicken , it 's not a big deal if it 's all going to be cooked .
There are substitutes , but eggs have very important effects on the texture of dough and are therefore hard to substitute . You will need to experiment a great deal until you hit on the correct texture , because you 'll need to tweak all other ingredients and maybe include new ones , e.g. substitute part of the butter and use cream instead to account for moisture loss from egg substitutes . Mien 's link already includes some substitute ideas , like applesauce and commercial imitations . I ca n't give you more suggestions , because I always put eggs in my cakes ;) . But when tweaking , keep following in mind : Egg whites provide a resilient mesh which traps small air bubbles , so they make a cake more airy . You may need to adjust the baking powder upwards a bit . If it is a soda recipe , you 'll need to raise the acidity too . But the whole effect ca n't be approximated just with baking powder , because its bubbles are too big . For that , you need better emulsification ( covered below ) . Egg whites also have a binding quality . This should n't need compensation in a cake , as you need a dough without too much binding ( as opposed to bread ) , but if your cake starts falling apart , consider using a flour with higher gluten content ( all purpose flour instead of cake flour ) . Gluten binds too . If , on the other hand , your cake is too bread-like , then you may need less binding . The egg yolks are a source of fat , which prevents the dough gluten from forming a strong mesh by covering the particles . You will miss this with egg substitutes , especially if they are pectin-based ( like applesauce ) because pectin enhances binding . Use the lower gluten dough ( it it does n't cause the cake to fall apart ) or add more fat . Then there is the importance of emulsifiers . Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lecithin in the kitchen . An emulsifier helps your wet ingredients bind in an emulsion , instead of staying in two separate phases with the watery phase soaking the flour through and the fatty phase making the whole thing greasy . It also helps the trapping of very tiny air bubbles in the wet part of the dough ( this is what happens when you beat eggs with sugar on high speed until the colour lightens ) which provides a very fine leavening . Maybe commercial egg imitates contain emulsifiers - check the list - but if they do n't , you must buy pure lecithin . It is usually soy derived , but maybe you need to check with the manufacturer that your brand is suitable for vegetarians . Also , consider including cream , the fat in it is already emulsified in water , unlike butter ( which is water emulsified in fat ) . You must calculate precisely and tweak other ingredients to ensure that the total amount of fat and moisture do n't change ( except if you are compensating for the changes caused by the egg substitute ) . If it is a chocolate cake , consider reducing the fat and the flour and adding some cocoa powder ( the regular-fat variety ) . Cocoa has binding and thickening properties , and will help with the more even fat distribution . Melted chocolate tastes good in cakes , but makes them very dense , so do n't use it . The easiest way would be to find a recipe published by someone who has already done all the work . But just from paging through a cookbook , you ca n't tell if they did it right , or just slapped a spoon of applesauce instead of an egg and called it a vegan cake . Edit : I just had an idea when I saw Mien 's gelatine question and yours together in the list . I have n't heard of anybody using it , and do n't know if it will work , but it does , it will be great . So try it . I already said that using cream would help . As you need a foam full of very tiny bubbles for the perfect leavening , you could try whipped cream instead of whipped eggs . The trouble is that the air will get out of the batter very quickly while and after folding the cream . So you 'll need to stabilize it . Gelatine in unusually small quantities will make for a very nice experiment , but obviously not one you 'll want to do . But plant-derived gelling agents could help . Carrageenan is commonly used with dairy products , and you can buy it online . So try folding stabilized whipped cream into the batter .
Sirloin steak does n't have a huge amount of collegen , which is why it 's traditionally cooked over high heat for as short a period of time as possible . If I were you I 'd be more worried about the meat become unpleasantly mushy if left in the bath for too long . I would just use the Douglas Baldwin <URL> for bringing the meat up to the required temperature :
You should only start using one if you have a pressing need . That is tongue-in-cheek , but unless your have a need , there is no ' should use ' . One such need may be hygiene ( or saving effort , or lack of strength in the hands ) , but only you can determine whether that 's true . UPDATE : original post was modified ( and better for it ) As in the earlier answer , benefits may be : Hygiene Economics ( more juice from your lemon , if normal squeezing is n't enough for you ) Speed / efficiency Catches the seeds for you A possibly disadvantage may be that it mangles your lemon skin ( depending on type ) , which you might still want to use . On the other hand , models may also exist that allow you to squeeze efficiently after you 've scraped some of the skin ( if you needed to ) , which can be a hassle if done by hand . As to specific models : I do n't use any . ( probably just use the orange juicer if I had a bunch . Like hobodave - do n't need another singletask device that sees uncommon use ) .
The searing applied after sous-viding should not be enough to alter the temperature of the meat notably . All you 're trying to do with the sear is create the flavorful crust on the outside of a piece of meat via the Maillard reaction , not accomplish any cooking of the interior of the meat itself . This is best done by applying very high heat for a very short amount time , usually just a few seconds . Some like doing this via pan-searing or on a very hot grill , but I usually use a high-powered blowtorch . The important thing is that you not sear for so long that interior of the meat has a chance to notice . A perfectly sous-vided piece of meat should be a uniform color throughout , except for a heavily seared crust . There should n't be any gray band of over-cooked meat under the crust . Avoiding that is why you 're sous-viding in the first place . Also , I find 125-130 ° F to be a touch on the rare side . For a good medium rare , 133-135 ° F gives me better results .
No . Pasta certainly can be varied by 1-2 minutes depending on the degree of bite desired ( assuming the commercial , dried variety ) . Furthermore , height above sealevel determines air pressure and the boiling temperature of water , which further complicates things . For microwaving , a similar problem occurs with power : not all microwaves have the same effective power , which means that you ca n't have an integer number of minutes of cooking time . In fact , if you see 600 W : 8 minutes , 1000 W : 5 minutes , you already know that they 're rounded numbers ( 600 * 8 = 4800 ; 1000 * 5 = 5000 , ignoring the larger heat loss in the first case ) [ edit ] A bit of math on the back of a napkin suggests that even at a fixed altitude , the difference between high and low air pressure is significant enough . No , they 're not adjusting the ingredients to come up with an integer number . Besides , it 'd be far easier to vary the thickness a bit .
One of the benefits of sous vide cooking is that you can not cook food over the temperature set , if you set the temp to 70 degrees it 's physically impossible for it to go over that . This means that if you cook it longer than it needs to get up to the desired temperature you wo n't dry it out . I would think for guineafowl that 120 minutes would be enough . As for temperature shock you 'd have to go much higher than 70C to run into that , so I 'd start with the water at your desired temperature . As for sauces guineafowl is very rich and savory , so something with acidity would help to balance it . I like your sauce idea and think it would work fine . Riesling is a good choice if you get one with a more mineral character than a sweet bomb , although a squeeze of lemon can supplement the acidity if needed .
I use Propane all the time . There are several factors as to why : It is cheap , about 1/4 the price of butane . It 's more readily available . You can buy a propane torch at many different stores for very cheap . The torches typically put out a lot more heat . I 've used both propane and butane , mostly for crème brulee , but other food as well . The butane torches put out such a focused small area of heat , that it would get uneven burning . Whereas with Propane , they often put out a much larger area of heat , making it easier to caramelize across the surface evenly . As for the concern of it imparting propane flavor , I have had that happen , once , but I 've also had that happen with butane . It 's all about flow control . If you have the dial turned up too high and it 's spewing out massive amounts of propane , plus hold the flame too close to the food , you MIGHT get then hint of propane . But if you have the torched dialed in to the proper settings , you really ca n't beat the ease and convenience of " energy-efficient clean-burning propane gas "
You could probably do it on the cheap , but the temperature precision might suffer in the process : ( $ 0 - $ 3 ) A container for water that can handle being warmed up a bit . ( recycle something or buy a 5 gallon bucket ) ( ~ $ 20 ) A small submersible garden pump . ( I have no idea what temperature they 're rated for , but I use one in my greenhouse hydroponics systems , and it gets rather warm in there in the summer ) ( $ 10-20 ) An immersion heater ( ~ $ 65 ) : a <URL> Total : ~ $ 100 If you 're comfortable wiring up your own circuits , you could likely make your own temperature control unit for less , as that 's the bulk of the cost . If you 're not comfortable with all of this , then the <URL> ( currently $ 25 off , bringing it to ~ $ 155 ) . You 'll have to supply your own water container . Update : Ecnerwal got me thinking -- vessels with thermostat controls . ( heater is easy , it 's the thermostat that 's expensive ) . Crock pots have the unfortunate problem that they only have one to three present temperatures ( low , high and warm ) . There are , however , a few things that might be useful : a deep-fat fryer . Preferably cleaned , or one that can be disassembled to clean . They tend to have very powerful heating elements , so you may need a screen to ensure that the pump and the food do n't get to close to it . You 'll also want to check the dial for the lowest temperature that it can maintain . ( it might not go below 200 ° F ) electric skillet . They 're quite shallow , but if you 're just cooking a steak for 1 or 2 , it might work . ( again , check the dial to see what the minimum temp it 'll hold is ) . Depending on he size , it might be possible to put another container inside it to hold more water . Coffee urns . They can be much larger , but they typically just have one setting , so you ' dd need a termostat on it .
A few things that can help , if it 's not an issue with fat like @Aaronut suggested : Tomato paste . Yes , I know it 's a sacrelige , but it 'll act as a thickener . Take the pasta out before it 's gotten to al dente , and finish cooking it in the sauce ; the pasta will absorb any extra liquid , and help to thicken the sauce . Do not rinse off the pasta after you drain it . Way too many people do , and it washes off the starch that you want for the sauce to bind to the pasta properly , and may introduce extra water .
Use it the same as you would thai basil , or even " normal " basil . It 's a little more strongly on the licorice flavor side of things than lettuce leaf basil , but it still works nicely in conjunction with tomatoes , garlic , and other " italian " flavors .
As long as they are n't spoiled they 'll be fine for a crumble/crisp/cobbler . You 'll want to have someone else taste them to make sure first . They may need less sugar and less or no precooking . If they are really , really mushy then you might want to add some firmer plums or other fruit to give some texture .
Eggs are completely safe in cooked food , and pancakes are cooked . Pancakes made from scratch have egg in the batter too . As long as you do n't drink the batter , or more realistically , leave an uncooked bit in the middle of the pancakes , you 're totally safe . ( And of course , it does n't take much to kill salmonella , and a mL of uncooked batter right in the middle of a pancake has ridiculously small odds of getting you sick even if it 's somehow still cold , but if you 're trying to play by all the rules , then you should make sure they 're fully cooked - you probably want that anyway . )
130 degrees is certainly the temperature to aim for , I 'm thinking that it 's the pan sear that did it . 1 minute in a pan is actually quite a bit for a thinner steak ( at 6 ounces I 'm thinking yours were maybe 1/2 - 3/4 inch ) , certainly enough to add 10-20 degrees or so to the steak 's temperature and make it medium well . As for how to avoid it there 's a few things : Get a thick steak : a thick steak can take a minute in the pan without cooking much more Cook to rare : if you want to use a thinner steak cook it to 115 or 120F instead of 130F , that way the sear will bring it up to the perfect temperature Use a torch to brown it : A chef 's torch would give a good , quick sear without cooking the steak as much as a hot pan Sear the steak first : it 's not as good as searing after , but then you will get your perfect temperature Cook the steak , then let it cool , then sear it . Your steak will only overcook if the temperature goes over 135F
There are several negative effects from over-kneading bread dough : Overheating - if the dough gets too warm , it will ferment too quickly ( or over ferment ) and will therefore lack flavour . Oxidisation - kneading for too long can cause the flour to oxidise and bleach , again impairing flavour . Breaking down - eventually the molecular bonds of the gluten will break , which is obviously not what you want to happen ! The latter two are really only possible with electric mixers , however . Most doughs are ready for fermentation when they reach an internal temperature of 77-81ºF ( 25-27 ° C ) . You can also check the gluten development with the Windowpane Test : pull off a chunk of dough and stretch it with your hands . It should stretch to form a very thin translucent sheet , without tearing .
Have you tried using a candy thermometer and testing the jam when it 's at 220 ° F ? An alternative to the method that you use is to use a spoon and do the ' two drop test ' . If you dip a cold metal spoon into your jam mix and then lift it . When the mixture is only just boiling it will drip off and be light . As the mixture continues to heat the drops that fall from the spoon will be heavier When the two drops form and fall off the spoon it should be ready . I 'll be honest though I much prefer the method you use and this is just an alternative .
Yes , and Wikipedia has a <URL> of these scales ( with some further details in other portions of the article and the links ) . Basically , at least four of the five recognized primary " tastes " have a reference compound that other foods are compared to subjectively . For sweetness , a solution containing the test compound is diluted until sweetness can barely be detected by a human taster ( similar to the Scoville scale ) . Sucrose is given the reference value of 1 ( or sometimes 100 ) . Sourness is similarly rated in comparison to a dilute hydrochloric acid solution , saltiness is rated in comparison to a dilute table salt ( sodium chloride ) solution , and bitterness is rated relative to a dilute quinine solution . ( I 've not heard of any similar scale for umami . ) In most cases , the reference compound is given a value of 1 . The most common way to reference these scales is as the " [ taste ] index , " as in " Citric acid has a value of 0.46 on the sourness index , " which means it has to be diluted slightly less than half of how much hydrochloric acid would be for it to be on the threshold of human sourness detection . ( By the way , while these scales show us something , they are mostly useful for comparing single pure substances . For culinary purposes , their value is somewhat limited by the complex interactions among various tastes and flavor components . Even individual substances can change flavor depending on environment : for example , a complex molecule may taste relatively neutral at neutral pH , but with increased acid and thus sourness , it may acquire a salty flavor . )

Stove top Sushi rice - Which method ?
It is the rice that is important , regardless of the cooker you use . If you think you are unable to find Sushi rice on your own in local market , why not check with a Sushi stall chef/owner near by ? Some people get mistaken with sticky rice , because really Sushi and sticky are on the same category . You could even say that Italian risotto is as well . However sushi rice is rinsed and surface starch is removed . Yamikuronue has already given you some good insight . Perhaps she could tell you what rice you could buy :) I hope you have the basic sushi rolling bamboo mat to help you with . From mine and many of others ' experience , the mat is very useful . I have used <URL> to make nice maki rolls . The following <URL> seems to be indicating a method ( water sprinkling ) that I saw/ate in a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo near Maru building . Hope it helps . Edit 1 : If you want to make best sushi out of normal rice , this is a bruteforce method we tried at home for the first time . Not the best Sushi found in a Sushi bar in Japan , but still it was a taste to remember , and an experience that made sense . break the long grain rice ( you can use a mortar , or bottle , or any clean/non-contaminated cylinder on your cutting board :) ) wash the rice until the starch goes away - even if it 's not 100 % , it 's good enough when you have soaked it . soak the rice rinse and wash again and rinse depending on the usual ' hardness ' of the rice you use , and how much water you add per cup of rice , you may have to change the amount of water you add . For example , if you have 50g of raw rice , and 75g of water , then the total weight is 125g . You must keep the same total weight when you add water to the soaked/washed rice . you can very well cook the rice in a pan good heat to cook rice : after boiling , bring down the heat to minimum and let it be , no need to take lid off once rice is cooked , you can mix it with sushi vinegar . If you do not have rice/sushi vinegar , then you can add some plain vinegar and pinches of salt mix all , stir well This gives you just nice rice for sushi :)
Your answer of " everything except arrowroot " is spot on . You should use a corn starch slurry in all likelihood . It is less expensive and more commonly available and will not <URL> ; corn starch is also purported to have a creamier texture . Arrow root also may have been overcooked by your preparation as described in your comment as it has a lower temperature that it needs to reach relative to other thickeners . Keep it handy for your acidic sauces , but keep to corn starch for the dairy . A benefit of arrowroot in clear sauces is that it wo n't make the sauce cloudy as will corn starch ; however with dairy this is not a concern .
There is no difference in food taste when cooking using gas or electric . Gas burns pretty cleanly so is not going to leave a flavor residue you could detect . Cooking over flame as in a barbecue or a pot over a campfire does change the flavor because of the smoke , that 's the only case I can think of where the heat source can change the flavor of the food .
I have always made sure that I only defrost enough to meet the needs of the moment for sushi . If you cut the blocks into 4 to 8 rolls worth , they should defrost under running water in just fifteen to twenty minutes , just about the time it takes me to do a batch of sushi rice . That said , fish once defrosted will start to lose flavor immediately but will remain edible for 2 days . Once it starts to smell , get rid of it immediately , and I would play it very safe on that " starts to smell " the faintest whiff should be enough to send it to the bin .
Aha ! Found the answer myself ! <URL> includes the step " Garnish with toasted sesame seeds or fried salty mung beans . " -- I googled " fried salty mung beans " and found the picture below , which is exactly what I was looking for :
That depends on the rice . I have done my own measurements in the past ( I hate volumetric measurements , ) and found : 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Brown rice ( medium grain ? ) weighed 142g . 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Calrose rice ( medium grain ) weighed 150g . Both were Australian grown rice . The rice cooker cup 's top measurement is 160ml , but I always fill to the brim because ... I 'm too lazy to look at the notch . Why is the weight different ? Because different grains of rice can wedge together more efficiently ( less air pockets . ) The weight measurement for a long grain rice like Basmati would be different again . TL ; DR : buy a scale to be accurate .
I believe that a pan needs to get very hot for damage to occur - 500c is the number I found for <URL> specifically , and carbon steel would be <URL> up similar temperatures , I do n't have numbers for copper or other metals pots can be made of offhand but the point stands - it will take very high temperatures to effect a metal pan to the point where it warps or alters itself , and the pan should be safe at any temperature you would be cooking food at . You should be able to heat the pan to those temperatures before any adverse reactions can begin to occur . On the other hand , it is very difficult to tell how hot a dry pan actually is - it may be too easy to misjudge the safe heat , to let the pan get hot enough to warp or scorch the seasoning or burn whatever is added or worse , suffer thermal shock when something is finally put in the pan . A pan with water in it wo n't rise above 100c until the water 's gone , and while oil wo n't keep the temp low like water will , it will change as it heats , and can provide some warning that the pan is getting too hot before it reaches a point where the pan is damaged - even if that warning , at the last , is the oil smoking or scorching . Thicker pans should fare a little better , since they take a bit longer to heat , and can distribute the heat more evenly , and they 're also sturdier and might resist warping because of that - but thin pans can get very hot on the contact points , and will bend or warp more easily . Also , with a dry pan the possibility of thermal shock is higher - in a pan with liquid in it , the water or oil acts as a good medium to transfer heat through , sort of like a buffer for temperature change , so if something cold ( er ) gets added to a hot pan , the oil or water will transfer heat into it and out of the hot pan and liquid , much more evenly , and stabilize the temperature faster . In a dry pan , the heat will transfer only at the point of contact , and fast , so a dry pan will undergo stress at the point of contact much more . Also , adding the water or oil you need to cook with itself can become a source of thermal shock if the dry pan had gotten too hot on the stove , so adding room temperature liquid might cause the pan damage as the heat flows out suddenly and unevenly , pans have cracked under such stresses . In the end , I think you can certainly put your pans on the stove without any contents , and have the pan come out undamaged even if had been heated quite a bit - but you have to be careful and skilled not to overheat your pans too much , and that can be tricky to gauge with a dry pan . On the other hand , having water or oil in the pan will keep the temperature low or warn you when it is overheating , so it is just a little bit safer ( and so probably good advice ) .
At restaurant supply stores , you can get much larger fine strainers than consumer stores normally have . Another type is the chinoise or china cap , which may or may not be suitable for your needs ; these typically have very fine mesh . These can be available in larger capacities . You may also have success with a tamis , which is a drum type strainer , although these are harder to find .
A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element . A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat , similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb . An induction stove does n't actually generate heat itself , but rather induces it the pot or pan . It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field . This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat , thus heating the food . Induction stoves are faster , safer , and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves . It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up . They are safer because they do n't actually generate heat themselves . After taking a pot off the " burner " ( glass surface ) it quickly begins to cool . With regards to differences in the cooking process , there 's not much . You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove . It does affect your choice of pans however . All aluminum pans will not work , nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones . If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine . The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface .
A pull-through sharpener will never do as thorough a job at sharpening your knife as a stone , and over time will lose its efficacy and actually dull your blade . In a pinch they can be useful , but be sure to give the knife a few passes on a good quality steel afterwards , as the pull-through sharpeners tend to remove metal quite coarsely .
What are the best substitutes for arborio risotto rice ? Your best replacement would be another short grain , or in a pinch , medium grain rice . ( if it 's a variety that does n't cook up creamy enough for your liking ... you can cheat and after you remove it from the heat , quickly stir in a beaten egg ) And how about when your only choices are all the local shops have : pearl barley , or ' brown rice with barley and spelt blend ' ? I 'd probably go with the pearl barley , just because it 'll have a more consistent cooking time than a blend . ( so you do n't end up w / little uncooked nuggets in a puddle of overcooked mush . This makes me think pearl barley is the best option . It take a lot more boiling than normal rice ( 40 minutes ) , so I 'll have to half-cook it by boiling before adding it to my pan with stock as my risotto recipe calls for . Do n't pre-cook it . You want to toast your uncooked grains in the oil , just as you would with a rice-based risotto before you add any liquid . If you do n't do this step , <URL> ( I ca n't comment on the texture , as I 've never tried cooking pearl barley this way ) . If you 're reluctant to spend almost an hour in front of the stove , the period to cheat is in the middle ; toast it , do a couple of stock additions w / lots of stirring , then add lots of stock &amp; let it cook , then once it 's nearly dry go back to stirring &amp; slowly adding liquid 'til it 's done ... or <URL>
Do n't reuse an old milk jug for storing the new , combined milk . The standard plastics used in milk jugs in most areas can not be properly sanitized for reuse ( even with standard sanitizing solutions ) . Instead , use a properly sanitized and covered glass or plastic container , preferably one that you clean in a hot water dish washer . Milk stored in a properly cleaned container will have the maximum shelf life ( and reduced chance of other contaminants ) .
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
White fish are , as a rule , more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish . Add farm-raised to that equation and you have the makings for a very bland meal , which is why you almost always see farm-raised white-fleshed fish served with heavy herb treatments and powerful sauces , or ( in cod 's case ) fry batter . Tilapia and cod are two of the most common farm-raised fish on the market , so I 'm leaning heavily on my suspicion that you 're trying to make sushi out of the farm-raised varieties and not wild game . If it 's white fish you desire for sushi , talk to your fishmonger . Tell him what you 're doing and ask for his recommendation . He 'll direct you toward game fish that that are either very new and very fresh or that of the flash-frozen variety .
<URL> should definitely work if you follow it correctly . Comparing your recipe to it might tell you what you did wrong . From the information you already gave , it seems certain that you did n't cook it long enough ( as rumtscho said in the comments ) . Other things that could have been wrong : oven not hot enough ( your oven might not be as hot as you think ) water not hot enough when added to the rice ( Alton Brown 's recipe calls for it to be boiling ; I do n't know about yours ) too much water/too little rice dish too small ( if the water is deep , it wo n't heat as fast in the oven ) ( thanks to Aaronnut , see the comments ) non-metal casserole dishes take a while to heat up Given your updates , well , basically I have no idea how that recipe would ever have worked . As you saw , the water was n't even hot enough yet after half an hour . If you poured the water in boiling , it might have had a fighting chance , but it still would probably not have been long enough . Cooking it uncovered is weird , too - it means that once it 's hot , you 'll start losing a lot of water to evaporation . The recipe on the bag likely has you cook it covered on the stove , so clearly you should n't be using the same amount of water with it uncovered . As for the amount of water ... 1:2.5 really sounds like too much water to me . I 've seen some people online claiming that 1:2 is right for white rice , and brown rice needs more water , but in my experience that 's a recipe for soggy , watery rice . ( Edit : Of course I was basing that on covered rice ; rumtscho rightly points out in the comments that for uncovered rice you 'd need even more , since you lose some as I mentioned . ) So if I were you , I 'd forget about the recipe you used , and try the one I linked to . Many people ( including me ) have had reliable success with it .
It should n't be a problem , since their cooking times are similar .
What you describe is grill basting - where a liquid is poured onto the grill and covered ( with a metal salad bowl or a basting cover ) to more evenly cook the food and maintain its moisture . The liquid is added towards the latter half of cooking , as adding it in the first half of cooking has no real beneficial effect . Additionally , the steam will melt cheese more evenly if grilling burger patties . Typically , this liquid is a stock ( chicken or pork stock if cooking chicken , vegetable stock if cooking vegetables and beef stock if cooking beef ) or water . On a personal note , I sometimes dissolve a pinch of salt in the water if I do n't have any stock available .
I 'm by no means an official source , but it looks like a long grain rice is used . <URL> shows an example made with <URL> , and links to <URL> , which calls for long grain rice .
For a brine , no it does n't really matter , except that granulated sugar will dissolve more nicely than raw sugar . The sugar is for flavor more than anything else , though it does help the brine some . It also promotes browning of the meat . If you change one kind of sugar for another , I 'd use a 1:1 swap by weight rather than volume so you do n't have to worry about crystal sizes . Though the sugar does help the brining action some , the salt is the important component . From <URL> : How does brining work ? Brining promotes a change in the structure of the proteins in the muscle . The salt causes protein strands to become denatured , or unwound . This is the same process that occurs when proteins are exposed to heat , acid , or alcohol . When protein strands unwind , they get tangled up with one another , forming a matrix that traps water . Salt is commonly used to give processed meats a better texture . For example , hot dogs made without salt would be limp . In most cases , we add sugar to the brine . Sugar has little if any effect on the texture of the meat , but it does add flavor and promotes better browning of the skin .
There are a few tools you should have that are out of the ordinary in a typical American kitchen : <URL> - It 's really the only way to make maki ( rolls ) . Pro tip : when you use it , put it inside of a large zip-loc bag . This helps prevent the rice sticking to the mat . <URL> - This is essential in helping the rice turn out properly . The one I linked includes a free mat . I do n't own this particular brand ; I bought mine from an asian grocery store near me for like $ 30 , it came with a paddle . If you do n't want to commit to this large uni-tasker then I recommend using an equally large shallow-ish plastic bowl/dish . The sushi chef that taught me said plastic was OK , but to avoid glass or metal . <URL> - A quality rice cooker makes life amazingly easier . I own the one linked and it is amazing . I use it for cooking all of my rice . The quality of Zojirushi is simply unsurpassed and it quickly pays for itself . The single most important thing is a very sharp knife . It makes cutting the maki SO much easier . I ca n't stress this enough . A chef 's knife is just fine , but it should be well cared for and very sharp . For beginners <URL> is by far the easiest to make . You simply shape a small amount of rice in the palm of your hand and slap a piece of fish or other seafood on top of it . Cutting the fish for nigiri is an artform and can not be adequately conveyed here , but if you just hack out a thin piece of the right size it will taste fine . Tuna and salmon are relatively cheap cuts to use for this . For maki I suggest starting with spicy tuna rolls and California rolls . All you need for a California roll is : avocado , cucumber , and imitation crab meat . For spicy tuna mix you need : tuna , <URL> , and <URL> ( or <URL> ) . You may also want some <URL> and/or <URL> roe for the outside of your rolls .

What temperature to freeze meat at to preserve quality ?
Summary : think of the so-called ' soft freeze ' as an extension of your refrigerator , not of your freezer . The major things that happen to frozen foods that degrade their quality are : Expansion of ice crystals during warming and cooling cycles of the freezer , degrading the texture of the food item ( making meats , for example , exude more juice or even appear weepy ) Enzymatic or chemical changes over time . These are slowed more and more the colder the freeze . Fats become rancid due to interaction with oxygen , again slowed the colder the freeze Freezer burn , as water sublimates from the food , again exacerbated by warming and cooling cycles and the freezer , and proceeding more quickly at warmer temperatures You will note that almost everything that degrades the quality of the food items proceeds faster at warmer temperatures ( even when those relatively warmer temperatures are below freezing ) . So , in general , the colder you can keep your freezer ( within reasonable limits ) , the longer the quality life of the food products stored within it . As reported by the <URL> , food is safely stored at 0 F , -10 C. All ( relevant , before someone points out cryophiles ) bacteria are dormant at these temperatures . The <URL> indicates Most foods will maintain good quality longer if the freezer temperature is -10 to -20 ° F . At temperatures between 0 and 32 ° F , food deteriorates more rapidly . Fluctuating temperatures , such as those in self-defrosting freezers , also may damage food quality . Do not plan to store frozen foods for the maximum suggested time if your freezing unit can not maintain zero degree temperatures . The soft freeze temperature of 23 F / -5 C simply does not meet these standards , and is not useful for long term freezing . So given all of this , what is the point of the soft-freeze feature of your new refrigerator ? It is to allow you to keep food ready to use fairly quickly , as meats will not generally freeze completely solid at these borderline freezing temperatures , and are quicker to warm for preparation . It allows you to hold them for longer than you could at normal refrigerator temperatures , but not to store for the long term as in freezing to the recommended temperatures . This is in line with the information given by <URL> : The Soft-Freeze temperature helps keep meats or fish fresh longer .
It is perfectly safe to eat ( when produced , transported , and so on under sanitary conditions , just like any other edible meat ) . In some cultures it is considered a delicacy ; in others , it is not considered appropriate to eat , but those issues of cultural norms , not of safety . The news is because it is a violation of trust ( truth in labeling ) in a cultural background where horses are not normally eaten . Personally , I might wonder what other shortcuts the purveyor had taken if they are lying about content ...
Honey should be stored at 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit Honey is similar in to olive oil and should be storaged between 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit according to <URL> : Similar to olive oil , honey should be stored at a cool temperature between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit . So , it 's best to store it away from your oven or stove . Also , it should not be refrigerated . Extreme changes in temperature will spoil the flavor of honey . Looks like this confirms that you may want to keep it in a cool place and away from hot temperature where it would cause honey to degrade in quality . <URL> continues : Remember Do not store honey in a refrigerator or near a stove or oven .

You can freeze roux and store it up to 6 months without any problems . I put them in plastic ice-tray forms until they are frozen , then move them to a refrigerator bag . Just keep following things in mind : Leave a bit of room in the container before putting it in the freezer - roux expands when freezing . Bring it to room temperature before using it .
You can probably get away with high heat , but you need to watch the liquid content . Since you 're not cooking something that is liquid and can circulate to heat evenly , you risk burning the food or having it dry out . I ca n't see any reason this needs to cook for such a long time . Ground beef is finely divided , so cooking for extended times wo n't benefit it that much . I 'd say bring it to a boil either on high in the crock pot or on the stove , then transfer to the crockpot for 2 + hours ( as long as you have ) .
A mixture of flour and water at room temperature is a very hospitable growth medium for many bacteria , yeasts , and molds ; and indefinitely is a long time ... Even if you are extremely vigilant when it comes to kitchen hygiene , the mixture will eventually start to grow some form of microbes . This process could take a week or more to become obvious . If you use the batch up within a week or so it is unlikely to cause any problems . For longer storage you should refrigerate the dough and/or add salt ( in the proportional amount you would use for bread ) . If it develops an off smell or visible mold you are better off throwing it away . Keep in mind that hydrating flour , especially whole grain flours , activates amylase enzymes that break down starches into simple sugars . This process , called autolysis , improves browning and flavor , but if allowed to go on too long it leads to a gummy crumb or poor overall structure .
Bitterness can come from underripe fruit ( although a lot of times they 'll just be sour or less flavorful ) , lack of juice is usually something that has been stored too long and dried out . A ripe mandarin or clementine should be firm but not hard with a good , bright citrusy fragrance . Rubbing your finger on the skin should impart some citrus oil ( unless it 's waxed of coated ... ) I think usually the smell is the best guideline for flavor , although I have still sometimes had a fruit that smells great and tastes pretty bland . But I think usually if they are really fragrant that 's a good sign . The skin should be somewhat loose-feeling . If the skin is tight on the fruit , it is either not ripe or it is drying out ( or it 's not a mandarin or clementine ) . Do n't squeeze the fruit and bruise it , but when you pick it up , there should be a bit of give in the skin . Mandarins and clementines have very thin skins , but these still have the sort of spongy texture of other citrus . Because they are thin , they dry out quickly . It 's hard to describe what drying citrus skin feels like - progressively rougher and harder than fresh , eventually turning into a crisp and brittle almost stony layer . I 'm sure you would notice far before it gets to that stage , but it 's not going to happen overnight . ( But the fruit should n't be squishy or have soft spots , that is generally spoilage or damage . ) It should not feel dry and hard . A juicy citrus will feel heavy for its size , although for really small ones that 's kind of hard to judge . One more thing to note , though , is that most of the time , the whole batch of whatever type of fruit at the grocery store or at a particular market stall at any given time will very likely come from the same source . While there might be some better and some worse ones , overall they 'll probably be pretty similar , unless you can clearly see that some are older or from a different source . If you 're not sure about a batch , just buy a couple and then get more after you see that they 're good . ( And if you find some great ones , buy a lot and freeze some for juice for later . )
Not sure if there is a correct way . It 's basically skewered hunks of meat on a wood fired BBQ You can do your own Churrasqueira by using a Weber " kettle " style BBQ or a B.D.S. ( Big Drum Smoker ) . Use long steel skewers ( or swords ! ) for your meat and BBQ away Thick steaks of beef and lamb work well . Also try chicken drumsticks and some small Chorizo ( spicy sausage ) Do n't marinate the meat , but toss some coarse salt onto the meat surface before and during cooking . Do n't go crazy with it , but it seems to absorb the roasting flavours and really boost the taste Use a smoky fire , if your wood wo n't smoke add some fresh wood or herbs that do . Try lavender bush ( wood and flower ) , grape vine or kiwifruit vine cuttings , or any other fresh cut aromatic wood Watch the amount of fat dripping onto the hot coals ; too much will make the meat taste bad . Shield the coals as required or trim off large chunks of fat There is no need for motorised skewers that takes the fun out of it . Occasionally turn the meat by hand while enjoying your favourite beverage , and " chewing the fat " with a friend Serve by taking a skewer to the diners plate , and hold skewer nearly vertically above plate . Use an extra sharp carving knife and slice onto the plate with a downwards cut so juices and other slicing splatter goes onto the plate and not onto the diners If you are having a Churrasco party , give each diner a flippable symbol ( e.g. red/green ) to indicate to the server ( probably you ) " GIVE ME MORE ! " , or " I am stuffed " . Serve a round of each meat as their outer layer becomes done Coolest Churrasco cooker I could find The rails on the top are what the skewers rest on Following the car theme , some more cool Churrasco cookers here <URL>
Foor food safety , the recommendation means that the coolest part of the meat should reach the target temperature . For something like a beef or pork roast , the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast . For chicken or turkey , it will often be where the leg joins the body . You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading . Now , because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature , the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven . How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is . In other words , a large roast will have a greater thermal mass -- more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature , and the heat will transfer into the coolest point , raising its ultimate temperature . So , the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained . To err on the side of food safety , keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature . With a little experience , you 'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts , and remove it from the oven earlier . The bottom line however , is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature .
Try a <URL> . This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time ( weeks , not days ) .
The biggest indicator I 've found of quality dried pasta is how rough it feels when you rub it between your fingers . Compare Barilla and De Cecco spaghetti to see what I mean . The best brands use copper dies when extruding their pasta and this lends a rougher texture that will hold sauce better than plastic or teflon extruded pastas .
You should always try to first bring hot quinoa to room temperature and follow the rest which you already mentioned . That works great , else if you try to pack it when it like burning hot , then the steam kind of stays in the packed room which later creates moisture and later spoils the food even though you keep it in the refrigerator . Best worked for me is by cooking quinoa in the night . Now I have lot of time to bring it to room temperature followed by pack it , store it and use it .
Room temperature for sure ! Eating something like salami chilled detracts from its flavour . Obviously you want to be a bit careful about leaving it out for a really long time , but I usually take anything I want to eat out of the fridge well before consumption .
<URL> by the guys over at <URL> ( and also a <URL> ) with almost everything you 'd ever want to know about chips . That first recipe is supposedly good even after they 've cooled off : Our standard fries are good even when cold . Another option is to cook a lot of chips but stop after their first frying and freeze them ; when you want to eat them , simply put the frozen chips into the fryer for the second frying . This also has added benefits : Freezing acts like partial dehydration . When the frozen fries are finished , they liberate water freely , leading to rapid dehydration and good crust formation with a porous interior . Pre-frozen fries are crunchier than fresh and stay crisper longer after they are fried , but they tend toward hollow fry .
Very high fat , thoroughly marbled ribeye is a good start , but there 's a fair amount of variation . The extremely thin slices are also not something that every butcher is accustomed to producing , but that should get you to the right beginning .
I 'd be more concerned about the meat 's safety than taste/texture . " Warm " thawing creates the perfect environment for bacteria growth . That having been said , my experience mainly involves the use of a microwave to thaw meat . When microwaving meat to thaw , try to avoid the meat having corners or protrusions . This adversely affects taste/texture because they usually start to cook before the rest of the meat thaws . Freeze ground meat , in a circular shape with a hole in the middle for quickest microwave thawing time . When thawing meat ' parts ' place them in a circle , thickest side outward . So long as no noticeable cooking has started , the taste/texture should be fine . Cook immediately .
The searing applied after sous-viding should not be enough to alter the temperature of the meat notably . All you 're trying to do with the sear is create the flavorful crust on the outside of a piece of meat via the Maillard reaction , not accomplish any cooking of the interior of the meat itself . This is best done by applying very high heat for a very short amount time , usually just a few seconds . Some like doing this via pan-searing or on a very hot grill , but I usually use a high-powered blowtorch . The important thing is that you not sear for so long that interior of the meat has a chance to notice . A perfectly sous-vided piece of meat should be a uniform color throughout , except for a heavily seared crust . There should n't be any gray band of over-cooked meat under the crust . Avoiding that is why you 're sous-viding in the first place . Also , I find 125-130 ° F to be a touch on the rare side . For a good medium rare , 133-135 ° F gives me better results .
While the above suggestions would get rid of the oil splatter problem , they would also result in overcooked meat with a soggy exterior , as all the water created during frying ( for example , chicken releases a lot of juice ) would remain in the pan and steam the meat instead of frying it . Your best bet is to get something called a splatter screen . I 've seen one at <URL> , and at walmart , and I would assume kitchen supply stores would carry it too . A splatter screen is basically a fine metal mesh lid with a handle that fits over a variety of pans/pots and while it allows the steam to escape it also prevents the oil from splattering everywhere by catching in it the fine mesh . The best $ 10 you 'll ever spend .
The real , original Wiener Schnitzel is veal . Definitely . I ca n't link to a web source now , but I have some German cook books at home , including one solely about different kinds of schnitzel . From the veal , you use parts 6 , 7 and 11 for any kind of schnitzel , 7 being the best and highest-prized choice . I do n't know the English names , maybe somebody can supply them . Also , try using leaner meat . I think that in the US , the fat marbled beef is considered higher quality . But in Europe , lean beef is preferred . A good beef schnitzel has maybe 3 % fat . This said , there are lots of places which cook pork schnitzels in the Wiener style and call them Wiener Schnitzel . It is n't traditional , but if you like the taste , there is nothing against doing it that way at home . They come from the same parts of the pig as the veal schnitzel : the ham and the lower back . Again , they should be very lean . And in both cases , unlike a steak , a schnitzel is always boneless .
The smoke produced from a heated oil is n't all too different from the smoke produced by a fire . You are essentially burning that oil and causing rapid , incomplete oxidation ( or rather <URL> ) . In actual fact , the peroxidation will start to occur long before you hit the smoke point ; however , smoking is an indicator that this is happening very rapidly . The net effect is very similar to that of rancidity , in that it will produce many <URL> and <URL> , and while this is n't the place to be debating whether or not that 's bad for you , I will simply point to the aforementioned link on free radicals and say that at the present time , the prevailing belief is that these free radicals have deleterious effects . It 's up to you decide what level of risk is acceptable to you . The effect may in fact be identical to that of rancidity , although I ca n't confirm that with a source at this time ; all I know is that heating an oil up to its smoke point will increase the oxidation rate ( make it go rancid faster ) , and rancidity in turn lowers the smoke point , so the two are definitely related . So what I 'd say is , if you do n't mind the idea of occasionally eating rancid fat , then go ahead and smoke it all you want ; otherwise , you might want to be more careful . <URL> , even if the actual ingestion is n't . So again , be careful . Avoid overheating oil if you can . By the way , saturated fats like coconut oil , animal fat or ( clarified ! ) butter tend to have the most immunity to this particular chemical breakdown , as evidenced by their naturally higher ( unrefined ) smoke points . Lipid peroxidation works on the double bonds , which do n't exist in saturated fats ( polyunsaturated fats have the most ) .

Is storing homeade dressing with garlic powder safe ?
Short answer : Homemade salad dressing , even with garlic , is generally considered safe , for a time frame of up to a week . While some strains of botulism can grow slowly at refrigerator temperatures , in general botulism requires three things to grow in addition to having spores present : Low salt , low acid environment Low oxygen environment Temperatures above about 35 to 40 F ( depending on the strain ) Garlic is one of the foods at risk for having botulism spores present . Your recipe is vinegar based , and so is acidic . With the olive oil , the total dressing may be under the 3 % threshold that completely inhibits botulism growth -- especially when the dressing loses its emulsification and separates into layers , some layers may be less acidic . Still , your strongest protection is the refrigeration , combined with the acid , and the short time frame . <URL> specifies that plain garlic and oil ( much more at risk due to the lack of acid ) can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week . You can therefore infer that with the additional acid , you will get at least the same week of safety , although I would hesitate to go longer as safety issues always warrant conservative assumptions .
The short answer to your question is YES . The extra acid in the ingredients will hamper the second act of the double acting baking powder . The acids are timed/staged for reaction not the baking soda . The Magic Baking Powder ( happens to be in our kitchen , too ) is mostly a single acting formula since monocalcium-phosphate is a low temperature acid ( with apparently some double acting properties due to generation intermediate step of dicalcium phosphate ; per your link ) . High temperature acid for second acts typically include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminum phosphate and sodium acid pyrophosphate . You can try to counteract that by adding a bit of baking soda , but you run the risk of altering the taste and not having it all neuralized . If you really want to get pedantic , use a pH meter to measure the acidity of your dough . I suspect tasting the dough might give an indication as well . ( bitter alkaline , sour acidic ) Another test might be to mix your acidic ingredients in a bowl with some water and start adding measured baking soda until you see no more reaction ( bubbles ) and use that as a your basic of neutralizing your dough . All said and done , I agree with SAJ14SAJ that you 'll be just fine going with the existing recipe . There should be enough baking soda left to get something out of your double act . I also heard it from a world-class baker that most recipes can be done with only baking soda , let alone baking powder or double acting ones .
It would certainly be safe . Vermouth is a fortified wine , meaning that it is wine with added alcohol . The added alcohol gives the vermouth a much longer shelf life , even at room temperature after the bottle is opened . You can store open vermouth for at least several months without any discernible loss of quality . It will continue to be safe indefinitely as long as the bottle is kept closed , keeping the alcohol from evaporating . That said , I can see no reason why two vermouths could n't be mixed in advance . As a matter of fact , you could add the bourbon too . Perhaps some kind of alcohol super-taster could tell the difference , but I sincerely doubt that any mere mortal would be able to tell the difference between a just-mixed Manhattan and one that was mixed 3 months ago ( assuming , of course , an airtight container ) .
Butchered meat is generally sterile except on its exterior . ( That does n't mean parasite - or botulism-free , but it 's a start . ) Get the best quality you can from a source you trust . Keep it at as low a temperature as possible , and do n't expose it to warm air for more than the few minutes it takes to prepare . Cut with a clean knife on a clean surface . Put it right back into the fridge at a very low temp . Salt and acid , if you use them in your sauce , will provide some anti-bacterial benefits , but this is not foolproof . People all over the world eat raw meat , but it 's best to start with small amounts and see how your system handles it . If you 're a child/pregnant/old / sick , it 's much less of a good idea .
I discussed a similar subject in this question : <URL> Raw fish is n't safe to eat if it 's just been sitting around . However , the raw fish used in sushi/sashimi has been frozen ( typically flash-frozen ) in order to kill any parasites , making it as safe as any other food . Most distributors of sashimi also have their own methods and internal regulations to ensure food safety , but specifics are understandably hard to come by . Suffice it to say , it 's far safer to eat properly-prepared nigiri or sashimi than it is to eat an undercooked hamburger .
I 've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses . Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer . You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1 , but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness . Increasing the amount of instant coffee , however , would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want . Also , instant coffee takes longer to dissolve , so it needs to be added straight to a liquid . There 's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes , such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes , because the recipe has no water in it in the first place . In the rare recipes where there is water , you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water + espresso powder , and this would likely work fairly well . So , summing up : there 's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I 've found with some significant experimentation . Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me .
I suppose the Belgian " curry ketchup " is similar to the German varieties and no , they are usually not only seasoned with curry powder , but also other spices . There is no standard seasoning mix for curry ketchup , but common additional spices are ginger , black pepper , paprika , cayenne or other chili powders . I also think that some brands contain onions . The brownisher colour of curry ketchup is mostly because of the turmeric in the curry powder , so just adding the powder to regular ketchup will get you a colour match even without the additional spices or ingredients .
There are three signs you want to look for on garlic that indicate you may not want to use it : Signs of mold , especially black mold . Discard the garlic . Soft to finger pressure . It is rotten . Discard . Sprouted . While it is still safe to eat ( if it does n't have other issues ) , it may be bitter . Good garlic should be quite hard when pressed with your fingers , and preferably is not sprouted . Some people even remove the green core of partially or beginning to sprout garlic when they prep .
Up to 7 days ( homemade mayo as well ) . Egg whites/yolks out of the egg ( but not combined with the acid ) can last 3-4 days refrigerated , and eggs in-shell are good for 2-4 weeks depending on processing .
Baking powder , especially if too great a quantity is used , adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good . Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly does n't do anything to enhance the flavor . Many baked goods traditionally do n't use a chemical leavener at all , but instead rely on technique . Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created . Yeast , on the other hand , creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread . Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes ( <URL> , for example , although many " knock off " recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness ) . Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network ( usually something you absolutely do n't want in a quick bread or quick cake ) -- you do n't get a crumb with big , airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid . Also , in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge . The shelf life is not so different . If yeast scares you , you may want to check out some of the proponents of the <URL> technique . For a lot more information on this subject , there is a recent publication that covers all sorts of <URL> .
Not long at all . Usually 1 minute is enough . If it starts to turn brown , it 's been in there too long .
Whey is an excellent source of protein and whey protein in particular is used in many body-building supplements . Please see the excerpt below from <URL> . Drink Up ! -- The acidic tang of whey may be a bit of an acquired tasted but I actually find it refreshing . Cultured whey has pro-biotics that can help balance the microflora in your gut as an extra bonus to the protein . The web page gives a lot of information about whey and the many other uses for it as well as a great tip for storing . Hope this helps !
Short answer : Homemade salad dressing , even with garlic , is generally considered safe , for a time frame of up to a week . While some strains of botulism can grow slowly at refrigerator temperatures , in general botulism requires three things to grow in addition to having spores present : Low salt , low acid environment Low oxygen environment Temperatures above about 35 to 40 F ( depending on the strain ) Garlic is one of the foods at risk for having botulism spores present . Your recipe is vinegar based , and so is acidic . With the olive oil , the total dressing may be under the 3 % threshold that completely inhibits botulism growth -- especially when the dressing loses its emulsification and separates into layers , some layers may be less acidic . Still , your strongest protection is the refrigeration , combined with the acid , and the short time frame . <URL> specifies that plain garlic and oil ( much more at risk due to the lack of acid ) can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week . You can therefore infer that with the additional acid , you will get at least the same week of safety , although I would hesitate to go longer as safety issues always warrant conservative assumptions .
Bearing in mind the salmonella statistics given above. , yes it is safe to eat raw eggs so long as you are not very young , very old , or immunocompromised in some way -- e.g. HIV , chemotherapy , leukemia , etc. .
No , spices are commonly sold as " X powder " or " ground X " . As far as I can tell , they are likely the same thing . The only thing I might imagine would be different would be the size of the grind . I would imagine yes , you can substitute one for the other . eg : <URL>
You 'll be fine doing a straight substitution . Well , maybe I should n't be so definitive since these are powders we 're talking about and it 's not quite the same thing , but I 've substituted buttermilk for whole milk in bread recipes plenty of times . The only thing that changed for me was the rising time . When I use buttermilk in my sandwich bread , it needs an extra 20 minutes or so on the first rise compared to the whole milk version .
It is almost certainly safe unless it was left out at warm temperatures to spoil , or has molded , or otherwise spoiled in a manner not directly related to being uncovered . It may , however , be unpalatable due to : Drying out Picking up flavors or odors from other items in the refrigerator Since you are eating it relatively quickly , if you are not experiencing these issues , your practice should be just fine . My own personal preferred method is to put my cheese chunks in a zip lock type bag , which substantially cuts down on the drying , especially for moister cheeses like mozzarella or semi-firm cheddar .
In fact , although the risk is low , the <URL> does recommend soaking in the refrigerator , or using the quick soak method as opposed to an overnight room temperature soak : To be on the safe side , it would be advisable to use the quick soak method : Bring water and beans to a boil , cover and boil for 2 minutes . Remove from heat and let stand 1 hour . Drain and further cook . Similarly , the <URL> recommends ( emphasis added ) : A 12-hour soak in cold water before cooking helps hydrate the beans and considerably shortens cooking time . Ideally , beans should be put to soak the night before they are to be prepared and be kept in a cool place , or in the refrigerator , to avoid any fermentation taking place . Before soaking , wash them several times in cold water and remove any damaged or split beans . Discard any particles floating in the soaking water , such as small insects from the harvest , specks of dirt or other contaminants .
I do n't know that there are studies on using different kinds of kelp with beans , but I have used both kombu strips and kelp granules interchangeably when cooking beans . The results seem to be the same either way .
Typically that would be whatever was used for dusting the loaves or the bannetons , either flour , starch or sometimes <URL> . It is done to prevent sticking and for decorative purposes - often both : <URL> ( <URL> )

What can I substitute for the egg used to seal egg rolls ?
Flour paste . Mix flour with water and a bit of salt . Go for a thick glaze-like consistency , and use it instead of the egg . Give it at least 10 minutes to hold before frying , and try to hold the edges closed with tongs when initially frying .
It 's a different flavor . Romano is sharper , more grassy ; parmesan is nuttier and sweeter . I actually prefer romano where I have a lot of other strong flavors . If there 's other sharp flavors in a dish , such as olives , chili pepper , or capers ( e.g. , puttanesca ) , I 'll go with romano which seems to stand up better to the robust flavors . For something with a more subtle flavor such as a ragu bolognese , butter or cream-based sauces , risotto , etc. . I feel that a good parmeggiano reggiano can stand up to the other flavors in the dish without overwhelming them . If cost is your main concern , I 've had some parms from Argentina that are actually pretty good . Reggiano is definitely better , but depending on what you 're using it for , it might be an option . I would n't use it in something like a risotto or fettuchine alfredo where it plays a key role in the dish , but if you 're just grating it on top it will work fine . An in-between option is Grana Padano , which is advertised as a " budget " substitute for reggiano . In my experience , it 's pretty good , but where I live it 's only a little cheaper .
Sumac is commonly used a tart flavoring element in the eastern Mediterranen region . Historians believe that it was the common sour element in cooking for that area prior to domestication of lemons . It is a characteristic seasoning element in Fatoush , a Syrian bread salad . It 's not usually available in the mainstream spice section of most grocery stores . The best place to locate it is in mid-eastern markets , delis , upscale stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca or online through P <URL> or the <URL> .
I found a highly rated <URL> on food.com . I have n't personally tried it , but it 's highly rated on that site , and is ridiculously simple . 1 16 oz block of cream cheese 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream Blend until smooth Try it and let us know ? :)
the wire egg slicers seem to be free of this problem . Perhaps you could use a wire , or better yet the wire cutting tool that potters use for clay .
Pretty much no , they are totally non-alike . The beauty of brisket is that it is full of connective tissue and other odd stuff that translates to succulence when cooked low and slow . Round is pretty much the opposite , it has very little in the way of interest .
Long story short : It 's the acid , and any acid will do . Food colourings are a type of dye known as an <URL> . Their effectiveness relies on hydrogen bonding which only works in an acidic environment . It 's not that the vinegar does anything special - not exactly . Rather , adding a few drops of food colouring to a large amount of water would give you something that 's not acidic at all , which will diminish or totally eliminate its effectiveness as a dye . Including vinegar in the mix simply allows you to stretch your rations , so to speak - to dilute the colouring in a whole lot of liquid without making it useless as a dye in the process . Basically , you 're creating a <URL> , which is a well-known term in the textile world , as it 's used to dye wool and other fabrics . Warm temperatures ( 140-180 ° F ) also aid in dye absorption , and apparently - although I 'm no expert in textiles - a small amount of Urea also helps . You could definitely use cream of tartar , citric acid or any other acid , but the recipes using vinegar are generally aiming for a specific pH , so you 'll want to adjust quantities of any other acidifier to match . Presumably , vinegar is just the cheapest and most widely available acidifier .
I have always wondered how in anglosaxon speaking countries , people think that " mint " is always the same as " mint " , just because it has the same name . In fact , spearmint tastes as different from peppermint as thymian from oregano . Almost all cooking recipes I know of are meant for spearmint , except for some sweet applications . All mint tea I have encountered is made from peppermint , not from spearmint . So while you can use dried spearmint instead of fresh mint , using mint tea is a bad idea , unless yours happens to be an exception made from spearmint . You could try finding out if a herbs seller has dried spearmint , but you must remember that it has less aroma than fresh spearmint . Also , dried mint does approximate the aroma of the fresh one when used as a herb , but when used in big quantities ( you mention 1 cup ) as a vegetable on its own right , the substitution is much more problematic , because juiciness and texture are much more different . I do n't know about the situation where you live , but spearmint is n't used much in Western countries , except maybe England , so it is seldom available at supermarkets and costs a lot there . A better source are Turkish grocery shops , where it is as common as parsley , and the price is comparable . If there are Turkish shops nearby , it is definitely worth trying to find it there . For a longer term solution , it might be a good idea to grow your own spearmint in pots . The plant is quite unassuming and easy to care for , and a kitchen which smells of fragrant herbs is nicer than one which smells of frying grease or cleaning products .
You could use Red Pepper Coulis : Roast red peppers on grill , gas flame or cut off the sides and place skin side up under broiler until skins are blackened . Cool and remove charred skin . <URL> and garlic in a little olive oil with salt and pepper until softened . Add the charred roasted red peppers and some chicken stock . Simmer until vegetables are very soft and puree with an immersion blender , food processor or regular blender . Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary . Thin with additional stock according to consistency desired/needed . Add basil , oregano , Italian seasoning blend to season as desired .
Fenugreek seeds are intensely aromatic and go quite nicely in curries , and any dish where such a flavour is required . In the middle-east they use it quite a lot , often as a condiment . Highly used in spice rubs , pickles , marinades , anything where a strong spice flavour is required and often in puddings as an aromatic like nutmeg is used in English cooking . The leaves have a similar flavour , but not quite the same , you could use the seeds in their place adding them in to the spice mix if there is one , but the leaves I prefer personally . The flavour of methi leaves in thepla or in curry is wonderful in my opinion .
This is what I use currently - a drill on a high speed using the micro mixer attachement . I think <URL> on low would work as well , but I do n't have that one . When I make waffles for 4 people , I use 4 yolks and my immersion blender gets the traction needed , but for two yolks I need a narrow glass and this .
Use part of the shell you just cracked to scoop it up ; it will attract the broken bit . Also , if you frequently end up with bits of shell in your eggs , you should revise your cracking technique . Eggs should be cracked on a flat surface ( countertop or plate ) not a sharper surface like the edge of a bowl .
Wikipedia , as well as all 12 serbian recipes I found specify full-fat white brine cheese ( cow or sheep milk ) . Only one of them called for a type of cream in addition to the cheese . In Western Europe , Turkish groceries can carry typical Balkan white brine cheese . If you do n't have access to one , buy feta . Cow and sheep cheese are considered substitutes in Balkan cuisine - the cooks are aware that they have a difference in flavor , but they use what they have at hand , similar to the way that an apple recipe will call for crisp apples , but wo n't specify Pink Crisp or Elstar apples . So both cow and sheep feta will do in principle . But I have noticed that supermarkets sometimes carry expensive real Greek feta , which is high quality , and only cheap western-made cow feta-style cheese , which is of inferior quality and has a rubber texture . If you are not sure of the quality , go for the real imported feta ( which will be sheep ) , not the feta-style .
If your caramel rolls are the kind with a sticky , gooey mass in the bottom of the pan that is flipped upside down out of the pan , then I would say that the rolls wo n't really get good and caramely in a stoneware pan . You 'd be better off baking one pan of rolls at a time in the metal pan . While one pan is rising and baking , just chill the other part of the dough ... either plain in a bowl , or prepared into a log that only needs to be cut . If the caramel rolls are more like a cinnamon bun , then the stoneware dishes should do fine in a pinch . This is assuming they are glazed stoneware and not terra cotta . Cooking time will increase a bit as the stoneware will take longer to heat up ( it will also retain the heat longer when removed from the oven ) . You could always just go out and buy some foil pans . I do that when I make rolls ( caramel , cinnamon , and sticky ) for the local fire company 's carnival . They go through 17 = 20 dozen rolls each year . I know baking rolls can be a lot of work , so what I have found to be very helpful , is to make the dough the night before baking . Cover with cling film , and let it have a slow rise in the fridge all night . ( you will get improved flavor too . ) The next day , divide the cold dough up and prepare as usual . They will take a little longer for the rise in the pan after shaping , but it sure is a lot easier on you .
春卷 ( Chūnjuǎn , Spring rolls ) are julienned vegetables , sometimes with a bit of noodles , sometimes with a bit of minced meat , wrapped with a flour dough skin and pan - or deep-fried . They are a filled roll . You can see the different varieties by country here : <URL> Spring roll : 鸡蛋卷 ( Jīdàn juǎn , Egg rolls ) are many different things around the world . In Chinese communities , these typically refer to a sweet biscuit type roll , of hollow flaky egg pastry ( not filled . ) However , there is also another variety ( common in American Chinese cuisine ) where a flour dough wrap is filled with " pork , shrimp , or chicken , adding cabbage , carrots , bean sprouts and other vegetables , and then deep fried . " In the American Chinese respect , I believe it is very similar to a Spring roll really , although the flour dough looks thicker and of a different composition than a typical Spring roll ( the dough bubbles when deep-fried , with Spring roll skin it does not . ) <URL> Sweet egg roll : American Chinese egg roll :
Like Bob said , surely boiling some noodles is way less of a bother than breaking out the pasta machine ? If you really want to make fresh pasta , I do n't see any reason you could n't use it for lasagna without boiling it - the reason one boils dry noodles is because it 's hard to get them to soften in the time it takes to bake the lasagna . But just like when cooking fresh noodles , you need to be careful not to overcook it , so make sure all your fillings are fully cooked before you start layering . It also should be perfectly fine to not cut the noodles into strips - the reason dried noodles come that way is for easier handling . It is possible to make lasagna using dried lasagna noodles without boiling them first , but you need to add more water and bake it longer . A search for " no-boil lasagna " will turn up scores of recipes .
If you whisk egg whites to much they will definitely separate . Basically you are over tightening their stretchy proteins which squeeze out all the water . You are left with useless protein fluff floating on water . The flavor and odor will not change , however . That would be a sign off spoiling and unrelated to the whisking .
You can stuff any pepper which is large enough . Poblano are moderately spicy . You can use bell peppers , but they will not be spicy . You might want to make up for that by including some spicier small peppers in your stuffing , perhaps a serrano or a jalapeno or seventeen , depending on your personal taste .
Chefs are really fast at cooking . It 's what they do . A chef can almost effortlessly crack an egg with one-hand in about a second . Scrambled eggs would be pre-cracked and beaten prior to the cooking-shift .
It appears to be feasible ! I found <URL> in which a " cooking expert " gives a specific recipe : Frozen egg tempura Remove the shell of a frozen egg and cut the egg in half lengthwise without thawing . A peeled egg is slippery , so put a paper towel on the cutting board before you place the egg on the board . Lightly flour the halves of the egg all over , and dip it in a mixture of three tablespoons of tempura flour and two tablespoons of water . Deep-fry the egg in oil heated at 160 C for about three minutes . They 're not too specific about the results , but I imagine they 'd have mentioned if it exploded or anything ! <URL> mentions doing essentially the same thing for a scotch egg : Freeze the raw egg in its shell , de-shell the frozen raw egg and wrap the sausage meat around it whilst it is still frozen . This can be difficult as the egg 's albumen defrosts quickly . Coat in flour , egg and breadcrumb . Fry till the scotch egg floats and the crumb is a deep golden brown . It 's the only way I know that gives a soft runny yolk every time . I do n't know what frying temperature was used , and it 's got sausage and breading around the egg rather than just tempura batter , but it 's a deep-fried egg , starting from raw/frozen , and produces a soft yolk .

What is a halogen burner or ( ? ) cooktop ? How does it work ?
Halogen hobs are a type of electrical resistive hob which work just like a halogen incandescent bulb . In fact , the reason why incandescent bulbs are being phased out is that they are so inefficient , giving off most of the energy they use as heat instead of light . A halogen hob uses the same kind of tungsten filament as the lamps , instead of the iron found in the widespread electrical hobs . The benefit is that it warms up quite fast , much faster than iron . I have n't shopped for resistive cooktops in recent years , so I do n't know how the market is . It 's possible that they are very rare and expensive , or that all the new ceramic cooktops use them and the manufacturers do n't mention it on the label , so the public is unaware of it . They do n't work differently than standard burners , just faster , and they do n't look much different from the outside . You also do n't need any kind of special cookware for them , I have no idea why the manufacturer of that pan decided to tell you that it works on both " electric " and " halogen " , when it is the same thing where pan suitability is concerned . Update as per ChrisH 's comment : Because the halogen works mostly with radiant heat , it 's important that you do n't use a pan with mirroring bottom , that 's probably why the pan was labelled as suitable for halogen besides " electric " . This is probably important for iron-heating ceramic cooktops too , because the ceramic also lets a significant part of the iron 's radiant heat through .
The cream whipper relies on gas expansion to work . When you make whipped cream by beating , you beat fine air bubbles into the cream . The cream traps air and becomes essentially a matrix that holds those bubbles -- a foam . Your gas-charged whipper does the same thing in a totally different way . When you charge the whipper with gas , there 's high gas pressure inside with the cream . The cream will actually absorb the nitrous oxide you put in . Because of the pressure , the gas absorbed can be thought of as really really really small bubbles within the cream . So you have a matrix of gas and cream , but because the bubbles are so small , it 's essentially just cream . Chilled liquids more easily absorb gases at high pressure , which is why it 's good to use cold cream and keep the whole unit in the fridge . A limited amount of agitation ( shaking ) exposes more cream to the gas , improving absorption . When you release the cream from the device , the absorbed gas expands rapidly . The bubbles get bigger , and your cream to bubble ratio becomes more like the foam that we know as whipped cream . It 's really exactly the same thing , only with nitrous oxide instead of plain ol' boring air inside the bubbles . Why nitrous oxide ? As I understand it , it 's because it 's the cheapest non-toxic , odorless and tasteless gas you can get . Carbon dioxide would almost be a good choice , but unfortunately it 's bitter . Not a good match for cream . Finally , why is shaking too much a bad thing ? That one I do n't know for sure , but I know what happens when you over-whip cream with the mixer . You make butter . Perhaps the gas or high pressure encourages this conversion , or maybe you 're just churning it that much when you over-shake . Either way , I 'm sure you 've essentially made butter when you shook it too much .
" Shortness " in dough refers to its tenderness which is influenced by the amount of fat as well as sugar . If your quiche recipe is calling for a short dough , it would be referring to a higher ratio of fat since pastry for quiche typically does n't include sugar . Both fat and sugar minimize and break down gluten development which results in " short " protein strands and thus a more tender result . As the fat is rubbed into the flour glutenin ( providing strength ) and gliadin ( providing elasticity ) are coated with the fat which acts as a lubricant to keep the two from being able to link together forming gluten when liquid is added to the mix . The higher the amount of fat in a dough the more tender it will be . If you want a dough to be flaky then you 'd leave the fat in larger particles which will blister to form flakes . If you want a dough that will be moisture resistant to fillings ( such as a quiche ) then work that fat in finely so that it will be less likely to absorb moisture during and after baking . Quiche crusts ( and crusts for other custard based pies ... pumpkin , sweet potato , custard , etc ) should first be blind-baked for the crispest crust in the finished result . As for " fixing " a pastry dough ... it 's usually easiest and best to simply start over . Water is added a little at a time to avoid adding too much . If too much water is used then more flour needs to be added but with the excessive flour and water then comes additional gluten . If you get a pastry dough too wet , I would be inclined to rub some additional fat into flour and then add that to the first dough rather than just flour alone . Too little shortening will really only be noticed after baking and that 's going to be determined through how tough or tender the dough is . Keep in mind that toughness also depends on the amount you 've handled it . Short doughs typically ca n't be handled too much because the higher amount of fat means that they will warm and get sticky . It is best to refrigerate to firm up the fat rather than add flour as the flour simply dries it out . The tender nature of the dough from sugar means that in some cases they can be impossible to roll out and transfer to a pan . In this case they are usually put into the bottom of the pan and then patted out across the bottom and up the side .
You should always try to first bring hot quinoa to room temperature and follow the rest which you already mentioned . That works great , else if you try to pack it when it like burning hot , then the steam kind of stays in the packed room which later creates moisture and later spoils the food even though you keep it in the refrigerator . Best worked for me is by cooking quinoa in the night . Now I have lot of time to bring it to room temperature followed by pack it , store it and use it .
Corn ( Maize ) is <URL> , and not any of the other things you mention . Even the farmers and agricultural agencies consider it a grain - it 's one of the " official grains of Canada " and regulated by the <URL> . I 'm not sure when or why it started being called a vegetable , but as far as the culinary definition goes , it has far too much sugar and starch to fall properly into that category . The typical culinary definition of a vegetable is savory , not sweet . Botanically , the kernels can be considered a type of fruit called a <URL> ( AKA a grain ) , although it 's not normally eaten as fruit ( for one thing , it 's normally cooked ) . It may accompany vegetables reasonably well , just like rice or many other grains . But it is a grain .
You need 1.1 x as much water as pasta for al dente ! I measured this myself , cooking penne rigate ( in water , not sauce ) - 200g of pasta weighed 420g after being cooked and thoroughly drained . The estimate below from the nutrition facts is 1.4 x , which probably corresponds to typical American overcooked pasta - a surprisingly large difference from mine . I 'm guessing you 'll be somewhere between , maybe 1.25 x . You can also ballpark it from nutrition facts . <URL> has 31g carbs per 100g pasta , and <URL> has 75g carbs per 100g pasta . So 100g dry pasta turns into 100g * 75/31 = 242g of cooked pasta , meaning the added water was ~ 1.4 x the weight of the pasta . So for a pound of pasta , that 's 1.4 pounds or about 2 2/3 cups of water . Given people 's tastes , this might be a little past al dente , so I would personally start with maybe 1.25 cups of water then add a little more if necessary . ( I 'll also try cooking pasta normally and weighing it if I get a chance . ) Note : if you have a significantly different variety of pasta , it will obviously behave differently . This is for pasta that 's 13 % protein and 75 % carbohydrates . For the standard 2oz/56g ( dry ) serving on the package , it 'll say 7g protein and 41-42g carbohydrates . I checked Barilla , De Cecco , Ronzonni , Garofalo , Safeway store brand , Trader Joe 's store brand , and those nutrition facts , and they all matched . If you 're branching out to other styles like whole grains or egg noodles , things will obviously change , but things are very uniform in the US .
" Folding " is a more gentle mixing technique than " stirring " and " mixing " . Stirring and mixing both denote a more vigorous action . Folding is usually used for items where something has previously been whipped ( such as egg whites or cream ) or where tenderness is desired and thus less mixing is advisable ( muffins &amp; biscuits ) . Folding is usually done with a rubber spatula ( for liquid &amp; dry ingredients ) or with a wire whisk ( often beneficial for whipped cream and egg whites so that the mixture gently incorporates as it falls through the wires ) . To " fold " ingredients together : Hold the spatula or whisk in your dominant hand and grasp the far edge of the bowl ( side that is away from you ) with your non-dominant hand . Turn the bowl towards you with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously scraping around the edge ( also toward you ) and finish by folding the mixture over on top of itself . Return both hands to the far side of the bowl and follow-up by cutting through the center of the mixture with your utensil and once again folding the mix over on top of itself ( again , turning the bowl simultaneously ) . Alternate scraping around the side and through the middle of the bowl until the mixture is just combined together . Note that if an airy mixture such as egg whites or whipped cream start to go from soft and billowy to more liquid-like , you are overworking it and need to stop to maintain volume . In the case of whipped cream and egg whites you typically add a small portion to the heavier mixture and actually DO stir this in . While yes you 're losing some of the volume of that portion , it serves to help lighten the heavier batter/mixture . The rest of the whites/cream are then folded in to the mix in several additions . Sometimes dry ingredients may be sift on top of whipped eggwhites before being folded . The larger the spatula or whisk , the fewer strokes that will need to be made and the better the results will be .
Visible cloudiness is a result of suspended particles of about 1 micrometer ( micron ) or larger in size . Technically , just about any juice could in theory be filtered to remove those particles . But there are a couple things going on here . First , any filtering , clarification , etc. does cause some modification of flavor . Flavor compounds can be much smaller than 1 micron , but how they 're perceived can be modified by larger particles that contribute to mouthfeel and by their relative concentrations . If you 're measuring against the raw food , any change subtly modifies how it tastes . A raw tomato tastes slightly different from tomato juice , which in turn tastes different than <URL> . This can have an especially strong impact on subtle flavors like vegetable juices . Second , 1 micron is pretty small . The average pore size for your <URL> is about 10-15 microns , meaning you have to go a full order of magnitude smaller in order to remove visible cloudiness . Besides physical filtration , there are other ways to do this like <URL> , but those may also remove things like suspended oils or specific flavor compounds . That might be okay if you mostly care about sweetness and you can add artificial flavors back later ( as with mass-produced juice blends ) but could be a problem if you 're going for a very " natural " flavor . In general , more filtering means more processing and more associated flavor change . Third , you 're right that there is a marketing aspect here . Consumers have grown used to certain types of juice being clear ( like apple juice ) and others being totally opaque ( like orange juice ) . A certain subset might also actually prefer clouded juices , seeing them as less processed ( which they generally are ) and therefore more " healthy " , regardless of whether that 's actually true . In short , you could filter just about any liquid clear through some means or another , but it will taste different , and will likely affect how much people will pay you for the result .

A halogen hob uses the same kind of tungsten filament as the lamps , instead of the iron found in the widespread electrical hobs . The benefit is that it warms up quite fast , much faster than iron . I have n't shopped for resistive cooktops in recent years , so I do n't know how the market is . It 's possible that they are very rare and expensive , or that all the new ceramic cooktops use them and the manufacturers do n't mention it on the label , so the public is unaware of it . They do n't work differently than standard burners , just faster , and they do n't look much different from the outside . You also do n't need any kind of special cookware for them , I have no idea why the manufacturer of that pan decided to tell you that it works on both " electric " and " halogen " , when it is the same thing where pan suitability is concerned . Update as per ChrisH 's comment : Because the halogen works mostly with radiant heat , it 's important that you do n't use a pan with mirroring bottom , that 's probably why the pan was labelled as suitable for halogen besides " electric " . This is probably important for iron-heating ceramic cooktops too , because the ceramic also lets a significant part of the iron 's radiant heat through .
I 'd presume they just mean dish soap and not some more powerful cleanser . With regard to additives , etc. . I guess whatever you are okay with normally should be okay . Obviously you have to rinse the trays thoroughly to get the soap off . I 've had a few dehydrators and there is nothing special about the plastic trays . I doubt they are dishwasher safe but I 've never put that to the test ( I suspect it would not work that well anyway ) . The trays can be pesky to clean if you 've used a marinade . The best thing I 've found for this is a small , soft circular brush .
Inside the rice cooker , there 's a thermostat monitoring the bowl 's temperature ( and kept in firm contact with the bowl via the spring ) . As long as the temperature does n't go above the boiling point of water , the rice cooker keeps cooking . Once it goes slightly above that point , the water must have all boiled off or been absorbed , and that means the rice is done , so the cooker switches to a much lower " keep warm " setting . This approach works only for foods that start wet and are done once the standing water is gone , which is why automatic rice cookers are common but there 's no comparably simple way to automatically cook pasta . Fancy rice cookers can be far more elaborate ( with microprocessors and whatnot ) , but simple rice cookers are very simple indeed , with no timing mechanism at all . This means they rely on putting in an appropriate amount of water for how much rice you are cooking . If you put in too little water , the rice cooker will stop when it 's gone but the rice wo n't be done . If you put in too much , you 'll get overcooked rice . Fortunately , rice is not super sensitive and you do n't have to measure carefully , but you need to get it approximately right . For different amounts of rice , you just have to scale the water accordingly . For lentils or beans , you 'll have to use a different water ratio , and you should look it up for the beans you have in mind ( and to make sure they can be cooked reasonably in a rice cooker in the first place ) ; I do n't know how to predict it from first principles .
In the oven , that heat is coming from all directions more or less equally . On the stovetop , the heat is coming only from the bottom . This can potentially cause convection , and almost certainly requires occasional stirring ( especially for larger batches ) , meaning that the ingredients are being moved around . The combination of the ingredients being heated more when they 're at the bottom and the movement can cause them to start breaking apart , and generally cook unevenly . Personally , I only find this to be an issue with beans and meat ( and it 's not something that 's going to cause failure ; it 's really just a refinement ) but if you are making an especially large batch of stew , you may want to try the oven .
Generally , slow-cooking means any food preparation method which relies on using low-heat for a long amount of time . Barbecues , smokers , luau pits , and low-heat ovens could all qualify . The benefit of slow-cooking , generally , is that food becomes incredibly tender , as all of its connective tissues break down . Also , flavor can infuse over time and provide deeper results than with virtually any other method . Lastly , long-cooking times create a celebratory atmosphere where food is the focal point of a social gathering . Specifically , slow-cooking refers to the ' slow-cooker ' a counter-top set-up which has a large , electronically heated ceramic bowl and a glass lid . It usually has only a few settings , such as ' low ' , ' medium ' , and ' high ' . The benefit of slow-cooking in a slow-cooker is mainly convenience . These units are safe enough to turn on before work and return to before dinner , with fully-cooked , piping hot food ready to go . The slow-cooker is geared towards ' one-pot ' recipes , which means they require minimal food preparation . You simply cut up the ingredients in fairly large chunks , add seasoning , and liquid , and that 's it . They are a favorite of working parents , but increasingly , also a device for more advanced experimentation .

Sure , why not ? It probably wo n't turn out quite like the stuff you get at the store , but all you need is cream , a way to churn air into it , and enough agitation that the milk fat molecules start to clump together . It will require some manual work once you 've got the butter and buttercream separated . But the food processor will get you most of the way there without too much of an arm workout .

Basically , a chutney is a kind of savoury jam . This is a very simplistic definition though . The main differences between jam and chutney are as follows : The preservation in jam is only by sugar . In chutney , vinegar and sugar are used together , so chutneys are not necessarily sweet . Jam is almost always made with fruit as the main ingredient . In chutney , fruit can be used , but so can vegetables . Also , chutneys tend to be a mix of more than one thing . For example , an apple chutney will have plenty of apples , but also swede and onion in it . Jams usually do not add other flavours to the fruit and sugar ( pectin is for texture ) . Chutneys are usually flavoured with several spices , as well as chili peppers , onions and garlic . In the Indian subcontinent , chutneys are served along with the meal in small amounts , as a condiment to add to the meal . They are usually eaten with the blander side/starter dishes like pakoras or samosas , rather than with the spicy and flavourful main dishes . In the rest of the former British Empire , and particularly in England , it is eaten on bread , with butter or cheese , in a similar way to jam or pickle . Note that what the English call pickle is also a sort of savoury jam , not pickled cucumbers like in America .
There is a lot of ambiguous and misused terminology in cooking ... added to that , different countries have specific legal definitions for foodstuffs that vary from one jurisdiction to another . Gammon vs. Ham Some sources call it gammon if it is <URL> , while <URL> claim gammon differs from ham because it is cured with the belly and then detached , whereas hams are detached from the rest of the animal and then cured ( a nearly useless distinction ) ; also the words gammon , ham and bacon are sometimes used interchangeably . In the US we call it ham when it is cured , whether it is cooked or raw ; and we call it fresh ham if it is uncured ( We pretty much call anything from the hind leg of a pig ham ) . Fresh vs. Raw vs. Cooked Raw does not mean that no processing has been performed , it just means that it has n't been cooked or the proteins have n't been denatured chemically . Curing , smoking , marinating , freezing , and drying , and milling can all be performed without cooking . Generally , " Fresh " means no processing has been performed . In the US and UK , the term " fresh frozen " has gained a foothold more as a marketing term than actually providing useful information . There are a number of cured hams that are eaten raw and are safe . For example prosciutto , jamón ibérico , jamón serrano , and some country hams in the US . Most of these are dry cured and may or may not be smoked . Types of smoking . The more commonly known type , and what most people call " smoking " , is actually hot smoking . Hot smoking is what happens when the item being smoked is kept in a smoker at a temperature high enough to cook the item , usually in the 225-250 ˚F / 105-120 ˚C range . The other type of smoking is cold smoking . During cold smoking the smoker or smoking chamber does not get hot enough to cook the item being smoked , usually 100 ˚F / 38 ˚C or lower . This type of smoking used to be much more common as an added protection and flavor for cured foods as well as food that are more delicate . These include gammon/hams , fish , cheeses , bacon , and seafood . Just as many foods that were previously dry cured are now wet cured , many of these products are now produced industrially using " wet smoking " or smoke flavor additives instead of cold smoking methods . As with cold-smoked meats , some " wet smoking " yields a product that is technically raw , because its proteins have not been denatured by heat . Instead , liquid smoke or smoke flavor is added to the brine or applied as a coating before cooking . Cold smoking has had a bit of a resurgence lately with the invention of <URL> , which allow you to add smoke without the need of a <URL> .
Several sources as <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> practically insist that you salt steaks before cooking them . I do n't think McGee experiments with or discusses exactly when to season/salt a steak in his books , but <URL> that he is also in favour of pre-salting . The fact that so many people seem to prefer this technique would seem to indicate that there 's at least some merit to it , even if the science is n't well-understood . All of the arguments I 've heard against salting steak ( or beef in general ) before cooking seem to be <URL> in nature . When pressed for an explanation , many of these people claim that the salt draws out moisture which will subsequently dry out the cut . In practice , the amount of moisture it draws out is practically negligible unless you actually cure it , which means using lots of salt and letting it sit that way for a long time . I do n't know anybody that does this . Well , <URL> ( warning : do not follow the advice on that page unless you are fully prepared to ruin a perfectly good steak ) . When pressed , most of these people ( including Anita Lo , above ) say that the water it draws out to the surface will inhibit the <URL> . This is true - the presence of water does inhibit the Maillard reaction and any significant quantity of water will give you a steamed gray steak instead of a delicious seared brown one . But the key word here is significant . No reasonable amount of seasoning will draw out so much moisture that you actually end up with a puddle of boiling water underneath the steak , and even if it did , you would simply pat the steak dry before searing it . You do pat your steaks dry , do n't you ? Also note that this applies to dry seasoning . When marinating a cut of beef it is another story entirely . Salt in a marinade really does create brining and that will tend to make the meat juicier . When meat brines , it absorbs extra moisture - the meat still loses moisture when cooked but the added moisture from the brine helps to offset it ( this , again , is all in McGee ) . A saline solution also dissolves a portion of the tougher proteins in the meat , resulting in a more tender result . Salt is a great thing to have in a marinade , which is why some of the simplest of marinades - soy or teriyaki sauce - are so effective . Just , again , make sure to pat that beef dry before pan-searing it if you want to get any sort of browning going on . Anecdotally - for what little that 's worth - I find that there 's very little difference in tenderness whether seasoning with salt briefly before or shortly after cooking ( before resting ) . I 've done both and I honestly do n't think I could identify which was which in a blind test , except perhaps for the consistency of the " crust " that forms when you really pile on the salt - this is a favourable result for many , and I 'll often do this if I 'm in the mood . But all in all , the scientific data on this subject is scant ; the results are very inconclusive . And it just does n't matter that much ; the debaters seem to put entirely too much emphasis on this point when there are far more important factors in preparing a great steak or roast , such as additional seasonings , what it 's seared in , temperature and heat distribution of the pan , and let 's not forget the cut and grade of meat . These things have profound effects on the final result , and if I were obsessive about beef to a fault , then I would concentrate my efforts more on finding better quality ingredients and equipment rather than fussing over the salt issue .
The grade is by whole carcass . <URL> History of beef grading in the US <URL>
There are several major types of mousse , made from different bases , and with different flavor elements . Depending on which one you are using , they may have varying requirements . As MandoMando mentions in the comments , assuming you are using a mousse based on whipped cream or whipped egg whites or a freezer-stable thickener ( neither gelatin , agar agar , nor carageenan are freeze-stable ) , you can simply freeze the cake for transport . This tends to work very well , although you may have issues with condensation when thawing it , so you want it very well wrapped ( usually after freezing , so as not to muss the icing ) . Chocolate mousses are often fairly stable due to the cocoa butter , which is solid at room temperature ; some can also be gelatin stablized . See the linked recipe in <URL> for inspiration , where the confection is built with two layers of mousse , one which is stablized with gelatin . Many fruit mousses tend to be made with gelatin , so increasing the quantity of gelatin will give you a stronger mousse . See also : <URL> for perhaps more information on hydro-colloids than you ever wished to know .

Why does my pizza dough rise so inconsistently ?
If the yeast is n't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water . It should be between 105-110 . If it 's too cool then you wo n't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you 'll start to kill it . Another possible case can be when you 're adding the salt . If it 's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast . Get the yeast , sugar , water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour . Add the salt as you 're starting to bring the dough together so that it does n't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development . If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator , make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast .
Soaking beans will not soften them . If done for a very long time ( i.e. , days ) , some beans will eventually begin to sprout or ferment , at which point they will become softer . But that is generally not desirable for basic cooking . Instead , you 'll need to cook the beans to get them to soften . Bring to a slow boil and then simmer until the interior is the desired texture . ( A common test is to take a few beans out on a spoon and blow on them ; if the outside of the bean breaks open a bit when you blow , they are likely soft and cooked through . ) By the way , the main purpose of soaking is to hydrate the seed coat ( the outer covering of the beans ) . Once that happens , the moisture can more easily penetrate the interior when cooked , allowing the beans to soften . If you do n't soak , you 'll simply waste the first part of your cooking hydrating the seed coat . Depending on the type of beans , their age , and other factors , that could increase your cooking time by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so . ( For more details , see my previous answer to another question <URL> . ) Also , do NOT try using an acid . Acids can actually toughen the seed coat , making the beans take longer to cook and soften . This is one of the reasons chili recipes ( for example ) often recommend cooking the beans first , before adding to acidic ingredients like tomatoes . ( Note that cooking times for beans and lentils can vary significantly , depending on type of bean and age . For a mixed bean soup , I 'd expect about 1-2 hours of simmering for pre-soaked beans , and perhaps as many as 3 hours . Older beans can take longer , and I 've occasionally had old batches of dried beans which never quite softened to a consistent texture . ) EDIT : Just to add onto Joe 's great advice from the Dry Bean Council , Harold McGee has this to say about beans which never soften ( from On Food and Cooking ) : " Hard-to-cook " beans ... are normal when harvested , but become resistant to softening when they 're stored for a long time -- months -- at warm temperatures and high humidities . This resistance results from a number of changes in bean cell walls and interiors , including the formation of woody lignin , the conversion of phenolic compounds into tannins that cross-link proteins to form a water-resistant coating around the starch granules . There 's no way to reverse these changes and make hard-to-cook beans as soft as regular beans . And there 's no way to spot them before cooking . Once cooked , they 're likely to be smaller than normal and so may be picked out before serving . McGee also mentions that occasionally you may encounter batches of " hard-seed " beans , which hardened during particularly hot and humid growing conditions . In such cases , the beans will be tough no matter how early they are used ; they may take much longer to cook than usual ( and sometimes may never soften ) .
How to throw dough , a basic step by step guide . Make sure you have a dough that can stand up to being airborne . This means that you need a high gluten dough . You can throw wetter doughs as you get more experienced but they require much more precise hand placement and are much less forgiving . Make sure your dough is fully risen with out being " blown " . It should be elastic and soft to the touch . Coat dough in flour . This step is necessary to allow free spinning on your hands and to get good , clean releases . Create crust . You can use the method that daniel describes , you can use the Papa John 's fold and tuck method , you can do it like this <URL> , it does n't matter as long as you end up with a piece of dough that is flat over the interior with a ridge going around the outside . You should be comfortable with in-air hand stretching before you get to the actual throwing . This is when you place the dough on the backs of your hands , support it with your knuckles and stretch it out . This position is a great way to start a basic toss that wo n't rip your dough as you will be catching with the backs of your hands and not your fingers . You want to release the dough by having your right hand provide upward thrust as your left hand provides spin . This will provide a straight up toss that is very easy to catch . The way to do the more advanced throws is learn to release from your finger tips . This involves having your fingers rest along the ridge that we made in step four . You can check out a quick tutorial starting at 2:17 on this <URL> . Feel free to ignore the rest of it , but it was the best explanation I found online . Basically , you want the dough to hang in such a way as to allow you to impart spin and momentum with just one hand , while other is occasionally used as a stabilizer . This allows tricks like the <URL> and the through the legs and all the others . Important tips that will help you be successful at learning this skill . Cold dough is more elastic than warm dough . That means its terrible for pizza but great for practicing . It also resists puncture a little better , so less holes . A damp kitchen towel has about the same aerodynamics as a piece of dough . It 's what I used to train the guys at my restaurant on for extra practice , and it 's way cheaper than one of those rubber doughs . The dough should always be spinning in the air . If it 's not , you are n't doing it right . Throwing dough can result in a very thin middle . You want to make sure that you are stretching evenly and keeping an eye on that if you intend to use the dough for it 's actual purpose of delicious pizza . Practice , Practice ! Throwing dough is a physical skill and you have to train your muscles a little to be good at it . It can be a little frustrating at first but stick with it , it 's a lot of fun . If you have any additional concerns leave a comment and I 'll do my best answer them .
If you juice your own carrots you would see how sweet carrots actually are . When you juice a carrot , you are extracting the liquid portion ( which contains the majority of the sugars ) from the cellulose . Since the cellulose is somewhat flavorless & thinsp ; -- & thinsp ; it tastes pretty much like paper pulp & thinsp ; -- & thinsp ; you are essentially creating " concentrated carrot " flavor , which is why it tastes so much sweeter than when you eat it whole . You can also roast a carrot and see how sweet it is . Roasting drives off a lot of the water and breaks down the fiber . Try it ; you 'll see just how sweet a carrot actually is .
The best is the <URL> If you ca n't find that flour locally , there are sellers online . I find a mix of bread flour &amp; semolina works very well too . This is my favourite pizza dough recipe : <URL>
My targets for the final dough : when I stretch it over my fist , once it has got to the size where it covers my whole fist , it starts to stretch under its own weight if the inside of the dough is exposed it will stick to hands/surface need to use semolina/cornmeal to transfer the pizza around contains lots of visible bubbles before stretching , with the dough having enough integrity to stretch the bubbles without losing them . can stretch it to be translucent without tearing too much ( preferably without tearing at all ) What I look for at different by stages : I have been making a lot of pizza dough over the last year , experimenting with different amounts of water and kneading techniques . In order to make a very thin base , ( on you can stretch so it is translucent ) but can still transfer into the oven I make a very wet ( 60 % hydration ) dough and either : No-Knead approach : use small amounts of yeast and salt . Just leave the dough for approx 18 hours . Then put in the fridge , I find it is best after 2 days in the fridge . Because the dough is cold you can easily handle it , although you might need to let it warm up a bit before you can do anything with it . What I am aiming for is that when I stretch it over my fist , once it has got to the size where it covers my whole fist , it starts to stretch under its own weight . I expect to see a lot of bubbles , up to 0.5 cm in diameter but most smaller , in the dough , but not to be able to pour it out . I will have to scrape it out of the bowl using a wet spatula . and will have to use a light dusting of flour ( not too much ) to stop it sticking to the surface or my hands . I sometimes let it rise again after shaping ( need to at least let it relax for a few minutes ) and usually have to add more flour to my hands to do the stretch . Try to use as little extra flour as you can . I usually have to only dust the dough once and lightly before stretching it . If you have to use any more it might be too wet or not have enough gluten development . Hand Knead approach : using more yeast and salt . When I first turn the dough out to knead I do not expect to be able to handle it , it is to sticky and runny . I use tools to fold it a few times . You will probably need some flour to do this , but try not to use too much . After several folds the dough comes together enough for me to lightly cover it in flour I " roll knead " - which is rolling and stretching it , but not bringing the wet inside to the surface . If you start to fold or tear the dough it will stick to your hands and the surface , if that happens you have to put more flour on which will reduce the hydration of your dough so avoid it . You will have to work it for quite a while . Try to get your body weight applied to the dough as your roll it . What I am aiming for is a dough which you can pick up without your fingers just going into it and that springs back when you deform it ; but if you tear it or open it up the inside will immediately stick to your hands and the surface . When I get this I stop kneading . I usually rise it for 80 mins but it depends on the temperature . After this rise , I will divide it and shape it into balls . I expect to not be able to easily rip the dough apart due to its wetness . It should contain quite a bit of air , and some largeish bubbles which I try not to knock back too much . I have to use a wet spatula to divide it , and then use a small amount of flour on the outside to form a smooth surfaced ball . Then I cover it and rise it again for 20mins . The outside will be smooth with some bubbles visible and due to the flour dry enough to handle . The inside will be too wet to handle without adding more flour . After this second rise I put a bit of flour on my hands and stretch it over my fist , it should behave pretty much the same as the no-knead version at this stage .
Your metal bowl sitting in your 70 ° F room is 70 ° F ( at least , if its been sitting there for a bit ) . Your plastic bowl , or glass bowl , or ceramic bowl , or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70 ° F. They 're all actually the same temperature . Now , given , when you touch the metal bowl , it feels cooler than the plastic one . This is because your finger is n't 70 ° F , and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than ( say ) plastic . If the dough is room temperature , it wo n't matter -- heat is n't flowing out of it . The dough itself does n't generate much heat . If your dough started above room temperature , it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl . But , if you wanted to keep it from cooling , putting it in a warm place is much more effective . A stainless steel bowl is fine . I 'd avoid aluminum ( and copper , if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing ) due to them being reactive , especially if you 're making sourdough .
There is a lot of water in the milk . The high heat turns the water into steam . The egg and flour contains proteins and gluten that forms a " net " . The steam ca n't escape without pushing the net upwards . This makes the dough rise . It helps that the container is a narrow cylinder .
If the yeast is n't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water . It should be between 105-110 .

I 'm not sure what causes the bowing to be more pronounced from one cooking method versus another , but the solution is to put a thumbprint indentation in the middle , creating a slight " donutted " shape . This will help to ensure you get the " patty " shape you want .
Short answer : Steam . Long answer : Proteins in egg whites are almost uniquely suited to making foams of tiny bubbles , then stretching like a web of bungee cords as the water inside these bubbles turns to steam in the oven . Therefore , the critical element in making your souffle rise is the skill with which you whip the whites into a foam to the correct degree ( just to stiff peaks , not over-whipped ) , followed by integrating ( folding ) that foam into the dense , flavor-filled base . There are a few tricks for augmenting the rise -- e.g. , using a pinch of tartaric acid in the whites , using a copper bowl -- but if your technique is poor , these things wo n't make enough of a difference . Alton Brown ( " Good Eats " TV show ) has an excellent program explaining the whole thing , including some basic chemistry , available free on YouTube : <URL> <URL> By the way , you said that a successful souffle must rise above the vessel . While rising high is a major goal , I would not limit success to that event . Last night , I made chocolate souffle that only crested the vessel a little ways ( not the ideal " double the volume " ) , but each bite was still ethereal and decadent at the same time . Everyone 's plate was clean . THAT , to me , is a successful souffle .
Your technique is going to be critical here . Leaning scones are n't necessarily indicative of improper technique , but flat ones are . Keeping your ingredients cold is important when creating scones in every recipe I 've read or tried . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> as to grate the butter and then freeze the grated pieces and use a <URL> to provide layers . Many other recipes use cold butter ( frozen or simply very cold out of the freezer ) in chunks and a pastry blender to cut them in . Your milk should also be cold , not room temperature . You may also want to chill your work bowl and utensils . You do n't want your butter melting before those scones hit the oven . When your scones hit the oven and the butter does begin to soften and melt , it will leave behind layers of air in your scone which will help it to rise . You do n't want to handle finished scone dough very much . Use a light touch and minimal work . I 'd also check the date on your self-raising flour . The ingredients will lose their activity over time , causing the flour not to rise as well any more .
The lack of vent holes would have been a problem . Vent holes allow steam to escape , reducing the amount of internal moisture . This moisture will both prevent the crust from cooking fully through , and will cause the crust to soften as after it comes out of the oven . That 's not to say that there was n't also some other problem , just this is one thing that you should correct .
I would imagine , if the book is of reasonable quality , by prepared , they mean one that you have prepared earlier . If there 's a recipe for pizza base in the book , that 's probably what they 'd like you to use . Personally , if you 're going to the trouble of making home-made pizza , make your own base . Invariably , the pre-made bases you can buy from stores taste like chalk . There 's a few topics here that may be useful : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Try heating the cream and milk to just below a simmer . Right before adding the milk mixture to the yolks whisk the sugar , vanilla , and eggs together . Pour the hot milk mixture into eggs very slowly . It 's best to strain it through a fine strainer . If you use vanilla bean make sure to add it after straining it . Let cool a little before putting it into the fridge . It should be cold before making the ice cream . It 's not necessary to fully temper ice cream base like crème anglaise .
Gravy is supposed to be opaque and is a result of using flour as the thickener . If you want clear gravy , like what you would get in a Chinese restaurant , then you need to use corn starch or arrowroot as your thickener . But the opacity is considered to be a good thing . It 's the canned stuff you buy in the store that is clear .
<URL> tells us this is a myth : Many tea companies , and even some reputable entities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture , have made misleading generalizations about the caffeine content of broad classes of tea . It is a widespread myth that black tea contains more caffeine than green tea , and another myth that white tea contains the least caffeine of all teas . They indicate that brewing method is the main determiner of caffeine levels in the brewed tea . The source article goes on to cite various credible scientific sources , which raise the credibility of this assertion . Unfortunately , most of their links have gone bad , which makes it harder to check the background science . This <URL> does indicate slightly different levels , but that is likely to be a result of different brewing details across tea types rather than fundamental to the tea plant itself .
I had this exact same problem for years . And it was all about letting the dough relax . I 'd get beautiful crusts , but never EVER pass the windowpane test . I was so confused . Turns out , all I had to do was leave it alone for about 10 minutes , much less and I 'd still run into issues . The window pane test is intended to show that enough gluten has been formed that you can stretch the dough . It 's a completely non-exact test . It 's just to ballpark if there is ' enough ' gluten . By leaving it alone for 10 minutes or more , the gluten has relaxed and can be stretched to form the window pane . This relaxing is the same thing that you may need to do while forming your pizza . If you find that your pizza dough will stretch out some , and then pull back constantly - its good because you 've probably got enough gluten . Let it relax for several minutes and then pull it back - go too far and you 'll likely accidentally form a window pane ! Enough gluten means that you 've formed an efficent ' net ' of gluten that will trap gases from the yeast and also provide some ' chew ' . You 'll get better rise and your bread will have a better crumb . Yeast breads without much gluten development are often denser . When hand kneading , an <URL> will also help ( well , it always helps , just especially when you have to do the work manually ) . By giving the dough a short rest after initial mixing , you let the dough fully hydrate and some gluten will start to form on its own . When you come back to knead the dough , you should find the dough more workable and a little easier to get to the ' kneaded ' point . What 's going on with ' relaxing ' gluten ? Kneading forms gluten , but it often also tangles them up a bit . <URL> and will pull out into long strands easier .
There are a few things I can think of . The first is , are you sure your oven is at the right temperature ? Although your oven may beep that it 's preheated , without checking it with an oven or infrared thermometer you ca n't be sure that it 's actually at the temperature you need - and even if it is at that temperature where the sensor is , it might not be the same temperature elsewhere in the oven . Try moving the rack you 're using one or two levels closer to or further from the element and see if it makes a difference ( further will probably be better if you 're trying to increase spread ) . My oven has a 50-75 & deg ; F range from the top rack to the bottom - a major difference when it comes to baking ! Understanding my oven 's temperature range changed my baking outcomes significantly . Second , are you letting the dough come to room temperature before baking ? I 've found that the colder my dough , the less spread I get . On Betty Crocker 's site , there is <URL> and under " Why do n't my cookies spread " , they recommend using an aluminum sheet - the darker the cookie sheet , apparently , the less spread you will get . I have n't tested this personally , but I trust the source :) I get good spread on my silpat baking sheets , for what it 's worth . The only other thing I can think of is your butter , is it truly softened , or is it a hard block , or is it melted ? I 'm not an experienced enough baker to explain the science behind the differences as they relate to baking , but I do know that those three options will produce significantly different results . I believe that if your butter is too cold , they wo n't spread as much as they could - but hopefully someone can chime in and confirm or deny that . Oh , and I asked a friend of mine who 's a baker - she said that it 's possible that your baking soda is old , and that could cause it , but I do n't know from first hand experience if that 's possible or not . I trust her judgment though , as she 's my go-to with baking questions and she 's never led me astray .
I do n't see anything in the question that is peculiar to pizza dough . Anything I answer will apply to any kind of yeast-risen , glutenous dough . The goal with any such dough is a well hydrated protein matrix that has been arranged in sheets that will trap the gas produced by yeast . If the yeast is dead it wo n't be able to produce gas and your bread will be somewhere between a cracker and shoe leather - depending on how thick you roll it out . Using too little yeast is not the same as dead yeast . If you use too little yeast ( within reason ) they will take a long time to reproduce , eat , and blow up your stretchy proteins . They will be producing a lot of flavor during this period . This will generally taste good . If you use too much yeast ( within reason ) the yeast will act very quickly . This is nice for speed but it will result in a much less developed flavor . Neither is a problem so you can choose for yourself . Using too little water will result in not enough gluten development and a dry , or crumbly dough . The dough wo n't hold gases and there will also not be enough steam when baking so the dough will be more dense . Too much water and you have a batter that ca n't be worked with . Over working a dough is n't so much of a concern . It is possible to over knead but it is hard to do . See : <URL> . Under working the dough will result in less gluten development and very similar results as using too little water - basically you will have unleavened biscuit dough . The exception is if you are following a " no-knead " recipe . In this case the dough is allowed to rest for days which lets the protein sheets form on their own . Resting the dough is necessary both to relax the protein mesh that you created as well as to allow the yeast a chance to blow it up with some CO2 . Not long enough and you wo n't be able to roll out the dough because it will be too tight and it wo n't be risen because the yeast have n't eaten . Too long and the bubbles will coalesce into large open cavities . A good rule of thumb is " doubled in volume " . Usually about an hour but this is highly dependent on how much yeast you use , how much water , and the ambient temperature . The end result is that you do n't need to worry about most of these things . The biggest mistakes I see people make is making a dough too dry or simply not kneading enough . It is easier to add flour than water so put in less than the full amount of flour , knead for a while , if the dough stays too sticky then add a bit more flour and knead in . As answers to other questions have said - you want a dough that is " smooth and elastic " it is n't sticky and looks homogeneous . After just a couple tries you will get a feel for how wet that means and you 'll be an expert . For pizza dough in particular - almost as important as the dough construction is the baking temperature . You want to cook it as hot as you can . 500F in an oven or on a grill . It will only take 5-10 minutes . The fast hot cooking will do a lot for your crust texture . It makes the difference between a crispy , chewy pizza crust and a soft , bready ( and soggy under the toppings ) crust .

why add a shot of vodka to a cream sauce ?
First , the alcohol does n't burn off . We had a table about the percentage of alcohol left after a period of cooking , and especially in something cooked as short as a pasta sauce , there is a substantial amount left . For the longer discussion , see <URL> . Second , alcohol is a great solvent . It can leach aromatics from spices and herbs which would n't come out with water only . There is a good reason why extracts and essences are made with alcohol . While a really good extract needs a long time , even the short cooking time will be enough for alcohol to make a difference . Third , it can stabilize your sauce . Cream is an emulsion of fat in water , and not terribly stable , especially if some acid is present . Alcohol dissolves both fat and water , so it will stop the cream from eventual separating . Fourth , maybe you happened to find a not so great recipe . Vodka will help with the first three points , but it is seldom a good choice for cooking , because there is almost always another alcohol which will accomplish the same and introduce a good flavor which harmonizes with the remaining ingredients . For pasta sauces this tends to be a good brandy , but it depends on what else you have in the sauce . And because even vodka will leave a taste of alcohol in the end , it is hard to argue that it can be used where the taste should be kept unchanged .
It means the butter is made from cream that has n't been fermented . Butter made from fermented cream is known as " cultured cream butter " , and it has distinct sour , lactic acid notes . Sweet cream butter tastes , well , sweet , and if it is from really good fresh milk you may be able to taste grassy notes . Both are good in their own way .
Could be an unfinished roux ( the butter , flour mixture ) . But most likely it 's because the cheese was heated too quickly or too much , causing the protein to clump up . Suggestions : Melt with less heat Use a double boiler ( to reduce hot spots within the pan ) Toss the shredded cheddar with cornstarch first ( starch helps reduce clumping ) Add cheese in smaller batches ( easier to maintain correct heat level and stir cheese in )
Tomatoes are mostly water anyway . They 're not going to get above boiling point whether or not you add water ( or at least not by more than a very few degrees even with salt added - less than the effect of altitude ) . On the other hand the browned bits from the bottom of the pan ( often called fond in the US though I 've never heard this in the UK and the usage in France is a bit different ) do give a nice flavour to the sauce so long as they do n't catch . If you do add water , you 'll need to simmer it down anyway , making that the stirring step still happens , just later . But adding some water fairly early can give you some flexibility . A good time to do this is when it 's starting to meet constant stirring but you need to get on with the rest of the meal . A low heat and a heavy pan help too .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
Roux Method The advantages of the roux method : It can be prepared in advance The raw flour taste is cooked out when the roux is prepared , so the sauce is ready as soon as it is thickened ; this also makes it easier to add more roux to adjust the thickness of the sauce . It actually requires less supervision . You are actually being overly fussy with your roux based sauce . You could add all of the milk at once , although starting with one smaller batch just to dissolve the roux is a good idea . The butter coats the flour particles , making lumping quite unlikely Can be browned for additional flavor at the cost of thickening power It also adds oil or butter to the recipe , which may or may not be an advantage . Slurry Method The advantages of the slurry method ( which is what the second method is , although it is more typically done with water or stock than milk are ) : It is fast and convenient , if you do n't have roux prepared ahead No oil or butter is required , so it does n't have to be accounted for in the recipe . Disadvantages : It is easier to get lumping if you do n't thoroughly whisk the slurry before heating It must be brought to the boil for at least a couple of minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste , and harder to adjust thickness . Harder to prepare ahead Conclusion Use whichever you are comfortable with . For fine sauces , roux based may be superior ( and certainly more buttery ) , but you can have excellent outcomes with a slurry . For casual cooking , I tend to use a slurry , saving roux for more formal dinners and fancier dishes like Thanksgiving gravy .
I always go in this order : Garlic/ginger/chili / spring onion whites This is to infuse the cooking oil with these flavours . Cook for short amount of time ~ 30secs . onions/peppers/carrots / harder veg These need a little more cooking that the other bits , so I give them a bit longer . mushrooms/sugar snaps/soft veg These need less cooking , so bit less time . bean sprouts I like these to be a bit crunchy so add them right at then end and basically just warm through . If I 'm using bigger veg like broccoli/cauliflower then I do them separately to the other veg . I use a little of the chili/garlic/ginger and fry that for 30 secs , add the broccoli fry for another minute or so just to brown the florets , then add some water , turn down the heat and put on a lid , to steam the broccoli . Once its done I remove to a separate plate the add back in at the end . It basically depends on how much you like each veg cooked . If you prefer your peppers crunchy , put them in nearer the end .
I had to do some reading on this one . There are a lot of answers . 1 - You should find a better recipe . Chocolate spread recipes I have used come in one of two styles . The water in your recipe seems to be a problem . The nutella style that uses fat , sugar , and chocolate . These will not really dry out . Sometimes the oil will separate a little and will need to be mixed back in . I would group frostings in this group although , of course , they contain far more sugar . See this recipe : <URL> Thick chocolate candy . AKA fudge . These contain water but the sugar and water are cooked together into a syrup so the water is not able to immediately dry out . They will crystallize if they are badly handled - many recipes contain a little corn syrup to prevent this . This does not seem to be what you are trying to make . 2 - Store your concoction in a lidded container that is n't too much larger than your sauce . I use mason jars to store mine . Alternatively you can push plastic wrap down onto the surface of the spread . 3 - Refrigeration . Recipes that do n't contain dairy do n't need to be refrigerated and in fact should n't be because it causes them to harden . 4 - Adding water to melted chocolate is only a problem when dealing with chocolate that is dry and meant to solidify such as a molded chocolate . In such a case even a drop of water will cause seizing . In this case where there is already quite a bit of water in the recipe seizing is not a risk and you should n't have any problem mixing a tiny bit back in . Do not add water to the nutella-like spread recipes . They do not contain water and it will not mix in . I ca n't tell from your description what is causing your sauce to harden - it could be drying out , separating , or crystallizing . Any of these will be solved by reheating and thoroughly stirring . Although water could be added to restore dried syrup I think you will get better results by switching to a recipe that uses fat in place of the water .
I would add a slight clarification to hoc_age 's great answer , since the question mentions using " only yeast " and does not mention sourdough explicitly . Assuming the question is referring to commercial yeast , a long pre-ferment can still result in some sourness in the flavor . However , unlike sourdough , the types of bacteria and acids produced may not be as consistent . Sourdough cultures are selective environments that only grow certain types of bacteria , like certain Lactobacillus strains , which can survive in an acidic environment . Flour and water mixed with commercial yeast is generally not a particularly acidic environment , so all sorts of things will grow -- and your dough will resemble something like the early stages of a brand-new sourdough starter , with a variety of naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria , many of which live naturally on flour or come from air or water . Eventually the waste products from the yeast and bacteria will create acids . In comments , the question of acetic vs. lactic acid came up . The quantity of acid produced by yeast is not appreciable . However , bacterial fermentation will produce both acids ( and a few other minor ones in very small quantities ) . In general , the ratio of these two acids depends on a number of conditions as well as the ingredients . Fermenting at higher temperatures and with a wetter pre-ferment ( e.g. , a sponge ) will increase the lactic acid production compared to acetic acid , while dry-dough fermentation at lower temperatures will often have a stronger acetic acid taste . Note that acetic acid is more volatile and thus gives a stronger taste and smell , so not very much of it is required ; it also has greater mold-inhibiting properties than lactic acid . ( This is probably the original association of particularly " sour " dough with prospectors in cold temperatures ; in those conditions , the bread produced could taste much more sour . ) So it 's not only time but temperature and hydration ( i.e. , " wetness " ) of the pre-ferment which will effect how much sourness and the type of sour flavors produced . ( In sourdough , the initial amount of starter used in the pre-ferment will also be significant . ) The question asks how to avoid excessive sourness . Aside from the advice mentioned above -- especially pre-fermenting at warmer temperatures and with higher hydration -- one can also just use a soaker instead ( i.e. , water and flour , and perhaps other ingredients -- particularly grains -- without yeast ) . If the goal is to maximize other flavors beyond sourness , a soaker will allow enzymes to break down the grains and release flavors , but acidity will be less without the yeast . Another possibility is to use a " mash , " which is effectively a soaker heated up somewhat to speed up and maximize enzyme activity . Sometimes various dough enhancers ( e.g. , malt powder ) can also be used instead or in addition to speed up flavor development .
According to Cooking The Roman Way by David Downie , Fettucine Alfredo is a traditional Roman recipe called " pasta del cornuti " ( cuckold 's pasta ) . What either Alfredo Di Lelio III , or Mario Mozzetti , depending on whom you believe , invented in 1914 , was the dramatic tableside preparation of Fettuccine Alfredo , which is what made the dish a hit with visiting Americans in the 20 's and 30 's . The tableside preparation is really what makes Fettuccine Alfredo what it is : the hot pasta is tossed with the butter and cheese in front of the diner , and then served to them immediately . Again , according to Downie , the only ingredients of Fettuccine Alfredo are egg fettuccine , lots of butter , lots of Parmegiano-Reggiano , and ( if necessary ) a little salt . Recipes which add cream or milk are Americanized recipes designed to allow restaurants to hold orders of Alfredo for a long time under heat lamps ( and turn it into a gooey pasty mess ) . Italians , from my experience visiting Italy , rarely put cream or milk on pasta ( a real Italian could speak up here ) . Downie has a fun 3-page digression about the ongoing lawsuits between the Roman families who claim to own the name . It 's worth a read . Alan Davidson , predictably , says nothing about Fettuccine Alfredo . The Glorious Pasta of Italy likewise does not cover the dish . Wikipedia supports Downie 's story , except only attributing Di Lelio , and adding the tidbit that Di Lelio apparently called it " Fettuccine al burro " ( fettuccine with butter ) , and the Alfredo name was appended later when it was copied in the USA . Wikipedia also says butter and cheese only , on fettuccine pasta . So , to answer your question and the questions asked in the comments : Fettuccine Alfredo is an Italian dish , if more popular in the USA than in Italy . It is a variation of a traditional Italian dish . In its traditional form , it has only egg pasta , butter , and cheese . The pasta for Alfredo is egg fettuccine .
Whipped cream was made for centuries before the mixer was invented . :) You can do it with simply a balloon whisk . Things that may help though : Very cold cream ( not freezing ) Very cold bowl and whisk ( put them in the freezer for 20 minutes prior to using ) Copper bowl The process is simply to start slow until you see bubbles form , then speed up until you see the whisk begin to leave trails in the cream , then go full speed ahead until just before it starts to look soft and billowy . At this point you can add your sugar and continue whipping until thickens and firms up to form soft peaks . Advice : Buy a hand-mixer at least ! :) Update - Yes you can whip it with a stick blender . I would be careful to avoid over - whipping with this method though . It might be easy to over-do it , and you 'll start to make butter .
This is what we figured out at Serious Eats : <URL> In sum , use more sugar , whip the cream , freeze in icecube trays and run through a Cuisinart at the end .
One element is tradition . The popsicle was supposedly invented by Frank Epperson when he <URL> in with a <URL> . ( Some historians have questioned this narrative , however , given that Epperson claimed this occurred in 1905 in San Francisco , but <URL> there for Epperson 's story to hold up . ) The choice of wood , according to this traditional story , was somewhat accidental , though given that plastics were not yet available in 1905 , Epperson 's main choices for stirring would probably have been metal or wood . ( And obviously metal would be uncomfortable to hold in a frozen treat , regardless of whether this origin story is true or not . ) In any case , Epperson later patented his invention ( including the wooden stick ) in Oakland in 1923 and started selling them . Again , this would have been too early for plastic to be a reasonable alternative , so part of the reason for wooden popsicle sticks may just be that they are traditional and familiar to customers . A business seeking to make a change away from such a tradition would need motivation , either an economic reason ( a cheaper but still acceptable product ) or an actual product improvement . Given that wooden popsicle sticks are intended to be disposable and already function well , economics would be a primary reason to switch , if there were a cheaper material . But Memj 's answer is correct here . It 's simple economics : wood is cheaper in this case , which is the reason it is used for various small uniform disposable items from toothpicks to chopsticks , utilizing technology that has been in wide use since the early 1900s . ( For more information on the reason for manufacturing and process on producing small wooden items cheaply , I 'd recommend Henry Petroski 's <URL> The Toothpick : Technology and Culture . ) It 's also important to note that some businesses actually have experimented with disposable plastic sticks . The most common type were so-called <URL> or Icetix , which were distributed by Borden Dairy in the U.S. . They were intended to be collectible and manufactured to be used as toys after serving their purpose in the ice cream bar . ( See photos and further description <URL> and <URL> , for example . ) I would note that these sticks easily solved potential problems brought up in some of the other answers : A series of holes allowed the popsicle to be frozen through the plastic and thus added to adhesion . And the holes also decreased thermal mass and heat transfer , which would negate any potential discomfort from holding a piece of cold plastic , which seems to be a strange concern to me anyhow . ** In any case , these plastic sticks were undoubtedly more expensive to manufacture , but they were marketed as a novelty item . And their interlocking nature and use as a toy required people to buy more popsicles to build with them , thereby providing an economic incentive to justify the added expense . Without such an economic incentive for " standard " disposable popsicle sticks , and with wooden sticks being traditional , there 's little reason for businesses to make a switch to plastic . ** More details about thermal properties : While some plastics are somewhat better at transferring heat than wood , there are many types of plastic which would not be noticeably uncomfortable compared to wood in a small stick , even if they were solid . Note that the thermal conductivity of many standard plastics is <URL> , only roughly double that of wood , which is around 0.13 W/m-K . Compare that to most metals , which could actually freeze one 's hand to them , which have conductivities which are hundreds of times that big . Specific heat is <URL> , and the density of <URL> is only a little higher than <URL> , which is a standard wood for popsicle sticks . Bottom line is that plastic popsicle sticks would absorb heat somewhat more quickly and stay colder a little longer , but not enough to produce significant discomfort for a small , thin piece of plastic . But , theory aside , one can easily buy reusable plastic sticks for homemade popsicles -- just search Amazon for " plastic popsicle sticks " . ( <URL> comparing 26 different varieties of plastic molds , almost all with plastic sticks/handles . ) And I do n't think I 've ever seen a review complaining about discomfort in holding them . I 've also seen multitudes of baby teething toys , for example , which are meant to be frozen and are made out of plastic : the idea of a " damp hand freezing " to a small thin piece of plastic seems quite unlikely .
It looks to me like you need umami . One easy , healthy thing you can add is powdered dried shiitake or porcini mushrooms . I just throw the dried mushrooms into a spice grinder , it 's a powerful punch . EDIT : ( SAJ14SAJ refers to the same concept , glutamates , in his answer )
I think it all got too hot , but there might be other problems . Did you mix the cornstarch in completely ? Leaving undissolved cornstarch is a sure way to obtain ' blobs ' . Did you pour the hot milk onto the egg-mixture ? You should do that very slowly and whisk vigorously ( while trying to splash everything ) . If the eggs get too hot , they will coagulate . Did you use a double boiler ? Putting the pan on an open flame will make the bottom too hot and the eggs will coagulate . Even if you did use a double boiler , did you whisk regularly while heating ? The eggs at the bottom will become far warmer than the eggs in the center ... As rumtscho mentioned , a thermometer will be useful for monitoring the done-ness of the custard . Generally , a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 ° C ; it begins setting at 70 ° C. Source : <URL>
You <URL> . Once it 's opened it 's good for a month or so with no appreciable change . After that the flavour and colour starts to degrade , but it 's still safe to eat . Worcestershire sauce is fermented for more than a year before it 's bottled , so it will change at a much slower rate than an acidic , but unfermented sauce like ketchup . Still , it 's only good for a few years after it 's opened .
A foam is just a liquid with plenty of air incorporated into it . You can incorporate air into any liquid ; in order to be able to create an actual foam , however , you need to be able to incorporate the air faster than it escapes . What makes a liquid able to hold the air you 're incorporating ( and hence form a foam ) is a foam stabilizer , also commonly called an emulsifier1 . I know of no specific taxonomy of stabilizers , but the vast majority are hydrocolloids AKA gelling agents and belong to some family of protein . Agar , carrageenan , alginate , xanthan , and pectin are all types of <URL> ; Lecithin is mostly a random collection of <URL> ; Gelatin is denatured collagen , i.e. animal protein ; Whey protein is the prevalent protein in dairy products ; And so on . Really almost any emulsifier will do . Basically everything in your list either is , or contains , one of the the additives mentioned above : Chocolate is almost always emulsified with soy lecithin ; Eggs contain high amounts of lecithin ; Milk and cream contain whey protein ; Most " supermarket cream " also has emulsifiers like carrageenan already in it . ... you get the picture , I hope . The most basic answer I can give to this is that if you want to make a foam , you need to either use something that 's already an emulsion ( milk , butter , chocolate , etc. ) or use an emulsifier/stabilizer additive ( such as gelatin , lecithin , etc. ) If you want a relatively complete list of all of the food additives that qualify , you 'll want to look at the E number , and specifically <URL> ( thickeners , stabilizers , emulsifiers ) . 1 . As commenter Erik very correctly points out , an emulsifier is not the same thing as a foam stabilizer . However , by convention , the terms seem to be used interchangeably all over the place , to the extent that I get blank looks when I refer to a " stabilizer " as opposed to " emulsifier " . So , know the difference , but do n't get too hung up on it .
Given the science as Kenji Alt explained it in his article , the key fact of the vodka is that it is 80 proof , or 40 % alchohol . So beer , which usually is on the order of 4 to 6 percent alcohol ( yes , there are outliers ) will not have the same level of inhibition of the gluten formation . The vodka is not the only factor in the recipe leading to crispiness and good crust , so you will probably still get very good results with the beer , assuming you like the flavor profile it brings to the wings , but it wo n't be quite the same . If you use another liquer that is on the order of 80 proof , again assuming you like the flavor profile , you should get quite similar results . This would include mixing grain alcohol with water or orange juice or whatever to the appropriate ratio . Other than some white wine for cooking , though , I do n't buy spirits so I do n't what would be more economical -- and that might vary from region to region .
First , you do n't specify if you mean cream of coconut , or coconut milk . I think coconut milk would be the thing to try here , as it has less fat . Second , if it works , it wo n't be bechamel any more . But this is a technical detail : if it is tasty to you , you should be able to use it as a substitution practically everywhere . Third , does it work ? I have n't tried it , but I would strongly assume that it will . Coconut milk has more fat than normal milk , but this is n't a terrible problem for roux-based sauces . Indeed , I have read recipes ( in reliable cookbooks ) which direct the cook to add melted butter to the roux before or after adding the liquid . Which means that the fat ratio in the sauce is n't too exact ; it is the ratio of flour to water which you have to keep straight . The one thing to pay attention to is that coconut fat melts around 34-35 ° C . So your coconut roux sauce will exhibit noticeable difference in thickness depending on the temperature . As long as you serve it warm , it will be a similar thickness to bechamel . If you let it go cold , it will probably thicken quite a bit . If you plan to serve it cold , adjust the flour amount accordingly .
The salt adds flavor , but it also helps reduce the gelation of the starch in the pasta . The starch in food is the form of microscopic grains . When these grains come into contact with water , they will trap some of it ( think cornstarch in cold water ) , but when the water is hot they swell up like balloons and merge with each other , and you have starch gelation . Another thing you may want to add to the pasta water is some acid ( lemon or cream of tartar ) . Tap water in most cities is made alkaline , which increases the starch loss from the pasta to the water , making the pasta stickier .

Metal vs paper filter for Chemex ?
A paper filter is a true " filter " in that it basically only allows liquid to pass through . This means that you will have no sediment in your coffee , if that is a concern to you . Paper filters are absorbent though , so some of the flavor compounds of the coffee will be absorbed into the paper , and some other compounds as well ( a chemical in coffee that causes a rise in cholesterol is absorbed by the paper ) . The paper can also lead to a papery flavor in your coffee . Metal filters only filter out particulates of a certain size , so you will frequently end up with a layer of " sludge " at the bottom of your pot . Metal filters should be non-reactive though , so they will not add a flavor to your coffee and will allow everything extracted from your coffee to pass through . If cholesterol is n't a concern , I 'd say try both and see which you like better . <URL> <URL>
It 's just how long you dry them . Thin apple slices work best for crunchy chips and then just dry them till they 're crunchy - sometimes as much as 18-20 hours . Soft , chewy dehydrated apples just go for a shorter time .
For hard , chemical-resistant surfaces such as marble , bleach or peroxide cleaners will help . On things like counters , pots and pans , a Magic Eraser will often take off the stain . Sometimes a harsher abrasive like Comet or Barkeep 's Friend will be needed . Softer or porous materials , including cloth and many plastics often CAN NOT BE UNSTAINED . In my kitchen we treat turmeric like a dangerous chemical -- isolate , contain , and plan ahead to limit exposure . It 's just that destructive . You might as well tie-dye or bleach white any clothing you get turmeric on ; it India it is used as a dye for saris because it will semi-permanently tint cloth . You can brush off the dry powder harmessly , but when it is moistened and allowed to sit for a moment , the color is pretty much permanent . Edit : UV + peroxide : I saw a patent for removing turmeric stains from upholstery using UV light and hydrogen peroxide . You might try soaking fabrics in peroxide or Oxyclean ( which uses peroxide ) and leaving then out in the sun . Ca n't hurt right ? Edit : strategies to manage turmeric without making a mess Plan ahead where you 'll use it , and which utensils and vessels will hold it , so you do n't mess up anything you do n't need to . Re-use already turmeric-stained items so you do n't wreck anything new Mortars and pestles , tupperware , wooden and soft plastic utensils are a lost cause . At least the stain is purely cosmetic ? ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wear an apron . Keep spilt powder dry ( it wo n't stain ) and brush it off with a paper towel into the garbage . Brushing away promptly keeps you from inadvertently spilling liquid on it , or wiping it with a wet towel during cleanup . That is , unless you want a neon-green counter and towel ? Whenever you spill something containing turmeric , promptly wipe it off , to reduce staining . Hard ceramic and porcelain are immune to staining unless the surface is rough . Try to use these for storage . Glass will stain . Stainless steel is resistant but not immune . With these strategies , I find I can use turmeric regularly without problems .
A piece of muslin/cotton/fine-tissue-of - your-choice will do the job nicely . You can easily find it in kitchen stores or <URL> .
The interior of modern cans are a heat resistant plastic ( remember they pressure cook the cans at the factory ) , and will be fine for heating liquid things Just do n't try using it to fry stuff !
I can not speak to price ; I have n't comparison-shopped with this feature in mind . However , I have used various home gas ranges with either type of broiler . I 'll go ahead and sum it up : tl ; dr : I greatly prefer an in-oven broiler . Here 's why . First , positioning . Broiler drawers are typically located at the very bottom of the range , underneath the actual oven . This means that in order to place food in or take it out , you 've got to bend all the way down to the floor . I hope the ergonomic challenge here is obvious , but I have safety concerns as well . If you have never tried to cook 10 pounds of flank steak in a broiler drawer , then learn from my experience : it 's less than optimal . You will wind up bent over at the waist when pulling your finished steaks , end up tilting your pan and spilling meat juice on the way to the top of the range , and just barely manage to kick the drawer closed before your dog licks the exposed cooking tray . An in-oven broiler presents no additional challenges than you 'd have with regular oven use . Second : flexibility . Broiler drawers often seem to come equipped with an awkwardly-sized pan that 's smaller than the oven itself . Sometimes this has brackets or rails to hold it in place in the center of the drawer . This is a stupid design that 's difficult to clean , sometimes even difficult to remove , and limits your cooking space . The pan also rarely has any ability to move up or down , limiting your vertical space too . With an in-oven broiler , you can adjust the existing racks to get thick items underneath , and control how close your food gets to the heat source ( and therefore how quickly it browns ) . I frequently kick on the broiler at the end of cooking with things like au gratin potatoes , to get a nice brown crust on top at the very end . I could n't fit the pan I use into a broiler drawer , but with the in-oven version I do n't even have to open the door . An in-oven broiler will also accommodate any size pan that will fit in your oven . Remember those flank steaks ? Regarding design , most gas ranges that I 've seen with an in-oven broiler have two separate burners , a main version at the bottom that provides indirect heat to the oven box , and the broiler running along the top with a sort of heat shield to reflect its energy down into the oven . Drawers often seem designed to take advantage of only a single burner at the bottom of the oven , which provides both indirect heat to the oven box and direct heat to the drawer . This is mostly my assumption ; I 'm not an engineer . This design could make drawers marginally cheaper ( again , I have n't checked ) but I think the advantages outweigh any price premium for the extra burner . I 'll be so bold as to say that you will be very pleased with the difference if all you 've ever used is a drawer .
Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth : Broths are the result of cooking meat , not just bones . They 're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own . The juices poured off from a roasted turkey ( after being degreased ) would be considered broth . Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth . Stocks are made from just the bones . They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes ( sauces , soups , stews , rice , etc. ) Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking . Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks , since it 's really hard to get all the meat off the bones . Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time ( 4-6 hours for chicken &amp; 8-12 for veal/beef ) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones . Broths are n't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods ( even chicken surrounded by the liquid ) will result in tough , flavorless meat . Consomme : a fortified and clarified stock . The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a " raft " which is a combination of lean ground meat ( appropriate to the type of stock being used ) with brunoise ( 1/16 inch ) mirepoix ( carrots , onions , celery ) , and egg whites . The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats , the proteins coagulate forming a " raft " on top of the stock . A small hole is poked in the center ( if one has n't already formed ) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor . Bouillon : French word for broth . Court Bouillon : sometimes called a " short broth " . A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water , acid ( lemon juice , vinegar , wine ) , parsley stems , bay leaves , peppercorns , and some salt . When to use Stock vs. Broth : Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred . Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity is n't important , and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch .
For the most part this is a question of convenience and how quickly you go through a fresh supply of spices in the quantities you buy . Pretty much every dry spice will last better and be more aromatic and flavorful if it is stored whole . That applies to leaves , seeds , bark , you name it . Some really hard spices like nutmeg may not be appropriate for the coffee grinder ( maybe if you break it up some first ? ) , but those are at least large enough to get a good grip for hand-grating . One exception for me would be specialty pre-blended spice mixes which sometimes have ingredients that would be really hard to track down , or which you might have to buy in much larger quantities than you can reasonably use . ( If you can get all the ingredients easily then it is probably better to blend it yourself to your own preferences and in the quantities you need . ) Another exception in my kitchen is hing ( asafetida ) which is a resin that in its pure form is extremely pungent and I find it difficult to work with . Commercially-prepared hing powder is generally diluted with rice flour and is much easier to use in appropriate quantities .
Metal Advantages : durable , no risk of absorbing flavours Disadvantages : may scratch certain cookware Wood Advantages : does n't scratch , looks nice Disadvantages : can wear down over time , can sometimes absorb flavours Plastic Does n't find a place in my kitchen other than a rubber spatula for baking . Silicone You did n't mention this , but I like it , because it works like rubber but can withstand high temps ( brushes , spatulas ) I think the answer really depends on what you cook . If you have a basic set ( wooden spoon , spatula that can handle heat , good ladle , chopsticks ) , you can make do without the rest as you start . You 'll quickly learn what you wish you had to make it a little easier .
As a substitute for untoasted sesame oil , most light oils will work ( light olive , peanut , canola , sunflower , etc ) . Any nut or seed oil should be pretty close . Toasted sesame oil has a much bolder and nuttier flavor . It could perhaps be approximated with a light oil and adding toasted sesame to your dish .
Oxtail would be your most likely substitute , but you have indicated you can not obtain it . The next best choice ( of those widely available ) is probably chuck , which is the shoulder muscle , and is well worked and flavored . It requires low and slow cooking for best results , much like shanks and tail do . Some stores -- even the chain grocery stores -- will special order for you if you ask them to , so you might be able to get shank . Depending on where you live , you may also try butchers at farmers ' markets , Dutch markets , or similar .
I 've never really considered there to be a real difference between sautéing and frying . They both mean to cook in a hot pan with a little bit of fat . However there is n't a lot of consistency online . It does n't look like there 's any sort of definitive answer here . Some points of view : <URL> , although frying might involve slightly more oil . The terms are essentially interchangeable . This is the top hit on a google search " sauteing frying " ( although this question is on the first page ! ) . <URL> , sautéing involves jumping the food while frying involves a little more oil and less flipping or stiring of the food . Here 's <URL> for this definition . This definition makes a delineation between pan frying and shallow frying . <URL> and involves partially submerging the food in oil . Food is normally breaded first . There 's no distinction between frying and shallow frying . This is Martha Stewart 's definition . As you can see , it 's really all over the map , and that was just from the first page of the google results . I think we 're getting in to issues with language changing beneath us . However , I think the safest bet is probably that sautéing involves a lot of stirring , frying does n't , and I should consider refining my own definitions . Caramelizing ( which fortunately does n't have any of the same confusion ) is a process that happens during cooking when sugar oxidizes . There are many different ways that you can achieve this effect . One of the ways is to sauté or fry ( depending on your definition ) something until the water sweats out and the remaining sugar heats up . So the answer is that you are caramelizing the onions by sautéing ( or maybe frying ) them .
Browning ingredients ( both meat and vegetables including the aromatics ) before doing a braise or stew ( which is what slow cookers do ) helps develop depth of flavor , through the <URL> where proteins and carbohydrates react together to create a myriad of flavorful compounds . Vegetables that are high in sugar , such as onions or leeks , and even carrots may also have some <URL> , where sugars react with each other , again creating flavorful compounds . Especially with beef , these deep browned flavors are often what people associate with the product , and what they expect to taste . On the other hand , browning almost by definition overcooks the outside of meat well past well done , so it is somewhat drier and tougher , although this can be mitigated by a long braise Some experts recommend browning only on one side of cubed meat , to compromise between getting flavor development , and getting good texture . The one thing browning or searing does n't do is " seal in the juices " ; that is a myth that is well de-bunked . The choice to brown or not brown is one of taste and balance . It is traditional in many recipes , especially of Western European heritage . There are many traditions where browning is not as frequent , including true Mexican cuisine and many Asian cuisines . Choose what seems most appropriate and tasty to you in a given dish . Personally , I like the flavor development , and almost always opt for browning .
Low quality chocolate chips often have additives in them that help them keep shape and shelf life , that 's why they 're not recommended . Callebaut callets are pure 100 % chocolate according to Callebaut . I 'd use them anywhere for bar or chips with great results . They might not come out of the oven looking exactly like a traditional chocolate chip cookie ( for example ) but they should taste fantastic !
Short of the danger of splashing hot liquid on you , or the standard immersion blender dangers of having it slip and hit you , there 's no additional risk with using immersion blenders on hot mixtures . Making hot soups creamy is pretty much exactly what they are designed for .
As a beer brewer , I 'm pretty concerned with fizz ;) Since the below may be a little tl ; dr , the short answer to your question is , " I do n't think so . " This is actually the first time I 've heard of the metal spoon " trick " , so I ca n't directly comment on that , but I 'll share a little of what I know about carbonation . Carbonation is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) that is dissolved in the liquid ( beer , champagne , soda ) . The fizz is that CO2 coming out of solution and escaping into the air . Keeping it cold helps keep the fizz , as CO2 dissolves more readily into a cold liquid . And conversely , comes out of a warm liquid more readily . Ever pour a glass of warm soda or champagne straight after opening ? It 'll foam over everywhere . The only way to not lose all that CO2 is to seal the container . Even then , the CO2 will come out of solution and pressurize the headspace ( space in the top of the container ) . That 's why you get a hiss when you first open a bottle . Again , temperature comes into play . In a warm bottle , more of the CO2 comes out of solution and pressurizes the headspace . Chill that same bottle down , and the CO2 can dissolve back into the liquid , giving you a sparkling beverage again . Now , back to the spoon . I would think that putting a spoon in the carbonation liquid would produce <URL> , causing the CO2 to come out of solution faster . This is why many beer glass manufacturers are coming out with laser-etched designs on the bottom of their glasses - the effervescence caused by the nucleation points helps bring out the hop aromas .
Sour cream could work . It has a similar flavor to plain greek yogurt , although the consistency is somewhat different . In fact , My fiance and I have switched to using greek yogurt in place of sour cream because of this since sour cream is higher in calories . I think it would be just fine for a sauce .
A paper filter is a true " filter " in that it basically only allows liquid to pass through . This means that you will have no sediment in your coffee , if that is a concern to you . Paper filters are absorbent though , so some of the flavor compounds of the coffee will be absorbed into the paper , and some other compounds as well ( a chemical in coffee that causes a rise in cholesterol is absorbed by the paper ) . The paper can also lead to a papery flavor in your coffee . Metal filters only filter out particulates of a certain size , so you will frequently end up with a layer of " sludge " at the bottom of your pot . Metal filters should be non-reactive though , so they will not add a flavor to your coffee and will allow everything extracted from your coffee to pass through . If cholesterol is n't a concern , I 'd say try both and see which you like better . <URL> <URL>
It 's absolutely fine to make the dough in advance , just do n't let it dry out . It even freezes well . There is more good information on <URL> on the subject . Keep it on the counter for up to a day , refrigerated for up to three days , frozen for up to 6 months ( for best quality ) . In any case that you want to hold the dough , be sure that your baking powder ( if using ) is of the <URL> variety .
Also known as a " bird 's beak " , it 's used for <URL> root vegetables ( turning them into little footballs ) and making fancy , delicate cuts when carving garnishes from fruit or vegetables . More practically , the curved blade is great for peeling round vegetables and fruit . It 's a complete pain in the butt to sharpen without a belt grinder ( or pro sharpening service with same ) , but gosh , it looks neat . Congrats on the fun present !

At what temperature will the fats on meat render ?
According to <URL> : 130-140 ° F - Fats begin to melt and render ( liquefy ) . This is a slow process and can take hours . Note : this is 55-60 C . The speed of the process will increase with temperature .

A meat thermometer is a device that can be left in food in the oven , the thermapop is not a meat thermometer because the plastic casing and electronic are not oven safe . If you put your thermapop in the oven and left it there you 'd destroy it . You could use it to measure air temperature outside the oven without a problem , although you 'd use up the battery quickly if you left it on constantly . The two most widely available meat thermometer types are mechanical ones which stick into the meat and have a dial you can read , and electronic ones which have a probe on a wire which goes into the meat in the oven . Either type can be used to measure oven temperature , you just put the probe in the oven without being in meat . Given how dirt cheap oven thermometers and room thermometers are these days there 's not much net gain though , you may as well invest a small amount of money in the right tool for the right job .
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
It aerates the sugar ( <URL> ) - adding tiny bubbles in the final product . It makes the finished product lighter and chewier instead of denser and hard .
To be perfectly honest with you , in all my years of cooking in kitchens I never took the temp of the fish . It was always by feel and look . Yes , I know that the gov ' t has guidelines that say 145F for fish but really when it comes down to it , if you have an 8oz cut of salmon/cod/monk in the pan , sticking an instant read into the middle wo n't do you much good . ( Caveat : If it was a salmon Wellington I would shoot for 130F as it 's a fully enclosed package that you ca n't feel for doneness ) The thickness of the cut will make a huge difference in when you should pull it out as you get post-oven cooking during resting in which the heat continues to heat the core of the flesh up to a final cooked temperature . That 's why most chefs will take the roast out at a rare measured temp when they are shooting for a med rare serving state . If your question is what state should monk fish be served , IE med rare ( like salmon ) or rare ( like tuna ) then I would say med-rare is your best bet . Over cooking is a bad thing for monk fish and it goes from a lovely moist state to dry nastiness really quick . A nice way to cook it that helps to give you a little move wiggle room when cooking it is to wrap it in Parma ham ( prosciutto ) . The little extra wrapping tastes great but also gives you a little bit of buffer as you get close to that magical temperature of doneness . Hope it helps .
If you mean the little paper frills on the ends of the bones on a Frenched rack of lamb , those are purely decorative .
The collagen in the ribs needs to get to a temperature of about 160 F to start breaking down into water and gelatin . If your oven can be set as low as 175 or 180 F on a normal bake or convection bake setting that is probably a better alternative unless you have access to an oven thermometer and can measure what temperature the warm setting on your oven attains .
Common noob mistakes : Cooking things too long . Meat dries out when it 's cooked to too high an internal temperature . That 's the whole thing , and it 's true no matter how you cook something . If you like your meat to be completely devoid of pink inside , it will be dry . No avoiding it . Find out what 's a good temperature for the doneness you desire , and use an instant-read thermometer to find out when you get there . You will also find that some cuts of meat want more cooking than others . A skirt steak wants hardly any cooking because it dries out easily . A New York strip , with good fat marbling , can withstand more cooking because it has that nice fat to keep things moist . Cooking with too much heat or too little . When the heat 's too high , you burn the outside before the middle can get to the temperature you want . If it 's too low , you never really get a good sear on the outside , and miss out on much of the grilled food experience . And you 'll need to learn to tailor your heat to the needs of what you 're cooking -- fish typically needs less than chicken , which needs less than beef or lamb . Putting the meat on too early . You need to wait for the charcoal to ash over and stop flaming . If you do n't wait for the coals to get right , you run a much greater risk of flare-ups and scorched food , not to mention off flavors from unburned wood or fillers in your charcoal . This is a non-issue with gas grills . Not preheating the grate . You need to put the grill grate over the coals as soon as you can so it preheats well . If your grate is n't preheated , you wo n't get grill marks , and your meat is more likely to stick . You need to do this if you have a gas grill too -- maybe more so , since they typically do n't get as hot . I 'd recommend that you find a basic book about grilling . Any of Steven Raichlen 's books will give you the general tips on how to do things . I 'm not wild about his overuse of rubs and sauces -- I think they 're totally unnecessary most of the time -- but he does know his way around a fire and a grill grate . However , if you want your meat well-done , be prepared to eat a lot of dry ( and likely tough ) meat . Your only option at that point is to switch to low-and-slow techniques that cook things like pork shoulder for a really long time at a low temperature ( traditional barbecue ) . The meat gets fully cooked , but because it has a lot of fat and connective tissue to render , retains a moist mouthfeel . But this is n't grilling , per se , and takes many hours .
The typical tricks used by chocolate manufacturers is to change the viscosity of chocolate by adding a gel like xanthan gum or glycerine . The other trick is to incorporate more water into the chocolate with the aid of an emulsifier such as lecithin . All these techniques are hard to do at home as they require many hours of stirring the chocolate to avoid grittiness . <URL> often give recipes . One can buy chocolate with higher melting points . <URL> melts at 55 ° C , the highest melting point for a commercial chocolate that I know of , but is not yet on sale . Many of the commercial chocolate bars , such as the wartime <URL> use chocolate that incorporate these techniques as do the <URL> .
Unfortunately , the function depends on the manufacturer . While turning off a set of elements may be common , another option is that the setting may just increase the cook time . Bagels are thicker and have more mass than sliced bread , so a longer toast time is necessary to have a similar level of toasting . In particular there are Cuisinart toasters where the bagel button only lengthens the time of the toasting and does not change the pattern . From <URL> Bagel button The bagel feature adds extra time to the toasting cycle to allow for thicker breads . You may also use the bagel button for English muffins and other thick breads .
I usually put tinfoil down and then lightly oil it . If done carefully , the tray stays clean and does n't need to be washed and the foil can be thrown out ( or used for a second batch of veggies if you have one ) .
To store fats , you should always use glass as plastics react to fats by absorbing some and perhaps discoloring or transferring flavors to your fat . Depending on use , I prefer to work with cold fat at the start as it has a much broader possible use and I do n't like to wait when I make biscuits , so I keep mine in the fridge . However , you gain very little extra life out of keeping it in the fridge and if you do n't keep it in a sealed container you run a very real risk of flavor transference there to . If you do n't make pastry dough or other such , your counter top is a perfectly acceptable place to store , as long as you use it up before it goes rancid . One thing to keep in mind is that fats can sometimes have very different shelf lives , so make sure you taste or smell before use , regardless of storage method .
Nuke or boil the spuds first to get them 75 % to 90 % done before they hit the grill I would n't use foil either , they grill much nicer bare skinned . Root vegetables suck up the smoke and get tasty dark patches from the grill , just keep and eye on them , and turn as needed
Try a <URL> . This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time ( weeks , not days ) .
Never down the drain . We 've had a few incidents in my neighborhood where the sewer pipes were clogged with fat , and a few people 's basements flooded with sewage as a result . For fats that solidify , let them do so , then pitch them in your regular garbage . Chill grease in the fridge if you need to get it to harden up . For ones that do n't solidify , pour them into a sealable ( <URL> ) bottle , and throw the whole container away with your regular garbage . It 's possible that your area might accept cooking fats &amp; oils as part of a recycling effort . Ours does for motor oil ( I live in Maryland ) . For restaurants , some places ( eg , the state of Maryland ) require a system for catching grease that 's been washed down the sink . It 's my understanding that they 're fairly expensive ( a couple thousand dollars US ) , but the fines for not having one installed may be even more , and they wo n't let new restaurants open without one .
I 'd deglaze the pan after each pan and transfer the juices to a small bowl to make a sauce I would wipe/clean ( no soap ) the pan after each batch . After the last batch , transfer the bowl content and make a sauce with the last pan drippings and what you already have .
My friend makes coconut crusts all the time and she bakes them at 350 degrees . But AllRecipes.com bakes their crust at 325 degrees for 15 minutes .
It is absolutely worth adding ground pork or veal . I usually use a leaner ground steak and compensate with a fatty ground pork ( shoulder is good ) - fat = flavour . Another tip is to take your time . Many people try and cook bolognese in half an hour , but considering ground meat is usually made with tougher cuts , you end up with tough meat and under-developed flavours . Use plenty of onions and garlic , brown your meat well , use good wine , stock , tomatoes and herbs ( thyme , rosemary and bay ) and gently simmer that bad boy for at least 3 hours . For ultimate flavour , cook it the day before and let the flavours marry overnight .
I have never heard of Tofu being called " vegetable meat " . There are some fake meat types based on different types of soya products ( or also other plant proteins ) , like " fake duck " . But the only product I have seen bearing the generic label " vegetable meat " is <URL> . It is made from soya beans whose fat has been extracted to be used for oil production . As for " non artificial " , I have no idea what your personal definition of " artificial " is . It does n't grow on trees , but then neither does butter , and I have never heard people condemn butter as " artificial " . It is a processed product , and it is not a traditional process , but I ca n't tell you if it is more or less processed than traditional heavily processed foods such as sugar . Also , the amount of chemicals involved is probably dependent on the manufacturer . I guess you have to trust the regulatory organs of your country to not allow the production of food containing something harmful . Organic ? This depends on the manufacturer too . If he adhers to organic production guidelines , then it is organic . And hygienic ? This is even harder to answer , it depends on not only the manufacturer 's decisions about the process , but also on the day-to-day process quality measures his employees take . There is no reason to say that " vegetarian meat " is the same as vegetarian Chinese food . A cup of rice served in a Chinese restaurant is vegetarian and Chinese , but does not include any kind of meat substitute . If I cook a French recipe and use textured soy protein as meat replacement , this makes it vegetarian , but not Chinese . There can be some overlap between the two , but I doubt that it is big . China has had social conditions leading to vegetarian lifestyles ( poverty , religious restrictions ) for long before production of such protein began . I doubt that any restaurants in the world are famous for it , mainly because it is a poor meat analogue . Yes , it offers a high amount of protein . But it does not taste really like meat . World-famous restaurants are world-famous because they offer high-quality food , and no food using inferior substitutions is high-quality . Yes , there are good vegetarian restaurants , but they do n't make poor imitations of meat dishes using fake meats , they offer vegetarian dishes made from good ingredients . Some of them can feature some of the more popular soy products like tofu , but they are probably not famous for their tofu , because the tofu is not the main star of all dishes . This all assumes that what you refer to is actually the textured vegetable protein I linked , but that is far from clear from your question . Other possibilities exist , because people have long tried to find a suitable meat substitute for vegetarians and for people who ca n't afford real meat . Most are soy-based , like the mentioned tofu and tempeh , but there are also wheat-based ones like seitan , and I think that there was some kind of beans product used sometimes instead of meat . Without you giving us more information , we ca n't conclude for sure which one you mean . But the answers to the other questions is about the same , with the exception that some processing methods are older than others and so can be considered more traditional ( in case this plays a role for your understanding of " artificial " ) .

How could I make stuffed french fries ?
So I have a method that I just worked out but it is insanely labor intensive and only suited to small batches . With that said , here you go . Also , steps will be slightly out of order so make sure you read completely through . To create filled french fries : First , you need to cut your potatoes into slightly larger fries than normal . You are looking for about 1/2 to 2/3 of an inch on each side . You need to preheat your grease to 275 . Once your grease has preheated , parcook the french fries . They should be cooked but not crisped or browned . Lay fries in a layer on a pan and place into fridge . Prepare your injection . I used sour cream but you can add whatever you want . ( I thinned the sour cream down with a little milk till it got to the consistency that I wanted ) Load your injection into a syringe and inject into the now cooled but not cold fries . Do n't over-inject or you will ruin fries left and right . Inject by running the needle fully in , then slowly removing while slowly deploying the filling . As you inject , lay on a pan in the freezer . This is important because you need to get the fries frozen as quick as possible . While you wait , prepare your seasoned flour . I tried some with out the flour and the fries tended to lose the filling . Your are going to be working the fries in small batches . It is imperative that the fries be frozen through , if they are n't you will lose your filling . Toss a handful of fries into the flour and coat thoroughly . Alternately , you can coat fries in an egg wash then flour , but the results were a little too far from traditional fries for me . Toss the fries into 375 degree oil until fries brown and are crisp on outside . You need to watch carefully and as soon as they start floating count to ten then remove . You ca n't over cook them or you will not have any filling remaining . A couple of extras : I do n't know how a filling that is predominately water will work in these , but I would conjecture very poorly given how fries cook . Your hole in the potato is only going to be sealed with flour so you might see some leakage . I could n't figure out a way around that . You benefit from the freezing with a much improved bite texture over my normal fry prep . The final result has a high wow factor , and was pretty tasty . I am not sure the results are worth the effort , but I think if you try a high flavor filling it will go a long way to making it worth while .
The theory is to pasteurize them sous-vide at 57ºC for 1:15 ' . You must be able to control the temperature , so specialized equipment is needed ( ronner or similar ) . The resulting egg has a different texture than ordinary ( and I believe it tastes more ' yolky ' ) . I 've kept homemade mayo for more than two weeks without problem ( off smell / taste ) . Custards are heated , so no pasteurized eggs are needed , just like hollandaise sauce .
You could fold with a heat-safe silicone spatula , that will let you reach the whole surface of the pan so you do n't get scorching , without introducing so many bubbles . Or if you happen to have a vacuum machine , put your sauce in a bag after you make it and vacuum out all of the air . Voila , bubbles gone .
Harms ? Meh , that 's silliness . You can make your own fizzy water if you 're so inclined . <URL> . If you really do n't want fizzy , then just substitute still water in any of the recipes in a search for <URL> . Choose recipes that use soda water , club soda or seltzer water , not ginger ale . Ginger ale adds flavor , you want recipes that stand without that flavor . EDIT : Just to be clear ; soda water , club soda or seltzer water are all just water , injected with carbon dioxide to make bubbles ( carbonation ) . So by substituting regular water for soda water , club soda or seltzer water all you 're losing is the " fizzy " . ( Club soda may have a tiny amount of something like baking soda to neutralize the decrease in PH caused by the carbonation , <URL> gets further into it , but for all practical purposes , they are all just bubble water . )
No , it wo n't work . Michael 's comment explains why . Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed , it is fat and water emulsified . This is a big difference . If you had some special reason to do this on a regular basis , you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers . You can beat any fat with water and lecithine or xanthan and get a creamy result . As far as I know , this is how plant based cream substitutes work . But if the issue is that you just do n't have whipping cream right now at home , then it is easier to go buy whipping cream than to go find emulsifiers ( I buy mine online , do n't know if there are brick-and-mortar B2C stores which sell them ) . If for some reason you absolutely ca n't do it in time , I would suggest using a different filling . Pastry cream works well with millefeulle , buttercream can work too , lightened with whipped eggwhites if necessary .
Basically , it is that easy . But it is a costly endeaver . I have know chefs to make it with a pure olive oil or grape seed oil . Some heat it to 220 degrees or so but I have meet some that do n't . The ones that did n't made sure to pull the oxygen from the bottle with one of those wine vacuum savers . I have been told self made truffle oil will lose it truffle flavor due to most the flavor actually coming from an odorant . I have not personally made any so I ca n't speak from experience on how long it will hold . All the above being said . If I had the money to buy some truffle , I am not sure the best use for them would be to make truffle oil .
Great french toast starts with the bread . You 're looking for two things : thick slices , and staleness . Why stale ? Stale bread has enough firmness to stand up to the custard . If you do n't have stale bread available , you can set it out the night before in a simple wire rack . At least 8 hours should be enough to stale it up nicely . They will be rather firm to the touch . The ideal finished product is crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle . This might be what you mean by mushy , but mushy in my mind is kind of negative . The key to accomplishing this is to let your bread soak in the custard only 30 seconds per side , but then move it to a rack to sit for another 2 minutes further . This extra set time allows the custard to penetrate deep inside the bread , and be distributed much more evenly . The final trick to getting a nice crispy crust , is to cook it twice . First in the pan/griddle as you normally would , but then 5 minutes in a 375 F oven on a rack . This brief oven stint crisps up the exterior nicely . I highly suggest watching Alton Brown 's <URL> episode . That 's where I learned the oven trick , and his recipe has n't done me wrong since . Regarding <URL> , I 've never had it , but based on the Wikipedia description it sure sounds like a good candidate . Just make sure you slice and stale it overnight .
You do want a coarse grind for french press coffee . The key is letting the coffee steep for long enough to make a strong brew . I have good results with a 5 minute steep time . Be sure to use a timer , and compare different times to find the optimal brew . As a general rule , if you are at altitude , then you need to add time because boiling water is cooler . ( Note that I am at 5000ft , so 5 minutes may be too long for you . ) Below is a picture of the coffee chunks in a coarse grind on top of a US 5 cent coin ( 21.21 mm in diameter ) . The picture is from <URL> . EDIT : The reason to use a coarse grind for a french press is that finer grinds will get stuck in the filter and/or push their way through . This has three potential problems : 1 ) it will be harder to press down the filter , possibly leading to spillage or breakage ; 2 ) your coffee will have grinds in it ; 3 ) the coffee may become bitter , as the finer grinds that passed through the filter remain in contact with the coffee for too long .
The proportions on everything look correct ( including the milk ! ) EXCEPT that is a very small amount of butter for 3C flour . There is also no sugar in that recipe -- and even a very small amount of sugar will change the texture of the dough . I personally would triple the amount of butter , add 2-3T sugar , and then re-try the recipe . VERY cold butter will also help with a lighter finished baked scone . As for the comment that the oven time is too hot and long -- the temperature is good -- but I would think the baking time would fall more in the range of 15-20 minutes , depending upon whether you are baking from frozen dough or freshly made scone dough . A hot oven , as opposed to a moderate oven ( 350 degrees F -- normal for cookies and cakes ) is recommended for biscuits and scones . Since all ovens bake differently , rely less on the actual time and more on how the scone looks -- it should be lightly golden on top and not doughy in appearance in the center . A cake tester can be used to be certain that the center is fully baked . good luck -- it always seems to take a little effort to find the scone recipe that you think is perfect !!
The potato is probably not as important as the method . Simply frying them will not get you the fry you want . Basically you boil them , then double fry them . Here are the steps for <URL> : Ingredients 2 pounds russet potatoes ( about 4 large ) , peeled and cut into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch fries ( keep potatoes stored in a bowl of water ) 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar Kosher salt 2 quarts peanut oil Procedure Place potatoes and vinegar in saucepan and add 2 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt . Bring to a boil over high heat . Boil for 10 minutes . Potatoes should be fully tender , but not falling apart . Drain and spread on paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet . Allow to dry for five minutes . Meanwhile , heat oil in 5-quart Dutch oven or large wok over high heat to 400 ° F. Add 1/3 of fries to oil ( oil temperature should drop to around 360 ° F ) . Cook for 50 seconds , agitating occasionally with wire mesh spider , then remove to second paper-towel lined rimmed baking sheet . Repeat with remaining potatoes ( working in two more batches ) , allowing oil to return to 400 ° F after each addition . Allow potatoes to cool to room temperature , about 30 minutes . Continue with step 3 , or for best results , freeze potatoes at least over night , or up to 2 months . Return oil to 400 ° F over high heat . Fry half of potatoes until crisp and light golden brown , about 3 1/2 minutes , adjusting heat to maintain at around 360 ° F. Drain in a bowl lined with paper towels and season immediately with kosher salt . Cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set on a sheet tray in a 200 ° F oven while second batch is cooked . Serve immediately . Worth reading is also <URL> .
Custard should taste eggy . This is a feature , not a bug . However , from your mention of flour , I think what you 're talking about is a souffle , not something like a creme brulee or along those lines . Would that be correct ? Edited based on subsequent clarifications : Ah . Your method is sorely lacking , and your ingredients are off . You need to temper the yolks first , you need to use yolks only , and use cream instead of milk . Here is a smaller version of what I use at work for creme brulee : - 1L 35 % cream - 11 egg yolks - 1C sugar - 1 vanilla bean , scraped Bring cream to a simmer with the vanilla seeds and pod ( you can use approx 1.5 tsp vanilla extract , pure not artificial , instead ) . While it is heating , beat the yolks and sugar together until just incorporated . Pour the cream into the eggs whisking briskly to prevent curdling . Pour mixture through a fine chinois . Skim off foam , pour into ramekins . Place ramekins in a pan , add water to 1/2way up the sides . Cover pan with foil . Bake at 275 ( convection ) or 325 ( non convection ) for approx 40 minutes , until wobbly in the centre but set . Chill until set , eat . The deflation is caused by a souffle effect coming from including the egg whites , which are never used in a custard -- custards , creme anglaise , etc , are always yolks only . When you include the whites , air will be trapped inside temporarily , and will escape/collapse when the mixture cools . If you bake until fully stiff with my method , you will get hard and rubbery custard by the time it is set in the fridge . Also , save the whites -- they freeze well -- for meringues or souffles .
Type of flour : rice Liquid : soda ( seltzer ) water Mix as little as possible . Lumps are okay . Dip quickly , drop into 350 veg/soy oil .
Depending on how far overcooked it is , then you might be able to resuscitate it by cutting it into smaller pieces and cooking it low and slow in some liquid . For example , you could use it as the meat in a stew , or slice it thinly and then braise it with some vegetable to make a pot-roast . This also gives you an opportunity to introduce additional flavor , as it sounds as if that may have been lacking as well .
Many of the dried noodles that are marketed as " udon " -- at least in my experience in the USA -- are actually mislabeled , thinner noodles like <URL> or even <URL> . I would suggest buying the semi-dried variety that are usually packaged in vacuum sealed plastic . This variety is shelf stable , but it can often be found in the refrigerated section of Asian mega-marts . The noodles will already be almost full size before cooking .
You 've pretty much answered your own question . Put the PB in a blender , drizzle in a little peanut oil , blitz and season to taste with salt and a little sugar if you want it . I 'd add them all slowly : you can always add , you ca n't take away .
I am happy to give you a brief idea , but you may have to tell me how much info you need Get the lotus leaves from chinese shop and they are usually dried leaves , so you need to soak them in water for a night . After that give it a wash and cut it to the right side sticky rice is a type of rice , so that 's what you need . Do n't use any other rice as they wo n't stick . You will need to soak the rice in water for couple of hours and add couple drops of oil . Prepare whatever you want to put in your rice like mushroom and meat When u make the wrap , put a layer of rice on the leaf and then place the meat and mushroom on the rice . After that put another layer of rice on top and wrap it up Put the wrapped rice to steam and I can not help you with the time , but it 's between 10-20 mins Good luck
There has been a belief , at times wildly popular , the using a half full can of beer ( or soda , or other beverage ) as a base when barbqecuing or roasting chicken helps keep it moist , and imparts flavor . This is <URL> . As Meathead says in the linked article : No way the beer adds moisture . The method is supposed to add moisture to the meat . But the can is inserted half way up the cavity and blocks the meat from contact with moisture . It acts like a condom . so any vapor that escapes the top of the can , and there is n't much , will only come in contact with the upper half of the cavity . The surface area of the exterior of the bird is vastly greater than the surface area of the cavity , and after blocking off half the cavity with the can , there is very little surface area for flavor to penetrate . He also explains in detail why beer can not add much flavor , if any -- there are very few flavorful ingredients in beer as a proportion of the whole which is mostly water . While I am not familiar with Irn Bru , I imagine that most or all of the logic still applies .
Seltzer and carbonated water are the same thing . Club soda is slightly different . <URL> The term seltzer water is a genericized trademark that derives from the German town Selters , which is renowned for its mineral springs . Naturally carbonated water has been commercially bottled and shipped from this town since the 18th century or earlier . Generally , seltzer water has no added sodium salts , while club soda still retains the sodium salts . So , the primary difference is that seltzer has no added ingredients , but <URL> : Sodium bicarbonate , sodium chloride , sodium phosphate and sodium citrate are added to club soda ... <URL> of the ingredients list and taste of various types of fizzy water . So to answer your question directly , you can make seltzer just by carbonating regular tap water , and you can make club soda by adding potassium bicarbonate , potassium sulfate , or baking soda to water and carbonating it .
In general , you can roast peppers to develop a richer flavor . Then skin the pepper and you can use it for salsas , sauces , or just slice/dice it up for a sandwich .
It really is an issue of personal preference . If you prefer a rocking motion , the German profile suits your style better ; if you are a push-and-slide person , the French profile is more suitable for you . It also possible to find models at various points within the range . See this <URL> thread for an in depth discussion ( with diagrams at one point ) . The original poster concludes , quite correctly in my opinion : But ... let 's keep our senses of perspective and humor . A German knife wo n't turn a good cutter into a bad one , and a French knife wo n't do the opposite . Both profiles suit the classic , European and American styles of food and knife skills . It comes down to taste and training .

How can I know when my yogurt is ready ( in a generic , basic , non-us yogurt maker ) ?
According to <URL> , you can you tell if your yogurt is ready by " gently jiggling one of the containers ... the yogurt will not move if it is ready and you can take it from the yogurt maker and put it in the refrigerator then . Or you can wait and let it get more tart for 12 hours or more . " It also gives more specific instructions about the three types of yogurt makers , so you can see which one you own and follow more recommendations based on that .
Even if it is possible , it is a very , very bad idea as you do n't know what cultures or pathogens are in the already spoiled milk . Fermented dairy products should only be made from fresh milk in good condition -- and in most cases , that milk should be pasteurized while fresh absolutely as soon as possible from the source cows .
Making <URL> means letting <URL> alter the texture and chemical composition of milk by digesting lactose and producing lactic acid , which in turn interacts with the proteins in the milk , causing the milk to thicken and taste sour . Unlike in cheese making you are not separating curds and whey , so you are not " losing " significant amounts of substance . Yes , there might be some fluctuation - an increasing number of lactobacillae and them eating lactose - but on a very small level . For our general kitchen precision , 500 g milk makes 500 g yogurt . Side note : 500 ml milk is not exactly 500 g , in fact , it 's 510 g according to my sources , but I consider these values precise enough for general cooking purposes . Otherwise , you ca n't even stir , as minute amounts will remain on spooons or in your pots and pans . This is a kitchen , not a lab .
This is known as " back bacon " in Canada , and when brined rather than smoked , it 's peameal bacon . Canadian bacon is , sadly , usually just some sort of processed ham product meant to resemble back bacon . It 's also known here in the US as Irish rashers or British rashers ( a rasher is the british term for a slice of the sort of bacon you 're after ) . It can also show up as simply Irish bacon or British bacon . Google any of those terms to find internet vendors .
This is a combination of the type of cheese and too much heat . Some cheeses melt more readily ( mozzarella for example ) , but all of them will seize up if they are heated too much too fast - the proteins ' curl up ' and separate from the fat and water in the cheese . To combat this , you should chop or grate the cheese up to speed up melting , and lower the heat a little before adding it . You should also avoid using cheese straight from the fridge .
You absolutely do n't need a bread maker for good bread . They have been making bread for at least 22,000 years and I promise , in the vast majority of those , having a bread maker would have gotten you stoned as a witch ( if you had electricty to run it ) . However , a good bread maker will vastly cut down on the time you have to spend making bread . Basically , bread by hand requires a few hours and lot of physical kneading to develop the gluten that gives bread it 's structure and in a bread machine , you dump the ingredients in , turn it on and walk away , then come back and enjoy some fresh bread .
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on . Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat . Give cast iron ample preheating time , and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan . That equals crispy . Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron . You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan . That alone probably would n't make much of a difference , but considering that you 're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes , the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan . That is not a friend of crispiness . You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature . I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan . Teflon , on the other hand , should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time . Some people go so far as to say that you should n't preheat it all . So if your beginning temperatures were about the same in the pans , they should n't have been . After you put in the potatoes , forget about it . You 'll never get the same kind of crispy sear with a teflon pan as you will with cast iron , even if you do n't know how to best exploit the advantages of cast iron .
There are two choices when flavoring yogurt : <URL> . If you want to make a batch of yogurt and choose your flavors later you may enjoy adding coconut extract ( or other extracts ) after the fact . However , if you are set on a single flavor ( as your question implies ) you will get better results adding a flavoring oil , the chemistry of oils vs. alcohol seem to react differently . Check out the " <URL> " link , he has done some experimenting that will help you along .
You can add a handful of pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds . You do n't need to adjust any of the other ingredients . Sunflower seeds contain a ton of good stuff , including fibre , according to <URL> : " In addition to linoleic acid ( an essential fatty acid ) , sunflower seeds are also an excellent source of dietary fiber , some amino acids ( especially tryptophan ) , Vitamin E , B Vitamins ( especially vitamin B1 or thiamine , vitamin B5 or pantothenic acid and folate ) , and minerals such as copper , manganese , potassium , magnesium , iron , phosphorus , selenium , calcium and zinc . [ 5 ] Additionally , they are rich in cholesterol-lowering phytosterols . "
In this case , inoculation refers to the introduction of yoghurt bacteria ( <URL> ) that transform the milk into yoghurt . If anything goes wrong - from unclean conditions that let other bacteria grow to unfavourable temperatures that inhibit the proper growth of your desired lactobacillae - you speak of improper inoculation . The effects on taste and possibly food-safety have been discussed in your linked posts . So work in a clean environment , use a good strain of bacteria and maintain the recommended temperature range to prevent this .
Greek yogurt is simply strained yogurt . It was only fairly recently that Greek yogurt was widely available in the United States , so prior to wide availability , a simple substitute was to strain normal yogurt . The type of sauce you are trying to make would definitely use a strained yogurt . Whether you wanted to strain your own or buy strained yogurt ( aka Greek yogurt ) is really up to you . In Greece , sheep 's milk was traditionally used for yogurt , but now there 's a lot more cow 's milk too , so either would be authentic . I would think that full fat would be the most authentic , but not the healthiest , as I doubt low fat varieties were used traditionally ( if they even existed ) . The American use of the term Greek yogurt is really just one of branding . Many other areas in the middle east use the same style of strained yogurt . The Greeks also have plenty of normal ( unstrained ) yogurt .
Technically , this is not precisely buttermilk , but it 's pretty close in both composition and usage . The term " <URL> " can actually refer to a wide range of fermented milk varieties . Traditionally , buttermilk was produced by allowing natural bacteria present in cream to ferment some of the sugar <URL> into <URL> . This made churning butter from the cream easier and also helped protect the cream from spoiling . After the butter was churned and removed , the liquid that remained would be your buttermilk ( today referred to as " traditional " ) . Nowadays , mass-produced " cultured " buttermilk is produced by taking pasteurized low-fat milk and introducing bacterial cultures to produce lactic acid in a similar fashion . That 's similar to how <URL> is produced , but yogurt is generally allowed to ferment for longer until the milk proteins set and thicken . There are many varieties of yogurt with slightly different cultures from each other and from cultured buttermilk , and the beginning fat content of the milk can differ too . So , technically these are distinct , but if you use milk to thin out yogurt , you 're producing a beverage that ( like buttermilk ) contains lactic acid , producing that distinctive tangy flavor , and which ( like buttermilk ) is somewhat thicker than milk . Your identified ratio is the same as <URL> that I found while searching around , so you can definitely use this to substitute . There are also <URL> available . <URL> also covers similar information , in addition to being a colorful exploration of related terms .
Frozen yogurt made with full fat yogurt is very creamy and full flavored . You might find that the eggs are unnecessary . If you do do the custard watch you temperature carefully as yogurt curdles easily when it is heated . If you have a lot of fat in the yogurt then it will be resistant to curdling otherwise you can take out some insurance by mixing in a little bit of corn starch - if that is allowed . Honey is perfectly fine and many frozen yogurt recipes call for it .
An espresso machine usually needs to push water at somewhere between 8 and 15 bar pressure , which is quite a lot . And since it is the high-pressure components that are key to how they work , it is the quality and durability of these that tends to set the price point . The quality of the pump varies from a device intended to be used for two or three cups once a week , all the way to professional machines designed to produce thousand of cups a day , month after month . This is why domestic machines are usually quite clear that they are for domestic use only : they simply can not cope with the duty cycle of any more than that . Many domestic espresso machines will turn themselves off if they are used to make too many cups in one session - quite simply , they overheat . It sounds like one you bought is one intended for occasional use . My advice is to visit a couple of retailers that have staff dedicated to selling espresso machines . They will , of course , try to sell you " their " brand , but they will also recognise when someone needs a domestic unit designed for daily use as opposed to one just for special occasions . As a bonus , you generally get what you pay for with espresso machines . The more expensive domestic ones usually really do last much longer .
You are trying to add the yoghurt at too high a temperature . Let the dish cool to around 75 deg C before adding the yoghurt , and make adding the yoghurt the last thing you do before serving .
Many of the commercial yoghurts use stabilizers like <URL> to prevent the yoghurt from separating during transport . All fruits naturally contain pectin ( some more than others ) , so one option , if you are making your own yoghurt at home , is to add some fruit to it . Here in the US , supermarkets carry small bags of dry pectin powder ; if you can get some of that , you could try adding it to your yoghurt . Another option is to initially heat your milk to 85 ° C for a half hour before cooling it and adding your yoghurt starter . This heating serves two purposes : ( 1 ) it gets rid of some of the excess moisture through evaporation , and ( 2 ) the heating will denature ( i.e. , stretch out and relax ) some of the milk 's proteins . Denatured proteins will be able retain more of the liquid that is in the final product . Finally , you can add powdered milk to the mix ( about 125ml of powdered milk per liter of milk ) . Powdered milk is basically just milk protein , so the added protein will help contain some of the final liquid .
An avocado will keep a few days in the refrigerator after it has been cut . The cut portion will turn brown/black due to oxidation , you can just cut that off , it is not harmful . From <URL> to keep the avocado from discoloring sprinkle it with lemon/lime juice or vinegar and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or place in an airtight container . From <URL> storing a cut avocado with a piece of cut onion in an airtight container will stop the oxidation . I do n't know why this is , but I suspect that it has to do with the sulfur compounds that the onion releases . This is the same sulfur that makes you cry when you chop onions , but it is also used as a preservative . The onion 's smell and taste do n't seem to transfer to the avocado , as far as I can tell . But I 'm not overly sensitive to onions , so you may want to check this out first if you are . When not to use , from WebMD if your avocado 's flesh has become very dark or the flesh has become stringy you should avoid eating it , particularly if there is any sign of mold . Avocados have a very high fat content , so they oxidize and become rancid very quickly at room temperature and will need to be thrown away .
Per the information on <URL> , there is no mention of the pan being pre-seasoned . But there is also no mention of needing to do so . From the maintenance tab on the linked page : Before you cook Remove all labels and packaging materials . Before using your new cookware , wash thoroughly in hot soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge . Dry completely . General cooking tips Prior to each use , it is recommended to add a teaspoon of cooking oil for better cooking results . Never heat an empty utensil . Be sure there is oil , butter , liquid or food before placing the cookware on the range or burner . It is not recommended to use high heat . Cooking on excessive heat can cause permanent damage to the surface and utensil . Never cut anything in the cookware or use utensils with sharp edges as to avoid damaging the surface . Add salt to water only after is has come to a boil . Salt grain deposit on the cookware bottom will attack the metal as the heat melts it down . There is also other information about cleaning and oven use . All said , I do n't follow a set rule about seasoning non-stick cookware even though I 've often seen it recommended . But when I have heated oil in a non-stick pan it does seem to do better afterwards , especially with older pans . And I always hand wash non-stick cookware . To sum up , I do n't see how you could cause any harm by pre-seasoning the pan and occasionally reseasoning , even if it does n't need it . But this is based on my experience and I have n't used this brand . The only other thing I can suggest is to contact the company and see what they say . Since they do n't mention pre-seasoning , I suspect they will say it is n't necessary . If you do contact them , we 'd be interested in what you find out . And welcome to Seasoned Advice ! EDIT : I was assuming that the OP knew about seasoning a non-stick pan , as the question is about how to tell if a non-stick pan is pre-seasoned when new . To be very clear , seasoning a non-stick pan is NOT the same thing as seasoning a cast iron or other bare metal pan . Should you ( or anyone ) decide to season a non-stick pan , please make sure to follow a recommended procedure .
Rule of thumb , dairy in the north and coconut in southern recipes . ie korma would n't have coconut Indian yogurt is made with whole milk . As with western recipes , balancing the fat for good mouth-feel is important : yogurt can be a good choice when a larger quantity of liquid is called for . Cream works great when a finishing splash smooths out flavors without watering down Acidity is also important . Does the dish need a tangy component or a softening of acids ? A dish could use both : yogurt marinade then a bit of cream to finish . For richness and a hint of sweetness along with a wonderful aroma , coconut ca n't be beat but will be a discernable flavor in most curries . Many restaurants are making use of coconut where it is less than traditional with good results .

Is this ' browned butter ' ?
Yes , that is how browned butter or beurre de noisette ( as it is called in French ) is made . Of course , normally , you would not let it scorch to black . You want a rich hazelnut color as indicated by the French term .
Hah , I get to cite my new copy of McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " for the first time ! There are several things going on here ( all of which can be found in the 2004 edition of McGee , most on page 50 ) . Firstly , as Nathan indicates in his answer , most of the liquid that is sold as buttermilk these days is in fact not " real " buttermilk , but so-called " cultured buttermilk " , made from ordinary skim milk and fermented until acid and thick . Secondly , even traditional buttermilk was somewhat sour , though less than cultured buttermilk . To find out why , let 's examine the processes that were involved in making it . If you want to make butter , you start by separating milk into cream and whey . Since the 19th century , we typically do that with a centrifuge and it goes quite quickly , but before then , we would leave it to gravity . That would take a while , and the milk would start to ferment while it happened - especially in warmer environments . This fermenting is essentially lactic acid bacteria converting lactose into lactic acid , which sours the milk a little . So in either case , you would have more lactic acid in butter + buttermilk than in butter + whole milk .
It is certainly a fermentation . A simple chemical neutralization would n't need that much time , and would n't produce lasting fizz . You can be certain that there are wild yeasts everywhere : in the air in your kitchen , on your elderflower , probably on your utensils , etc. . It is impossible to say which ones prevailed in the fermentation , the ones you brought in with the elderflower or the ones which came into it from some other sources .
The reason is that butter can inhibit gluten formation . It ' coats ' the proteins that would form gluten . You knead the dough first to get gluten , and then add the butter afterward around the already formed gluten . You can add it earlier , you just end up with less gluten and a more tender dough . Creaming is n't usually done with bread , as its purpose is air bubble formation .
The only way that the butter could be incorporated without creaming would be to melt it . Melting butter , or allowing it to get too soft , even if just left at room temperature too long will result in what I call " pancake cookies " ... those that just spread out and run all over the baking sheet . This is also the reason that butter should NEVER be softened in the microwave . Creaming butter and sugar aerates the butter with tiny little air pockets . The reason it becomes lighter in color is due to the air that has been incorporated . The moisture inside the air pockets from the butter itself to eggs , milk , etc. turns to steam and the steam ( aided by any leavening that might be called for in the recipe ) helps the cookies to " puff " . If you do n't cream the butter and sugar you 'll most likely have very poor results . The expense of the wasted and ingredients and your time would be enough to pay for an inexpensive hand mixer .
Nope . For peanut butter cookies it 's just a matter of taste , and it 's 1:1 .
You can call the manufacturers and ask them if it is " INDUCTION READY " The packaging &amp; the insert with specifications &amp; instructions should say that . Youu can ask the customer service at Amazon too , may be they will have the answer . But I also located an answer on the internet , which I am including the link : <URL>
Pros : Higher smoking point . Regular butter 's smoking point is 325-375F while clarified butter is around 485F . But it can still smoke and burn ! However the higher smoking point means it 'll be much more applicable in terms of sauteing food without worrying about burning the butter . 100 % fat . Often times its hard to calculate the exact replacements in baking when you want to replace a fat with butter because regular butter is n't 100 % fat . Using regular butter , you would need to factor in how much extra water you are introducing into the recipe . Longer shelf life . Without the water and milk solids , the shelf life of the clarified butter will be much longer . Can even be stored without refrigeration . Cons : Less buttery flavor . The milk solids that you are removing makes up a lot of butter 's flavor . By removing this , you are removing flavor .
Toasted almonds match well with hazelnuts , cumin , nutmeg , rosemary , vanilla and cinnamon . Cranberries do match well with garlic , lime , chili and onion . So from a flavor-pairing point of view , if you want a spicy dip , it would be better to make a cranberry dip in itself with cranberries , sugar , chili , pineapple and coriander , like a chutney . Mustard is a gamble . Cranberries do match well with some acidity , like lime or pineapples . I would be worried about the vinegar to be too stingy . If it 's a garlic-based dip , I would focus on garlic , onions , rosemary and cumin .
You need to 1 ) increase the emulsification , and 2 ) reduce the amount of time the sauce is very hot . You can try adding honey or mustard to the sauce , that will improve emulsification . You can also hit it with a stick blender which will do a much better job of breaking it up than can be done by hand . Also it may look ok after a few hours but who knows how much separation is starting to happen at a very small scale and will accelerate when it hits heat . Add the sauce at the last possible moment before plating . It is n't going to benefit from cooking , and it is n't going to marinade into the cooked food , so do n't have it in any longer than it takes for it to warm up . 20 seconds is probably all it will take .
Butter can go bad . The oils will go rancid if exposed to too much light and heat for too long . This accelerates the process of oxidation , which happens even if you keep the butter in the fridge . Even in the fridge your butter will eventually go bad . Personally I follow the dates on all packages . I do so with an awareness that they usually tend to be conservative , which keeps me comfortable . Rancid butter in a taste test wo n't kill you , though . It 'll just taste bad . So you should be able to taste this butter to see if it is bad . While I recommend following the dates on packaging , here are signs that your butter has actually gone bad : discoloration melting ( which will happen outside of the fridge , you probably would n't see it ) sour smell sour and unusual taste
There are actually two dishes being sold , and neither is " Phở " . The words that she yelled and had Gordon do the same were " Hủ tiếu , Bún riêu " . They are both noodle soups , the former is pork based broth , and the latter , porc and shrimp/crab with tomatoes . You can google the words for more info .
Peanut butters that are not " all natural " include cheaper oils along with sugar and emulsifiers to keep the mixture from separating and to make it lighter and smoother . That lack of emulsifiers could make a huge difference but it depends a lot on the recipe . In a normal cookie dough fat is creamed with sugar and eggs are beaten in one at a time which adds a ton of emulsification power from the lecithin in the yolks . Additionally - the fat will bind with the flour and be baked into the cookies . Like Jefromi - I have not had any problem with the fat from natural peanut butter separating out after baking . If you made a cookie dough and either left out the yolks or did n't beat it well enough to properly emulsify - and then let the batter sit out for a while before baking I would fully expect the peanut oil to separate .
You will have to put on your asbestos chef 's fingers and roll them while hot I 'm afraid . You should leave them for about 15 seconds once they 're out of the oven . If you leave them for too long to cool you can always pop them back in the oven for a few seconds to re-soften . One thing that might help you is silicon baking sheets . Not only are these very ' non-stick ' , they also flexible , so you can use them as pseudo-oven gloves to roll the brandy snaps up .
I do n't know whether it 's meant to be melted but it 's not how raclette cheese in France or Switzerland is usually like . Livradois is not a region I would spontaneously associate with raclette either . Having grown up in the Alps , I would personally consider raw milk raclette cheese from Savoie or Valais as the most authentic and those cheeses definitely hold their shape , even at room temperature . That said , raclette is not a protected name in either Switzerland or France so it 's produced all over the place and it 's increasingly common to find flavored variants ( with black pepper , mustard seeds , etc. ) I also know people who like to melt blue cheese or reblochon ( a soft cheese from the Savoie area ) under a table-top raclette grill so why not some other soft cheese ? Finally , note that what passes as the ' traditional ' way to prepare raclette is neither a table-top grill nor melting the cheese in a pot and dipping bread in it , fondue-like , but actually exposing the whole piece of cheese to some heat source and scrapping the melted bits as you go , as shown on the <URL> .
It is simply to add tartness to add some balance against the sugar . The water from the vinegar will evaporate and leave behind acetic acid . There is an old fashioned type of hard candy known as <URL> . Your lollipop is essentially just that candy on a stick .
REDACTED . Botulism growth is inhibited at pH of 4.6 or lower . The pH of this recipe is lower than 4.6 because of the vinegars . <URL> After re-reading the recipe , I think the OP is right . This is not the safest recipe out there . For a great pickling recipe that is safe , try this : <URL>
Parsley is both a flavoring herb and a decorative element for plating the finished dish . By adding it during the cooking , it imparts flavor to the shrimp . By adding it to the finished dish , it provides color and flavor . The cooked parsley will have a slightly different taste to it than the fresh parsley . This is how cooks layer the flavors in a dish . TB stands for Tablespoon .
Take double cream ( you want a 48 % milk fat , which is hard to get in the U.S. outside of a specialty market ; heavy cream has a 30-40 % milk fat content ) and shake it . Forever . To be more specific , after sealing your double cream in , say , a jam jar , shake it until you hear the sloshing sound of butter forming ( which will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour ) ; drain the liquid off and then rinse the butter until the water runs clearly over it . Squeeze your butter ( I use cheese cloth or a linen napkin for this ) to rid it of excess liquid ( excess liquid can lead to rancidity ) , shape it into a block , and wrap it with wax paper .
Clarified butter is rather simple to make . It 's simply butter that has had the milk solids and water removed . It does last longer than regular butter , and can be stored for several weeks in the refrigerator . It also has a higher smoke point than regular butter , so you can use it when higher temperatures are called for without it smoking or burning . Slowly melt your butter and let it sit for a bit to separate Skim off the foam from the top Gently pour the butter off of the milk solids which have settled You 'll be left with about 75 % of what you started with . I 'm not sure what you mean by huge batch , but I usually make about a sticks worth at a time , as needed .

How can I make kimchi with everyday ingredients ?
To answer your specific scenario , kimchi has myriad variations using any number of vegetables , from perilla leaves to Korean radishes to napa cabbage . There are forms of kimchi that involve no chilies ( white kimchi ) , some involve a lot of water and bear little resemblance to the typical napa cabbage one ( mul kimchi ) . The main constraints for Korean-ness of kimchi will be that you 've fermented it ( for all of the types that I can think of , anyway ) , and that it does n't stray too far from familiar Korean flavor profiles ( rules that you can break if you 've got a deep enough foundation in Korean culinary traditions ) . Napa cabbage is n't particularly hard to find in Europe , however , so I 'm not sure why it would need to be substituted . For whatever reason , it was called " Chinese cabbage " in Germany ; I 'd be surprised if you could n't find it . If I wanted to make the typical cabbage kimchi , the hardest thing would have been finding the right kind of chili powder , which I was able to obtain without too much trouble when I was a 20 year old student there many years ago . Then , the typical small bits of raw oysters or other kinds of fish or dried shrimp can reasonably be substituted with locally available ingredients ( and some regions in Korea do n't always use those ingredients anyway ) .
Using a large amounts of seeds will significantly influence the humidity of your dough and bread . Dry seeds will soak up quite a bit of water - either during resting time or afterwards . This is especially bad when this soaking happens after baking , as your bread will get very dry ... Wholemeal tends to have the same effect . The best way to counteract this effect is to add more water and add more time This can be done either by pre-soaking the seeds , which will then " bring " the required extra water to the dough or letting a rather wet dough rest for a long time , preferably over night . The first approach is easier , because the seeds take up the required water " automatically " , the latter preferable taste-wise . Longer resting times allow for the development of complex flavors and need very little yeast or sourdough . As for recipes , you should be able to find plenty on the internet .
I make kimchi regularly . It sits on a shelf at room temperature for a week or more , and slowly ferments . Some people ferment it for months . Sure , it likes a <URL> , but a few hours on a bus is n't going to hurt it .
<URL> The point of leaving the cookies to sit on the pan is to dry out the skin so it 'll solidify better . I 'd suggest resting longer ( up to 50 minutes ) or using a hotter oven .
Gravity is making the petals open . If you look at the shape of the petals their center of gravity is towards the outside of the bowl , but they are being held in place by something underneath . I suspect that it 's simply one piece of chocolate melted onto another . When the custard ( warm or hot ) is poured on it melts the bonds holding the petals in place allowing them to fall .
Many of the dried noodles that are marketed as " udon " -- at least in my experience in the USA -- are actually mislabeled , thinner noodles like <URL> or even <URL> . I would suggest buying the semi-dried variety that are usually packaged in vacuum sealed plastic . This variety is shelf stable , but it can often be found in the refrigerated section of Asian mega-marts . The noodles will already be almost full size before cooking .
In the accepted answer to <URL> , it says that you can try wringing the pumpkin purée out in cheese cloth ; or in a comment , that you can let it drain in a colander .
Answer depends on how the kim chi is made . I make it using a <URL> . The protocol there is to treat the leaves with a salty brine for 4 hours , then rinse them extensively . No further salt is added in the recipe , so any salt in the final product will have osmosed into the leaves . Most of that salt wo n't come back out except with a prolonged soak * . I 've seen other kim chi recipes that do involve adding back salt after the initial brining and rinse . The sodium content of those could be reduced with a quick rinse , but you 'll likely lose flavor too . Juices in with the kim chi are likely at euilibrium with sodium in the leaves , so simply pressing the stuff lightly to remove as much juice as possible might be the best way to limit sodium without sacrificing too much flavor .
I do n't believe you would want to try to leaven bread with beer only , though you could certainly use it as a flavoring . First , the amount of yeast still present in a brewed batch of beer is very low . Beers that have been <URL> ( or bottle conditioned ) will have more than others but , particularly with high gravity beers ( beers with a lot of alcohol ) , a lot of the yeast has died due to the alcohol content or been removed by the manufacturer to clarify the brew ( yeasts make beer cloudy ) . Plus , beer yeast and bread yeast are very different things : From the info <URL> : Different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce different proportions of carbon dioxide and alcohol . Baker 's yeast is a blend of several strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chosen for their flavor and ability to make carbon dioxide , which causes bread to rise . Brewer 's yeast is made of strains chosen for their alcohol-producing ability and tends to have a bitter flavor . Brewer 's yeast is considered an inactive yeast while baker 's yeast is an active yeast . In an active yeast the yeast cells are still alive , whereas they are killed in the process of making inactive yeasts , like brewer 's yeast . Brewer 's yeast is used to brew homemade wines and beers , while baker 's yeast makes bread rise . You ca n't brew alcohol with baker 's yeast and you ca n't leaven bread with brewer 's yeast .
They 're good pretty much forever . There is not enough available water for things to grow in there . Mind you , the more aromatic and subtle parts of the flavor will dissipate over time . The sugar absorbs water , giving the combination a very low water activity , meaning there 's little water available for microorganisms to use in growth . As long as your flavoring pieces are small and well mixed with sugar they will not spoil .
In the interests of science I gave this a try . Used a can of carbonated water , boiled in my kettle . There was no boiling water explosion , although I more than half expected one . It seemed to maybe boil a little faster , but that 's more likely due to the fact that it 's less liquid than I usually heat . Being a tea fanatic I have a lot of flavored teas but I opted for PG Tips , figuring I would taste any difference a little more easily . I caught very little flavor difference from usual , maybe a little stronger but that could be chalked up to any number of things besides using carbonated water . So yeah , I think carbonated water would probably work in a pinch . Probably do n't put too much of it in the kettle , though . ( A small part of me still suspects that had it been full it would have shot boiling water everywhere ) .
I 've sometimes made small reductions in the microwave . Just put the liquid in a much deeper container than it fits in so it does n't make a mess , and run it on 50 % power , check every 30 seconds or so until it is reduced to the degree you need .
The theory is to pasteurize them sous-vide at 57ºC for 1:15 ' . You must be able to control the temperature , so specialized equipment is needed ( ronner or similar ) . The resulting egg has a different texture than ordinary ( and I believe it tastes more ' yolky ' ) . I 've kept homemade mayo for more than two weeks without problem ( off smell / taste ) . Custards are heated , so no pasteurized eggs are needed , just like hollandaise sauce .
I think you just need to dehydrate them some more to get that effect . I assume granola and muesli tend to use drier raisins because they will keep longer , and not affect the rest of the cereal with extra moisture . The amount of moisture left in raisins can be variable , it depends on how they 're made and for what purpose - the moister ones are more accessible , the drier ones keep longer - that would be why some are softer than others . To dry out your raisins , you might sun-dry them , or use a dehydrator , or even lay them out in a warm oven to chase of the extra moisture . You would have to keep checking to figure out when they reach the consistency you want . You might even try toasting them , for a higher temperature and a quicker time - though I 'm not sure if the higher heat will change the flavors , or if the changes would be any good ... I have not heard of toasted raisins as an ingredient .
You could put them in a pan of boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes ( not so to they 're cooked through ) before putting them in the oven . The potato on the outside of the wedges will soften and cook a little bit which will help the outsides crisp up a little . Make sure you allow them to drain completely before you put them in the oven .
i 've only made seitan myself a couple times , and it 's been awhile , but is n't there a point where you drain it and/or squeeze out some moisture ? if so , maybe an extended sit in some sort of press would help . the times i 've made it , i put it in a smoker afterwards , so it was firm because of the low-heat semi-cooking , i guess .
Depending on how far overcooked it is , then you might be able to resuscitate it by cutting it into smaller pieces and cooking it low and slow in some liquid . For example , you could use it as the meat in a stew , or slice it thinly and then braise it with some vegetable to make a pot-roast . This also gives you an opportunity to introduce additional flavor , as it sounds as if that may have been lacking as well .
According to <URL> , yes , you can make your own matzo meal by the obvious method of putting some crumbled matzo sheets into the food processor . She notes that you will get about 1/2 cup from two sheets . Farfel can be made simply by breaking the matzo into appropriately sized pieces . <URL> explains that it is easiest to do it by hand to get the uniform size . <URL> even says that is all farfel is : broken up matzo .
<URL> by Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page has a large section on food pairings . For carrots they mention orange , ginger , lemon , basil and mint . I think any of these could work well , if done right . My suggestion would be first to use really good , flavorful carrots -- preferably from a farmer 's market . Second , I would tone down or even leave out some of the usual carrot cake spices so that you do n't cover up the carrot flavor or the subtle flavors of your possible additions . Maybe fresh or candied ginger in the cake itself would be good . Orange or lemon curd and/or zest would work particulary well in offsetting the cream cheese icing . I 'm thinking basil and mint might be better saved for another dessert .
I would actually just make caramel . Place about 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup in a heavy bottom pan and dissolve over low-medium heat then crank up the heat and let cook , without stirring , until the mixture turns a golden amber colour and starts smoking . Then use the resulting caramel to sweeten your coffee :-)

How do you clean a pizza stone ?
Perfect . Sounds like your pizza stone is nicely seasoned . Scrub it with your stiffest brush , rinse with water , no soap , done . If you 're paranoid about germs , cook it before cooking on it . Throw it in the oven at a few hundred degrees , for 15 minutes or so . Ideally , you 're supposed to heat the stone ( thus sterilizing it ) before slapping the pizza upon it anyway ( although that requires a <URL> ) .
<URL> . For both Camembert and Brie . Next time do n't buy it ...
Chicken fat is what you want , and -- this is important -- no cream or milk . Use chicken fat to make a roux , and then chicken stock . This will get you a yellowish colour . For extra bonus points , make your pastry with schmaltz as well . They do this at the gourmet supermarket down the road , and their chicken pot pies fly off the shelves .
When the grill has cooled completely ( after dinner ) : I take some kitchen paper or some newspaper and clean off as much as possible . I use a wire brush with a scraper to brush the grill , and scrape off any bits that are stuck on . I DO NOT re-oil , and the grill stays nice and greasy for the next usage . Before the snow of winter rolls around , I take it all apart , clean the plates with a BBQ cleaning foam and water , and the cover that goes over the burners gets a good scraping , then I wash and clean the frame . This way , the grill will last years of good use .
Providing you do n't leave anything unpleasant inside the cavity a good rinse under the tap is good enough . As you surmised , the process of cooking the chicken will kill all the bacteria . Just make sure it 's cooked correctly :)
The simple answer is : You reduce a cream sauce the same way you reduce any other sauce , by simmering it until a certain amount of liquid is gone , just like the instructions said . You have to be careful about temperature though , because milk ( or cream ) can burn at high temperatures , and then your sauce is ruined . You should keep it to a low or at most medium simmer . Cream sauces normally tend to thicken extremely fast , so the long cooking time is almost certainly due to watering it down . I do n't think the water was necessary at all ; the chicken broth was probably for flavouring , and although " broth " is a somewhat nebulous term , one would normally expect a broth to contain at least some amount of gelatin , which will cause the sauce to thicken substantially when it cools if you reduce it a lot . Water does n't , so you 've added no flavour and thinned out the sauce . Basically , you ( or your wife ) added water for no other purpose than to try to evaporate it later . Water generally does n't go in a cream sauce . If you do n't have chicken broth or ca n't use it , I would either substitute more wine or just leave it out completely . Usually the only time you substitute water for broth is if it 's actually the base of your sauce .
If the banana flower was astringent it is because of the flower , not the cooking method . When the flowers are large and young they taste a lot better . If you wait until the bananas are formed and the stem to the flower is long then it will be astringent . The best time to pick the flower is when the stem is 10cm or less from the banana bunch . If the flower is old it will not be as good . The variety of banana will also influence the taste of the flower . Sugar bananas often have the best flowers . You can eat the pink section but it is not as pleasant as the white section . If you eat the small individual flowers you need to take out the stepal in the centre which is incredibly time consuming . Putting the banana flower in lime water is simply to stop it going brown before you cook it . It does not significantly change the flavour . There are many ways to cook banana flower . Here is my preferred method . Peel the flower until you come to the white centre . Discard the red outer section and the individual flowers hidden within this . I like to quarter the centre and then I place in boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes with some salt . For me it is delicious just like this with some lime , but from here you can put it in a cooked curry , salad etc
Honestly , do n't grill . Do n't run away ! Hamburgers were originally cooked in pans , not on grills . One of the reasons for this is thta with grilling you lose any fat and moisture that comes out of the burger . So I use Heston Blumenthal 's method now . While I tend to ignore the preparation elements ( I have neither the time nor the money to hand-grind my burgers with a specific ratio of this cut to that cut to the other cut ) , the cooking method is flawless : Make your burgers . Over very low heat , place a pan with just a little oil ( or bacon/duck fat , which is lovely ) . introduce burgers to pan . As soon as they release easily from the surface , flip . Thirty seconds later , flip . Repeat until cooked through . ( fifteen to twentyish minutes ) . This will give you the juiciest , most tender burgers you have ever had in your life . I promise . Essentially what you 're doing is basting the burgers in their own fat . Alternatively , if you have an immersion circulator , cook your burgers sous vide and then just mark on the grill when done . I 've had burgers done this way and they are excellent . Burgers will flare on the grill -- that 's all the fat ( and therefore flavour ) being squeezed out by the action of cooking and burning away .
Quinoa naturally contains a bitter compound on the outside of the seed . Usually you have to rinse the quinoa to remove the bitterness but most commercial quinoa seems to have already been rinsed . So , I no longer rinse my quinoa . If you have time , it 's nice to heat a pan and add the quinoa and toast it a little ( for a nutty flavor and fluffier texture ) , then add water and salt . I typically bring the water to a boil ( 2 cups water to 1 cup quinoa plus 1/4 tsp salt ) , cover and reduce the heat to a simmer for 10-20 minutes ( or until the little tails release ) . Lately I 've found that using a rice cooker is a no-fuss way to prepare quinoa . I usually just do quinoa , water and sea salt but you can add spices while cooking it if you want to enhance the flavor . I would add vegetables afterwards . Quinoa is so quick-cooking I would n't see the need for a pressure cooker .
Scrub the heck out of it with Kosher salt and the tiniest amount of water , then start all over again seasoning it . A fair amount of work , but well worth it to save a good skillet .
There are two safe ways to defrost , one more rapid than the other . First method is to defrost in the refrigerator . This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F , in the safe zone . This will , also , take a while . Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water . The water does n't have to run rapidly , but it should change regularly . This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air ( water is a better conductor of heat than air ) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time . If you are not going to cook it immediately , then return to the refrigerator . If you are deep frying , there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried , but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong .
If it 's a small spot you can rub half a lemon on it till it 's gone . If the entire inside has darkened you can fill it with water , add several tablespoons of cream of tartar ( 2 per quart ) and boil it for 10 minutes . You can also buy aluminum cleaner , but the do it yourself is typically cheaper . In case you 're wondering why I 'm suggesting an acid for cleaning . It 's actually alkali foods that stained your pot , not acidic . e.g. boiling potatoes . Acid actually cleans the spots put there by alkali foods . The common warning against cooking acidic foods in an aluminum pot is to prevent excessive amounts of aluminum being leeched into your food .
While using a hot oven and keeping the tin hot while filling are both critical elements , equal concern needs to be taken with making sure that your batter is at room temperature . If the eggs and milk are n't room temp to even slightly warm , then it will take a significant amount of heat to simply warm the batter in the pan before significant steam can build for their expansion . You can warm eggs quickly by placing the whole egg ( in shell ) in a bowl and covering with hot water from the tap . Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and you 'll have room temperature/warm egg . Milk can simply be microwaved to warm only slightly or you 'll cook the eggs . You might also try using bread flour . Here in the south all-purpose flour has a lower gluten content than most other all-purpose flour in the US and it 's also bleached to weaken the gluten content that 's there . I 've recommended to guests of mine that have had issues with popovers not rising that they try bread flour and I 've heard positive responses following the use of bread flour . Bread flour will also have a bit more flavor and produce more browning from the additional protein .
This is absolutely fine , especially if the eggs are pasteurised . I 've seen plenty of recipes that have raw egg in them that say it ; s fine to freeze them . You can even freeze eggs ( that have been mixed up a little ) for up to three months . So yes , I 'd say freeze it as soon as possible . Also , if you were concerned about freezing the quinoa that will fine as well ( a lot of people do n't know you can store grains in the freezer ) . Enjoy !
It 's meant to be munched on between sips , and permits a " reset " - the cocktail will be fresh upon the tongue the sip after the bite , permitting you to enjoy its flavor and consistency without being oppressed by the cumulative effect of unctuous , spice and salt that is the hallmark of the beverage . Celery is an astringent and an aromatic - it will cut through the palate-coating tomato juice can leave behind , cool the intensity of the salt and heat , and will interrupt the soup-like consistency with a firm crunch . It 's often included in tuna and chicken salad and served with hot wings for the same reason . Other vegetables that tickle our sense of " bitter " in a pleasing way may be similarly substituted - but celery also acts as a handy swizzle stick .
So <URL> and <URL> suggest that there are 3 kinds of rinds . Summary below : Bloomy : Appears white , soft , maybe fuzzy . Can also be reddish/brownish . Comes on softer cheeses that have a more custard-like flavor . Formed by a spray of penicillium candidum before aging . Edible , but the flavor changes and may taste ammoniated over time ( consume so long as it 's palatable ) Washed : Color ranges from pinkish red to orange or brown . Caused by bathing the cheese in some kind of solution , be it a salty brine , beer , brandy , wine or some other alcohol . Contributes to the flavor in some cheeses , and tastes unpleasant in others . Natural : Formed by letting the cheese age on its own , drying out and growing whatever molds might be present in the cheese or air . Tends to have a concentrated flavor of the cheese , but may not be palatable . Examples : Stilton , Montgomery Cheddar , Parmigiano-Reggiano . Sometimes comes under a cloth cover . Should be edible , minus the cloth . Additionally , there are two other possibilities No Rind : There should be no guessing here . You 've probably had cheeses with no rind ... because they might come in a container . Ricotta , fresh mozzarella , and creme fraiche come to mind . Wax/Twig/Cloth : Inedible . Should be discarded My personal takeaway from this quick research is that I should learn to distinguish artificial covers ( cloth/wax ) from rinds . It seems like those that separate from the cheese will either be an artificial cover or an old rind , both of which are undesirable . If it 's indeed a rind , then I 'd taste it , both alone and with the cheese , to determine if it 's palatable . For Parmigiano-Reggiano specifically , I 've read that it goes well in soup . Perhaps this is because it 's unpalatable-y hard , but still contains the concentrated flavor . TLDR : look for cloth/wax . If none , is it tasty ? Does it feel good in the mouth ?
If you insist on using a damp cloth , you have to make it wet again and again , so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times . Much easier is plastic wrap , which does n't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl . Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously wo n't work . My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid . It does n't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of " stretch and fold " or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough .
There are a few factors that could effect this : 1 ) How the meat is cooked and how lean or fatty it is . If you overcook the meat ( although I doubt that you would ! ) or if it 's leaner or fattier . If its a fattier meat add say an extra 2 tbsps or so of sauce and if it 's leaner ( or overcooked ) I would add a tbsp or so less of sauce . 2 ) The viscosity and composition of the sauce . If it 's a white wine sauce ( thinner , less rich ) you would want to add more , however if it 's a hollondaise sauce ( thicker , richer ) you may want less . 3 ) Opinion , some people like more sauce , some people like less . It may depend on the type of sauce which you may want more or less of . Saying this I would say around 4 tbsp of sauce , then account for the additions and your own personal preference . Any more sauce and it may become swamped , any less and you will not have enough sauce to taste or keep the meat moist . It is a very subjective subject so do keep that in mind .
In a hot pan , the oil droplets jump off for three reasons usually : When you add oil to a hot pan that is not completely dry yet ( i.e some water present in the pan ) . This residue water will boil , turn into steam and splatter oil . When you are adding wet food to the hot oil . The water turns into steam and splatters oil . Solution : Making sure the food is fairly dry before putting in oil . E.g. drying vegetables with a paper towel . When you are turning food . Solution : as @Wayfaring Stranger said , flip to food towards the opposite end , not towards you . Another thing might be that you are using a very shallow walled-pan , but mostly , splattering oil is due to water being present .
Fill a basin or hotel pan with water . Place in your smoker . Ensure the smoker heat is set below 100C/212F ( adjust as necessary for distance above/below sea level ) . Um ... smoke . An hour should do fine . More if you want more . Optionally strain through a superbag or muslin to remove any deposited particulate matter .

What does " spooned and leveled " mean ?
The easiest way to measure a cup of flour is of course to take the measuring cup , plunge it into your bag of flour and just lift up a spoonful . The problem with that is that the plunging and lifting will compress the flour inside the cup and actually get you more flour than you wanted . If you spoon the flour into the measuring cup you minimize the compression and will get a more accurate measurement .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
This is totally fine . Meat gets poked and prodded all the time , whether to test it , to pick it up with tongs , or sticking a fork in it to cut . Meat just is not that fragile . Things like smashing with a tenderizer are much more violent and do affect the texture ( that 's kind of the point ) , so that 's not a great comparison . But this is a really minor thing .
Stretch and fold should be done in both directions . One stretch and fold , in most techniques that I read , is stretching like you stay , folding , then rotating 90 degrees and repeating . You can see an excellent example of stretch and fold in <URL> and <URL> . Where they do it and then turn it - that 's one stretch and fold .
3 Rams is the brand . Pretty popular Chinese Cleaver manufacture . The number 2 is the weight of the knife . I think the numbers range from a # 1 ( heaviest ; bone chopping ) down to a # 5 ( lightest ; vegetable knife ) . If you 're looking for a vegetable knife yours is probably on the heavy side . It 's more suited to chopping up poultry/fish . A couple articles/forums , which seem to confirm my guess that lower is heavier : <URL> <URL> Edit and Disclaimer : The numbering system is also manufacture dependent ; some go from a 1-3 , some from a 1-5 . I am sure there are others as well . Best place to verify , would be if you could scope out a chinese market/store that sells the knives to compare what you have .
The oven shelf is not the back of the oven . Basically what you would do is lift one side a little ( maybe an inch or so ) and let it drop . Then you can do the other side . This will give you a more fudgy and less cake-like crumb , as the cake-like finish comes from trapped air bubbles . If you rap the pan to help the air escape then you have less trapped air and thus a denser , more fudge-like crumb .
If I recall correctly the differences are slight , but significant . Both have a subtle , delicate flavour with an exceptionally light texture . The Victorian is usually regarded as the healthier , lighter of the two , but I believe this is mostly due to the Génoise usually being rendered as a layer cake with a lavish buttercream filling , though if I remember right it can also be used as a base for madeleines and ladyfingers . The Victorian can be baked thin and carefully rolled with cream for Swiss rolls . The main difference is the Victorian slices disorderly and ' crumby ' while the Génoise retains its form neatly . Both are accompanied well by , and are traditionally served with hot beverages namely tea and coffee . The Italian creation is undecidedly the more complex one to prepare . You 're right about separating the egg whites and beating them separately aerating the mixture further , but I 'm not certain if it would make a noticeable difference in case of sponge cakes but I 'd love it if someone could comment on this .
It is just the root of the coriander plant . Certainly at least here ( UK ) you can buy living coriander plants in the supermarket ; you could pull one out of the pot and use the root from that . Apparently you can also subsitute 2 stems of coriander for every piece of root called for in the recipe , but I 've never tried this .
I would imagine , if the book is of reasonable quality , by prepared , they mean one that you have prepared earlier . If there 's a recipe for pizza base in the book , that 's probably what they 'd like you to use . Personally , if you 're going to the trouble of making home-made pizza , make your own base . Invariably , the pre-made bases you can buy from stores taste like chalk . There 's a few topics here that may be useful : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Drain them first . Your concerns are spot-on , and if you measured and then drained them , you would end up with less than 1 cup of yams . Generally , you can tell be cause the recipe called for 1 cup of drained yams , not 1 cup of yams in their sauce . Drain them , but double check that you wo n't need the liquid for anything later on in the recipe ... That 's a mistake I 've made too many times with canned foods .
They are not equivalent cuts and ' should not ' be used interchangeably . Stir Fry meat is cut from the more tender cuts of beef ( tri-tip , sirloin , rib-eye ) and do n't require much time cooking to be ' ready to eat ' . Stew Beef is from less tender cuts ( the Chuck or Eye of Round ) which will become tender after a ' significant ' time braising ( cooking in liquid ) . That said ... the food police wo n't show up at your door if decide to interchange these , and using stir fry beef for stew is n't a terrible thing to do ... but you will likely not be happy if you try to switch the other way .
Sorting means a few things : Remove foreign objects like small stones , other seeds , twigs ... that may have accidentally been packed with the beans . Remove damaged ( think insect damage , for example ) or otherwise shrivelled , infected or moldy beans and loose skins . Hint : Hollow beans and skins float up . Double-check for bug infections . Sometimes there are little hitchhikers , even if you have impeccable hygiene at home . It boils down to making sure you have nothing in the pot that does n't belong in your meal .
I do n't have any info on the affect of pH , but cornstarch can make your compote separate when canned : <URL> . Two alternative thickeners are tapioca and clearjel . I 've used clearjel for canning with excellent results . I have n't used tapioca to can , but do prefer it in my pies . ( posted as an answer per Sobachatina 's recommendation )
I have never added butter to sponge sheets when making swiss rolls , jelly rolls , or anything similar in the past . It 's just straight up bread flour , sugar , and eggs . I can only think of three possible reasons why butter might be added : To improve the flavour ; To keep the sheets moist and help prevent overbaking , as any fat would be used in cake batter ; however , this is generally not a major concern in cake rolls ; or To help prevent it from sticking to the sheet ( do n't bother ; if you have this problem , use a silicone mat ) . Reasons # 2 and # 3 are n't very convincing to me , so I would only bother adding butter if you prefer the taste of swiss rolls with butter added . I do n't think butter would help with rolling at all , in fact it might make rolling more difficult on account of making the sheets more crumbly and less able to hold together under pressure .
The main purpose of beating an egg is to " denature " the protein within the egg . Proteins are long chains of amino acids and they have lots of internal chemical bonds , which hold them together into tightly contained units . When a protein is denatured , those internal bonds break and the amino acid chains unravel and become elongated . At the same time , atoms that were previously bonded ( as part of the internal bonds I mentioned ) become available to bond with other molecules . When an egg is heated to 40 degrees celsius , its protein chains become denatured and elongate , which allows chemical reactions to occur . The egg changes from a liquid solution of protein into a solid mass . A similar thing happens with you beat an egg . The physical act of beating causes the protein strands to stretch , thereby causing the protein to denature ( the internal bonds are broken as a result of the application of physical force ) . So , rather than the protein chains being bound up into tight balls , they become long strands . This is similar to gluten when it is developed . These strands form structures that allow the trapping of air , which results in a lighter texture . Beating eggs is not just about mixing . It 's about changing the structure of the eggs to produce a physical effect . To read more about this , see " The Science of Cooking " by Peter Barham .
" Folding " is a more gentle mixing technique than " stirring " and " mixing " . Stirring and mixing both denote a more vigorous action . Folding is usually used for items where something has previously been whipped ( such as egg whites or cream ) or where tenderness is desired and thus less mixing is advisable ( muffins &amp; biscuits ) . Folding is usually done with a rubber spatula ( for liquid &amp; dry ingredients ) or with a wire whisk ( often beneficial for whipped cream and egg whites so that the mixture gently incorporates as it falls through the wires ) . To " fold " ingredients together : Hold the spatula or whisk in your dominant hand and grasp the far edge of the bowl ( side that is away from you ) with your non-dominant hand . Turn the bowl towards you with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously scraping around the edge ( also toward you ) and finish by folding the mixture over on top of itself . Return both hands to the far side of the bowl and follow-up by cutting through the center of the mixture with your utensil and once again folding the mix over on top of itself ( again , turning the bowl simultaneously ) . Alternate scraping around the side and through the middle of the bowl until the mixture is just combined together . Note that if an airy mixture such as egg whites or whipped cream start to go from soft and billowy to more liquid-like , you are overworking it and need to stop to maintain volume . In the case of whipped cream and egg whites you typically add a small portion to the heavier mixture and actually DO stir this in . While yes you 're losing some of the volume of that portion , it serves to help lighten the heavier batter/mixture . The rest of the whites/cream are then folded in to the mix in several additions . Sometimes dry ingredients may be sift on top of whipped eggwhites before being folded . The larger the spatula or whisk , the fewer strokes that will need to be made and the better the results will be .
Swai and catfish are biologically related , but Tilapia is a Cyclid and as such quite far removed . I think the biological relation is not all that critical to their similar taste which you dislike though . The taste of fish relies on a few factors such as : Their living environment ( Fresh , brackish , salt water ) The type of soil on the water bottom ( silt , sand ) The diet of the species ( other fish , water based plankton or bottom dwellers ) Catfish is a bottom feeding freshwater species and likely to have a relatively similar taste to other species that share their living environment and diet . As such I 'm willing to bet you also do n't like the taste of Carp very much . Perhaps the solution lies in finding a fish that has a similar texture to Catfish but is a sea dwelling fish eater . That way you might get the appreciation from your eaters while being able to enjoy your own dishes more .
Generally speaking , butter spreads have a water component to them . That 's what the emulsifier is for , as it keeps the fat and water from separating . The problem is that you ca n't fry/cook with it . If you place it in a pan it will separate , and sizzle in a very unpleasant manner . If I remember correctly , it actaully smells quite awful in the process . As for baking , I think it 'll be fine anywhere there needs to be fat as fat . Wherever you need fat as something to hold the structure , you had probably best not use it . Caveat emptor , as I do n't bake very much at all . Let it be aid , however , that margarine as opposed to butter spread , can be used anywhere that butter is used . It is n't as tasty , and has trans-fats . On the other hand , it has less cholesterol .
It means to combine the things listed up to and including the cloves , as in " combine ingredients 4 through 11 " . In that recipe it 's just a helpful hint to tell you where the dry ingredients stop . The recipe is already calling for ground cloves - it mixes them into dry ingredients as-is . When using whole cloves , if you do n't immediately just grind them , you generally cook them in something liquid then strain them out later . ( Similar to cinnamon sticks or whole allspice . ) The cinnamon and nutmeg in the recipe are also ground , not whole . If a recipe wants whole cloves , it will explicitly say , and often count them : 10 [ whole ] cloves .
" Shortness " in dough refers to its tenderness which is influenced by the amount of fat as well as sugar . If your quiche recipe is calling for a short dough , it would be referring to a higher ratio of fat since pastry for quiche typically does n't include sugar . Both fat and sugar minimize and break down gluten development which results in " short " protein strands and thus a more tender result . As the fat is rubbed into the flour glutenin ( providing strength ) and gliadin ( providing elasticity ) are coated with the fat which acts as a lubricant to keep the two from being able to link together forming gluten when liquid is added to the mix . The higher the amount of fat in a dough the more tender it will be . If you want a dough to be flaky then you 'd leave the fat in larger particles which will blister to form flakes . If you want a dough that will be moisture resistant to fillings ( such as a quiche ) then work that fat in finely so that it will be less likely to absorb moisture during and after baking . Quiche crusts ( and crusts for other custard based pies ... pumpkin , sweet potato , custard , etc ) should first be blind-baked for the crispest crust in the finished result . As for " fixing " a pastry dough ... it 's usually easiest and best to simply start over . Water is added a little at a time to avoid adding too much . If too much water is used then more flour needs to be added but with the excessive flour and water then comes additional gluten . If you get a pastry dough too wet , I would be inclined to rub some additional fat into flour and then add that to the first dough rather than just flour alone . Too little shortening will really only be noticed after baking and that 's going to be determined through how tough or tender the dough is . Keep in mind that toughness also depends on the amount you 've handled it . Short doughs typically ca n't be handled too much because the higher amount of fat means that they will warm and get sticky . It is best to refrigerate to firm up the fat rather than add flour as the flour simply dries it out . The tender nature of the dough from sugar means that in some cases they can be impossible to roll out and transfer to a pan . In this case they are usually put into the bottom of the pan and then patted out across the bottom and up the side .

Which other spices besides cloves will react with plastic ?
I 've had a good look and as far as I can see only cloves and allspice have this property . Most websites specify that it 's due to an oil present in cloves however according to Wikipedia the main chemical components in clove oil ( admittedly not cloves but fairly similar ) are : Bud oil is derived form the flower-buds of S. aromaticum . It consists of 60 -- 90 % eugenol , eugenyl acetate , caryophyllene and other minor constituents . Leaf oil is derived from the leaves of S. aromaticum . It consists of 82 -- 88 % eugenol with little or no eugenyl acetate , and minor constituents . Stem oil is derived from the twigs of S. aromaticum . It consists of 90 -- 95 % eugenol , with other minor constituents . As neither eugenol , eugenyl acetate nor caryophyllene have this property the oil that does cause ' plastic clouding ' must be fairly low . Likewise the main chemical components of allspice oil according to Essential-oils . co.za are : eugenol , menthyl eugenol , cineol , phellandrene and caryophyllene . None of these chemicals have chemicals with that property . However many of the chemicals in allspice and clove are also present in nutmeg , black pepper and cinnamon .
The short answer is 1-2 years for traditional pickles , assuming a good recipe with adequate salt content and fermentation time ( traditionally anywhere from a month to a few months ) . For modern quick fermented homemade recipes , where the pickles are fermented in a week or so instead of months , I 'd recommend using them up within a month or two . Some representative sources ( note the bolded bits about fermentation time ) : " Fermented or processed pickles also have a very long shelf-life , about two years . " ( <URL> ) " FERMENTED PICKLES : The oldest method of pickling , when a naturally occurring bacteria transforms the sugars present in the ingredient into an acid , preserving the food . These are called ' processed ' pickles , and though they take as many as five weeks to cure , they last up to 2 years . " ( <URL> ) " The product is completely fermented in 3-6 weeks ... In contrast to salt stock brining procedures [ i.e. , pickles removed from their liquid after fermentation and stored in a very heavily salted tank for future processing ] , genuine dill pickles do not require desalting and are often sold with the filtered fermentation liquor that is produced during the process . The product must be consumed within 12 months . " ( <URL> ) While these are common estimates , many books on the subject wo n't even give such shelf-life estimates ( e.g. , Sandor Katz 's The Art of Fermentation ) , because there is so much variability depending on recipe and storage conditions during and after fermentation . The other issue is that fermented brined pickles are " alive " in the sense that they continue to have microbial activity even after refrigerated . Unless you " process " the pickles after fermentation by heating to a high temperature and canning , you should expect that pickles will change their taste and texture continuously . You might like pickles that are " just finished , " but dislike their flavor or texture after a month or two in the fridge ( or the reverse ) . Traditional pickle-makers often take advantage of these changes , for example by selling " half sours " which taste like something between a fresh cucumber and a pickle and have only been partially fermented . " Half sours " and other pickles that have not completed fermentation before refrigeration have a much shorter shelf-life ( usually a few weeks ) , because the lack of full acidity in the liquid and remaining sugars and other nutrients in the cucumbers may still allow other things to grow and for spoilage to occur . Even after a longer fermentation , expect pickles to gradually get more sour and to soften in texture as the months go by . However , with adequate salt content and full fermentation , and as long as you are not contaminating the storage container , there 's no reason to expect they will actually " go bad " at refrigerator temperatures for at least a few months and potentially much longer . Traditionally , long-storage pickled cucumbers were fermented in ( and subsequently stored in ) a cool place , like a root cellar or other underground compartment , which probably stayed around 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit most of the year . At these cooler temperatures , pickles usually needed to ferment for at least a month and sometimes a few months before achieving full flavor . Since the root cellar temperatures were often above refrigerator temperatures , they would then continue to get even more sour and gradually begin to break down as the months went by . However , the purpose of storage was to have cucumbers available throughout the year , so last year 's batch would be used up and then be replaced by the new harvest . Today , most people tend to ferment homemade pickles faster ( often at room temperature ) and often with less salt than the season-long ferments of the past would use . This produces pickles more quickly , sometimes in as little as a week or so , with pickles that are not as extreme in their sourness and saltiness as the long-storage pickling of the past . The flavor profile can also be somewhat different , due to greater activity of some microorganisms at room temperature . Depending on the recipe , they are often not as stable and should probably be consumed within a few weeks or months . ( For example , Alton Brown 's relatively fast pickle <URL> recommends storing the pickles no longer than two months in the refrigerator . )
While all of these are large pots ( or may at least come in large sizes ) they have different purposes , which lead to differences in typical construction . Saucepans are intended for general purpose cookery , and usually have solid construction , and permit searing in the pot , reducing , and a variety of other tasks . They are the most difficult to characterize as there is tremendous variation in quality levels and design among the products available . Stock pots are purpose built to make large quantities of stock . Since they are not used for searing typically , and liquids circulate via convection making hot spots not a priority , they are typically constructed from thinner metals ( steal or aluminum ) and do n't have good general purpose cooking qualities . The main virtues in a stock part are low cost , size , and light weight . Dutch ovens ( at least real Dutch ovens ) are a legacy from the time when cooking was done in hearth or campfire . They are designed to be nestled into the coals or embers , with more coals or embers placed on top of the lid , creating a hot oven like interior -- thus the name . True quality Dutch ovens will be fairly thick , usually cast iron , possibly enameled , and may have little legs to help nestle it into the fire above the coals ; similarly , a the lid may actually fit into the pot , allowing coals to easily be piled on top . Dutch overs are actually fairly versatile cooking implements , and can serve for searing , roasting , braising , stewing , biscuit making , soup making , and even some bread applications even in the modern kitchen . Many are large enough to make stock in for home purposes , although they are not absolutely ideal for the task . You will have to ask yourself , given your own cooking patterns , would the general versatility of a dutch oven , or the size of a stock pot serve you better . None of the sets you linked to has a true dutch oven , however ; the one that purports to be a dutch oven has a glass lid ! It might be an okay pot , it is not one I would ever choose . For stainless steel products ( without the specialized legs and concave lid to nest coals in ) , there is very little difference between a dutch oven and a very large sauce pan .
Many of the chemicals in food responsible for how a it tastes are also the same ones which , as they escape into the air , give it it 's smell . These oils and aromatic compounds which give many spices their flavour break down or escape over time changeing the taste as they degrade . Some spices stay fresh for a long time once ground , others are well worth ( as you are finding ) doing your self . Many of these compounds react with the oxygen in air to become new ones , these would then potentialy taste stale . Other compounds may break down if light gets to them ; especially natural light as ultraviolet breaks many chemicals down . Other chemicals just evaporate away . All of these reactions depend on surface area ... so the smaller the bits of spice the faster they lose the flavor/smell chemicals . Very fresh powdered spices would n't have this issue . Also if you ground the spices yourself and then left them for a few week/months you would find much of the taste has gone from the powder .
Yes , it 's oxidation , so yes , oil will stop it happening . However , broiling the potatoes straight from the oil will not yield very good results . You are much better off par-boiling them for 3 or 4 minutes , draining them , leaving them to steam and dry out for a few minutes , then coating them in oil and seasoning , and baking them for 30-45 mins . This will yield a nice , crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside result . So , if you 're boiling them you might as well put them straight in the water you 're going to use to do that .
It depends on the moisture content . If the vegetables are wet when put in they will get mildew and go soft faster because the water has no place to evaporate . This is made worse when leafy greens are put in bags since they have so many nooks and crannies to hold water , and they seep out their own moisture content because of the large surface area . Try drying off the veggies first or putting them through a salad spinner to get as much water out of them as possible .
I posted this question in a hurry ( because as you can imagine ) , there was a lot of anxiety concerning whether it was safe to have dinner or not . It turns out that this ham is not safe ; I will quote the USDA : The plastic bone guard covering the exposed bone is used to keep the bone from breaking the outer wrap . If left on the meat during cooking , a 325 or 350 ° F oven temperature may not melt the plastic but still give off an abnormal chemical odor or taste . Cutting away the meat around the exposed area will not necessarily solve this potential food safety problem because the penetration of the chemical into the meat will be unknown . If meat is cooked in a closed container , the chemicals may penetrate the entire piece of meat . USDA advises not to eat the ham ; discard it . Source : <URL> Quite a disappointment unfortunately .
In general lard can always be substituted for butter , but you will not get the same flavour , obviously . Lard is perhaps a bit more ' savoury ' than butter , so it may be worth trying a pie out just to see if it works with a sweet filling . You should be able to convert straight from butter to lard . Another alternative is vegetable shortening , which you can use in all kinds of baking .
For hard , chemical-resistant surfaces such as marble , bleach or peroxide cleaners will help . On things like counters , pots and pans , a Magic Eraser will often take off the stain . Sometimes a harsher abrasive like Comet or Barkeep 's Friend will be needed . Softer or porous materials , including cloth and many plastics often CAN NOT BE UNSTAINED . In my kitchen we treat turmeric like a dangerous chemical -- isolate , contain , and plan ahead to limit exposure . It 's just that destructive . You might as well tie-dye or bleach white any clothing you get turmeric on ; it India it is used as a dye for saris because it will semi-permanently tint cloth . You can brush off the dry powder harmessly , but when it is moistened and allowed to sit for a moment , the color is pretty much permanent . Edit : UV + peroxide : I saw a patent for removing turmeric stains from upholstery using UV light and hydrogen peroxide . You might try soaking fabrics in peroxide or Oxyclean ( which uses peroxide ) and leaving then out in the sun . Ca n't hurt right ? Edit : strategies to manage turmeric without making a mess Plan ahead where you 'll use it , and which utensils and vessels will hold it , so you do n't mess up anything you do n't need to . Re-use already turmeric-stained items so you do n't wreck anything new Mortars and pestles , tupperware , wooden and soft plastic utensils are a lost cause . At least the stain is purely cosmetic ? ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wear an apron . Keep spilt powder dry ( it wo n't stain ) and brush it off with a paper towel into the garbage . Brushing away promptly keeps you from inadvertently spilling liquid on it , or wiping it with a wet towel during cleanup . That is , unless you want a neon-green counter and towel ? Whenever you spill something containing turmeric , promptly wipe it off , to reduce staining . Hard ceramic and porcelain are immune to staining unless the surface is rough . Try to use these for storage . Glass will stain . Stainless steel is resistant but not immune . With these strategies , I find I can use turmeric regularly without problems .
What would a network-attached scale even do ? You 'd have to configure it to report to something , or have something else poll for it ( and then you 'd still have to configure it , either via DHCP , BOOTP or similar to set its IP address ) . It 'd be a security nightmare , as it 'd be like a network attached medical device ( or old printer ) that never gets updates to deal with security vulnerabilities . Some sort of a serial connection like RS-232 or USB is just plain safer in this situation . ... and there are plenty of USB digital scales , as they 're used by companies to weight packages &amp; print out postage . The only reason to not go with USB might be distance limitations ( 5m for USB 2 ) , but you can get USB over Cat5 ' extenders ' . ( which would then meet your ' cat5 ' cable requirement ... but you can also get DB9 ( or DB25 ) to RJ45 adaptors , if you just want to run 232 over cat5 ) ( I 'm a programmer/sysadmin at a US government agency so it 's possible that my security concerns are a little higher than most other people 's . Even if you keep it on an isolated network to only talk to the terminal , odds are that the terminal is going to need to be updated at some point , and you risk it getting infected . Even if they exist , it 's just not worth the trouble . And yes , I do know about the <URL> )
In short , using port as a substitute for red wine will not wreck the dish . Though the flavour is different ( and richer ) and will make your bolognese taste different as a result , the taste should not be bad . I frequently do this as I am not a red wine drinker , and port keeps far better in an open bottle . I would recommend using slightly less than when using red wine , but this is highly subjective .
If you defrost in water , by all means keep the plastic on . If it were n't wrapped , you 'd put it in a baggie anyway and not dump it directly into the water . The instructions to unwrap are for defrosting in the fridge and to allow the water to run off . Fish is often covered in a thin protective layer of ice , which you want to be able to drain instead of staying on for a long time . For the relatively short time in a defrosting water bath , you will be fine . Just pat the fish dry before frying or you get a lot of spattering . From a food-safety perspective you should be using cold water , btw , it works just as well and you can be sure your fish stays out of the danger zone .
Both refined sunflower oil and refined soybean oil are generally considered flavorless . Also included among these are : Canola ( rapeseed ) oil Corn oil Peanut oil Safflower oil Vegetable oil The most reliable method of course is to taste the oil :) . I 'm sure you can actually taste the flavor of extra virgin olive oil .
The most common preparation is tomato sauce and parmesan cheese . Of course , some Americans will tell you that the only truly American way to eat spaghetti is to top it with chili , then shredded cheddar cheese , then chopped onions , then red kidney beans . It 's hard to fully express the majesty of this dish , and should only be enjoyed on special occasions , like the Super Bowl . In Canada ( which I consider to be basically " American " ) , it 's also fairly common to add or replace the tomato sauce with pesto sauce . Soft goat cheese is another common additive . Perhaps these sound " Italian " but I 'd consider an Italian pasta to be something more like a bolognese , carbonara , alfredo , or even the trusty old butter/olive oil and parmesan cheese . You 'll almost never see tomato sauce combined with pesto sauce in an authentic Italian restaurant ( or in Italy ) , but it 's common in American home cooking .
Do n't reuse an old milk jug for storing the new , combined milk . The standard plastics used in milk jugs in most areas can not be properly sanitized for reuse ( even with standard sanitizing solutions ) . Instead , use a properly sanitized and covered glass or plastic container , preferably one that you clean in a hot water dish washer . Milk stored in a properly cleaned container will have the maximum shelf life ( and reduced chance of other contaminants ) .
There are a few seeds which are good to eat . These generally get sold in the supermarket ( pumpkin seeds , apricot kernels ) . If you buy the fruit containing them , you can keep the seeds . If you want to store them , you should dry them first . Spread the cleaned seeds in a single layer on paper and put it in a warm dry place ( not in direct sunlight ) , and wait a few days . You should deshell them right before consuming , that way they keep longer . If you want to eat them right away , do n't dry them . They taste better when fresh . Some should be roasted in the shell before eaten ( pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds ) . There is little sense in eating seeds not commonly sold in supermarkets , like melon seeds or apple pips . They do n't have any nutritional value for humans , or taste bad ( e.g. very bitter ) , or both . It is even dangerous to experiment too much . For example , peach kernels contain poisonous cyanide compounds . So stick to what is commonly eaten , there is a reason the other seeds are n't used .
First , I 'm assuming by " pesto " you mean " Pesto alla Genovese " , given your question about pine nuts . Basil , pine nuts , garlic , olive oil , and cheese is a delicious combination , but it 's only one of many " pestos " ( peste , actually ) , since pesto refers in general to any sauce which is made from crushed or pureed ingredients . Mix and match to your heart 's content . Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese ; pine nuts have always been scarce , even in early-20th-century Italy . As a caution , though , you need to get good , fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts , or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid . Almonds could also work , although I 'd think they 'd be rather bland . The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper . Again , freshness and getting the skin off is important . I 'd think sunflower seeds would be kind of odd and oily , but you do n't know until you try . If you do , post a comment to let us know !
The ideal temperature for whipping cream is between 35 degrees F and 50 degrees F ( 1 2/3 degrees C to 10 degrees C ) . In order to maintain this temperature , you may want to chill your bowl and beaters in your fridge until cold , but you should be able to whip cream just fine as long as you do not let it rest once you remove it from the fridge . Above 50 degrees F ( 10 degrees C ) you wo n't be able to whip your cream .
I have used a rice cooker lid as a replacement on an old crock pot . It has a small venting hole as you described . I have been using this lid for years now and have yet to have a dish dry out . The hole is just too small to let much water out .
Having taken a look around some recipe sites and taken the intersection of what most of them consider the " core " spices ( and leaving out the ones that showed up on too many ' variations ' lists ) , it looks like the canonical ones are : basil marjoram oregano rosemary thyme

Does chlorine evaporate from water when cooking ?
Water treatment often uses chlorine or chloramine to kill germs or algae . If you are smelling it it 's more likely to be Chloramine than Chlorine . Chlorine will dissipate from water over time naturally , but boiling for 20 minute will drive it out . Chloramine will also dissipate naturally , but in a much longer time frame , and would take over a day to boil out . So boiling water will get rid of chlorine but not chloramine ( at least not in a useful time frame ) , and boiling will concentrate other minerals in the water which is usually undesirable . It will also de-oxygenate the water , making it flat . Flat water is n't great for cooking - compare the flavor of a cup of tea or coffee brewed with flat water as opposed to fresh and you 'll see what I mean . Your best option for water treatment chemical removal at home is an activated charcoal filter unless you want to invest in a UV treatment system , which would seem to be a bit OTT . You could also use a reducing agent from a brewery supply company , but if all you want is some fresh tasting and smelling water then the filter is your best option . <URL> has a thread on this which is worth reading .
You could try <URL> : Stick it in the freezer , and skim off the ice . Keep the ice , discard the liquid and melt the ice . If you had a freezer that you could precisely control the temperature , I believe there are certain preferred target temperatures , but simply checking on it frequently in a standard freezer should do the trick . The vacuum based suggestions also sound good , if you have appropriate equipment for that . Basically , you 're asking about distillation in reverse . Traditional distillation is primarily boiling , but there 's also a few traditions ( applejack , <URL> ) involving ice distillation . In ice distillation they 're after a higher alcohol product and keeping the liquid ( discarding the ice ) , but I believe if you switch which part you keep you 'll get the same results . Much like any other distillation , you may need to run through the process multiple times to get the desired result . With beer , the primary flavoring is from compounds extracted from hops , which react with oxygen to produce unpleasant flavors . By " unpleasant " I mean turning the bitter and tangy flavors into something more like wet cardboard . So depending on what you 're doing you may also need to protect your beer from exposure to oxygen . I believe with beer the real enemy is oxygen , with heat or light accelerating the undesirable reactions . Depending on the style of beer , esters and phenols may also be important to the flavor . In styles where those flavors are desired , it 's typically a wide mix , and it 's quite possible some of them will evaporate easier than alcohol or be harder to freeze . Note that no distillation method is " perfect " , with all distillation methods you 'll have water and alcohol in both outputs of the process , you 'll just have a greater amount of alcohol in the evaporated or unfrozen part and a lesser amount in the unevaporated or frozen part . Note also that in the US any <URL> .
I ca n't speak to specific chemicals/aromatics for mushrooms , but this kind of thing does happen with all kinds of food . The initial cooking is releasing aromatics that were previously bound up in the food somehow , so you quickly get some stronger flavors . But aromatic molecules are volatile ( that 's why you smell them ! ) and also generally more prone to breaking down , so as you cook longer , they escape , or are broken down into something else without so much flavor , leaving you with something milder . Think about onion , for example . When you first start sauteeing it , there 's a lot of really strong onion smell coming off , maybe even enough to make you cry if you 're prone to it . If you eat it then , it 'll still have plenty of sharp onion flavor . But as you cook longer , those flavors mellow out ; going to the extreme , slowly caramelized onions have no sharpness and very little onion flavor . I think the initial strengthening of flavor may be stronger with mushrooms because of their structure . They seem dry at first , with all the water bound up inside . But as you start to cook them , their structure breaks down and they quickly release a lot of water , and with it , those flavors .
The salt adds flavor , but it also helps reduce the gelation of the starch in the pasta . The starch in food is the form of microscopic grains . When these grains come into contact with water , they will trap some of it ( think cornstarch in cold water ) , but when the water is hot they swell up like balloons and merge with each other , and you have starch gelation . Another thing you may want to add to the pasta water is some acid ( lemon or cream of tartar ) . Tap water in most cities is made alkaline , which increases the starch loss from the pasta to the water , making the pasta stickier .
The tangzhong is composed mainly of gelated starches . According to Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " During the baking of bread and cakes , the starch granules absorb water , swell , and set to form the rigid bulk of the walls that surround the bubbles of carbon dioxide . At the same time their swollen rigidity stops the expansion of the bubbles and so forces the water vapor inside to pop the bubbles and escape , turning the foam of separate bubbles into a continuous spongy network of connected holes . If this did n't happen , then at the end of baking the cool - ing water vapor would contract and cause the bread or cake to collapse . In the Tangzhong , the starches are already swollen before mixing begins . This means that they do not need to compete with the proteins to absorb water as the completed dough warms up in the oven . As you mix the ingredients the plump starches perforate the gluten-water sheets . As McGee mentioned , these starch granules ' rigidity accounts for the spongy , close structure of the tangzhong crumb , dough with less perforated gluten mesh forms larger bubbles and a more open crumb . The gluten in the flour used in the tangzhong is denatured by the process before it can form into an extensive network . However , since the tangzhong accounts for only a small portion of the total flour used , there is plenty of gluten left to maintain structure during rise and oven spring until the starch structure sets .

Yes , it is true that we do n't add oil to the boiling water . I 'm not aware of any good reason to waste extra-virgin olive oil that way ! Some oil is always added at the end , over the sauce , when the pasta is already in the plate ! It has to be raw , so that it retains its fruit nuances and texture . If you are doing cold pasta salad and want to avoid sticky pasta , adding oil in advance wo n't help . You have instead to wash pasta under cold water to wash the starch away ( you can put the pasta in the colander directly under the running cold tap ) .
Salt ( Sodium chloride ) is salt . As a topping , flakes are commonly used purely for presentation purposes only . The taste is the same , but gets more intense as the salt particles get finer , so use less if the salt is in powder form As an ingredient , use any form you are happy with , and is economical to use . Once salt is dissolved into water it will be identical to any other form of salt For health reasons , finely powdered salt is preferable as much less is required to impart a salty taste
I spoke with the farm that sold me the kohlrabi ; they have seen people make something akin to mashed rutabaga by boiling kohlrabi for ages and ages , so it gets about that soft . Note that mashed rutabaga is apparently still firmer than mashed potatoes , but obviously soft enough to mash into a pulp . For a stir-fry , they suggested a match-stick shape rather than medallions ; my second such stir-fry found them to have about the texture of halfway-cooked onions , soft enough not to crunch anymore but firm enough to hold their shape on a fork .
As long as you are talking about a normal pot with or without a normal lid ( i.e. not a pressure cooker ) and you are reasonably close to sea level , you 're right , boiling water is at 100 ° C. However , if you start to climb in altitude , that is no longer the case , at 300m , water boils at 99 ° C , at 600m , 98 ° C and so on . Wikipedia has a page with information about <URL> that contains a reference table .
It will firm up a little bit during chilling , but not much . It is certainly supposed to be firm enough to keep its shape on its own when taken out . If you have baked creme caramel or cheesecake , then try to get it to a similar consistency as these . If you have n't , you may want to use a roast thermometer . The final temperature ( assuming a traditional flan without starch or flour ) should fall in the 85-90 Celsius range .
OK - for my bona fides , I 'm a microbiologist and have made a career of quality control in food processing including meat processing so I know what I am talking about . There are two kinds of smoked pork chops , cold smoked and hot smoked . Cold smoked pork chops are n't heat processed , so they are n't cooked . They have the redder color and the more resilient , moister feel of raw meat . You are only apt to run into them in specialty meat markets or at small local butchers . These need to be cooked to 145F to be safe and palatable to eat . What you find in the grocery store and most meat markets is almost always hot smoked . It is heated during the smoking process and is fully cooked , just like a smoked ham . It looks and feels to the touch liked cooked meat . That sounds like what you have . If you are n't sure ask the butcher or meat department manager . They should know . If they do n't , buy your meat elsewhere . Having said all that , it is common to find the smoked pork chops in the meat case right alongside the raw pork . Being exposed to raw meat undoes the kill step the heat of cooking does to foodbourne microorganisms . Salmonella , e.coli and other organisms are easily transferred from utensils , trays and workers hands back onto the cooked meat . This could be done in the meat case , or in wrapped product it could happen in the back room where the chops are cut up and wrapped . Organisms that find their way onto the meat quickly grow and spread over the meat 's surface and may find their way into the interior of the cut through any break in its surface . Unless you are certain it has been factory wrapped , sealed and labelled rather than in the store you should treat it as raw meat and heat it to 145F before serving . At the least be sure the surface of the meat has been seared before serving . I just do n't trust the expertise and commitment to providing safe foods you are apt to find in a grocery store or butcher shop . On the other hand , if it looks like it came from a factory already sealed in plastic wrap I would feel certain it was processed on a line that only processes cooked meat and is promptly sealed . I would have no qualms about eating it cold right out of the package .
Simply put , you have to stir them the first three/four minutes of cooking . Be sure to boil them in enough water ( at least 1 liter per 100 grams ) . In addition to that be sure to buy some good quality pasta . From my knowledge pasta tends to stick when the wheat used is of poor quality . A good pasta should not be transparent when seen in direct sunlight , but it should be of a nice pale yellow color and opaque . Good Italian pasta brands that you can find outside of Italy are De Cecco ( which I fear might be quite expensive , and probably not so easy to find ) , or Barilla ( easier to find ) . Both of them has cooking instructions printed on the package . You might want to cook them for 2-3 minutes less than what 's printed , then eventually cook them the remaining couple of minutes together with your sauce .

I own a 1-litre soda siphon like the iSi Siphon you pointed out . Some friends have a higher-capacity soda maker , I think from Sodastream . To answer your questions : Yes , the charger is single-use , and it carbonates only as much water as is in the bottle . My soda siphon holds about 1 litre of water . If I put in less water , then once the bottle runs dry I vent spare carbon dioxide uselessly into the air . If I put in more water , the carbon dioxide runs out and the remaining water wo n't leave the bottle . Using the standard siphon product , there 's no easy way to have a single charger yield more than one 1 litre . The charger is designed to deliver all its gas at one time ; it does n't reseal . Consider the <URL> if you want a step up from the 1-litre soda siphon with disposable chargers . Sodastream uses larger bottles of gas , which they describe as " 60L " . I think they mean that each bottle of gas carbonates 60 litres of water . Sodastream 's <URL> claims , After your initial purchase of a home soda maker package , you 'll enjoy seltzer and sparkling water in reusable 1-liter PET bottle for just [ Canadian ] $ .30 per litre and flavoured sodas for about $ .88 per litre , before any applicable shipping charges ... From their wording , it 's pretty clear to me that the $ 0.20 - $ 0.30 / litre claim is purely the marginal cost of carbonating water . It does n't include amortising the purchase cost of the equipment , and likely is based on the cheapest way to refill the carbon dioxide bottles ( exchanging filled bottles for empty by mail ) , and likely does n't include shipping costs or taxes for the refills . It may be that one can drive the cost per litre down by adjusting the amount of water in the soda bottle , as well .
In casseroles , pot pies and the like , condensed soup is usually added without additional water . It serves as a thickening agent and will pick up sufficient water from whatever vegetables etc. you also have in the recipe . That 's not to say you never add water along w the soup , it 's just that the desired end result is more often some sort of solid casserole-like dish than merely a souped up soup . If you 've uncooked , dry , noodles in there too , you will have to add some liquid beyond the condensed soup , so as to allow them to hydrate properly .
This <URL> shows the technique very clearly . Place place the filet skin side down . Grasp the tail end , and slip your thin , flexible knife into the filet by the tail end , scraping against the skin , cutting down the length of the fish . Turn the fish over , and inspect . If any pieces remain , removing them is similar to removing the silverskin from a pork or beef tenderloin . Slip your knife under the end of the remnant , pulling the blade up against the skin and cutting down its length to remove . I recommend watching this video or others , because the technique is easier to see than understand from a written description .
Use a meat thermometer . If you overcook the chicken , it will dry out . The standard temperature for chicken breast is 160 degrees Fahrenheit .
You may need to add more oil , say a generous tablespoon . Also , I do n't think you should need to soak those lentils first , the pressure cooker should be more than able to take them apart without any advance soak . Also be sure to use plenty of water . At least 8 cups for 1 pound of beans .
The absolute time a stock will take depends on the quantity of stock you are making and also on the ratio of solids to liquid with which you started ( along with the strength of your burner , the starting temperature of the water , the geometry of your pot , ... ) . Intentional variation is also possible depending on your intended use . The best advice I 've heard comes from Judy Rodgers in the Zuni Cafe Cookbook : taste the stock often as it cooks , more and more freqently as it starts to taste good . When it does n't taste better than the last time you checked , it 's done .
Use the pasta cooking techniques in this answer : <URL> Bring just enough water to cover the pasta to a boil , put the lid on and let it sit . Use less water , less energy , and it ca n't boil over if it 's not boiling .

Can quickbread be prepared in advance ?
Some muffins with very thick batter can be held for up to several days before being baked , but these are the exception , rather than the rule . However , quick breads , whether sliced loaves , whole loaves , or muffins , freeze extremely well . Muffins are especially easy to reheat in the microwave or a toaster oven , and can be an ideal way to have quick breads prepared in advance . Another way ( which offers fresh , hotly baked breads ) that I like I do before busy holidays that will have muffins or cornbread on the menu , is to prepare the dry mix , and the wet mix , and stick them ( separately ) into the refrigerator . Then , it is only a matter of combining them , putting them in the pan , and baking .
@Chris : Does the recipe from the Nero Wolfe cookbook say anything about dumping the milky/watery portion out of the pan before returning the butter to it to brown ? Clarified butter WILL NOT brown , that is the purpose for clarifying it . The milk solids are what brown . The portion that usually goes to the bottom will be the whey and the milk solids initially tend to form the " scum " on the top . To me it sounds like he 's trying to suggest that you should pour the butter &amp; solids off , dump out any whey , and then return the butter to the pan so you can heat it to the point of a dark brown without it splattering ( which is caused by the water in the whey ) . 4 tablespoons of butter is n't going to have much whey in the first place so just cook the whole butter to the beurre noir point .
To be perfectly honest with you , in all my years of cooking in kitchens I never took the temp of the fish . It was always by feel and look . Yes , I know that the gov ' t has guidelines that say 145F for fish but really when it comes down to it , if you have an 8oz cut of salmon/cod/monk in the pan , sticking an instant read into the middle wo n't do you much good . ( Caveat : If it was a salmon Wellington I would shoot for 130F as it 's a fully enclosed package that you ca n't feel for doneness ) The thickness of the cut will make a huge difference in when you should pull it out as you get post-oven cooking during resting in which the heat continues to heat the core of the flesh up to a final cooked temperature . That 's why most chefs will take the roast out at a rare measured temp when they are shooting for a med rare serving state . If your question is what state should monk fish be served , IE med rare ( like salmon ) or rare ( like tuna ) then I would say med-rare is your best bet . Over cooking is a bad thing for monk fish and it goes from a lovely moist state to dry nastiness really quick . A nice way to cook it that helps to give you a little move wiggle room when cooking it is to wrap it in Parma ham ( prosciutto ) . The little extra wrapping tastes great but also gives you a little bit of buffer as you get close to that magical temperature of doneness . Hope it helps .
Yes , you can squeeze citrus too much . That bitterness you sometimes taste in citrus fruit comes from limonin , a compound that most people can detect at concentrations as small as a few parts per million . In many citrus fruits the limonin is created once the acids of the juice vesicles interact with LARL , a tasteless substance in the fruit 's tissues ( <URL> ) . In the juice of a squeezed lime the reaction from LARL to limonin takes a few hours to complete , so if it is very fresh it will not be as bitter . Over-squeezing , as in using a pestle , will expose more of the tissue ( and therefore LARL ) resulting in more bitterness later on . If the peels are in the mix , it will also extract some of the oils ( mainly limonene ) from the peel , which is very bitter . So bitter , that <URL> are designed so that the juice extracts never touch the peel . During summer , guests often ask for caipirinhas at our house . I like to imagine that it is because I peel my limes , remove most of the white pith including stem , and try to mash the limes just before mixing the drink . This way it requires less sugar allowing those great citrus flavors to stand out .
I 'd look towards a dutch oven and cake-like items : upside-down cakes cobblers / crisps / grunts / bettys / slumps / etc. . In all of these , the fruit on the bottom helps to protect from the bottom of the cake-like-item cooking too quickly . You can either cook directly in the dutch oven , or drop another pan inside the dutch oven to speed on cleaning if you 're going to be cooking a few of 'em . You 'll also want to look for dutch ovens that are made for baking -- they have a lip on the lid , so you can put coals on top and pull the lid without the ash falling into what you 're cooking .
Yes , you could certainly reconstitute evaporated milk by adding water . The outcome would give you similar but not identical results as fresh milk , due to the change in flavor the milk underwent while being cooked down to the evaporated state : it will retain the slightly cooked , caramelized flavor . This may or many not have a significant effect on a given recipe . Milk also freezes , and still is suitable for most cooking purposes , should you choose to do so . Finally , if you use milk very rarely , unless you are making a dairy dominated recipe like custard or cream soup , you may not have to use milk at all . Water or another liquid might perform similarly or well enough -- it depends on the specific application .
Alton Brown says never to cook a cheesecake in a springform pan . He uses a regular pan and lines it with parchment paper so that the cheesecake wo n't stick to the bottom .
Soy chicken is usually available at Asian grocery stores that cater to an East Asian demographic . It is normally sold as " soy ham " or " veggie ham " , with " chicken " as one of the varieties available . It 's usually in a sort of log shape and you just cut it to whatever size you need . It is technically already cooked , but many recipes will call for it to be coated and baked , etc. .
Cookies for shaping are usually rolled cookies . Common categories would include : Sugar cookies ( as Mien mentioned ) Gingerbread Linzer cookie dough Look for recipes where you use a rolling pin . These are already formulated for minimal spread . Adapting other cookie recipes for use with cookie cutters will be trickier , and probably not worth the effort , in my opinion .
Ah , you missed the obvious : pumpkin ! This is biologically a fruit , actually , as is the zucchini . Pumpkin loves same spices as carrot . Maybe even rum or butterscotch too . Now , beetroot is a veg and colors cakes delectably ; perhaps why it was originally added when going stingy on the cocoa . How about parsnip next ? Sweet and nutty , I think pistachios would complement it well in a recipe borrowed from zucchini bread . more veg here : <URL> p.s. if you have n't guessed Rabarber is rhubarb
( disclaimer : I 've only heard of people doing this , not done it myself . ) Yes , it can be done . You 're looking for <URL> canning . Various places will sell you the bags , and you can vacuum seal them with a chamber vac , though you may need an upgraded heat bar . Then you can process them in a pressure canner ( or preferably autoclave ) . I 'd definitely follow the normal reheating recommendations ( the boil it 10 minutes bit ) before eating . I do n't think USDA has home canning guides for retort pouches .
It should n't have any effect , in the sense of any flavors leaching . If your container does change the taste , you should replace it . But it would be very unusual to chance upon a taste-changing container . Most cookware is non reactive , and containers meant for preparing and serving tea even less so . For example , untreated aluminium is reactive , but I 've never heard of it being used for tea pots or tea mugs . Steel is completely OK in that regard . Melamine also has no effect on taste , but see the footnote for safety considerations . The most likely condition under which you find a taste change would be if you are using ceramic teapots or mugs which were not mass produced for daily use , but made by a pottery hobbyist or by some exotic traditional technique which does not reach the convenience standards of modern mass production . In that case , you can simply switch the container to a neutral one , if the taste bothers you , or if you are worried about the safety of glaze leaching into your drink . Why porcelain or glazed earthenware No special reason . What you cite is an ISO standard . It was n't made for people making tea at home , they wanted to have perfect reproducibility , and the easiest way is to restrict as many variables as possible . So they took one of the traditional choices and prescribed it in their standard . There is no reason to follow that standard when you make tea for drinking . The material affects the taste of the tea in other ways : it has an influence on the speed of cooling down . But it is impossible to make a general recommendation here , as 1 ) there are many other factors influencing the cooling speed , and 2 ) people have different preferences for the taste of tea . The only relevance here is that , if you have found a process which produces tea you like with one set of utensils , it might produce a different taste if you use a different teapot , and you 'll have to experiment until you have calibrated the process to your preferences again . But the differences here are subtle , you have to be a pretty dedicated tea drinker to be bothered by them . Footnote on melamine safety : Melamine is a resin which contains traces of formaldehyde , a known carcinogen . The formaldehyde does not end up in the food at room temperature , but it starts leaching at higher temperatures , this is why it is not microwave safe . As the leaching process is gradual , and depends on pH besides temperature , there is no hard temperature prescription beyond which it is considered unsafe to use . But I could n't find any source rating melamine for over 100 Celsius , and some of them give a lower temperature such as 60 or 70 Celsius . If you are concerned about the formaldehyde , you are probably better off choosing another mug . Porcelain is the standard choice , but steel and some plastics are also frequently used . For a short consumer info on melamine , see <URL> .
Yes , those cakes are typically 0.6 ounces , and when substituting you should use one packet of active dry yeast .
Yes , but not in shell ( they explode , often spectacularly ) . See <URL> for some more information . In general , whites are better to freeze , although you can freeze yolks as well .
There are substitutes , but eggs have very important effects on the texture of dough and are therefore hard to substitute . You will need to experiment a great deal until you hit on the correct texture , because you 'll need to tweak all other ingredients and maybe include new ones , e.g. substitute part of the butter and use cream instead to account for moisture loss from egg substitutes . Mien 's link already includes some substitute ideas , like applesauce and commercial imitations . I ca n't give you more suggestions , because I always put eggs in my cakes ;) . But when tweaking , keep following in mind : Egg whites provide a resilient mesh which traps small air bubbles , so they make a cake more airy . You may need to adjust the baking powder upwards a bit . If it is a soda recipe , you 'll need to raise the acidity too . But the whole effect ca n't be approximated just with baking powder , because its bubbles are too big . For that , you need better emulsification ( covered below ) . Egg whites also have a binding quality . This should n't need compensation in a cake , as you need a dough without too much binding ( as opposed to bread ) , but if your cake starts falling apart , consider using a flour with higher gluten content ( all purpose flour instead of cake flour ) . Gluten binds too . If , on the other hand , your cake is too bread-like , then you may need less binding . The egg yolks are a source of fat , which prevents the dough gluten from forming a strong mesh by covering the particles . You will miss this with egg substitutes , especially if they are pectin-based ( like applesauce ) because pectin enhances binding . Use the lower gluten dough ( it it does n't cause the cake to fall apart ) or add more fat . Then there is the importance of emulsifiers . Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lecithin in the kitchen . An emulsifier helps your wet ingredients bind in an emulsion , instead of staying in two separate phases with the watery phase soaking the flour through and the fatty phase making the whole thing greasy . It also helps the trapping of very tiny air bubbles in the wet part of the dough ( this is what happens when you beat eggs with sugar on high speed until the colour lightens ) which provides a very fine leavening . Maybe commercial egg imitates contain emulsifiers - check the list - but if they do n't , you must buy pure lecithin . It is usually soy derived , but maybe you need to check with the manufacturer that your brand is suitable for vegetarians . Also , consider including cream , the fat in it is already emulsified in water , unlike butter ( which is water emulsified in fat ) . You must calculate precisely and tweak other ingredients to ensure that the total amount of fat and moisture do n't change ( except if you are compensating for the changes caused by the egg substitute ) . If it is a chocolate cake , consider reducing the fat and the flour and adding some cocoa powder ( the regular-fat variety ) . Cocoa has binding and thickening properties , and will help with the more even fat distribution . Melted chocolate tastes good in cakes , but makes them very dense , so do n't use it . The easiest way would be to find a recipe published by someone who has already done all the work . But just from paging through a cookbook , you ca n't tell if they did it right , or just slapped a spoon of applesauce instead of an egg and called it a vegan cake . Edit : I just had an idea when I saw Mien 's gelatine question and yours together in the list . I have n't heard of anybody using it , and do n't know if it will work , but it does , it will be great . So try it . I already said that using cream would help . As you need a foam full of very tiny bubbles for the perfect leavening , you could try whipped cream instead of whipped eggs . The trouble is that the air will get out of the batter very quickly while and after folding the cream . So you 'll need to stabilize it . Gelatine in unusually small quantities will make for a very nice experiment , but obviously not one you 'll want to do . But plant-derived gelling agents could help . Carrageenan is commonly used with dairy products , and you can buy it online . So try folding stabilized whipped cream into the batter .
Yes , you can . If the frozen salmon is of high quality , there is no reason based on the food science that it should not work . Many of the recipes and articles on the web indicate that you should ( or sometimes can ) start with frozen salmon . Some , including <URL> , specifically recommend using frozen salmon to reduce the risk from parasites : Parasites , such as roundworms , can naturally reside in salmon regardless of if it was frozen or fresh . For safety , use salmon that has been commercially frozen or freeze the salmon yourself to at least -10 ° F ( -23 ° C ) for at least 7 days .
I think what your looking for is called poured sugar oil moulds ( rings ) that you want to use ant shape is okay then use 2 lbs sugar ,1 lb water , 6.55 ounces of glucose and food colouring if you want.make a syrup with the three and then boil until it reaches 260F add food colouring continue to boil until temp . reaches 330F plunge the pot into a cold water bath to stop the cooking.remove from water and let stand 2-3 minutes to thicken . Pour mixture into moulds until 1/4 inch thick . Once edges have setenough remove the ring . Use a little reheated sugar to attached pieces together like a glue.this can be used as a base for any center piece you want to create with other sugar pieces
2kg of veal bones cut up for stock use from your butcher should need around 5 litre of water to cover . If you use more then you 're just thinning the stock and that 'll mean you need to reduce it more later to get the same flavour you would have had if you started with the correct amount of water . Why does this matter you may ask ... well , along with the longer reduction time you 'll taste changes to the flavour more as time goes by . You 're cooking it longer and the heat changes things , sometimes for the bad , sometimes for the good . Mainly it 's just wasted time reducing something that did n't need to happen . When all is said and done after simmering for around 6 hours , you 'll end up with about 3-4 litres of quality stock if you went with a 2kg :5 L ratio . If you use more water to start then you 'll end up with more stock but of low quality . Then you 'll spend your time reducing the stock down until it starts to taste like the stock that you could have made with 5L of water .
I would imagine , if the book is of reasonable quality , by prepared , they mean one that you have prepared earlier . If there 's a recipe for pizza base in the book , that 's probably what they 'd like you to use . Personally , if you 're going to the trouble of making home-made pizza , make your own base . Invariably , the pre-made bases you can buy from stores taste like chalk . There 's a few topics here that may be useful : <URL> <URL> <URL>
I finally found the answer to this question : I was in the supermarket yesterday and on a can of lentils the ingredients listed on the side of the tin had the phrase ' firming agent ' in brackets beside the entry for calcium chloride .

What kind of reaction is this ?
It is certainly a fermentation . A simple chemical neutralization would n't need that much time , and would n't produce lasting fizz . You can be certain that there are wild yeasts everywhere : in the air in your kitchen , on your elderflower , probably on your utensils , etc. . It is impossible to say which ones prevailed in the fermentation , the ones you brought in with the elderflower or the ones which came into it from some other sources .
My mum and I 've always used red onions all our lives and everyone or a huge population in North India uses red onions . I have friends here in Australia from South India who I 've seen using red onions as well when making dal . Having said that , I 've also tried brown onions a few times and it does n't make too much of a difference . And good luck with your first time making it :)
To answer in the language of the question asked : Medium holes with a cutting edge on bottom ( look like large raindrops ) : used for shredding . Small holes with cutting edge on bottom : used for shredding when you want it finer than the larger size . Outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides : used for grating . Wide holes that look like a smiley : used to slice things to an even thickness . As for recipes ... I generally do n't use the slicing portion too often , as I can get fairly consistent slices with a knife , but if you 're not so skilled , it could be used to slice potatoes for an au gratin ( might need to slice them in half first , is the slots are n't wide enough to fit the whole potato ) , or to slice firmer cheeses . It can also be used for slicing cabbage for coleslaw ( again , once cut down to fit ) , cucumbers or carrots for salads , etc. . As the blades are n't razor sharp , there are some softer items ( eg , tomatoes ) that it just wo n't work for , that you 'd have to do by hand or get a much more expensive mandoline . The grating side I only generally use for hard cheeses , when I need a more powdery texture than I can get with the shredding sides . I 've also used it for zesting citrus ( although it only works in large quantities , as you end up losing about 1/2 a lemon to the groves and it does n't release without a brush ** ) , and I 've used it for pulping carrots ( was mixing them into a sauce , and I did n't want identifiable bits ) The shredding sides are the ones I use the most , with the choice of side dependent upon what size I want the resultant shreds . I use it for firmer vegetables and fruits that I 'm baking into breads ( zucchini , carrots , apples ) , potatoes for hash browns , medium cheeses for firmer cheeses ( when I want this texture ) , etc. . Although a food processor can be used for this task , you have to consider a couple things ( besides initial cost &amp; space it takes up ) : it 's really easy to go and shred lots of cheddar cheese in a food processor , but it cramming all in there and fusing back together from the force and heat , defeating the purpose . Chilling the cheese helps , but you also need to keep dumping the work bowl out . If you have a strong arm and a small food processor , a hand shredder might actually be faster and give better results . When using a shredding disk for firmer things , you do more damage than by hand , resulting in lots of liquid being given off . Sometimes , this is better ... I have a potato kugel recipe that comes out very light as I can get more of the liquid out after having gone through the food processor ... so you may want to try both tools ( if you already own them both ) to see which one gives you better results . ** ... I 've heard you can wrap it in plastic wrap , use the grater , and then pull the wrap off to get it to release ; I 've never tried it , in part because I now have a microplane grater , but also because I 'd be afraid of getting bits of plastic in the food . I also want to say that I saw the trick the context of pulping ginger or garlic , but it 's been long enough ago that I do n't know that I can trust my memory
Basmati is classic . I am particularly fond of brown basmati rice , which has more flavor than white basmati , but it takes longer to cook and will go rancid after 6 months . If basmati is not available , any long-grain rice will suffice ; short-grain rice tends to be too sticky . As for technique , rinse the rice until the rinse-water runs clear . For every cup of rice , use 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp salt . Bring the water to a boil ; add the rice and salt and reduce the heat to a simmer . Cook covered until the liquid has been absorbed and the texture of the rice is tender . For additions to the rice , you have LOADS of options . You can add a pinch of saffron to the water for a vibrant yellow color and distinctive floral aroma ( if you just want color , add 1/2 tsp ground turmeric ) . You can add chunks of peeled ginger , cracked peppercorns , whole peeled garlic cloves , whole cardamom pods , whole cloves , whole bay leaves , whole kaffir lime leaves , and/or whole stick cinnamon -- amounts and combinations are entirely up to your taste ( just remember to remove any bay leaves before serving ; remove the others or not as you like , but bay is inedible ) . You can also add cooked vegetables , such as peas , butter beans , pearl onions , and/or carrots .
A difference I see between your recipe and other alternatives is that you do n't have any other starch besides your rice . Other recipes include a good amount of tapioca or potato starch . The other difference was that other recipes used rice flour instead of rice . You might also want to consider a change in technique . You can make rice noodles like a crepe rather than in an oiled steamer pan . Simply use a non-stick or oiled crepe pan , put in batter to crepe thickness , and let it cook until it begins to pull away from the edge of the pan . Invert and release in one motion onto a cutting board and slice .
You can call the manufacturers and ask them if it is " INDUCTION READY " The packaging &amp; the insert with specifications &amp; instructions should say that . Youu can ask the customer service at Amazon too , may be they will have the answer . But I also located an answer on the internet , which I am including the link : <URL>
Sugar syrup of such high concentration has practically the same shelf life as candy . You do n't have to refrigerate it . Bacteria practically ca n't live in it . You can keep it for months , and it expires because its taste goes off at some point , not because it becomes unsafe . If something goes wrong and the sugar concentration is n't high enough after all , the first thing which will colonize your syrup will be mould . It is very visible , and you will be able to just throw it out . No need to worry that you eat normally-looking product teeming with pathogens ( which is the largest problem in food safety ) .
It is simply to add tartness to add some balance against the sugar . The water from the vinegar will evaporate and leave behind acetic acid . There is an old fashioned type of hard candy known as <URL> . Your lollipop is essentially just that candy on a stick .
Your best bet is a stone ground bread flour or hard flour in the US that means finding a local mill . At your standard supermarket a high protein bread flour is your only option if you can find it there . I generally have to venture out to a Whole Foods market to find that as my " local " grocery store does n't carry it . You could also try Tipo 00 , I have run across it in some specialty stores . You are looking for the highest gluten content you can find so that you can get the elasticity you need to make proper strudel .
Any recipe where the water is part of a sauce or is expected to be absorbed ( including rice , couscous , and yes , pasta too ) , you can use stock instead to increase the deliciousness . If you have an opportunity to add flavour , why waste it ? Of course , there are some caveats to consider when making the substitution : Stock is going to contain a certain amount of gelatin ( how much depends on how the stock is made ) . This is often a good thing , leading to a richer mouth-feel , but if the thickening effect would be detrimental to your recipe , then do n't use stock . Stock can clash with other flavours , although less often than you 'd expect , since it 's effectively a mega-dose of umami . In particular I 'd probably avoid using it in recipes that are either very sour ( sour meat is the taste of rancidity and highly displeasing ) or very sweet ( since the sugar will overwhelm the flavour of the stock ) . So do n't use it in your candies or in your pickling solutions , but any dish based primarily on meats , vegetables , and grains , is definitely fair game . Because it 's a meat product , it has a limited life span . I would n't recommend substituting it for water in anything that 's going to sit in the fridge for several days and/or be re-frozen , due to food safety concerns . Oh , and I probably would n't use it in baking . The effects of using homemade stock when the primarily role of the liquid is to develop gluten would be unpredictable , to say the least . And somehow the thought of turkey-flavoured cake just does n't sound very appealing to me . As for the right ratio - that depends entirely on what went into the stock , how long it was simmered for and whether or not the stock itself was reduced prior to storing/freezing . You 're definitely going to want the same total amount of liquid , but if the stock is highly gelatinous then you might want to dilute it , and conversely , if the stock is very weak then you might want to reduce it . There really is no golden ratio , but I 'd probably stick with 1:1 for a " typical " stock .
There are actually two dishes being sold , and neither is " Phở " . The words that she yelled and had Gordon do the same were " Hủ tiếu , Bún riêu " . They are both noodle soups , the former is pork based broth , and the latter , porc and shrimp/crab with tomatoes . You can google the words for more info .
The resultant cheese in your first link will be a fresh , soft cheese , nothing like either of the Parmesan or cheddar cheeses mentioned in your second link . It is also an acid-based cheese , not a made with either rennet or bacterial cultures as are most other cheeses . Parmesan is a very long aged cheese . Cheddar is a. . . well ... cheddared cheese ( cheddaring is a process which reduces the moisture content of the curds ) that is then aged for varying periods of time . The fresh cheese in your first link will not serve you well in the same roles as either Parmesan or Cheddar . While I realize these products may not be available easily where you live , they are very distinctive and hard to substitute for with homemade products -- they just also not the kind of cheese that is normally made at home . The home made cheese described is most similar to an unaged feta ( although not goat 's milk ) , or a Mexican queso fresco .
When I go to the Korean supermarkets in LA , I usually see half an aisle just dedicated to 고추가루 in all kinds of forms ( mild to spicy , fine to coarse grind ) and colors . I do n't know that there 's any specific pepper than it is all about how sweet and mildly spicy 고추가루 is supposed to be . You could start from there to make your own by sun drying and crushing whatever peppers are available to you . If you are looking for a substitute that you can buy at a western store , try crushed red pepper flakes ( the kind you see in the shakers at pizza places ) . You 're going to be adjusting for taste/spiciness anyway , so not much of a dealbreaker .
It is used extensively in Indian cooking . I have one book , <URL> that calls for it in virtually every recipe , and each time reminds you to cut the amount down by 3/4 's if you ca n't find Yellow Cobra brand . It does indeed have a flavor someone reminiscent of aged garlic . It is thought to have medicinal value as well ( see the wikipedia article for details ) .
For this dish , you 'll probably want to use a low-end extra-light oil ( since it 's being heated quite a bit ) , and then drizzle in nicer extra virgin oil to finish the flavor after the pasta has been tossed into the cheese , oil , and spices . The rule of thumb is to have two kinds of olive oil : High-grade , richly flavored extra virgin olive oil ( for finishing ) Extra light , not extra-virgin olive oil for use as a cooking oil . You can use a cheaper oil for this -- many people choose to use a later pressing , crudo or " pure olive oil " ( in the US ) kind . The high-end oil is for adding it to sauces and drizzling on mostly-finished dishes to add that rich flavor . You 're looking for something with a lot of taste , and it 's a good idea to get small amounts of pricier oil . Getting small bottles means you 'll be using fresher , more flavorful oil because it has n't been open for long . Plus , you wo n't need much to finish dishes . Note that for this use , you want to add the oil near the end of cooking , as heat will alter and weaken the flavor . The low-end light olive oil should be of neutral or light flavor , and will be more tolerant of heating than extra-virgin . Because it has a much higher smoke point than extra-virgin grade oil , use this in recipes calling for heating up olive oil . If necessary for flavor , add some of the good stuff near the end of cooking .
It is certainly a fermentation . A simple chemical neutralization would n't need that much time , and would n't produce lasting fizz . You can be certain that there are wild yeasts everywhere : in the air in your kitchen , on your elderflower , probably on your utensils , etc. . It is impossible to say which ones prevailed in the fermentation , the ones you brought in with the elderflower or the ones which came into it from some other sources .
In the classic recipe the onions are chopped , personally , I like mine very thinly sliced . The cheese typically used is the French Comté but a good substitute is Swiss gruyère or even Swiss Emmenthal .
It is to cool it down without dilluting it - ice cubes would melt . And yes , you could simply cool the entire bottle , but it would n't look that fancy . Note that some purists would wrinkle their noses and insist that whisky1 is best enjoyed at room temperature and perhaps with a small dash of spring water . 1 And I 'm soooo not going into a whisky vs. whiskey debate here .
High fructose corn syrup is a preservative . While sugaring your ketchup is good for flavor , HFCS is great for shelf stability , as is the vinegar . The reasons you typically see HFCS in American Ketchups is that it is ( 1 ) heavily subsidized and domestic and cheap , ( 2 ) farmed by the same companies making the tomatoes , and ( 3 ) a preservative . Also , it helps to improve flow while maintaining viscosity . Sugar generally can be used to cut the acidity in a tomato dish without inhibiting the taste or outshining the tomato . My stepfather had digestion issues with high acidity meals and swore by a teaspoon or two of sugar to help aid the stomach issues . Likewise , the acidity of ketchup may well be mitigated by all the sugar .
You can avoid the tray altogether and bake them on a steel rack . Lye does n't react with stainless steel ( or with carbon steel , for that matter ) . It will stick lightly to the rack , just like anything else on stainless , but due to the small surface , you should be able to separate them . The second way would be to just use enough rock salt on a steel tray so that they are too high to stick . But it might mean that you 'll get too much salt embedded in them . And as a final word , you might just be using too much lye , or too strong a solution . Pretzel were baked long before there were silpats , and they did n't strip the seasoning off the tray . Avoid any coated trays ( teflon , enamel ) , and , most of all , aluminium .

What 's the difference between pan frying , sauteing , and shallow frying ?
Pan frying means letting the food sit in the pan and occasionally stirring or flipping . It tends to be done with larger pieces of food , and at a medium to medium-high heat . Sautéing means shaking the pan back and forth - making the food " jump " , if you 're translating directly . It 's done at a high heat , for a short time , usually with thinly-sliced or finely-chopped ingredients . Shallow frying , according to some references , refers to the food being partially ( halfway ) submerged in hot oil and flipped once , as opposed to deep-frying where the food is fully-submerged the whole time .
' Paella rice ' is not actually a variety of rice , but a category suitable , as the its name suggests , for making paella . Some common varieties are : Bahia , Balilla , Bomba , Senia , and Calasparra ; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose . These varieties differ from risotto rices , such as arborio and carnaroli , in not creating a creamy ' sauce ' around the rice . Paella rice should stick together , but be distinct and not in a creamy ' sauce ' . Arborio rice has a creamy , chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin ( one of two components in its starch ) content . Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices , however it too would become ' creamy ' if you stirred it like a risotto , since it also has a high starch content .
Old fashioned oats are rolled whole-grain oat kernels . In quick oats , on the other hand , the oat kernel is first cut into smaller pieces before being rolled . This makes it much easier for quick oats to absorb water than an old fashioned oat . You can visibly see the size difference . For baking quick oats can be used in place of old fashioned oats . However , if a recipe calls for quick oats , you may not get expected results using old fashioned oats . Typically , a recipe that calls explicitly for quick oats generally has too short a cooking time for regular oats to fully cook ( e.g. pancakes ) . Another thing altogether is instant oats . Do not substitute these in any recipe . Instant oats are parboiled , dried , and often has sugar and salt added . Nutritionally , quick and old-fashioned oats are identical .
Actually they recently came up with <URL> for civet coffee . Apparently a great deal of supposedly authentic stuff never actually traveled through the bowels of a cat . According to the <URL> , the levels of citric acid , malic acid , and the inositol/pyroglutamic acid are so much higher in kopi luwak that their ratios can be used to validate mixes with other beans where the proportion of kopi luwak is 50 % or greater .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .
Given that the frying of a cube of bread is a test for oil temperature , I suspect one or both of two things are happening here - 1 The oil is not at the correct temperature when the cubes of bread are dropped in it ; and 2 The oil temperature drops when you add too many cubes in at the same time so some get burnt and some end up soggy for the single time duration you 're cooking them for . Suggested solutions - 1 Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature for the level of browness you want the cubes of bread to be fried to . 2 Do n't over-crowd the pan . Fry them in batches , ensuring the oil temperature rises back to the correct one before the next batch is fried .
Chefs are really fast at cooking . It 's what they do . A chef can almost effortlessly crack an egg with one-hand in about a second . Scrambled eggs would be pre-cracked and beaten prior to the cooking-shift .
There is a wide range of pancake variants . <URL> are an egg-white leavened pancake often served with fruit and nuts , with the pancake itself being shredded for presentation . This is different than the most typical pancakes served in the US , which are not egg-white leavened , but baking powder leavened , but it is still a type of pancake .
I 've never really considered there to be a real difference between sautéing and frying . They both mean to cook in a hot pan with a little bit of fat . However there is n't a lot of consistency online . It does n't look like there 's any sort of definitive answer here . Some points of view : <URL> , although frying might involve slightly more oil . The terms are essentially interchangeable . This is the top hit on a google search " sauteing frying " ( although this question is on the first page ! ) . <URL> , sautéing involves jumping the food while frying involves a little more oil and less flipping or stiring of the food . Here 's <URL> for this definition . This definition makes a delineation between pan frying and shallow frying . <URL> and involves partially submerging the food in oil . Food is normally breaded first . There 's no distinction between frying and shallow frying . This is Martha Stewart 's definition . As you can see , it 's really all over the map , and that was just from the first page of the google results . I think we 're getting in to issues with language changing beneath us . However , I think the safest bet is probably that sautéing involves a lot of stirring , frying does n't , and I should consider refining my own definitions . Caramelizing ( which fortunately does n't have any of the same confusion ) is a process that happens during cooking when sugar oxidizes . There are many different ways that you can achieve this effect . One of the ways is to sauté or fry ( depending on your definition ) something until the water sweats out and the remaining sugar heats up . So the answer is that you are caramelizing the onions by sautéing ( or maybe frying ) them .
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
Leavening is rising by any means , so baking soda and baking powder ( chemical leaveners ) both apply here , as does yeast ( fermentation ) . Chemical leaveners like baking soda and powder work by mixing an acid ( varies , depending on the recipe ) and base ( usually baking soda in some form ) to produce carbon dioxide gas . Fermentation is the process of yeast converting sugars to carbon dioxide and alcohol . In bread making , the carbon dioxide is the desired product . In beer or wine making , the exact opposite . In both cases ( beer/wine and bread ) , other byproducts produced by the yeast add flavour and are highly desirable . There are other types of fermentation by bacteria ( such as those used in yogurt-making , pickles , or sauerkraut ) that produce lactic acid ; but those are somewhat outside of the scope of this answer ( although lactic acid fermentation by bacteria is responsible for the taste of sourdough breads ) . To specifically answer your question - yes , yeast breads undergo fermentation ( which is also leavening ) . Quick breads like banana bread use chemical leaveners , which are not fermentation .
I ran across a good resource while looking into duck eggs . I 'll let it speak for itself : The higher protein in Duck Eggs means they must n't be overcooked , or the whites will go tough and rubbery . Some people say they will be too tough if you completely fry them : they advise to rather partially fry them then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan , cover and let the steam moderate the heat and finish cooking them . Most people , though , seem to say they do n't notice a difference between fried chicken and Duck Eggs . Swapping Duck Eggs interchangeably in recipes for chicken eggs : some people say you ca n't ; others who substitute all the time say nonsense , it 's fine . When the Duck Egg whites are beaten they will come up a bit higher owing to the protein . They take a minute or so longer to start frothing up , but then make up for lost time . There 's a great deal more information on the page as well : <URL>
Traditional goulash is a stew/soup , usually using a cheaper cut of meat suited to slow cooking . It usually contains potatoes and other vegetables , as well as noodles . A true stroganoff consists of paprika-dusted fillet steak quickly pan fried with mushrooms and onions in a sour cream and brandy sauce . It is usually served with rice . I understand that in the US stroganoff can also refer to a stew made with similar ingredients as the traditional dish , and is served with noodles . This , coupled with the shared use of paprika , is evidently where the line blurs .
Yes , there is a clear difference in never-frozen vs. defrosted meat . The cell plasma in your chicken freezes in the freezer , turning into ice crystals . Since cell plasma is over 90 % water , it expands instead of shrinking in the 0 to -4 ° C range . The crystals cut the cell walls . When you defrost the meat and cook it , the cell plasma flows out into the pan , leaving you with dried out meat . This is the first , major problem with freezing , and occurs even when the meat is frozen for a very short time . If you keep meat stored frozen for longer time , there are two other effects . The unavoidable one is rancidity . The cell plasma in frozen meat has a high mineral concentration , and given time , it will oxidize the fat in meat , changing its taste for the worse . The avoidable one is freezer burn - it occurs if the meat is not wrapped properly in the freezer . Freezer-burned meat is really unpleasant to eat , most people throw out affected parts . Of course , this is not the only factor affecting meat quality . SAJ14SAJ 's comment is true in the sense that bad meat ( from mass-produced young animals grown in bad conditions ) will not have much taste of its own , and even if you prevent it from drying out , it still wo n't be as nice as good meat . But what is more pertinent in this case is that the cooking process can more impact on drying out than a freezing-defrosting cycle . If you cook defrosted meat carefully , you will minimize the dryness effect . It wo n't be the perfect morsel , but it can still taste pretty well . On the other hand , if you have never-frozen meat and overcook it , it can get to shoe-leather consistency , so that you lose all advantages from non-freezing .

Hibachi are technically a traditional Japanese device used for heating one 's house . They are a basic , heat-proof container that holds charcoal . The cooking devices that many people refer to as " hibachi " are what the Japanese would call " <URL> " : I 'm guessing that the term " hibachi " was popularized in North America because <URL> . Somewhere along the way , primarily in North America , the term " hibachi " also started to be used to refer to <URL> : I 'm not sure when or why this started ; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that <URL> confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as " hibachi-style " . Among these , teppanyaki is most similar to <URL> , in which meat is cooked on large , round , cast iron griddles : ( Images taken from Wikipedia . ) If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin , it would likely be referred to as " <URL> " , which is believed to have some origins in <URL> . Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time , " Mongolian barbecue " was developed in the 1970s in Taipei , Taiwan . During that time , Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan , so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue . There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish " <URL> " and Mongolian barbecue , however , jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue .
The coating you are talking about is potato starch that is browning on the bottom of the pan , similar to what happens to roux when it is prepared . If you deglaze the pan using alcohol , it will come right off without any effort ( water works too , though more is needed ) . As for how to get the potatoes not to stick , it 's important that the pan and the oil are quite hot when the potatoes are added to the pan . As described at <URL> , the hot oil encourages a steam barrier to appear between the potatoes and the pan , temporarily protecting the potatoes from sticking and encouraging the formation of a crust that will permanently keep them from sticking . Depending on the amount of potato being cooked , the amount of oil added to the pan will have to be adjusted for thermal mass , since the addition of uncooked potatoes will cause the oil to cool down very quickly .
The difference in their name is - not surprisingly - because of their form . Cherry tomatoes are round , while grape tomatoes are more oblong . <URL> mentions that grape tomatoes are ' sweet as cherry tomatoes ' , so not much difference in flavour according to this . Perhaps grape tomatoes are more similar to small plum tomatoes . <URL> claims grape tomatoes to be sweeter , having a thicker skin and a lower water content than cherry tomatoes . Interestingly , it also says that grape tomatoes are a cross between cherry tomatoes and other tomatoes . The claims of the second site are in agreement with <URL> site ( " grape tomatoes have thicker skin , lower water content and intense sweetness " ) . It also states " a grape tomato is half the size of a cherry tomato " , so perhaps they are smaller . Due to the lower water content , grape tomatoes have less chance of ' squirting ' when being bitten into .
White , green , oolong , and black tea are all products of Camellia sinensis leaves and buds , the only difference is how they are processed . You can turn the plant matter into any of the varieties . Different sources will give different accounts of the processing steps , but in rough order of least-to-most processed : White tea is minimally processed and not oxidized , meaning it retains the natural antioxidants , but does not develop as much flavor , color , or caffeine . Sweet or flowery flavors are characteristic . ( Chinese Silver needle white tea ) Green tea has a minimal amount of oxidation , halted by additional pan-frying ( Chinese teas ) or steaming ( Japanese ) steps . The additional processing brings out more flavor , and allows for caffeine to develop , at the cost of a reduction in antioxidants . Characteristic flavors are grassy , vegetal , and earthy , with sweet notes . ( Japanese Sencha ) Oolong tea gets partial fermentation , and often an additional shaking/bruising step that release additional flavors . Oolong can range in color from dark green to black . The combination of bruising and partial fermentation give many oolongs distinct flowery &amp; earthy flavors . Darker oolongs may have buttery or smoky tastes to them . It has somewhat more caffeine and less antioxidants than green tea . Tieguanyin or Iron Goddess : ( light oolong ) Black Oolong : ( Wu Yi ) Black tea is fully fermented , which blackens the leaves and causes the formation of caffeine and tannins . It generally possesses the most robust flavor and highest level of caffeine , but the least antioxidants . ( Chinese keemun ) Pu-erh is tea that is pressed into cakes and post-fermented , meaning that after processing and drying it undergoes an additional ripening/fermentation . Microorganisms work on the tea , changing it chemically in a similar fashion to aging cheeses . Traditionally this is accomplished over years in controlled climate conditions ( 10-15 years being ideal ) , but in recent decades a several-month fast ripening process is sometimes used . Pu-erh develops a richer , more complex flavor , and has the widest range of flavors of any of the varieties . Before post-fermentation , it may resemble a white , green , or oolong tea , but the ripening process can impart darker black-tea flavors , giving a unique character . Pu-er Cake Rooibos , sometimes called red tea , is made from another plant entirely , Aspalathus linearis . It is a traditional South African infusion , prepared like a black tea but without caffeine . There are two varieties , green and red . Green is un-oxidized , where red is oxidized . Rooibos is characterized by a sweet , woody/malty flavor . Health-wise , it is a source of anti-oxidants , may aid in digestion , and some say it may aid with nervous tension and allergies . Yerba mate is from the South American plant Ilex paraguariensis , whose leaves are steeped like tea . It is generally toasted in processing , and produces a brew with caffeine similar to coffee . Despite its caffeine , mate is actually relaxing to smooth muscles , so you do n't get jitters , and it also helps control appetite . The flavor is vegetal and herbal , and can be bitter if brewed hot . Although it contains antioxidants , this is balanced by traces of carcinogens from the toasting , and the jury is still out on whether mate overall increases or decreases cancer rates . Tisanes or herbal infusions these are various blends of dried herbs , fruits , spices , and flowers which are steeped like teas , but do not contain tea leaves . Generally , the ingredients are dried , although fresh ingredients can be used too . To confuse matters further , black and green teas may also have flavorings added to them , giving a similar result .
Yes , a grill pan will help some , for the very reason you have already identified in the question . Another advantage to a grill pan is charming grill marks . I do n't think that 's your best solution . If you like a serious sear on your steak , I do n't think you can do better than a wickedly hot cast-iron skillet . ( more on that : <URL> ) To mitigate spatter , I recommend a <URL> . The surface is a fine mesh screen , it allows free exchange of air , but holds grease in the pan and away from your walls .
You should n't heat a non stick pan without the oil , because it is too easy to overheat it and ruin the coating . So , I put oil inside first , and tell by the state of the oil . It smells , looks and flows different when it is hot enough . You can also learn to judge if there is sufficient heat when you hold your palm at a given distance above the pan , but in my experience , you learn to judge by the oil before you have gotten good enough to keep the same distance and to distinguish " enough " from " not enough " heat . If you do n't have enough experience to know when the oil is ready , you have to do it repeatedly until you learn it . It takes a few less-than-great meals if you do it purely by trial and error , and goes better if you use an infrared thermometer . You can also try floating cubes of stale white bread and watch their browning behavior , but I find this method too involved logistically - you have to have the bread , cut it , then deal with messy pieces of oily bread , and end up with slowly charring crumbles in your pan .

What is a good resource for learning about Molecular Gastronomy ?
<URL> is a fantastic resource , and has probably <URL> out there at the moment . There 's also a lot of good stuff at the French Cullinary Institute 's <URL> . They 've got <URL> that 's quite enlightening . I actually disagree on the McGee recommendations . While it 's an excellent book , full of great info , I do n't think it 's a good starting point for molecular gastronomy ( in the sense of the cooking movement rather than the more literal sense )
Try cooking tomato sauce in a cast-iron pan some time ... You 'll learn a whole new meaning for " irony " . A non-reactive pan is one that allows you to cook or store acidic foods without dissolving , leaching , or otherwise causing contamination . Good materials for such pans include glass , stainless steel , food-grade plastic , ceramic , porcelain , and hard anodized aluminum . Bad materials include cast-iron , copper , and aluminum . Plastic bowls should be fine for most purposes , however keep in mind that small scratches in the plastic may harbor contaminants that will be freed by the acid . So clean them well , or switch to glass .
<URL> states that one cake is the equivalent to one packet of dried yeast ( 0.25 oz or 2.25 tsp ) : One ( 1/4-ounce ) yeast packet of dry yeast OR 1 cake fresh , compressed yeast EQUALS 2 - 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast ( active dry or instant active dry )
In the normal cooking time of a quiche ( 20 to 30 minutes ) , the crust does n't really get soggy from the filling , even if it is quite liquid , as is expected for quiche Lorraine . So , you can without problem cook your quiche without first blind-baking the crust . The difference will be in the crispness of the crust : if you try to get it crispy , you should prebake , if you do n't mind it being rather , well , " plain " , you do n't . The only real reason for me to blind-bake a crust is when you put something on it that wo n't be cooked ( tartelettes ) , that will only get grilled or that will be baked less that it would require to bake the crust ( meringue tart ) . Most of these examples are fruit tarts , however .
Clean your potatoes . Peel if desired . Slice in half , lengthways . Place flat sides down on your cutting board . Cut again in half , lengthways . This would be for very large wedges . For slightly smaller , cut in thirds , lengthways , on a 60 degree angle , from the outside of the potato to the centre line where it hits the cutting board . For even smaller , slice in half again after the second half cut .
The short answer is that good quality chocolate has a high proportion of cocoa constituents with little or no substitution . What to look for : High cocoa solids content . Chocolate with less than 50 % cocoa solids will have little real chocolate taste and those with more than 70 % will have a much more complex and fine chocolate taste . Cocoa butter content . Chocolate makers tend to substitute vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to reduce costs . Cocoa butter prices have increased in recent years due to demand in the cosmetics industry . Smooth texture . This comes from the cocoa spending a longer period being crushed in the concher . Conversely , these are indications of a poor quality chocolate : Low proportion of cocoa solids Use of vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter Chocolates with low cocoa solids content , such as milk chocolate , are usually inappropriate for baking due to their proportionally low chocolate flavor . Baking cocoa powder itself is in fact just another word for cocoa solids , and this is why it is favored when baking : it is the pure chocolate flavor . The milk constituents of milk chocolate may also go rancid , giving the chocolate a ' bad olive oil ' taste as described <URL> . In this image the cocoa solids go up from 0 % in white chocolate to a maximum of 100 % in the highest of quality chocolates . As white chocolate contains no cocoa solids , look instead for cocoa butter and vanilla in place of vegetable oils and vanilla extract .
Poolish is a type of <URL> . You prepare it before mixing your dough . As in 16 hours before . Then , you mix it with the rest of the ingredients . What I usually do is mix 150g of flour and 150g of water with a pinch of yeast ( less than 1g ) and no salt at all the night before the day I 'm going to use it . The idea is to use the same amount , in weight , of flour and water , and the least amount possible of yeast and let it work as slow as possible . This will depend on many factors . I 'm giving you my quantities , but it changes from winter to summer , you will have to experiment . That 's half of the fun . For the mixing I use a fork and a 1 litter/quarter container and 30 seconds of work , it should n't take you more . The poolish usually gets almost to the top in 14-18 hours . Once I put 5g of yeast and got to the top in 1 hour . This is not bad but defies the purpose of the poolish taking a lot of time . Some people even put in the refrigerator to make it take longer . Why would you want it to take time ? This is what I was told and makes sense to me : when you mix water , flour and yeast two things happen : the yeast transform the sugars and some good bacteria starts creating acids that will determine flavour . The yeast work depends on the temperature and amount of yeast ( among other things , like water , salt , fat , etc ) . The bacteria does n't . Also , the bacteria and the acids help preserve the bread . Once it has reached the top you have 1 hour approx to use it . If not , it will collapse and you better start with a new one . If you think you are not going to use it in 1 hour , use a fork to degass it before it collapses and let it rise again . It will rise faster this time , but that will buy you some time . You can <URL> If you have a recipe you like , try replacing 150g flour and 150g water with the poolish and see what happens . You may replace between 10 % and 50 % of the final dough . You 'll see changes in color and flavor .
I 've come across two great , and very different , types of steak . The first is typical in Argentina and is not aged at all , but from a young calf ( 6-10 months old ) , free ranging and grass fed ( hence not like classic veal ) . This is really juicy , tender , and with a very " bright " taste . Good high-end Argentine restaurants usually serve meat like this , and in the UK you can order it from pampasplains.com , which I think is great . The second is from an older cow and dry aged to tenderize , but the aging also gives it a deeper , more bone marrow-like flavour . The best I 've had of this type was a cow from Limousin in France , served in Paris at a small restaurant called Le Sèvero ( 8 rue des Plantes , 14th Arrondissment , reviewed in the NY Times a while ago ) . It was amazing ! In London , 32 Great Queen St 's " Hereford beef " is a similar style and also excellent . They get it from a Hereford farmer called Tom Jones ( seriously ) , who serves several restaurants . Good steak should never be marinated in anything - all it needs before cooking is salt , maybe pepper if you like ( though I sometimes eat it with Coleman 's English mustard ) . I 'm fairly sure that grass-only feed is important to good meat , i.e. no cereal-based fattening-up , though it 's hard to separately test this one variable . Breed also clearly matters ( all Argentine beef seems to be Aberdeen Angus or Hereford ) . I love a nicely marbled , fatty steak like the ribeye , but my ( Argentine ) wife prefers leaner cuts like sirloin and filet - clearly a matter of taste .
You can proof your yeast to see if its still alive : Heat approx . 1/2 cup ( 100ml ) of water to about 115 ° F ( 45 ° C ) . Add a tablespoon ( 10g ) or so of sugar , stir . Water should still be above 105 ° F ( 40 ° C ) . Add a teaspoon of yeast , stir . Within 5 minutes or so , the mixture should be thoroughly foamy . If its not thoroughly foamy , yeast is bad ( dead ) , dispose of it . ( Note : Metric conversions above are rounded , just like the imperial units . Do n't use these conversions for baking , but proofing yeast does n't need anything exact . )
Roast Date Coffee starts to degrade fairly quickly . If you can find someone who roasts locally , that 's ideal . The closer you are to the roaster , the less shipping and handling and the more likely you are to get quality coffee . If a company is roasting something to be shipped nation wide , they have to make certain sacrifices . So like @Max said , look for a Roast Date . Within the last week or two is ideal , a couple months is decent . Origin For places like Tim Hortons ( Canada ) , McDonalds or Starbucks , they are looking for a very consistent taste every time . This is easier to do with a Darker Roast as you hide some of the nuances of specific crops . Often these will be from multiple origins to " blend " to a consistent taste . There are still many acceptable coffees that are blended like this . However , if you look at many of the Artisianal Coffee Places , they often tend to go for a light or medium Roast . They 'll also tend to advertise a specifc farm and country . The reason for this is that with a lighter roast you can taste more of those specific notes in the bean . Some places in my opinion go to far and under roast it . I find in this case it actually comes across as overly sour . So this is entirely up to you what you prefer or are used to . Packaging You want something that was vacuum sealed at the roaster . Coffee reacts with oxygen and degrades as soon as it 's roasted . Vacuum sealing it immediately , slows down that process . So this means avoid anything in a bulk bin in a coffee shop or grocery store . You also want to buy something that is a whole bean . As soon as you grind it , it also starts to degrade ( within minutes ) . You can find a ceramic burr hand grinder for about $ 30 . Personal Notes ... For me , I have a few local roasters that I really like , but for my daily cup I ca n't afford to buy them regularly either . So basically , I look semi-local ( for me it 's anything in western Canada ) for a medium roast from a company that can tell me where they got their bean . I look for words like " single origin " and " fair trade " and yes , even " organic " . I do n't actually care if it 's Organic , but I 've found these companies often care about their product more . When I get the coffee I like to be able to taste something unique in it . I 'm not sitting here looking for " hmmm this tastes of elderberries and caramel by the ocean in the fall ... " that 's a little too much for me . That said , if it just tastes like generic " coffee " , then I 'm not really interested . Not to say that any of this guarantees their quality ... so buyer beware . I do n't think specific brands fits with this site , as it 's too specialized/localized , but hopefully that gives you something to look out for .
You ca n't just pick up any old wood chips but you can get ones for cooking at the hardware store . Even Home Depot or Lowes should have wood-for-smoking available . You have to be careful since if you get chips made out of treated lumber for example the resulting smoke could be poisonous . Probably not something you want to eat . You also want to avoid poisonous wood or trees . Warnings aside , you can use just about any non-poisonous hardwood to make woodchips . Just make chunks or chips out of nice dry seasoned logs . Usually , people use wood with interesting favors to add such as fruit tree woods ( apple , pear , cherry ) . Other popular woods are mesquite , hickory , or maple .
Basically , a chutney is a kind of savoury jam . This is a very simplistic definition though . The main differences between jam and chutney are as follows : The preservation in jam is only by sugar . In chutney , vinegar and sugar are used together , so chutneys are not necessarily sweet . Jam is almost always made with fruit as the main ingredient . In chutney , fruit can be used , but so can vegetables . Also , chutneys tend to be a mix of more than one thing . For example , an apple chutney will have plenty of apples , but also swede and onion in it . Jams usually do not add other flavours to the fruit and sugar ( pectin is for texture ) . Chutneys are usually flavoured with several spices , as well as chili peppers , onions and garlic . In the Indian subcontinent , chutneys are served along with the meal in small amounts , as a condiment to add to the meal . They are usually eaten with the blander side/starter dishes like pakoras or samosas , rather than with the spicy and flavourful main dishes . In the rest of the former British Empire , and particularly in England , it is eaten on bread , with butter or cheese , in a similar way to jam or pickle . Note that what the English call pickle is also a sort of savoury jam , not pickled cucumbers like in America .
A cold/delayed ferment does several things : Allows for more complete hydration of the starches , and more gluten development . An enzyme called protease , which is naturally occurring the flour , breaks some of the long gluten bonds , making the dough more extensible . ( This is not in conflict with the first reaction , it just controls the gluten length ) . Creates flavors through alpha-amylase action converting starches to sugars . The first two items are lumped into the term autolyse , which can be done in time frames of anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours . The third item of a cold ferment gets more complex ... Additional enzymes ( alpha-amylase enzymes ) that come along with the flour , yeast , other ingredients added to the flour ( malt powders ) , or grain mashes , perform a set of reactions that break starch molecules into sugars . This reaction is what turns malted grain from starchy soup to sweet liquid in the beer-making process of " mashing " . These sugars both add flavor of their own , caramelize to create new flavors , and feed the yeast creating even NEW flavors . The trick , and reason it is cold , is that the yeast contribute valuable enzymes to this process , but can be too energetic . If they are allowed to ferment wildly they would likely over-leaven the bread . The cool temperatures slow the enzymes down as well , but not as much as the yeast , letting the enzymes catch up with the process . Now - no part of this process is dogma . There are people who cold-rest their dough and THEN add yeast the next day . Problem here is that you need to allow at least 6 hours at room temperature for the yeast to catch up , and it is hard to integrate yeast into pre-made dough . The results can be similar , but the scheduling is awkward . Other variations include cold resting only part of the dough , or making a liquid " soaker " that includes some mashed grain , allowing that to sit at room temperature without yeast , which is then integrated into the main dough on the day of baking . Cold-resting dough is also a practical matter - once the dough is mixed and resting , if it spends 12 or 36 hours in the fridge , it does n't matter too much , and once it is pulled out , only requires a few hours to come back to temperature , final proof , and bake . It sounds like a slower way to make bread , but personally , splitting the process into two days makes it easier to fit into a busy life - I start the dough on one day , then the next day ( or two or three days later , if I get busy ) , I can pull the dough after work , proof and bake for a late dinner that evening . The flavor and dough development are icing on the cake . To really dive into this process and what drives it , check out Peter Reinhart 's books " Bread Baker 's Apprentice " and " Whole Grain Breads " , both of which go into the process in great detail , and are excellent reads for anyone wanting to improve their baking . It includes a lot of the science , and enough background information to make you feel comfortable with what you are doing , and comfortable experimenting on your own with variations to the process .
It 's not a " cheat sheet " , and is rather too big to stick to your fridge , but I highly recommend the book <URL> , which is an encyclopedia of exactly these associations . What ingredients does any particular ingredient go with ? How do you cook it ? Absolutely terrific book !
Admittedly I have only stored my starter in a glass jar , but I would n't want anything else . You should look for a size that is neither too large , nor too small . It should comfortably hold your sourdough starter when you are simply feeding it - I usually store 200g of starter , at 100 % hydration ( 100g flour , 100g water ) or thereabouts . However , when actually making sourdough starter you make more - perhaps 400g or so , depending on how much bread you are making , plus you want to have something left to restart your bread . A typical recipe might call for 20 % starter , so 200g for a kilo loaf . The other solution is to of course have two separate jars , and only use both when doubling for bread . When I say it must be able to hold that much , I mean that it will have to hold it fully risen , which means around 2x to 2.5 x of the original size . In addition , narrow and high is better than low and wide , since it makes it easier to tell how much it rises . Also , you will want a wide opening , so that you can easily clean it . As for covering it , I just use a sheet of plastic . Just take care not to get it gooey . It will hold in the moisture so the sourdough does n't dry out , but wo n't trap the carbon dioxide . Good luck
Liquid vanilla extract has alcohol in it , so if you add this extract to hot cocoa , puddings , fudge , or anything you make with heat , the alcohol burns off and so does most of the flavor . If you wait for it to cool off the flavor stays strong . Same thing goes for artificial vanilla also because of the alcohol levels ( but the flavor is just not there to begin with with artificial flavor ) . If you use vanilla beans , open up the pod and scrape the inside of it and put it in the beginning with the hot mix . That is another story . It is very delicious , but you see teeny tiny little beans swimming in your lighter mixes like vanilla bean ice cream .
There is no substitute for salt . Sorry . It has effects on the tastebuds and the body that can not be replicated . However ! They can be approached to a degree that most people will find interchangeable . Acids can mimic the flavour-enhancing qualities of salt in a big way . The more acid you have in a dish , the less salt you will need . Beware of going too far , of course , as too much acid is just unpleasant and will need salt to counterbalance . Heat -- as in capsaicin , chili peppers -- can produce much the same effect . Echoing papin 's information above ; NA and K ( sodium and potassium ) exist in balance in the body . Too far in one direction and you have a heart attack ( too much K ) , too much in the other and ( if memory serves ; I could be wrong ) you essentially drown ( or is it edema ? I ca n't remember ) . If avoiding sodium is related to a health concern , please speak to your primary healthcare provider before adjusting your diet in this way .
I ca n't give you a list with good substitutes for common dishes . First , I doubt that my common dishes are your common dishes . Second , it would be too long . If you want to substitute alcohol in a dish , you have to understand what it does in the specific recipe , and then use your imagination to think of an ingredient which will have a similar effect . Alcohol has mostly three effects in a dish . First , it is a liquid , and its bulk must be considered . In recipes where the ratio is important ( mainly batters ) , if you leave out the alcohol , you have to add some other liquid to maintain the original ratio . Second , alcohol adds its own taste . A small part of it is the taste of the ethanol itself , but cooks mostly use beverages with a strong taste of their own as a component of the dish . Third , alcohol is a solvent . It can get more taste out of your other ingredients than pure water . ( Ever wondered why vanilla extract is alcohol based ? ) This is especially important in recipes which give it a longer time to interact with the other ingredients , such as the slow boiling of a coq au vin . Depending on which of these effects are important to you , you have different options to act . Just leave it out . If you are n't baking , you probably are n't that interested in the ratio . And if you expect the result to taste well enough without the alcohol , the simplest solution is to skip it . Use a liquid substitute . This is especially important in baking and confectionery , but you can decide to do it in any case . Depending on the original kind of alcohol and taste you are aiming for , you can use pure water , a liquid trying to stay close to the original taste , or a liquid which gives a completely new taste profile to the whole recipe . For example , in a sweet dish like your foster dessert you can use caramel dissolved in apple juice instead of dark rum if you want to mimic the original , or cherry juice to create a cherry-banana dessert . Common liquids to use are sugared water ( when the original recipe had a sweet liquor ) , a fruit or vegetable juice , a herbal infusion , clear stock , or pickle liquid . Do n't be afraid to use more than one liquid to get closer to the effect you want . If the recipe already uses some other liquid , you can just use more of it . Use a spice or condiment . This is when your main concern is the taste , and you do n't care about the missing liquid . Again , you could be trying to mime the original closely ( using orange zest instead of Grand Marnier ) , or just using any strong spice so the dish does n't become bland . It is up to you . A special case is to use only a taste " essence " : for some beverages common in baking , you can buy a propylene-glycol based condiment which approximates their aroma . Rum essence is widely available , but I 'm quite sure that the whiskey flavored ice cream in the supermarket is n't full of real whiskey . Leave the alcohol in the recipe ( possibly reduced ) . Obviously impossible in some circumstances , like a wine sauce , but quite feasible in others . You do n't have to drown the dessert in rum and flambe it . If you use 20 ml of rum per 1000 g of other ingredients , a child who eats a normal serving ( 150 g ) will consume somewhat less than 1.2 g of ethanol if no alcohol at all is cooked out - and in practice , if the recipe calls for cooking , maybe half of the alcohol will evaporate , and a very young child will probably not eat the whole serving . I do n't think that such miniscule amounts are problematic for children . Of course , you are free to combine these solutions in any way you see fit , depending on which effect ( s ) of alcohol you are trying to imitate . For example , if a baking recipe calls for 50 ml of calvados , use 15 ml of calvados , 35 ml of apple juice , and a breath of powdered cinnamon . Or baste a roast with a mix of tomato and carrot juice instead of red wine . The possibilities are endless , you just have to be clear on why you are choosing whatever you are choosing .
In the cowboy days , the people traveling through the western desert would carry canvas sacks which they would fill with water . The water would seep through the canvas very slowly , and wet the surface of the bag . Evaporative cooling would then keep the water cold ( at least cooler ) . You could try something similar if you are in a dry climate ( the rate of evaporation determines the cooling effect , which is limited by the relative humidity ) . Wrap the food or drink in wet cloth , and hang or set in a shady location with some wind . Keep the wrapping wet .
Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom , along with cinnamon and cocoa . Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world , not just in India . If you have reason to want to try this particular recipe , then try the recipe as written . There are thousands of beloved recipes for all kinds of chili . There is no reason to say , " That one looks good , I 'll do it just like that but omit a certain ingredient 'cause it makes me nervous . " Your friend 's advice is a bit odd to me because Garam Masala usually contains cardamom ( sometimes black , green and brown ) My advice is to either try the recipe as written , or find another with which you 're more comfortable . Or come up with your own . There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chili . BTW , I love cardamom in savory . I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup ( Pho ) that I crave if I have n't had it for a while . It would n't be right without cardamom .

What is the correct flour , sugar , butter ratio for crumble ?
There is no single ideal . More sugar and butter will mean a more crunchy crumble top ( and one that browns or burns more quickly ) , more flour will make it more sandy - they each have their place . The juicier the fruit , the sandier I like the topping to absorb some of the juice . The longer the fruit needs to cook , the more resilient to cooking the topping needs to be . And of course for a tart fruit like rhubarb , you might like more sugar in the topping to balance it - or you might just add sugar to the fruit and leave the topping alone . My goto mix is 1 cup flour , 1 cup sugar , 1/2 cup butter . But play with it a bit and vary it according to the fruit you are using - and I do n't just mean " rhubarb " or " apples " but taste a bit of today 's fruit to see how sweet it is , how soft it is , etc. .
There is no real difference between types of granulated , white sugar . The options you are likely to see are cane sugar and beet sugar . Granulated sugar from sugarcane is often considered " superior " to beet sugar by Americans , but the idea that cane sugar is in any way superior to beet sugar has no basis . Granulated beet sugar and granulated cane sugar are completely interchangeable and indistinguishable . Swapping them will cause no issue . By the way - this is sugarcane : <URL> These are sugar beets : <URL> I 'd post a picture of the granulated sugar made from each , but it seems kind of pointless as they look the same . <URL> On this question ( almost an exact duplicate ) , some posters see a small difference . I never have . <URL>

Pros : Higher smoking point . Regular butter 's smoking point is 325-375F while clarified butter is around 485F . But it can still smoke and burn ! However the higher smoking point means it 'll be much more applicable in terms of sauteing food without worrying about burning the butter . 100 % fat . Often times its hard to calculate the exact replacements in baking when you want to replace a fat with butter because regular butter is n't 100 % fat . Using regular butter , you would need to factor in how much extra water you are introducing into the recipe . Longer shelf life . Without the water and milk solids , the shelf life of the clarified butter will be much longer . Can even be stored without refrigeration . Cons : Less buttery flavor . The milk solids that you are removing makes up a lot of butter 's flavor . By removing this , you are removing flavor .
Essentially , food pathogens can not grow below 4.0 pH and vinegar is significantly more acidic that that . If you go <URL> and scroll down a bit , there is a good , succinct explanation . They use brines of 38 and 44 percent vinegar " for taste and safety " . With this basic information , it would be easy to create brines that are safe and suite your taste . You really do n't need salt , sugar , spices or herbs for safety for vinegar pickles ( though you do need salt for lacto-fermented pickles ) . The acidity alone will do it . Of course , you probably want your pickles to taste good , so those other ingredients will be necessary . I should also add , that the site I linked to adds a cook step . This makes the pickles safe immediately after cooking . Without a cook step , the pickles will become safe over time , as the vinegar permeates the product , but may not be safe immediately . It seems that the addition of a low temperature cook step is an interesting innovation that improves safety and the ability to maintain a crunchy product .
Just as with kneading , stirring develops the gluten in the flour . over-mixing batter is a culinary no-no ( fr . non-non ) . Batters are frequently rested in the refrigerator so the gluten can relax . Foods fried in batter that has been overworked and deprived of adequate rest is like a chef exposed to the same conditions -- tough and tired . Whole wheat flour has considerable difficulty developing its gluten potential because when the outer coat ( bran ) is ground up and combined with the starchy endosperm , sharp particles of bran chop up the strands of gluten as they attempt to form . So the very quality that makes whole wheat flour such a ' pain ' in the ass for bread making makes it highly useful for batters . Whole wheat has practically become my default flour . It 's fine for dusting food articles on their way to the sauté pan , and for making roux . But bear in mind that you may need to use a little more roux than before to achieve a given degree of thickening . That 's because the bran coat displaces a small portion of the starchy endosperm .
The smoky flavour of barbecued foods is best achieved through burning lump charcoal or hardwood . In the scenario you 're describing , yes , burning hardwood and then cooking over the coals would give you a smoky flavour Store bought briquettes actually probably give you less of a smoky flavour because instead of using wood , many briquettes use other materials/binders that do n't give you the smoky flavour you want .
-18 ° C ( -0.4 ° F ) is not too low for storage ( as this would be the normal temperature of a <URL> , where I store my ice cream and frozen yogurt . I definitely would n't set the temperature higher if I store also other stuff in the same freezer ) . For serving you would probably want to let it sit out a little bit , so that it softens up a little so that you can scoop it ( same as with ice cream ) . If it is way too solid , you maybe let it thaw too much before storing . Then , you can fix the texture by re-blending it in a mixer ( you can get even more ideas if you search for recipes on " how to make a frozen yogurt/ice cream without an ice cream maker " - often it involves freezing in an ice cube tray for easier blending ) . Or by thawing it again and using an ice-cream maker to get the desired texture .
Be sure to look at this related question too : <URL> <URL> just kind of took this on . They added some nice flavor to the velveting marinade , and then sauced the chunks after cooking . Some kind of adaptation of that concept would probably work well for you . I have done some small experimentation with adding flavors to the egg/cornstarch marinade , and so far I have n't had any problem . As long as you 've got enough egg white and cornstarch to make a light batter , you can add other things for flavor . BTW , the flavor of the velveting recipe in the question I linked to is lovely .
I 've done this before , and you wo n't get exactly the same cookie as you got before . Confectioner 's sugar is a total bomb . Do n't bother . Dark brown sugar makes darker cookies , with a chewier texture , which keeps longer . This is n't always a bad thing . Several of my cookie recipes I thought were a bit dry were saved by DBS . It added a nice depth to the flavor , as well .
Cakes are where sifting can make a significant difference . See <URL> book , she goes into it in detail .
It depends on the meat and how it 's cut . A ' solid ' uncut piece like a pork loin will take longer to marinade properly than if it was cut into thin strips for stir frying , for example - I 'd want to marinade the former at least 7-8 hours , while the latter could probably get away with 1 .
Peanut butter cookies do n't spread as they cook , so you have to flatten them before hand . This ensures that the middle will cook through before the outside burns . As for the pattern created , it actually creates slightly more surface area , so you 'll get more browning at the extra edges that you create . Think of it like a meringue , or the top of a shepherd 's pie -- if it 's too smooth , you wo n't get the little bits of browned crispy bits that you 'd get if you rough up the surface .
What 's in the picture looks about right . This brand is commonly found in Asian grocery stores around here : ( your mileage may vary ) . It is essentially crystallized cane sugar . If you really ca n't find it , you could probably substitute regular sugar . The flavour is a little different though , as well it is n't a refined white sugar . According to <URL> ( random search ) , there is a difference and the yellow rock sugar often includes a few other sugars ( unrefined brown sugar ) , and that you should n't ever use the clear/white rock sugar for pho .
I am answering my own question with information I have gathered after doing some of my own research . Several hand mills claim to make peanut butter , but the mill that seems to have the best public following and reviews for flour making , the <URL> , does not claim to make peanut butter in their marketing literature . I contacted the manufacturer , and got this reply : We do not recommend doing nut butters in our mill . However , we are applying for patents on a nut butter attachment for the Country Living Mill that does a superlative job . . We hope to have it available by this Fall . We have noticed that other grain mills on the market claim nut grinding ability and even show butter coming out of their mills . We have purchased these mills and tested them and quickly realized that it was an arduous task at best to produce anything resembling nut butter ... we can do the same with out mill but feel that it is misleading and certainly unfair to make such claims . Hope this helps . Of course their answer has every reason to be biased , and not tell me if there is a good peanut butter hand press available on the market . Another popular press , the <URL> claims to make creamy peanut butter with their stainless steel burrs , and one Amazon <URL> agreed it was possible , but too messy to be worth the effort . Reviews of two different griners at <URL> seem to agree with the general consensus that hand-made peanut butter is n't the state of the art ( yet ) : The nuts would n't feed , so I had to mash them into tiny bits . At this point the bits began to feed into the grinding plates . Unfortunately , those bits never exited -- even when I loosened the grinding plates . The only peanut butter that I managed to produce was the goo stuck between the plates . -- <URL> And : My test with peanuts resulted in the grinding plates clogging almost immediately , and I produced only a few flecks of peanut butter during the five minutes of grinding . Many companies claim their handmills will grind nutbutters and oily seeds , but I 've yet to see one that was n't a miserable failure in actuality . -- <URL> I have not been able to find a single first-hand account of making peanut butter with a hand mill that said it was worth it . As already mentioned , the amazon review mentioned above said it was far too messy . Many other reviews I 've found have said the end result only vaguely resembled peanut butter -- and never creamy peanut butter . In an effort to directly answer the question at hand , though , the only feature I so far have been able to find that is required specifically for peanut butter is that the mill have steel burrs , as opposed to stone which are desirable for finely ground flour , as the stone will absorb oil from nuts , causing the system to clog . EDIT : I got an additional reply from the Country Living Grain Mill manufacturers , explaining ( in no great detail ) what is required for a nut-grinder : There are a number of factors such as the mill must reduce the nuts to a manageable size prior to grinding , and propel them with enough pressure to be squeezed out between appropriately designed grinding plates . It sounds simple , but the reality is that it 's a very tricky thing to manage .
There is no standard , it all depends on how happy you want to get , and whether you just want the flavor of the booze , or the actual effect of the alcohol . Also a factor is the kind of alcohol you want to add . Light rums , for example , have less flavor than dark rums , so you 'd want to use dark rum if you want booze flavor over alcohol . As an estimate if you are going for flavor an ounce or two per liter ( or quart , they 're close enough for jazz ) will do the trick , or up to 6 or 8 if you want very happy people . Do n't forget to grate a bit of fresh nutmeg on top before serving !
Here I 'm assuming that you mean macaroons as in the French patisserie <URL> rather than the simpler coconut or almond based <URL> . In any case almond meal and almond flour are essentially the same thing , both are almonds ground into a fine ( or not so much in your case ) ' flour ' or ' powder ' . <URL> , almond flour is made from ' blanched ' ( almonds which have had their skin removed ) almonds whereas almond meal can be made from either almonds with their skins on ( whole ) or ' blanched ' . I have , however , always found them to be used interchangeably . If your problem is graininess , then you could either sieve the ground almonds before using or blitz/grind them finer in a food processor until the desired consistency is reached , however if you 're grinding them in a food processor make sure you do it in small batches or if you 're making macarons blitz them with the icing sugar ( for the tant pour tant ) to avoid making <URL> . Personally , I would do both to achieve a fine powder .
One kitchen I used to work in had a dry store that was basically a shed and in winter when the flour would be particularly cold we would always warm the flour before making bread . It always worked beautifully . The thing is you 're looking for the overall best temperature for your dough for the yeast to be active . So it 's no good mixing warmish water with cold flour - your dough temp will keep the yeast sluggish . That was our theory anyway .
You can absolutely do this . I do it in <URL> , for example . A good trick to boost the flavor even farther is to add non-fat milk powder to the butter as it browns , to supply even more protein for the Maillard reactions .
My preference for sugar work is to either use a pair of rubber-coated cotton gloves like this : <URL> or to use basic cotton gloves and put latex or nitrile disposable gloves over them .

What 's the secret for Chinese fried rice ?
There are really only a few secrets to good fried rice : Day Old <URL> ( Make it the day before , let it cool , place it in the fridge ) This I 'd say is absolutely , the main thing . The texture will NOT be right if you use freshly cooked rice . There will be too much moisture . HEAT ! Your <URL> needs to be hot . You want everything to cook quickly . Cook stuff separately . This is a follow-up from 2 . You want it all to cook very quickly , a crowded pan will hinder that . Cook Meat to 80 % , take it out , cook the other stuff , add the meat back in . Do n't touch it . Unless you have a blazing professional burner , your food needs time against the wok . Put it in , leave it for a bit , mix it some more . Fish Sauce &amp; Chinese Sausage They add great flavour . If it all seems complicated , it really is n't . Use day old rice &amp; give it lots of heat . Here are a couple of recipes that give further detail and have great explanations : <URL> on Steamy Kitchen <URL> on Steamy Kitchen <URL> on Rasa Malaysia
Moderate heat , eggs at room temperature , non-stick egg pan ( 8 " is good , with gently sloping sides ) with a tight lid . Melt butter in the egg pan until it stops foaming . Crack your eggs into a bowl so you 've got more control when you add them to the egg pan . Cook uncovered until just the bottoms of the white are set , the tops of the whites should still be transparent . Add 1Tbs water for two eggs , cover , check after 45 seconds and give the eggs a jiggle to be sure they will slide neatly out of the pan . They may be ready at this point , they may need another 30 seconds to a minute . EDIT : I 'm hungry anyway : My pan is n't ideal , I 'd rather have 8 " , this one is 10 " but it has a lid . My eggs are at room temperature , I have butter ready and a tablespoon of water . A heat-proof rubber spatula is nice to have , but if everything goes right you do n't even need it . I turn the heat to 1 click out of 10 below medium ( YMMV [ Your Mileage May Vary ] ) . After giving the burner and pan a couple of minutes to heat up it should take room temperature butter about 10 seconds to fully melt and another 5 seconds to stop sizzling . One thing that I like about cracking eggs into a bowl first is that it allows me to better center the yolks . The whites should start to become opaque almost immediately , but they should n't take on any brown color or be sizzling hard , just gently . Once the bottoms of the eggs are completely opaque ( this should take less than 30 seconds ) , add the water and cover immediately . Now the eggs are steaming . Fortyfive seconds and a jiggle later they 're just about there ! ( This is when I 'll add salt and pepper , I 'll wait until they 're plated for the hot sauce I ca n't live without . ) 10 more seconds under the lid , slide onto the plate . Voilà , completely set whites , completely runny yolks . OOPS , I forgot the tiny bit of white on top . That 's easy , using a spoon , give the eggs a quick baste of the hot butter before placing the lid . One more quick note : You may notice that I used quite a bit of butter . That 's just personal preference when my jeans are fitting just fine . You may use much less butter if you prefer , another type of fat , or even just a spray of non-stick spray ( Pam ) . If you use a minimum amount of fat , or even none , the " check and jiggle " step becomes even more important . Make sure you can slide the eggs around in the pan . If they 're sticking at all , this is when the heat-proof rubber ( silicone ) spatula can be very helpful .
In my experience , you 'll get the best bacon if you start with a cold pan . Throwing it onto a hot pan sounds impressive ( it sizzles right away ) , but it will also make the bacon shrink/curl up much more and faster . I cook bacon half by look , and half by sound . After you cook it a couple times you 'll see ( hear ) what I mean - the sizzle changes significantly as the fat renders off . I usually flip it as soon as the sound starts to change , and I flip more than once to reduce curling ( unless you have a bacon press , see below ) . If you do n't have one , I recommend a <URL> , especially if you like crispy bacon . It also helps it cook faster . In a pinch , you can use the bottom of a smaller pan - I cook bacon in a 12 " cast iron pan , and use an 8 " pan as the bacon press . If you do n't have a <URL> , you 're going to want one ... ... unless you wanted to cook your bacon in the oven . This is great for large batches , reducing splatter , and unattended bacon cooking . Steps to oven bacon : preheat oven to 400 cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil put bacon on foil , leaving a little space between cook for 12-18 minutes depending on desired crispiness . I lean towards crispier bacon so I usually start watching at 12 , pull it out at 15 . One other note , no matter which method you use , you 're going to want to take the bacon off the heat a minute or so before it 's at the desired crispiness - it will continue to cook slightly after you take it off . There have been a few times I 've made it to my desired doneness , tasted it out of the pan , been very happy with it , moved it to paper towels to drain , tried it a minute later , and it was too crispy . So be aware of that possibility .
I would recommend staying away from a grater and either using a knife or a chocolate chipper ( http://www.amazon.com/Lee-43198-Chocolate-Chipper/dp/B00005NUVX ) . The less friction and the more you keep your hands off it ( because your hand will melt it as you have discovered ) the better .
As a Chinese , who have had many mitten crabs in my life , I think I can provide 2 insights : In Chinese culinary culture , it 's not only meat that 's the most appreciated , but rather the taste , texture and the freshness especially with seafood . Mitten crabs during the autumn season contains a lot of eggs under the shell . The flavour of the eggs are what 's appreciated as well . Mitten crabs ( not sure in the US ) are safe to be consumed from food safety perspective as long as it 's being cooked properly like any other seafood .
Often there 's no secret sauce that restaurants use , but plain old bog-standard sugar . I know it 's boring , but there you go . They also may be using bottled sweet and sour sauce , which is also boring , but readily available in many supermarkets . All is not lost , however , as if you want some more authentic ingredients then there are plenty of options . In my kitchen ( which is n't big enough to satisfy my capacity requirements for exotic ingredients otherwise this list would be bigger ) I have several ingredients which impart sweetness to Asian dishes : Palm sugar : more of a Thai than a Chinese ingredient , but I use it for many different cuisines . It imparts a slightly syrupy flavor . In the UK this can be found in any big grocery store in the Asian section . Sweet soy syrup : Also can be found under the name Kecap Manis , this is an Indonesian ingredient . It is basically teriyaki concentrate , it 's salty , very sweet , and has some spices in it . I use it in all sorts of Asian cooking ( and I sometimes add it to gravy to darken and sweeten it ) , and it would be my choice for the dish you want to make . I would add it instead of soy sauce until I have the sweetness I 'm looking for , then add regular soy to bring the saltiness to the right level . Adding a little bit of water helps loosen it up Honey : not a purely Asian ingredient of course , but honey can be magic anyway . The floral notes may be just what you need Now for the sour : Tamarind : you mentioned tamarind in your post as something to sweeten , but tamarind is actually quite sour . I use paste at home , it lasts forever in the fridge Lime or lemon juice : of the two I prefer lime juice when making Asian cooking sour . I ca n't quite say why . Rice vinegar : This is a very commonly used souring agent , I use it most often in Chinese cooking , and it would be my choice for a fried rice dish Also worth mentioning is Mirin - a reduced-alcohol Sake , usually with a bit of salt added . It 's used widely in Japanese cuisine . I personally do n't use it much , but it 's worth having in the flavor arsenal .
Basmati rice is supposed to flow freely though , if it clumps , you are using it against the norm and should probably stick with a stickier rice . Usually Basmati is used Pilau style , or in a Biryiani , then the grains are slightly coated in some form of fat ( oil , ghee , etc ) , so the starch you would definitely want rid of .
It sounds kinda similar to <URL> , but that is usually made with extra sweeteners added to the milk as it is cooked down . You might look at <URL> , which is a Russian food , although it looks like the cooking down is usually less than you describe - that is , it may produce a brown crust , but the bulk of the milk is perhaps still creamy in color . You could look at <URL> or <URL> , which are made by cooking milk down into a evaporated , caramelized brown sauce . It looks like both are usually sweetened during or after cooking , but since the sugar is added later in the process , with other flavorings to taste , I see no reason that sweetening might not equally be omitted if the flavor is enough for whoever is making it . An interesting sort of match comes from <URL> , which was made by cooking down whey into a brown sauce ( Norwegian <URL> and Swedish <URL> are variations of this ) - but more recently cream and sometimes milk was added to the whey for a fattier end product . I could see someone cutting out half the process by making something similar with only milk , instead of some balance of whey plus cream . As a bonus , I do n't believe these products usually have added sweetener , so that might be a closer match . Honestly , there are a lot more variants where there is sugar or other sweeteners added to the milk while it cooks down and caramelizes , or even afterwards to taste , then variations where the milk is cooked down plain . However , there 's no reason why someone might not have adapted one of those recipes to omit the extra sugar for various reasons , so go ahead and figure out which name ( or tradition ) seems most in line with what your friend makes .
Use only good beef , salt and pepper . The beef should be a good fatty cut , with a ratio of 80 % meat , 20 % fat . Chuck is ideal . Any good butcher should grind it to order for you . You need to keep the ground meat as cold as possible , to prevent the fat melting out of it before you cook it . Do not salt the beef prior to shaping , just use pepper . Shape your burgers , then put them in the fridge for a couple of hours . Generously salt the outside of the burgers about 1 hour before cooking . Get a good pan ( preferably a cast iron griddle ) really , really , really hot . Brush one side of the burger with vegetable oil , then slap it on the grill . DO NOT PRESS IT WITH THE SPATULA , EVER . You squeeze out all the juice . Turn the burger and cook the other side . Timing will depend on how you like your burger . A good way of testing doneness is to insert a thin metal skewer into the centre of the burger from one side ( not the top ) , leave it for a few seconds , then take it out and touch it carefully to your lip . If it 's hot , it 's just about done . Or if you have a good digital thermometer , use that .
If I remember correctly , flautas are made with a softer flour tortilla while taquitos are made with a harder corn tortilla . Both are filled with similar fillings and then wrapped and deep fried . However , you can oftentimes find taquitos made from flour tortillas and flautas made from corn tortillas ... so what 's the deal ? There is another differentiation : size . Flautas are often longer than taquitos , as taquitos are made from taco sized tortillas , while flautas are made from burrito sized tortillas . Another little tidbit if you go to a fancier Mexican place : flautas are often narrower on one side to create a funnel shape . But this is not common in your standard places . TL ; DR ; They 're oftentimes the same thing
The party line from <URL> is to : Cut out the stems , wash , and blanche for about 2 minutes Dry Store in freezer bags with as little air as possible They indicate you will get about a year of storage from this method . That being said , the method you propose is well known for herbs , and kale is certainly much heartier than an herb . It should work very well , given that the application is a smoothie and you do n't mind having the kale pureed already . It should keep the kale usable for a year or so as well . So the main issue with the traditional method is , are you willing to blanche your kale ? I know not everyone is . If you use kale for other dishes and have to blend your daily smoothie anyway , you might use the standard method , and store it in daily sized batches , thus giving you the ability to use it for either a smoothie or some other dish .
What are the best substitutes for arborio risotto rice ? Your best replacement would be another short grain , or in a pinch , medium grain rice . ( if it 's a variety that does n't cook up creamy enough for your liking ... you can cheat and after you remove it from the heat , quickly stir in a beaten egg ) And how about when your only choices are all the local shops have : pearl barley , or ' brown rice with barley and spelt blend ' ? I 'd probably go with the pearl barley , just because it 'll have a more consistent cooking time than a blend . ( so you do n't end up w / little uncooked nuggets in a puddle of overcooked mush . This makes me think pearl barley is the best option . It take a lot more boiling than normal rice ( 40 minutes ) , so I 'll have to half-cook it by boiling before adding it to my pan with stock as my risotto recipe calls for . Do n't pre-cook it . You want to toast your uncooked grains in the oil , just as you would with a rice-based risotto before you add any liquid . If you do n't do this step , <URL> ( I ca n't comment on the texture , as I 've never tried cooking pearl barley this way ) . If you 're reluctant to spend almost an hour in front of the stove , the period to cheat is in the middle ; toast it , do a couple of stock additions w / lots of stirring , then add lots of stock &amp; let it cook , then once it 's nearly dry go back to stirring &amp; slowly adding liquid 'til it 's done ... or <URL>
I would probably use diluted white cranberry juice , as being the flavour closest to rice wine vinegar . I am not sure if the acidity would be sufficient , however ; you may need to add lemon juice . A substitute for soy you will not easily find , as the development of those sorts of flavours requires fermentation .
You can heat clarified butter to a higher temperature for two reasons -- you remove the milk solids , which can burn , and you remove the water , which will boil at 100 ° C and cause spattering . In baking , clarified butter 's lack of water means that it ca n't develop gluten as you would with simple melted butter . It 's actually more similar to other oils than it is to melted butter when baking . In the case of ghee , my understanding is that because it 's from a warm country , part of the reason for making it was as a preservative , as the ghee would have a longer shelf-life ( months ) than standard butter in the local climate .
The following excerpt answers questions 1 and 2 . Additionally it reduces the cooking time for the parboiled rice . Also known as converted rice , parboiled rice has been pressure-steamed and then dried in its natural outer husk ( which is later removed ) . This process hardens the starch in the grains so they remain firmer , less sticky , and separate when cooked . It also forces the vitamins and minerals from the outer layer of the grains into the endosperm , which is the part we eat . This makes parboiled rice a more nutritious option than regular ( unenriched ) white rice , which does n't retain any of the goodness of the nutrient-rich husk . There are several techniques you can use to prevent unprocessed cooked rice from sticking to each other : Use medium to long grain rice . Rinse the rice until the rinsing water is completely clear . Use the Boil and Steam method to cook the rice . In this method boil the rice for 5-10 minutes . Then pour off the excess water and steam the rice for an additional 10 minutes . This method of cooking the rice reduces the most starch on the outside of the rice which is what causes the sticking . Source : <URL>
To expand upon baka 's comment : this would taste good without the cumin too ; it 'd just be a simpler flavor . You can then replace it with any other spice that appeals to you , since pork 's flavor is n't going to strongly clash with many spices . ElendilTheTall 's answer suggests one option ; I 'm sure you can come up with others . This gives you a chance to make your pork fit well with whatever other dishes are in your meal .
Do you mean this one ? <URL> . If so , in Japan it is actually known as <URL> ( meaning pomelo candy ) as shown in this description . Here is a <URL> to how a similar milk version is made ( I think you would use mandarin/pomelo ( bontan ) juice in there somewhere for what you want ) , but it is in Japanese ... Perhaps the pictures will help but ... sorry , I do n't know if it 's ok to translate this ... but it says : milk 500ml , sweet glutinous rice 500g , sugar 500g , mizuame ( maltose ; could use corn syrup instead ) 600g , potato starch 200g , and a tray 31cmx24cmx3 .5 cm . Briefly , it says to soak the rice for half a day , then drain , and blend with the milk for 2-3 mins . Transfer to a pot and simmer on medium heat for 20-30 mins . Add sugar in a few lots , mix until dissolved . Drop to low heat , add mizuame and stir/knead very well - the firmness of the final candy will depend on how long you do this . Dredge tray with a thick layer of potato starch then pour the mixture in . To harden , refrigerate when cool .
My foolproof method is as follows : Weigh out the desired amount of rice - I use 2-3oz per person - and put it in a saucepan . Wash the rice well by filling the pan with cold water , tipping it out , and repeating about 10 times . The more you wash the less the rice sticks together . Put enough water in the pan to cover the rice by about 5-8mm . Leave to soak for 25 minutes until the rice grains have turned opaque white . Put the saucepan over a high heat , uncovered , and bring to a boil . Boil until the water has evaporated and the surface of the rice is dotted with small holes . Turn off the heat . Cover tightly : if the lid is n't a tight fit , place a piece of foil on the pan , then put the lid on . Steam for at least 15 minutes . The beauty of this method is that it does n't matter how long you steam the rice for once it 's past the 15 minute minimum - in fact , the more it steams the better it is , especially if you have added spices or flavourings to the water .
Soy sauce , sake or mirin and sugar are the usual ingredients in a teriyaki sauce . The rice wines in particular are vital for an authentic teriyaki flavour . So the question is somewhat moot : onions are n't usually found in teriyaki sauce anyway . The onions naturally add flavour to your marinade : if you like it , leave them in , if you do n't , take them out . The onions wo n't have any major chemical effect on the marination process . Personally I would ditch the olive oil , replace it with toasted sesame oil and add garlic and ginger for a more rounded and authentically flavoured East Asian marinade .
According to my local friendly butcher , Gammon is a type of bacon that is specifically from the hind quarters . Bacon is defined as any pork that has been cured through a process of salting , either as a dry-cure or a wet-cure where the meat is either packed in salts or brine respectively . With wet curing , other ingredients can be added to impart other flavours , such as beer or sugars . Typically , rashers are made from the body of the pig with streaky bacon coming from the belly , and back bacon coming from , well , the back ( so the same cut as a pork loin chop ) . Bacon joints are typically made by combining cuts of bacon from the shoulder and collar , whilst the hind quarters are sold as gammon with a premium on price . Traditionally ham referred to cooked gammon , although in modern uses , it is often extended to include other cooked bacon joints , which include moulded meats made from combining cuts together with other additives to help bind them .

Omelette cooked in oven or pan ?
Just because the recipe calls it an " omelette " does n't make it one . An omelette starts and ends its cooking in a pan . If you finish it in the oven , it becomes a frittata . ( There are a couple of historic differences , but let 's just stick with that . ) If the egg mixture both starts and finishes in the oven it would probably be a crust-less quiche . The benefits of cooking in the oven is the ability to get more even cooking of the eggs to get a more consistent texture throughout .
Many of the chemicals in food responsible for how a it tastes are also the same ones which , as they escape into the air , give it it 's smell . These oils and aromatic compounds which give many spices their flavour break down or escape over time changeing the taste as they degrade . Some spices stay fresh for a long time once ground , others are well worth ( as you are finding ) doing your self . Many of these compounds react with the oxygen in air to become new ones , these would then potentialy taste stale . Other compounds may break down if light gets to them ; especially natural light as ultraviolet breaks many chemicals down . Other chemicals just evaporate away . All of these reactions depend on surface area ... so the smaller the bits of spice the faster they lose the flavor/smell chemicals . Very fresh powdered spices would n't have this issue . Also if you ground the spices yourself and then left them for a few week/months you would find much of the taste has gone from the powder .
Using a bicarbonate of Soda paste is a good way to clean the oven and does not involve any nasty chemicals . Also , as you need to clean the base of the oven , it can help if you remove the door if it is a drop down door . This makes reaching inside much easier . Most doors are designed to be removed easily . Sometimes your manual will provide instructions on how to remove the door for cleaning . Otherwise this video on <URL> may help as it covers four different types of hinge .
A pizza stone in a normal oven will only get the maximum temperature of the oven ( probably not more than 280 ºC / 530 ºF ) . A specific pizza oven will gett hotter ( the one you linked gets 390 ºC / 735 ºF and , indeed has a stone inside ) . If you want to get Italian style pizzas , go for the pizza oven . They need that high temperature in order to be ready in ( ideally ) 90 seconds . Those Ferrari ovens are one of Italian 's favourite ones , albeit they 'll need a bit more time than 1.5 minutes achievable in wood fired traditional pizza ovens . You ( probably ) wo n't be able to achieve those high temperatures with a normal home kitchen oven , unless you have a pyrolytic home oven , and hack it in order to cook in it during the pyrolysis cycle . As for the waiting time between pizzas using a stone , consider it as a capacitor ( or a rechargeable battery ) : It takes heat ( until is soaked up ) , and then gives it back . Once you make 1 pizza ( or a loaf of bread ) , it needs to soak ( a bit ) again .
Most of the ice creams I 've made have been custard-based , meaning that egg yolks are cooked together with cream and sugar . The mixture is chilled and then churned . For a custard-style ice cream recipe including cocoa powder , the cocoa would likely be dissolved during the cooking step . If you are following a no-cook recipe that includes cocoa powder , I would at least use a whisk to mix the cocoa in as thoroughly as possible . However , dissolving the cocoa in a hot liquid would likely result in a smoother ice cream . Not sure what kind of recipe you are following , but you could probably heat the milk/cream , stir in the cocoa powder to dissolve , then chill the mixture before churning it .
While all of these are large pots ( or may at least come in large sizes ) they have different purposes , which lead to differences in typical construction . Saucepans are intended for general purpose cookery , and usually have solid construction , and permit searing in the pot , reducing , and a variety of other tasks . They are the most difficult to characterize as there is tremendous variation in quality levels and design among the products available . Stock pots are purpose built to make large quantities of stock . Since they are not used for searing typically , and liquids circulate via convection making hot spots not a priority , they are typically constructed from thinner metals ( steal or aluminum ) and do n't have good general purpose cooking qualities . The main virtues in a stock part are low cost , size , and light weight . Dutch ovens ( at least real Dutch ovens ) are a legacy from the time when cooking was done in hearth or campfire . They are designed to be nestled into the coals or embers , with more coals or embers placed on top of the lid , creating a hot oven like interior -- thus the name . True quality Dutch ovens will be fairly thick , usually cast iron , possibly enameled , and may have little legs to help nestle it into the fire above the coals ; similarly , a the lid may actually fit into the pot , allowing coals to easily be piled on top . Dutch overs are actually fairly versatile cooking implements , and can serve for searing , roasting , braising , stewing , biscuit making , soup making , and even some bread applications even in the modern kitchen . Many are large enough to make stock in for home purposes , although they are not absolutely ideal for the task . You will have to ask yourself , given your own cooking patterns , would the general versatility of a dutch oven , or the size of a stock pot serve you better . None of the sets you linked to has a true dutch oven , however ; the one that purports to be a dutch oven has a glass lid ! It might be an okay pot , it is not one I would ever choose . For stainless steel products ( without the specialized legs and concave lid to nest coals in ) , there is very little difference between a dutch oven and a very large sauce pan .
All of the following are generally cooked items : Shrimp , ebi , available raw in sashimi , but almost always lightly poached . The poaching brings out sweet and subtle flavors otherwise masked by a metallic tang . It also prevents the highly perishable shrimp from losing texture to spoilage . Octopus , tako , available raw in sashimi when sliced very thinly , but otherwise poached lightly . The poaching reduces toughness and brings out additional flavors in an otherwise bland meat . Eel , unagi , as you noted , is ALWAYS grilled , and steamed . This is necessary to achieve the truly transcendent flavor and texture of unagi . In fact , the cooking of eel is such a challenge that it is generally a whole separate chef profession in Japan . Most eel comes from one of the professionals , because sushi cooks know they will never be able to match the quality themselves . Improperly cooked eel becomes tough and has unpleasant flavors . Raw , the blood of eels is even toxic ! Sweet egg omelet , tamago , is by definition cooked . This is not to say that raw egg does n't have a place in Japanese food though ; tamago kake gohan is a dish of raw egg on rice , with soy sauce . Cockle is lightly poached Crab , kani is always cooked because ... well eating raw crab meat is just vile . For further reading , I highly suggest the <URL> . Food Safety : Sushi is only prepared from the very freshest and highest quality seafood , and sushi chefs are trained to identify parasites and signs of spoilage . In addition , some areas ( including the EU ) require sushi to be frozen for 24 hours to kill parasites . If that was n't enough to help settle your stomach , the pickled ginger and wasabi served along with sushi are more than garnish or simple condiments ! Both ginger and wasabi have potent and documented anti-microbial and anti-parasite properties . Ginger is also well-known for combatting nausea .

The way to make a proper griddled hamburger : Start with beef that is between 70/30 and 80/20 . You need to use a fatty beef because you are going to be doing a few things that will restrict the amount of juice in the burger and the extra fat will mitigate that . Season your beef and roll into balls less than 1/4 of a pound . Let the size of your patties be determined by the size of your pan , you need them small enough that once you smash you wo n't be touching the sides of the pan . You then want to preheat your pan . You want your pan to be as hot as possible . A commercial griddle can range in heat between 375 F and 650 F , so the temp here can vary quite a bit between places , I find hotter aids crust formation and allows the interior stay closer to medium . Do not use oil . I ca n't stress that enough . Your beef will put out plenty and oil will fry the burger instead of allowing a seared crust to develop . Place your balls of meat on the pan and smash them flat with a spatula . You might need a second spatula to remove the patty from the smashing one , as you lack the space space to heat it like you would on a griddle to prevent sticking . Allow it to cook about two to three minutes , then flip and top with cheese , if desired . Two more minutes and remove . As an added bonus , you can toast/fry some bread in the beef juices to create a patty melt style burger that will be oozing beefy goodness . You can drop the bread in right after the flip and it will be perfect by the time the patty is done .
Possible reasons : Horrible temperature control - this is simply a problem of cheap construction . One could theoretically build an excellent toaster oven with precise temperature control , but why would you ? Low thermal mass - If you get an oven to 400F and open it for long enough to put in food , the result is an oven at very slightly less than 400F , and which will quickly return to 400F . Do that with a toaster oven , and who knows what temperature you 'll get , or how quickly it will get to your desired temperature ( if ever , see # 1 ) . This is not a slam at toaster ovens , this is just due to them being approximately 2 % of the volume of a standard oven . Closeness to elements . It 's easy for toaster ovens interiors to vary by nearly 50F from middle to edge , simply based on distance to elements Now do n't get me wrong , I once made some kickin ' Oysters Rockefeller in a toaster oven , when I thought that they would be the difference between serving an appetizer and being allowed to serve breakfast the next morning ( wink , wink ) . If you know what you 're doing , and watch carefully and continually , a toaster oven can be an excellent source of high ( ish ) direct heat . But they are extremely difficult to control , and extremely unforgiving of errors . I ca n't think of a circumstance where a toaster oven would be my first choice of cooking tool ( and that includes microwave , campfire , plumber 's blowtorch ) .
Usually it 's best to cook dried noodles in boiling water , and drain and rinse them in cold water when they are done . This does a couple of things : helps ensure that the noodle is equally cooked all the way through ( instead of getting overcooked on the outside by the time the centre is cooked ) . by using separate water , you do n't fill your broth with starch , which would adversely affect the taste , colour and consistency . If you want to add the noodles directly to the broth , I would recommend rinsing them in cold water first ( like you would with rice ) until the water runs clear . This will prevent excess starch from being added to your dish . You could also try adding a stock cube to the water that you boil the noodles in , if your goal is simply to make the noodles more flavourful .
I do n't think it 's just one thing : The foil reflects radiant heat , meaning that the only remaining way to propogate heat is through conduction and convection . The foil is an impermeable barrier which helps to keep the moist air ( created by boiling off the moisture in the surface of the bread ) near the sandwich , which reduces the rate at which the bread dries out , and we need dry items for them to burn . It 's possible that retention of the moisture within the foil slows the heating of the enclosed system as there 's less loss of thermal mass , but I doubt that 's a significant factor in most situations . You might be able to test which of the other two is the more significant factor by running a test with foil that 's been perforated such that it 's not a good barrier but would still be reflective , and see how that compares .
For bacterial spoilage , keeping the soup hot would be more effective . As for " preserving " the soup , refrigeration will be drastically more effective . The high temperatures of simmering would keep the bacterial level pretty much nil , but the constant heat will ruin your soup on it 's own . Anything in the soup will become mush , flavors will become over-concentrated , and some flavors can drastically change from prolonged exposure to such heat . Prompt chilling and cold storage after cooking will greatly slow down the rate at which bacteria can repopulate the soup , and will also keep everything else in the soup about the way it was when the soup was at it 's prime . To really keep textures nice , I 'd recommend pulling off the soup that will be stored while vegetables &amp; meat are still a little firmer than you 'd like so that they 'll finish when you reheat .
First of all , it is extremely rare for the yolk of an egg to become contaminated if the egg is reasonably fresh . Contamination only tends to occur when the egg is quite old and the yolk membrane weakens . ( <URL> ) Now , that said , egg yolks begin to set at a temperature of 62 ° C ( 144 ° F ) , and salmonella can be killed at temperatures as low as 59 ° C ( 138 ° F ) , so it actually is possible to " cook " the yolk sufficiently to kill any bacteria without letting it set , but you have a very small window to work with , so you need to be careful . If the temperature is even 1 ° too low , you 'll just be encouraging the spread of more bacteria , and if it 's even 1 ° too high , you 'll ruin your recipe because the yolk will set . Nevertheless , if you have a reliable , uniform heat source , you could attempt to heat the egg to 60-61 ° C for about 1 minute . Unfortunately , you wo n't be able to use the technique used in other recipes - such as Bavarian cream - of simply using the residual heat of the other wet ingredients to cook the yolk sufficiently for safety while not allowing sufficient time to set . Dark chocolate is the most heat-resistant but will easily burn at temperatures significantly above 50 ° C ( 125 ° F ) . Mixing the chocolate with cream may raise this temperature slightly , and I admit to not being certain of the exact amount , but I 'm pretty sure it wo n't get you up to the required 59 ° C - and it really actually needs to be much higher than that because the temperature must stay that high for several seconds after adding the eggs . So my advice to you is to either : Pre-cook the yolks very carefully to a temperature just below 62 ° C ( use a thermometer ! ) ; or Use very fresh eggs from a reliable source ; or Do n't eat mousse made with egg yolks , if you ca n't tolerate the ( very low ) risk .
It 's going to depend on the material your ramekins are made from . If you have glass ones , maybe they 'll break . But the typical porcelain ones should be fine . Keep in mind they 're used for crème brûlée , which is prepared by chilling to set , followed by topping with some sugar , then caramelizing by either a torch or placing right under a broiler . Cold to broiler or torch is a much bigger thermal shock than cold to cold to oven .
I do n't know that there are studies on using different kinds of kelp with beans , but I have used both kombu strips and kelp granules interchangeably when cooking beans . The results seem to be the same either way .
It 's possible that it 's designed to conduct less heat from the bottom . Many gas ovens have the flue in the bottom and the heating is only from below in the oven . To make things more even , most electric ovens have an element at the top and one on the bottom . Speaking of bottom , the bottom line is that you should be ok . If you find the bottom of you cake not being done very well , move the form to a lower rack next time .
With enameled cast-iron , I do n't bother to heat the pot before adding the oil . For something that 's open-pored , like plain cast-iron or carbon steel ( like an old-school crepe pan ) , it 's better to preheat the pan . I ca n't see any chemical advantage to preheating enameled , as it 's inert and non-porous . Of course everything DOES need to be properly hot before you add the meat . I can take or leave letting my roast get to room temp when doing a braise . It 's going to be in the oven/pot long enough that it 's going to be cooked to 200 + degrees all the way through no matter what . The only possible advantage of letting it warm up on the counter is that it will take marginally less time to cook . And by marginally , I mean you probably wo n't even notice , on the scale of pot roast cooking time . For a steak or a rib roast where you want the middle warm without the outside being totally dry and charred , room temp helps a lot . The only real tip I can give on pot roast is to use the right cut of meat . You want something from the shoulder , which usually means chuck . It has an excellent mix of rich meaty flavor , collagen/connective tissue ( which makes that gelatin thats critical to the silky mouthfeel of pot roast and BBQ ) , and fat . You can also use something from the leg ( shank ) or tail , which also have loads of connective tissue , but they 're usually a little low on actual meat . If you get the right cut of meat and cook it low and long enough to get that collagen rendered , it 's pretty hard to mess up the rest of it .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
Which pan should I use ? Volume of a regular muffins 1/3 cup equals about 79 ml 1/4 cup equals about 60 ml -- > I take the average of both : 70ml per regular muffin Volume of mini muffins 1/8 cup equals about 30 ml 2 tablespoons equal about 20 ml -- > I take the average of both : 25ml per mini muffin Total volume 24 mini muffins ⋅ 25 ml/mini muffin + 4 ⋅ 70 ml/regular muffin = 880 ml = 880 cm ³ batter Using the 8x8 pan 8 " ⋅ 8 " = 20.32 cm ⋅ 20.32 cm ≈ 413 cm ² . Height of the unbaked cake : 880 cm ³ / 413 cm ² ≈ 2 cm ≈ 0,75 " . Using the 9x13 pan 9 " ⋅ 13 " = 22.86 cm ⋅ 33.02 cm ≈ 755 cm ² . Height of the unbaked cake : 800 cm ³ / 755 cm ² ≈ 1 cm ≈ 0,4 inches . I assume that baked muffins will gain the same the volume as the volume of the unbaked batter . Or at least 3/4 of their original volume . The cake without streusel topping in the 8 " x 8 " pan will be 4 cm or 1,5 " thick and the cake in the 9 " x 13 " pan will be 2 cm or 0,8 " thick on the average . After baking , the cake in the 8 " x 8 " pan might look like a <URL> :D After adding streusel topping , I assume you cake will be 1 cm thicker . To prevent extreme doming and to have a shorter baking time I recommend using the 9 " x 13 " pan . Baking time Some receipes in my cook / baking book say that pound cakes backed directly on a sheet pan take about 25 to 30 minutes at 180 ° C / 356F ( in an electric oven ) to de done . You should still check your cake continuously after 15 minutes . image sources : <URL> <URL>
I 've never been one to keep track of cooking times with meats , since it will vary wildly with meat thickness , burner strength and type , phase of the moon , etc. . Edit : I forgot to answer " how to go about searing " . I sear chicken like I sear beef : hard and fast . The point is to get that <URL> going to add some deliciousness and texture ( not to " seal in flavor " , which is hogwash ) . Pat the chicken dry with paper towels . Put just enough oil in a heavy-bottomed pan to cover the bottom . Put the pan over medium-high heat and get it good and hot - the oil may just start showing wisps of smoke . Lay the chicken in the pan carefully , being sure to start at the edge closest to you and lay it down away from you . This will prevent you from getting splashed with hot oil . Let it cook for 2-4 minutes until you get a nice sear on it . Flip , ( the chicken , not you ) again being careful to flip away from you . Now if the breast is thin enough ( <URL> ) , you can just let it finish in the pan . Often , though , after flipping I 'll pop the whole pan into a 400F oven and finish it in there . Again , times will vary , but I would start checking it after 5 minutes . The most accurate way to determine doneness of any meat is with an instant-read thermometer . I love my <URL> , but it 's a bit pricey . You can find inexpensive dial or digital ones at your local grocery . The <URL> is 165F . Normally , I poke my chicken with a finger to determine doneness , then double-check it by cutting it open . Fully-cooked chicken is white all the way through , and the juices run clear when you cut into it . Under-cooked chicken is pink , and the juices run pink as well . I get fresh chicken from a local farm , so I cook it until it is barely done to be sure it stays moist and delicious . For supermarket chicken I would err on the side of completely done , since you have no idea where the meat came from . For reference , fully cooked chicken : Under cooked chicken : Extremely under cooked chicken :

Why is Tsuyu sauce for cold Soba noodles served on the side ?
The simplest reason is texture . The point of cold soba noodles is to taste them at the ideal texture for soba . In a party situation , I 've served cold soba with pre-mixed sauce , and there 's a variant called wanko-soba in some parts of Japan ( particularly Iwate prefecture ) that is often served premixed in small bowls , but unfortunately , this results in the noodles softening fairly quickly . They 'll never be as good as they are when you dip a few strands at a time as you eat them . In fact , hot soba noodles deteriorate in texture as well , but this can be partially mitigated simply by slightly undercooking the noodles , since they will continue to cook in the broth . Since soba is generally a quick lunch in Japan , you 'll notice the quality decline in a hot noodle dish , but you 'll probably eat fast enough to avoid terribly soggy noodles ( unless you 're one of my toddlers , but even they can plow through a bowl of soba faster than they will almost any other food ) . Cold noodles will get soggier , but they will not " cook " , so undercooked noodles are n't practical in that case .
My italian grandma does it , but says to really make sure they dry out . You can dry them out and then freeze them , if it makes you feel any less hesitant .
Personal experience : I have used pots and pans on this and similar grills with no problems . My guess would be , if it says not to use them , it 's probably as you said - for the non-stick coating . There is a <URL> you can buy for the larger models , and perhaps you 're not going to get the most efficient heat transfer by putting it directly on the attached - but that does n't mean it wo n't work at all . Personally , I 'd rather have something slightly less efficient than have to carry two grills . Not sure which model you have ( since you said the portable , I assume <URL> ) , but the LX can handle pots and pans according to <URL> : " Grill lid detaches to make room for large pots or pans . " As far as I can tell , they 're essentially the same grill as far as how they function , just different sizes and features . Just to be safe , I would probably fire it up in your yard before the trip and try cooking something that you would cook on the trip , like a pot of coffee or a can of beans . That way you wo n't have any surprises when you 're deep in the woods and do n't have a backup ! If you are n't comfortable using it after your test , or for any reason , there are other solutions available that are pretty easy to carry . You can get a <URL> , they 're very small and light and easy to pack . There are some that sit directly on top of the propane bottle , but I do n't recommend them - they are very easy to tip , especially if you have children at the campsite . Unrelated to your specific question , but related to camping , I always recommend taking a small cast iron pot or dutch oven of some kind on any camping trip . In a jam ( let 's say you run out of propane ) , you can use that on any fire that you build , even directly on the wood/coals/whatever , and a pot is more versatile than a pan because it can be used for things you said , such as boiling water and making coffee as well as your typical browning , etc. .
I make a sort-of-vinaigrette that I usually use as a salad dressing , but it 'd probably be good with other things . My usual recipe is to halve a few pints of cherry tomatoes , toss them with some sugar and salt , then drain them into a bowl for a while . After they 've drained , I reduce the tomato juice with honey , shallot , dijon mustard , and cider vinegar , let it cool , then add a little olive oil , salt , and pepper .
It becomes quite confusing when talking about the difference between chow mein and lo mein mainly due to the error in translation . In Chinese chow mein literally translate as " fried noodles . " However when buying chow mein at a chinese restaurant , you get vegetables with a side of deep fried noodles . Somehow the title of a dish is referring the to side rather than the main dish which leads to much confusion . When talking about chow mein at a grocery store , it also gets confusing because you can get two types of noodles . The first kind is a fried noodle that looks something like this : This is definitely not what your recipe is referring to . The second type of chow mein you will find is very much similar to lo mein . It should be a raw noodles that is still semi-soft . It should look like this : If the chow mein you have at your grocery store resembles the second type of noodle , then you may use that as a substitute . If it resembles the first type , do n't . The first type is used as a topping sort of like chinese croutons .
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling . This lets the husk soak lots of water . Then place the corn , still in husk , on a hot grill for about 10 minutes , ~ 1/4 turn , 10 minutes , turn ... until the husk gets brown , even burnt . You should be able to tell when the corn is cooked by the smell . The sugars in the corn will start to caramelize and brown in the husk and it will give off a delicious caramel smell . You can check them by peeling down the husk to make sure that they are cooking well . Times will depend on your grill and how much patience you have . In general , it is difficult to overcook . You want to watch out for drying , but that usually takes a while if you soak the ears beforehand . Foil is a poor substitute for the natural wrapper . The husk both protects the cob from too much direct heat as well as holding water close to the cob to gently steam the kernels . And its just prettier with the browned and burnt husk , au natural .
While I found many references to Chinese egg noodles , I did not find much information on Japanese egg noodles . Digging into the edit history of your question , it appears that the actual product you would like to substitute for is <URL> . Their website is parsimonious with information , but does call the product vermicelli , and only indicates that they are made with wheat , and does not mention egg . <URL> , a producer of Asian ingredients for the US market , suggests using suggests substituting Italian style fettuccine or spaghetti for Chinese egg noodles . Putting this all together , you should be able to substitute dried Italian vermicelli , spaghetti , fettuccine or angel hair in the your recipe with good results . Check the package to ensure that the ingredients are only semolina ( and water ) , as some Italian pastas are made with egg ( this is most likely with the fettuccine shape ) . Any non-egg based semolina pasta will be completely cholesterol free . See also : <URL> from Recipe Tips .
It 's a simple matter of viscosity , when eggs are cold the white is less runny . When eggs are warm the white is much more runny . As for whether it is easier to separate eggs when cold or warm it depends on your method . If you use the shells to separate the white , by cracking them in half and then transferring the yolk back and forth between the halves , then I 'd say cold is a bit better because once the white starts to drip out it tends to go as a whole . With warm eggs more white will stay in the shell with the yolk . However , if you use your hands to separate the eggs , by letting the white drip between your fingers ( or using an egg separator which does the same thing ) , warm eggs work much better because the runniness allows them to flow easier . This method works fine for cold eggs too , but warm is faster . Of the two methods I prefer using my hands rather than the shell for a few reasons : Less broken yolks : It 's easier to break a yolk when using shells It 's faster : especially if your eggs are room temperature you can separate eggs twice as fast this way You can whip the whites right away : Most of the time the reason you are separating the egg whites is to whip them into peaks , and warm whites whip better than cold whites . If your eggs are warm already then you can whip them right away , if they are cold you have to wait for them to warm up A handy trick if you are separating a lot of eggs is to separate each white into a separate bowl , then putting the white into a larger bowl with the rest of them . This is so if you get a bad egg , or a yolk breaks into the white you can discard the egg and keep the rest of them .
Pizza sauce is , presumably , whatever tomato-based sauce you 'd put on a pizza . Those tend to be essentially like smooth ( not chunky ) , lightly seasoned spaghetti sauce . If by " plain tomato sauce " you mean a jar of tomato sauce for spaghetti , you 're probably in good shape . If you mean a can of pure tomato sauce , with no other ingredients , you 'll probably want to add some seasoning . Basil and oregano are good bets for herbs ; garlic and onion are also common , and perhaps crushed red pepper if you want a little kick . If you 're looking for a real recipe , <URL> , but search engines will serve you well .
Baking turns bicarbonate of soda into a weak form of lye - sodium carbonate , as you said . It basically makes it a stronger alkali . The actual baking process is safe , but the resulting lye is an irritant and you should avoid getting in on your skin , and definitely avoid it getting it in your eyes . The difference in texture and colour is noticeable after baking . The texture will be finer , and it will be whiter .
It sounds like you may be having temperature control issues . If it 's not dark enough , keep it over low heat for a bit longer . If it 's hardening/burning , it 's probably caused by one of the following : 1 ) your stovetop ( if burner is n't turned low enough or burner is too large and overheats sides of pan ) 2 ) your pan ( easy to burn things if your pan is n't sufficiently thick-bottomed ) 3 ) lack of attention during the carmelization process ( you need to move the sugar towards the center once carmelization begins to prevent burning at the edges , but not stir it too much ) . You might find these <URL> helpful for troubleshooting .
You 've got this all mixed up ! Unless you 're deglazing to do a pan sauce , the steak should be the LAST thing cooked . It 's the centerpiece of the dish and the most expensive part , and should n't have a chance to get cold while you cook the other parts . Saving cleaning on a single saucepan is not worth eating cold steak . You MUST use a stainless or cast-iron for this . As others touch on , teflon is not safe for searing , and fast temperature changes will wreck it . Here 's how to do things : Julienne onions to saute , prepare and measure stock , trim fat from steak , cut or butterfly it if needed ( this is your mise en place ) . Start preheating saute pan for onions Start butter melting in saucepan for roux Prepare roux and saute onions at same time , then add stock to roux , whisk , and season Transfer onions to bowl , cover to keep hot , and start to preheat pan for searing steak Cook steak while finishing sauce as needed , then rest it appropriately Plate steak , garnish , sauce , and serve Alternately , here 's another approach : Mise en place ( prep ingredients , optionally pre-measure them ) Prepare sauce in advance , set aside or keep hot . Or , even do it the day before and reheat it . It 's a roux-based sauce ; it wo n't go bad in the fridge , and will reheat beautifully . Saute onions . Or , caramelize onions beforehand , and just reheat them briefly and add . Cook steak Plate , sauce , serve And , finally the deglazed pan sauce way Mise en place Sautee onions . Set aside in bowl ( or on a serving plate ) Cook steak Throw heavy cream or red wine in to pan , and deglaze by scraping vigorously with a utensil and stirring as it boils vigorously Quickly season this , and throw in the onions , a few pinches of parsley , pepper , salt , garlic , and paprika , plus optionally thyme Congrats , you now have a pan sauce with onions to throw on your steak In a professional kitchen , you 'd have your onions pre-sauteed or sauteeing at the same time as the steak , and your sauce will be prepared in bulk , beforehand . You 'd only have to cook the steak and briefly heat or season the other two parts .
For vegetable knives , the main advantage of the front-side single bevel is that it 's easier to make super-thin cuts . For example , a test of knife skill involves paring daikon radish to remove the peel , then continuing to cut to make a long continuous paper-thin strip , longer than you would be able to make if you just sliced it . See , for example , <URL> People who have mastered this skill can also make remarkably fast matchstick cuts after making the long piece , and the lack of back bevel may reduce the amount of food that sticks to the knife . Some of these single-bevel knives that features a slightly concave backside ( urasuki ) , which may also reduce the amount of adherence of food to the knife . For crab knives , the honing is on the opposite side to the hand ( the back of the knife ) , which may reduce the amount of shell fragments that could embed themselves into the meat , and probably allows the meat to cut more cleanly . In practice , though , most Japanese households use dual-beveled knives . Single-bevel is more common in professional kitchens , especially in the Kansai area where fancy cutting techniques are used in presentation to a greater extent than in Tokyo or north Japan . Although I have a nice nakiri knife and a cheap santoku , both are dual-beveled . Knives meant for cutting regular fish or meat are usually , but not always , dual-beveled , the exception again mostly being for professionals . ( I think yanagiba and sushi knives are usually single-bevel , but are again mostly used in professional kitchens and almost never at home ) . I thought sobakiri and udonkiri were typically single-bevel to help push the cut noodles away , but more recently I am less sure that the single-bevel is as common as I had previously thought for soba or udon knives . The Japanese wikipedia entry for usuba knives suggests that the single-bevel edge is more durable , so , if true , that would be an advantage in high volume restaurant use . In my experience a thin , well sharpened Japanese blade may chip more easily than a thicker blade , so that resonates with me , even though I 'm not 100 % sure the notion that a single bevel is more durable is more than received wisdom . With practice , I think you can get slightly more precision cuts with a single bevel than with dual-bevel knives , however , I do n't think they are as easy to use for cooks with average knife skills .
Baking paper has a silicone coating to prevent sticking . If yours is only coated on one side ( the waxy side ) , this side should touch the food .
The person who wrote <URL> , agrees with you on the 80-100 ° part . However , in his salmon recipe , he advices to smoke below 85 ° . So my guess is that it depends on the food you 're smoking .
Its possible that when you drink a hot liquid , you swish it around your mouth a lot less than when you drink a cold liquid , and thus fewer of the taste buds on your tongue are exposed to it . This would n't be surprising : it 's hot after all . Another possibility is that if you 're starting with hot coffee , and adding sugar to it , that the sugar is n't fully dissolved when you drink it hot ( it takes time , especially if you do n't stir it much ) , but has dissolved by the time the coffee cools . With more dissolved sugar , it is sweeter .
To answer in the language of the question asked : Medium holes with a cutting edge on bottom ( look like large raindrops ) : used for shredding . Small holes with cutting edge on bottom : used for shredding when you want it finer than the larger size . Outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides : used for grating . Wide holes that look like a smiley : used to slice things to an even thickness . As for recipes ... I generally do n't use the slicing portion too often , as I can get fairly consistent slices with a knife , but if you 're not so skilled , it could be used to slice potatoes for an au gratin ( might need to slice them in half first , is the slots are n't wide enough to fit the whole potato ) , or to slice firmer cheeses . It can also be used for slicing cabbage for coleslaw ( again , once cut down to fit ) , cucumbers or carrots for salads , etc. . As the blades are n't razor sharp , there are some softer items ( eg , tomatoes ) that it just wo n't work for , that you 'd have to do by hand or get a much more expensive mandoline . The grating side I only generally use for hard cheeses , when I need a more powdery texture than I can get with the shredding sides . I 've also used it for zesting citrus ( although it only works in large quantities , as you end up losing about 1/2 a lemon to the groves and it does n't release without a brush ** ) , and I 've used it for pulping carrots ( was mixing them into a sauce , and I did n't want identifiable bits ) The shredding sides are the ones I use the most , with the choice of side dependent upon what size I want the resultant shreds . I use it for firmer vegetables and fruits that I 'm baking into breads ( zucchini , carrots , apples ) , potatoes for hash browns , medium cheeses for firmer cheeses ( when I want this texture ) , etc. . Although a food processor can be used for this task , you have to consider a couple things ( besides initial cost &amp; space it takes up ) : it 's really easy to go and shred lots of cheddar cheese in a food processor , but it cramming all in there and fusing back together from the force and heat , defeating the purpose . Chilling the cheese helps , but you also need to keep dumping the work bowl out . If you have a strong arm and a small food processor , a hand shredder might actually be faster and give better results . When using a shredding disk for firmer things , you do more damage than by hand , resulting in lots of liquid being given off . Sometimes , this is better ... I have a potato kugel recipe that comes out very light as I can get more of the liquid out after having gone through the food processor ... so you may want to try both tools ( if you already own them both ) to see which one gives you better results . ** ... I 've heard you can wrap it in plastic wrap , use the grater , and then pull the wrap off to get it to release ; I 've never tried it , in part because I now have a microplane grater , but also because I 'd be afraid of getting bits of plastic in the food . I also want to say that I saw the trick the context of pulping ginger or garlic , but it 's been long enough ago that I do n't know that I can trust my memory
<URL> is a style / kind of a sauce that originated in Napoli usually made with tomatoes , garlic , herbs , and onions . A spaghetti sauce only says where to sauce is used ( obviously on <URL> ) but does n't say anything about what the sauce is exactly like . There are <URL> which are basically spaghetti + sauce : <URL> -- which literally translates to " spaghetti mariner 's style " <URL> -- " spaghetti with garlic and oil " , originated in Napoli <URL> -- " spaghetti whore-style " <URL> -- " spaghetti coal worker 's style " and , uhmmm ... <URL> -- an Italian-American invention
This is the last write-up on the topic , and it 's much simpler : For hand-pulled noodles , you need : Bread flour ( wet gluten 29-30 % , protein 11 % -12 % ) 45 % added water 1 % alkaline solution kansui powder or ( Lye Water + Baking powder ) or Peng or Baking Soda Ingredients ( Alkaline solutions ) kansui powder 55 % sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) , 35 % potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) , 10 % sodium biphosphate dodecahydrate ( NaHPO3 .12 H2O ) Lye Water potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) 74.5 % in 100ml sodium biphosphate ( NaHPO3 ) 3.4 % in 100ml Instant ash Peng sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) 90 % Sodium chloride ( NaCl ) 1.15 % It is recommended to use bread flour because of its higher wet gluten content compared to normal white flour . You will also need a small amount of alkali . One recommendation is to use kansui powder , due to its ph of 11 . If kansui is n't available , the next option would be baking powder and lye water . If either is n't available , the next option would be to use sodium carbonate 1 % of total weight flour weight ( e.g. if you use 100g of flour , use 1g of sodium carbonate ) . If you 're using a lower gluten dough like all-purpose flour , then baking powder will do just fine . If you 're using cake flour , use baking soda . ( Remember to add the kansui/baking soda/baking powder/sodium carbonate to the flour and mix it in before adding water . ) Sodium carbonate vs. potassium carbonate : I 've have n't had success with bread flour , plain flour or all-purpose flour with potassium carbonate . Even though it increases the ph of the dough , it still does not give the dough its stretchability . Why use alkaline solution in the first place ?! Alkaline solution will increase the water absorption and gluten creation of the dough to enable it to be pulled sooner than normal by leaving the dough to rest at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes . The downside of the alkaline solution is that it also breaks down gluten after the peak absorption is achieved . So on one side you have faster absorption but on the other side the dough will become more resilient to pulling if left too long . For a non-alkaline solution , use <URL> . It will cover all the basics that you will need to learn , and you WILL need to use all-purpose flour or plain flour . Noodle flour works best . In conclusion : Without sodium carbonate it 's possible to have hand-pulled noodles with any flour . The downside is you will have to knead the dough for 45 minutes and leave to rest for 2 hours until you can start pulling your noodle strands . Without sodium carbonate the noodles are harder to pull and I had most success with cutting each strand and going from there from the video .
Assuming you 're talking about ggaennip , also known as shiso , it 's quite common to use it raw or salt-pickled . There are two common varieties , red and green-leafed , and to my taste there are some subtle differences between the Korean , Japanese , and maybe Vietnamese varieties . In Korea and Vietnam , ggaennip is frequently used to wrap foods ( ssam bap , for example , or the Vietnamese turmeric crepe ) . Shiso can be used to wrap foods , as a garnish , or chopped and served on some things , like grilled chicken ( yakitori ) as a flavor contrast . I do n't see much point in cooking shiso or yukari , but I 've cooked the red pepper and salt pickled version sold in cans ( or sometimes in the freshly made kimchi section ) by adapting it into a sort of variation on the mediterranean dolma . It retains much of the flavor , but is different than the raw leaf and mellower than just the pickle it starts from . I do appreciate shiso tempura , so I 'm not dogmatic about not-cooking , and there is certainly precedent for some cooked applications . I 've also made an agedashi-doufu , deep fried tofu in soup stock , which had shiso added before it was coated for deep frying . Shiso/gaennip is now popularly used in a drink that has added lemon juice or citric acid , but I 've only seen this as a concentrate or prepared beverage , so it 's possible that it requires some industrial techniques to retain the flavor when making a syrup . Dried salted shiso , called yukari in Japanese , is also used raw , but often mixed into warm rice either as a topping or to make onigiri .

Beer instead of Seltzer in tempura ?
It will produce the same effect , however it might alter the taste ( depending on the type of beer ) , and will almost certainly alter the color of the final product , as beer contains sugars that will increase browning .
The flavor is described as being very mild and unless the recipe calls for a ton of the stuff it is probably being used mostly for color . The color it gives is a yellow-orange . Substitutions used are turmeric , paprika , or a mixture of the two . It was often used itself as a substitution for saffron but of course saffron would be too expensive to make the substitution back . If your recipe does use a lot of annatto ( or you are serving it to people who claim to be able to detect the difference ) then your best bet would probably be to just buy it online . It is a seed so it is n't fragile and ships well . <URL>
It is used extensively in Indian cooking . I have one book , <URL> that calls for it in virtually every recipe , and each time reminds you to cut the amount down by 3/4 's if you ca n't find Yellow Cobra brand . It does indeed have a flavor someone reminiscent of aged garlic . It is thought to have medicinal value as well ( see the wikipedia article for details ) .
Compared to corn starch , arrowroot : Results in a clearer , shinier texture ; Survives the freezing process much better ; and Works better in acidic liquids ( certain sauces , soups , etc. ) Where it does n't work so well is in many fruit pies and some other baked goods ( because it tends to break down under high heat ) , and in dairy dishes ( you 'll end up with a " gooey " texture ) . Use arrowroot in place of corn starch whenever your needs match the above . P.S. . Many people are also allergic to corn , and this is probably one of the most common reasons to use arrowroot . If this applies to you , and you 're making a dish that is not suited to arrowroot , tapioca flour/starch is another great thickener and actually thickens better than corn starch .
From a purist perspective , cabbage is fairly important to the recognizability of the dish by that name ( as well as the pickled matchstick-cut ginger ) . Additional ingredients beyond those two are far more substitutable ( at least from common Japanese perspective ) ; the cabbage actually contributes a fair amount of flavor to an otherwise unremarkable dish . In fact , the presence of a mere two leaves suggests to me this is a pretty small portion . So here 's a " how to avoid substituting " answer , followed by a how to substitute answer . Cabbage tends to survive a good 2 weeks in the refrigerator , so I would n't fret about it too much . It also makes a good garnish , shredded ; additionally , it was super trendy for a few years for izakaya in Japan to serve raw cabbage with miso paste ( sometimes sweetened ) . I know many shops that will even sell a half a head ( in Japan it 's easy to buy even a quarter head of cabbage ) , or you may find a small package of pre-chopped , unseasoned coleslaw mix , which typically contains cabbage and carrots . Finally , cabbage makes an excellent foundation for a vegetarian soup stock , so it 's great way of making sure any surplus does n't go to waste . The only substitutes somewhat consistent with the style of the dish are other variations of cabbage ( bok choy , napa cabbage , possibly kimchi ) or certain crispy roots like kohlrabi . But frankly , those steer the dish into a non-Japanese style of pan-fried noodles . Not that there 's anything wrong with that , but the texture and flavor differences are fairly pronounced . In a pinch , we 've made these substitutions in my home , but in that case it was more about using up available ingredients , rather than trying to find an alternative .
<URL> has a vast amount of information on beer styles . To answer your specific question , an ale is top-fermenting whereas a lager is bottom-fermenting . Lagers are generally fermented at lower temperatures than ales . I believe that lambics would constitute a third category , since they are traditionally fermented by wild yeasts , but opinion may vary on this , I do n't know . There are dozens of styles of ales and lagers and a few different lambics , but the method of fermentation is the main distinguishing characteristic between the three types .
A Southerner will probably tell you that there is no type of BBQ sauce to go with this type of pulled pork because it 's not actually real pulled pork ... or real BBQ . Authentic pulled pork is smoked , and that comes with a completely different set of pairings . This is technically just braised , shredded pork . Which is not meant as a criticism , mind you - I often make a similar recipe in the winter time using a dutch oven . But terminology is important here because there 's a huge difference in flavour between pulled pork and braised pork . I 'll note for the record that any kind of slow-cooking will make a pork shoulder fall right apart ; you do not need the root beer ( which is n't that acidic anyway , and <URL> ) to tenderize the pork . The heat and moisture do that all by themselves , although root beer is as good a choice as any if you 're braising . Now onto the flavouring . Because the braise , unlike smoke , only minimally flavours the meat , you 're going to need strong flavours from elsewhere . If you 're really trying to mimic an authentic Southern-style pulled pork then you need to incorporate the smoky flavour somehow , which means using a smoky BBQ sauce ( hickory is common ) or better yet , incorporate this flavour at the very beginning of the cooking process by applying a dry rub containing smoked paprika or including a small amount of liquid smoke in the braise . If you do use a rub then the other flavours are up to you - there are plenty of recipes out there - just do n't use salt in it because pork already has plenty . As with any braise , stick to aromatics like garlic/onion powder , various chili powders/peppers , cinnamon , etc. . Once you 've successfully incorporated the smoke ( or what passes for smoke in indoor cooking ) then a little sauce goes a long way . Definitely incorporate some of the leftover braising liquid so as not to waste those delicious drippings - I use about half of it but that 's with a much milder braise . Ketchup and dijon mustard in a 50/50 to 60/40 ratio is very simple and surprisingly effective when mixed in with the juices . If you still find this to be lacking punch , you can throw in some cider vinegar , which pairs well with both the pork shoulder and your root beer braise . I actually boil off the pan ( after reserving some braising liquid ) and use cider vinegar as a deglazer for the fond , but since you 're using a crock pot ( or equivalent ) , you probably wo n't have much/any fond and this would require an extra vessel , so ... just throw a splash or two into the finished sauce , and reduce if that makes it a bit watery . Worcestershire sauce is also a good way to punch up any homemade sauce , and if it starts to get too intense or tangy from either that or the vinegar , tone it down with some brown sugar or molasses if you have any . If you 're dead-set on following the recipe to the letter , then , as above , I think I 'd choose a hickory or mesquite sauce , something smoky and not overly thick . Some of the better brands/products will actually include a small amount of alcohol , like whisky or bourbon . Almost all will contain onion , garlic , paprika , sugar , molasses , and vinegar ( often cider vinegar , as above ) - not surprisingly , exactly the same kinds of ingredients as I 'm suggesting in the dry rub and homemade sauce .
There are two things you care about when you are making a cake . First , ratio . Second , sequence . The ratio is a weight ratio . For example , a muffin batter has 2 parts flour , 2 pars liquid , 1 part egg , and 1 part fat . You can use different types of liquid to make different kinds of muffins . You can make any amount of batter you want , provided you use the same ratio . * The second point is the sequence of combining the ingredients . Look at pound cake and sponge cake : they are made with the same ingredients , using exactly the same ratio . But you combine the ingredients in a different order , producing two different types of cake layer . If you decide to change a recipe for avocado baking , you must keep both ratio and sequence in mind . An avocado contains , on average , <URL> . It also has 7 % fiber , but as I assume that you 'll puree the avocado first , it shoudl n't roughen the cake too much , it will be nowhere like whole wheat cake . We can ignore the sugars ( 1 % ) and proteins ( 2 % ) , as the amount is insignificant . As for the ratio , you can try using avocado , and then removing some fat and liquid from the cake recipe . As fresh avocado has 5 times more water than butter , it is n't possible to substitute all the butter from the original recipe - I do n't know any cake recipes with such high water : butter ratios . You should rather replace the liquid , calculate how much butter is being replaced by avocado fat , and then add the remaining butter needed . It will still need fine tuning , because some of the avocado water is already trapped in the fiber , and wo n't hydrate the cake flour . I 'd try out using maybe 140-160 g avocado puree for each 100 g liquid in the recipe . This will result in 115-120 g. avocado water . It will also deliver 20 g fat . So for aforementioned cupcakes , we 'll only need 5 g additional fat ( they use 25 g fat per 100 g liquid ) . Of course , layers for sponge cake or sachertorte are out of the question , because they do n't use liquid in the first place . The second problem is the sequence . Some recipes expect you to cream the butter and sugar . These ca n't be made with avocado , as it is impossible to separate the fat and liquid in this case . Similarly , you ca n't use it to make a roux for a souffle ( OK , that 's not technically a cake ) . Other recipes do n't require such careful mixing methods , and they should be fine with avocado puree . You can try practically anything where you are supposed to dump all liquid ingredients together , mix , and add the dry ones at once . Of course , you want also to consider the taste . Avocado has a somewhat earthy taste , and you 'll probably notice it in a baked product . So fine cakes ( like chiffon cake ) are better off with butter . But most of those are made without liquid anyway . You can try to hide the taste in cakes which have a very strong taste of their own . Chocolate batters will be very good for this , but some flourless cake bases with a significant share of ground nuts should work too . Another option is to use avocado in some more hearty , heavy cakes , where the taste is n't a problem . It should function in sweet cakes , and will probably be perfect in savory cakes ( think zucchini &amp; bacon cupcakes ) . It would be interesting to see what happens to a flaky crust where avocado puree is used instead of water ( with butter accordingly reduced ) . If the texture remains OK , it should give a very nice note to quiches . If you replace a sour liquid with avocado ( e.g. yogurt or buttermilk ) , do n't use baking soda . If the recipe calls for it , use baking powder instead , because baking soda needs acidic ingredients for its leavening action . * But part of it waits too long for the previous patch to free the oven , the baking powder will bubble away and the muffins wo n't rise .
I would say no . The function of the egg in the cake is to go in raw , mix with the other stuff , and once the raw egg has penetrated and coated the other ingredients thoroughly , bind it all together with that bouncy , sticky solidified eggy property which comes into existence as the egg cooks . Cooking the egg first all by itself , then adding to a cake would be like drying some crazy glue , then grinding up that hardened crust and putting the resulting powder between two things you want to stick together . The gluing action is all over when the glue has dried .
If you <URL> , you will find many , many recipes and descriptions . The basic idea is that you use a half-empty beer can as stand for the chicken , placing the chicken 's cavity on top of the can before roasting or grilling . The idea is that the aroma from the beer will transfer to the chicken , and the steam will help keep it moist . You can even buy commercial racks to do the same thing without the beer can . My personal opinion is that both of these ideas are bunk : Very few if any aromatic molecules will transfer to the chicken , and even if they do , they will not penetrate past the surface The steam will not keep the chicken moist , as the dryness of the meet is essentially a function only of the temperature to which you cook it , and very little else . If the chicken is cooked to too high a temperature , then the proteins will tighten up and express water making the chicken tough , rubbery , and dry tasting . The minimal amount of steam can not change this fact .
For some teas , the strainer does matter . For a particular variety of green tea that I was considering importing years ago , the producer recommended a certain type of fine mesh strainer for best results , as apparently the leaves were just the right shape to clog up the " standard " Kyuusu-style mesh strainer . ( Kyuusu is a type of Japanese teapot with the handle on the side instead of opposite the spout ) . With black tea , I found that those glass teapot strainers with the little slits in them worked fine , but were a pain to clean . For Japanese green teas , though , they were a disaster , as tea leaves got stuck in them and the infusion never got very complete , and the water refused to drain in a reasonable amount of time . As a result , I refuse to buy another glass teapot with those little slits , because they were too unreliable for anything but large leaf black teas or certain " fruit teas " ( as they were called in Germany ) . Korean style one-person tea cups with large holes in the strainer component work reasonably well for green tea ( and are designed for green tea ) , but often require toothpicks or bamboo skewers to clean if tea gets stuck in the holes . My favorite teapots mostly use the Japanese-style steel mesh , though I have had good luck for certain teas with built-in clay strainer holes if they brew small quantities of tea .
It was called <URL> , and indeed the ancient Romans used it , as did the ancient Greeks : Garum was prepared from the intestines of small fishes through the process of bacterial fermentation . Fishermen would lay out their catch according to the type and part of the fish , allowing makers to pick the exact ingredients they wanted . The fish parts were then macerated in salt , and cured in the sun for one to three months . The mixture fermented and liquified in the dry warmth , with the salt inhibiting the common agents of decay . Garum was the clear liquid that formed on the top , drawn off by means of a fine strainer inserted into the fermenting vessel . The sediment or sludge that remained was allec . Concentrated decoctions of aromatic herbs might be added . Flavors would vary according to the locale , with ingredients sometimes from in-house gardens . Like the fish sauce of today , it was extremely high in glutamic acid , AKA umami . In <URL> the author says : There appears to be no historical mention of fish sauce being used in Asia before the Early Middle Ages in Europe , which oddly enough is around the same time its use was dwindling in the remnants of the Roman Empire . That begs a question , right ? Did the concept travel , or did Asians develop it independently ? Greater minds than mine are working to definitively answer that question : ... flowed from west to east and was eagerly adopted by Asians on the Silk Road . The recipes for garum changed and adapted as they moved east and became nuoc mam and nam pla according to cultural preferences and what gifts the Asian seas had to offer . Archaeologists and food scientists are working to confirm these flows and linkages ... The production of garum and Asian fish sauce is virtually the same as well . Fresh fish and salt in some proportion ( recipes vary widely from 5:1 to 2:1 ) are layered in barrels , clay pits or earthenware crocks . Because of their large size , tuna were cut up before fermenting to prevent putrefaction , but most fish -- especially the small species are processed whole and intact . In Rome , oregano and other herbs were added at the production phase for both flavor and to suppress bacterial overgrowth , but this step is largely omitted in the production of Asian sauces . The vats are then left to ferment -- sometimes covered or sometimes uncovered ( Carthaginian and Roman ) in the heat and stirred every few days to a week to ensure even enzymatic digestion of the fish .

Yogurt curdles at high temperatures . If you curdle a big lump of yogurt , breaking it up well is hard , and it does n't taste too well . You want to end up with tiny particles evenly dispersed in the dish . So when you add it a spoon at a time , you can mix it really well before it has had time to curdle . An alternative method is to do it the other way round . You remove a spoonfull of the curry and dump it into the yogurt , then stir immediately . When it is completely absorbed , you add the next spoon . You continue until you have something like a 1:1 mix in the bowl , then dump it into the still cooking curry and stir . The second method requires less than 30 s between spoons , but is n't necessarily less work . ( You may have to prepare a separate bowl for the yogurt ) . However , it produces even smoother results . If you have a problematic yogurt ( low fat content , high clumping tendency ) , use the second method . Edit HenrikSöderlund 's comment makes me think that my explanation was n't clear enough , so here an addition . The yogurt will curdle a few seconds after it is dumped in the pot . The point is , you do n't lumps of curdled yogurt . A lump of curdled yogurt is grainy and sour and does n't mix well with liquid . Encountering a lump of curdled yogurt in your soup/curry unpleasant in a way similar to encountering a lump of undissolved baking powder in your cake . On the other hand , A tiny droplet of curdled yogurt is too small to feel as grainy , too small an amount of acid to give you an unpleasant sensation , and small enough to form a suspension with the " broth " . That 's why you have to break up the yogurt in droplets before it curdles , and this is only physically possible when you start out with a small amount like a single spoon . It is even more important to do that when adding to the dry-ish mixture described in the edit than when adding to a simmering broth . The broth is below 100 ° C , the curry base can be much hotter , causing the yogurt to curdle quicker . Also , a liquid will dissolve the yogurt easily and disperse it , but with the dry curry base , you have to rely on stirring only to reduce the yogurt to droplets .
If your caramel rolls are the kind with a sticky , gooey mass in the bottom of the pan that is flipped upside down out of the pan , then I would say that the rolls wo n't really get good and caramely in a stoneware pan . You 'd be better off baking one pan of rolls at a time in the metal pan . While one pan is rising and baking , just chill the other part of the dough ... either plain in a bowl , or prepared into a log that only needs to be cut . If the caramel rolls are more like a cinnamon bun , then the stoneware dishes should do fine in a pinch . This is assuming they are glazed stoneware and not terra cotta . Cooking time will increase a bit as the stoneware will take longer to heat up ( it will also retain the heat longer when removed from the oven ) . You could always just go out and buy some foil pans . I do that when I make rolls ( caramel , cinnamon , and sticky ) for the local fire company 's carnival . They go through 17 = 20 dozen rolls each year . I know baking rolls can be a lot of work , so what I have found to be very helpful , is to make the dough the night before baking . Cover with cling film , and let it have a slow rise in the fridge all night . ( you will get improved flavor too . ) The next day , divide the cold dough up and prepare as usual . They will take a little longer for the rise in the pan after shaping , but it sure is a lot easier on you .
I would recommend a combination toaster and convection oven . While I have a regular oven in my small apartment , I rarely use it in favor of saving energy ( and money on my energy bill ) by using the toaster/convection oven . I have purchased toaster oven sized muffin tins ( just a 6 muffin tin ) and a toaster oven sized roasting rack that fits two sizes of meat . My oven came with a roasting pan . The convection features have done wonderful things for my pies . You can get them big enough to make pizza in . As long as you are n't cooking for a crowd , it will work wonders . Things I 've successfully baked in there include : Muffins Cake ( did have to do it one cake at a time for a layer cake ) Pie ( the convection feature is perfect for pie ! ) Bread Cupcakes Pitas Steak ( well , it was a broiled steak recipe - the best I can do without a grill ) Chicken breasts I had a friend who rented a place that has a convection cooking setting on the microwave . We successfully used it to make muffins once , but I have n't tried it further .
I have seen recipes that call for chopped white onions instead of pearl onions , which leads me to believe it is feasible . The texture might be different ; when cooked , pearl onions tend to have a different sort of bite to them , much like a grape , revealing a burst of flavor after a slight resistance , whereas chopped fullsize onions tend to be more one-note and soft . I do n't know for sure what pickling does to the texture , but if it is beneficial to use whole onions for a similar effect , you 'll lose that . I suspect the flavor penetration would be greater , however , due to the cutting .
CO2 tastes good ! Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution ; this is what you taste . It 's like " salt and pepper " , but for water . Slightly acidic water is usually popular , hence lemon juice is sometimes used to taint a jug of water in times when no carbonated water is available . Carbonated water releases CO2 bubbles for many minutes after pressure is released ( dissolved carbonic acid reforming ) , which is an important presentation effect that other gases do not generally have . In many countries the local water supply is slightly alkaline ( due to limestone rock being very common ) , and this can leave a bad after-taste , and make food in your mouth taste soapy . The addition of weak acids to water helps with neutralising this effect . Around the world , some lucky towns have natural springs with effervescent water ( carbonated water ) , and man-made carbonated water is just imitating this . In history people have often travelled great distances to try effervescent water , so its popularity is well recorded . Nitrogen is used for water pressurisation in brewing and cooking as it leaves little or no taste , and generally does not form other chemical compounds . It 's used mainly when bubbles are required , but not an acidic taste . Oxygen is unsuitable for water pressurisation as very little can be dissolved at normal soda pressures , and it has no taste , but may readily form unwanted chemical compounds . In the 18th century , Joseph Priestley was the first person to document this manufacturing discovery . He noted precisely that it tasted good , and that it was similar to the German Selters water . He was discovering " airs " ( gases ) , and uniquely identified quite a few different gases . CO2 was the only one he listed as tasting good . His cheap source of CO2 was the fermenting grains from the nearby brewery .
High fructose corn syrup is a preservative . While sugaring your ketchup is good for flavor , HFCS is great for shelf stability , as is the vinegar . The reasons you typically see HFCS in American Ketchups is that it is ( 1 ) heavily subsidized and domestic and cheap , ( 2 ) farmed by the same companies making the tomatoes , and ( 3 ) a preservative . Also , it helps to improve flow while maintaining viscosity . Sugar generally can be used to cut the acidity in a tomato dish without inhibiting the taste or outshining the tomato . My stepfather had digestion issues with high acidity meals and swore by a teaspoon or two of sugar to help aid the stomach issues . Likewise , the acidity of ketchup may well be mitigated by all the sugar .
It has long been known that receptacles influence the taste and appreciation of beverages . <URL> , for example , are optimal for giving the nose an opportunity to experience the wine . They enclose a volume that allows you to swish the wine in the glass ( without spilling it ) to impart the aroma to air in the glass . The usually tapered opening keeps the aroma from dissipating before your nose can sense the wine . Champagne flutes , keep the effervescent champagne or prosecco bubbly and cold long enough to enjoy the drink without it going flat . Different <URL> are optimal for showcasing the " head " and are tall for the same reason as champagne flutes ( to keep the effervescence going as long as possible ) . I think it is absolutely the case that the same kinds of considerations apply to cola and other effervescent soft drinks . My opinion is that the best glass for such beverages is a <URL> . It it tall and narrow and keeps the bubbles going for a longer time than a wide glass , it is like a champagne flute but holds a larger volume which is needed for soft drinks .

Is there a difference between the grocery store package of chow mein noodles and the package of lo mein noodles ?
It becomes quite confusing when talking about the difference between chow mein and lo mein mainly due to the error in translation . In Chinese chow mein literally translate as " fried noodles . " However when buying chow mein at a chinese restaurant , you get vegetables with a side of deep fried noodles . Somehow the title of a dish is referring the to side rather than the main dish which leads to much confusion . When talking about chow mein at a grocery store , it also gets confusing because you can get two types of noodles . The first kind is a fried noodle that looks something like this : This is definitely not what your recipe is referring to . The second type of chow mein you will find is very much similar to lo mein . It should be a raw noodles that is still semi-soft . It should look like this : If the chow mein you have at your grocery store resembles the second type of noodle , then you may use that as a substitute . If it resembles the first type , do n't . The first type is used as a topping sort of like chinese croutons .
Yes , there is a difference in taste . I think it 's the chlorophyll , but I may be wrong . But the green asparagus has a " vegetable " or " grassy " taste which is n't present in the white asparagus . The white one has its own distinct aroma , which is less pronounced in the green one . As for texture , Caleb already said it . White asparagus is more tender , if you buy it fresh enough . On the other hand , non-tender green asparagus is snappy and somewhat brittle , like a normal stalk . Non-tender white asparagus is tough and stringy . When I cook white asparagus , I remove the lowest part ( the most stringy one ) and peel it ( the outer layer is especially string prone ) and sometimes , if it turns out to be low quality/old , it still has an unpleasant texture . The green one seldom requires removal of the lower part , and never peeling . Violet asparagus is like white one in both taste and texture , but not as common . Oh , and what Caleb says about both being the same plant is correct , but I have never heard of little shades . All farmers in Germany grow white asparagus underground . They make mounds of earth above the place where the asparagus is planted , and it has to grow a lot before it reaches the surface . They also cover the mounds with black foil to get the earth warm in spring . The harvest starts sometime in April and ends by tradition on June 24 . It is done by hand , because machines would break the rods . This makes it a quite costly vegetable . And it should be eaten fresh , because the longer it spends outside of the earth , the stringier it gets . I do n't share the common German enthusiasm for white asparagus ( " royal vegetable " etc. ) but think that it is a good vegetable in its own right . If you can get it fresh , it is worth eating now and then .
I addition to what Tabiasopdenbrouw said , and more to the point of usage/taste : Bacon is typically cut thinner and ends up crispier than pancetta . Both are often rendered for their fat before adding onions , peppers , etc. . . to the pan to pick up those pork fat flavors . Pancetta is often saltier in flavor though this is usually the case because the pancetta is cut thicker or into dices , so you get bigger bites of it and thus more salt . This is the biggest different between the two .
First of all , the names vary a bit from country to country , or the ingredients do . I 'll explain the most common names/ingredients . The main difference is in the ingredients used . Sorbet is basically water + sugar + fruit , while ice cream and gelato is milk/cream + sugar + fruit . So the last two are more ' creamy ' , while sorbet is more ' icy ' . You can say that ice cream is a type of gelato , but there still is a difference . More sugar in gelato , more butterfat ( the percentage of fat in the milk/cream ) in ice cream . You can read quite a lot about ice cream on <URL> .
White , green , oolong , and black tea are all products of Camellia sinensis leaves and buds , the only difference is how they are processed . You can turn the plant matter into any of the varieties . Different sources will give different accounts of the processing steps , but in rough order of least-to-most processed : White tea is minimally processed and not oxidized , meaning it retains the natural antioxidants , but does not develop as much flavor , color , or caffeine . Sweet or flowery flavors are characteristic . ( Chinese Silver needle white tea ) Green tea has a minimal amount of oxidation , halted by additional pan-frying ( Chinese teas ) or steaming ( Japanese ) steps . The additional processing brings out more flavor , and allows for caffeine to develop , at the cost of a reduction in antioxidants . Characteristic flavors are grassy , vegetal , and earthy , with sweet notes . ( Japanese Sencha ) Oolong tea gets partial fermentation , and often an additional shaking/bruising step that release additional flavors . Oolong can range in color from dark green to black . The combination of bruising and partial fermentation give many oolongs distinct flowery &amp; earthy flavors . Darker oolongs may have buttery or smoky tastes to them . It has somewhat more caffeine and less antioxidants than green tea . Tieguanyin or Iron Goddess : ( light oolong ) Black Oolong : ( Wu Yi ) Black tea is fully fermented , which blackens the leaves and causes the formation of caffeine and tannins . It generally possesses the most robust flavor and highest level of caffeine , but the least antioxidants . ( Chinese keemun ) Pu-erh is tea that is pressed into cakes and post-fermented , meaning that after processing and drying it undergoes an additional ripening/fermentation . Microorganisms work on the tea , changing it chemically in a similar fashion to aging cheeses . Traditionally this is accomplished over years in controlled climate conditions ( 10-15 years being ideal ) , but in recent decades a several-month fast ripening process is sometimes used . Pu-erh develops a richer , more complex flavor , and has the widest range of flavors of any of the varieties . Before post-fermentation , it may resemble a white , green , or oolong tea , but the ripening process can impart darker black-tea flavors , giving a unique character . Pu-er Cake Rooibos , sometimes called red tea , is made from another plant entirely , Aspalathus linearis . It is a traditional South African infusion , prepared like a black tea but without caffeine . There are two varieties , green and red . Green is un-oxidized , where red is oxidized . Rooibos is characterized by a sweet , woody/malty flavor . Health-wise , it is a source of anti-oxidants , may aid in digestion , and some say it may aid with nervous tension and allergies . Yerba mate is from the South American plant Ilex paraguariensis , whose leaves are steeped like tea . It is generally toasted in processing , and produces a brew with caffeine similar to coffee . Despite its caffeine , mate is actually relaxing to smooth muscles , so you do n't get jitters , and it also helps control appetite . The flavor is vegetal and herbal , and can be bitter if brewed hot . Although it contains antioxidants , this is balanced by traces of carcinogens from the toasting , and the jury is still out on whether mate overall increases or decreases cancer rates . Tisanes or herbal infusions these are various blends of dried herbs , fruits , spices , and flowers which are steeped like teas , but do not contain tea leaves . Generally , the ingredients are dried , although fresh ingredients can be used too . To confuse matters further , black and green teas may also have flavorings added to them , giving a similar result .
In their various parts of the world , all of these words mean sauce , at least some of the time . They come from different cultures , though , and carry different connotations at least in US usage . Short answer , though : there are no absolute differences that you can count on . Salsa This is a generic term in Spanish , and in South American cuisines . It can cover everything from a thick , dark mole , an adobo , a light and piquant salsa verde , or the typical tomato , onion and pepper sauce often served with chips in the US . Some salsas are smooth ; others are chunky . They can be cooked or raw . Many people use the word to indicate the red , fresh or lightly cooked tomato salsa with onions , garlic , peppers and usually cilantro often served in Mexican restaurants in the US , but this is only the beginning of what salsas can be . Sauce The generic term . Almost any flavorful liquid put on another food to enhance it . These range from elegently smooth ( such as hollandaise ) to quite chunky such as putanesca sauce . Gravy Gravy tends to be a sauce made from meat drippings , and thickened to serve with the meat or its accompaniments . In Italian-American usage , it often covers " Sunday Gravy " or a ragu made from tomatoes and one or more ( or many meats ) that in some communities was traditionally made on Sunday ; and more generally , any sauce with meat in it . I am told that in Italian in the context of pasta sauces , the actual word is ( forgive my spelling ) accompanimento , an accent for the pasta which is the star . Chutney The word chutney derives from the India/Pakistan region , where again there are a myriad different sauces that carry the title . In the US , it tends to be used for a chunky , acidic sauce made from fruit and/or vegetables . This overlaps considerably with jam or preserves , in this sense , although chutneys tend to be much more strongly spiced , and may contain complex combinations of complimentary ingredients . Still , this does n't cover the full range such as a chutney of pureed cilantro and/or mint , which is much more thin and sauce-like than the above more typical US usage . Conclusion You can not really draw strict distinctions among these categories . You have to know what the specific sauce or item is that is being discussed to strongly draw inferences about it .
What is the application ? For most uses , no , there would be little to no effective difference . Dairy products are a mixture of water , sugars , minerals ( which the dairy industry calls ash , because they are left as ash when burned in a calorimeter ) , proteins , and fat . If the product is not homogonized , the fat globules will eventually rise to the surface ( where they can be skimmed as cream , giving rise to the term skim milk for when the cream has been removed ) . If the product is homogonized , the fat has been forced into much smaller globules which form a stable emulsion , and will not rise . Whipping non-homogonized cream is much easier , but most of us ( at least in the US ) do not have easy access to such a product . Additionally , most dairy products are pasteurized in one of the various methods , slow or fast , which can affect the flavor . Other than these differences in flavor or whipability , you can mix them with little difference for most applications . Note : to your specific question , your mixture of smim milk and cream may actually be richer than commercial half and half , which is often about 12 % milkfat , but it would function very similarly . Of course , all the above only applies to fresh products -- basic milk or cream of various fat percentages . Fermented products like yogurt , creme fraiche , cottage cheese , buttermilk , and so forth have entirely different charactaristics .
Pot Roasting = Braising This more recent document from the same association , Cattlemen 's Beef Board and National Cattlemen 's Beef , supports this by using them interchangeably : <URL> I was trying to figure out what the document from your question may have been implying by the cuts the different cooking techniques were recommended for . And I 'd guess , because Pot Roasting is applied to more connective heavy cuts , that braising would be a shorter cooking time . That 's my best guess .
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
Traditional goulash is a stew/soup , usually using a cheaper cut of meat suited to slow cooking . It usually contains potatoes and other vegetables , as well as noodles . A true stroganoff consists of paprika-dusted fillet steak quickly pan fried with mushrooms and onions in a sour cream and brandy sauce . It is usually served with rice . I understand that in the US stroganoff can also refer to a stew made with similar ingredients as the traditional dish , and is served with noodles . This , coupled with the shared use of paprika , is evidently where the line blurs .
First off , the terminology issue . So , can someone please clear up this fog ? What 's the difference between Microwave and Oven and Microwave Oven ? <URL> Both terms mean the same thing : an appliance that uses microwave radiation to heat food . Cooking food in this way is called " microwaving " . An oven , on the other hand , has a heating element which heats the air inside , which then heats the food . Cooking food in this way is generally called " baking " , though there are a lot of other things ( e.g. roasting ) you can also reasonably do in an oven . So if all you have is a microwave , then all you can do is microwave ( not bake ) . And if you have an oven , then you can bake ( but of course you ca n't microwave ) . There also exist combinations , which are capable of both microwaving and baking , i.e. they have a microwave emitter and a heating element . However , remember that in the US - and thus on much of the internet - something talking about a " microwave oven " likely does not mean this combination , but simply microwave heating . Names like " convection microwave oven with grill " , " combination microwave/oven " do refer to these combinations , though . I 've also seen " speed oven " . You may sometimes have seen people referring to these combination microwave/ovens as a " microwave oven " ( I think this may be common in Indian English ) , but that 's really just imprecise language . Some sites say that a " microwave " is only for heating or re-heating cooked food . Whereas , in " microwave ovens " , you can microwave and bake . Is that true ? It sounds like in this statement , " microwave oven " is careless language , referring to a combination microwave and oven . ( It does n't make any sense at all otherwise ; the two things are the same thing , so of course you can do the same things in them . ) So the question is really , what can you do in a microwave vs an oven , or a combination microwave/oven ? It 's true that microwaves are mainly used for reheating cooked food , and it 's true that they ca n't actually bake . However , they can do a lot more than reheat food ; there are a lot of kinds of cooking besides baking . For example , microwaves are great at simmering/boiling and steaming , and it does n't matter if the food was cooked already or not . The recipes you 're talking about are probably mostly in those kinds of categories , but if you 're interested , <URL> discusses in a bit more detail what works in microwaves . The big things that you can do with ovens but not microwaves are the things that actually need the steady dry heat of baking . You ca n't bake bread or cookies or roast a chicken in a microwave . Microwaves hold in a lot of steam and do n't get terribly hot , so you ca n't generally get things to brown or crisp up . They also do n't really hold a temperature like you need for baking , they just pump more and more heat into the food .
春卷 ( Chūnjuǎn , Spring rolls ) are julienned vegetables , sometimes with a bit of noodles , sometimes with a bit of minced meat , wrapped with a flour dough skin and pan - or deep-fried . They are a filled roll . You can see the different varieties by country here : <URL> Spring roll : 鸡蛋卷 ( Jīdàn juǎn , Egg rolls ) are many different things around the world . In Chinese communities , these typically refer to a sweet biscuit type roll , of hollow flaky egg pastry ( not filled . ) However , there is also another variety ( common in American Chinese cuisine ) where a flour dough wrap is filled with " pork , shrimp , or chicken , adding cabbage , carrots , bean sprouts and other vegetables , and then deep fried . " In the American Chinese respect , I believe it is very similar to a Spring roll really , although the flour dough looks thicker and of a different composition than a typical Spring roll ( the dough bubbles when deep-fried , with Spring roll skin it does not . ) <URL> Sweet egg roll : American Chinese egg roll :
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
' Paella rice ' is not actually a variety of rice , but a category suitable , as the its name suggests , for making paella . Some common varieties are : Bahia , Balilla , Bomba , Senia , and Calasparra ; the particular variety should be indicated on the packet that you choose . These varieties differ from risotto rices , such as arborio and carnaroli , in not creating a creamy ' sauce ' around the rice . Paella rice should stick together , but be distinct and not in a creamy ' sauce ' . Arborio rice has a creamy , chewy texture due to its higher amylopectin ( one of two components in its starch ) content . Paella rice absorbs more liquid than risotto rices , however it too would become ' creamy ' if you stirred it like a risotto , since it also has a high starch content .
The previously accepted answer contains a good link , but not any information here on Seasoned Advice , so I thought I would write out a few things from my understanding after having developed an abiding interest in Cajun foods over the past decade . Basically , <URL> is a much broader term with a longer history . While it is perhaps inaccurate to say <URL> is a ' subset ' area and culinary style , it is more geographically - and flavor-specific than just saying Creole . The history of people and region identified as Creole ( on the American continents ) goes back a long ways , and Cajun is a more recent phenomenon . Creole can also refer to other peoples and regions other than just in the South/Central parts of North America , though such use in the United States is a distant memory . In the past century , the " Cajun " term has certainly attained an independent status as a self-identified people , region , and flavor -- the last no doubt owing to the flavor potency of their offerings . Which offerings , in my opinion , when consumed , are nearly always exquisitely enjoyable examples of perfection in the experience of food .
There is certainly a difference between different yeasts . Different kinds of yeast react differently , are happy at different temperature ranges , produce different amounts of gas , live for different amounts of time . In my little world , however , it 's better to use a yeast that you use commonly and understand than it is to experiment with a different yeast that may not behave the way you expect . The thing is , " bakers yeast " is a generic term . If it called for rapid rise yeast , and all you had was active dry yeast , I 'd say to go out and buy some , or your bread would end up flat . Chances are you have one of those two kinds . They 'd both work in most recipes , but each have their peculiarities , and you 'd need to adjust . I 'd give it a shot , and see how it comes out . If your bread ends up whacky , then try something else .
Generally speaking , butter spreads have a water component to them . That 's what the emulsifier is for , as it keeps the fat and water from separating . The problem is that you ca n't fry/cook with it . If you place it in a pan it will separate , and sizzle in a very unpleasant manner . If I remember correctly , it actaully smells quite awful in the process . As for baking , I think it 'll be fine anywhere there needs to be fat as fat . Wherever you need fat as something to hold the structure , you had probably best not use it . Caveat emptor , as I do n't bake very much at all . Let it be aid , however , that margarine as opposed to butter spread , can be used anywhere that butter is used . It is n't as tasty , and has trans-fats . On the other hand , it has less cholesterol .
Red pizza sauce is often ( but not always ) two things : Thicker . Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings , otherwise thin is fine . Depending on the crust , the heat of the oven , the toppings above sauce , and how watery it is , this may not be needed . If you 've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand . If you 've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese , precook and reduce the sauce . It 's often simpler . Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection . They 're all about the sauce . Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it . Many of the best pizzas are simply topped . Crushed san marzano tomatoes ( sometimes ) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do , and franky , it 's enough . I 'm not talking about the jarred varieties here , but what you might cook at home . Jars in the store , the main difference is just how thick it is .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .

How can you recognize cold milk that has gone bad or is about to ?
Looks like FAO ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ) does a formal testing <URL> . One of the easier methods : 2.4.5.3 . The Alcohol Test The test is quick and simple . It is besed on instability of the proteins when the levels of acid and/or rennet are increased and acted upon by the alcohol . Also increased levels of albumen ( colostrum milk ) and salt concentrates ( mastitis ) results in a positive test . Procedure : The test is done by mixing equal amounts of milk and 68 % of ethanol solution in a small bottle or test tube . ( 68 % Ethanol solution is prepared from 68 mls 96 % ( absolute ) alcohol and 28 mls distilled water ) . If the tested milk is of good quality , there will be no coagulation , clotting or precipitation , but it is necessary to look for small lumps . The first clotting due to acid development can first be seen at 0.21-0 .23 % Lactic acid . For routine testing 2 mls milk is mixed with 2 mls 68 % alcohol . Simplified for home use : This test is likely to be adaptable to household alcohol drinks such as vodka or similar beverages . For example the number of teaspoons of Vodka an ounce or two of milk can hold before it clots .
Not worth the risk , just throw it out . There 's no way to tell whether the smell was absorbed , or comes from bacteria in the food itself .
That is simply caramelized sugar that coats the dish before the custard is poured in for baking . As the flan is chilled , the moisture from the custard liquefies the caramelized sugar and results in the sauce . If you 're wanting to make it for other desserts and are n't making flan , then simply caramelize sugar and then add water to it . Be careful as the steam can easily burn you if you 're standing over it . The sugar will seize up and then as it continues to cook the crytallized caramelized sugar will liquefy . You will then have caramelized sugar syrup .
Unless there was sugar in your cream , there 's nothing particularly sweet about this combination . Did you salt the pasta water to roughly seawater saltiness ? If not , did you adjust salt before serving ? If your pasta water was under-salted , that would explain the sweetness , since the only significant source of salt otherwise was the parmesan . Heavy cream is equivalent to 36-40 % whipping cream . In the event that your cream was pre-sweetened , there 's not much you could do except add salt and hope the sugar does n't overwhelm . It 's a fairly common technique to add sugar to a salty dish to make it taste richer , or salt to a sweet dish for a similar purpose . But it would n't work very well if the cream was very sweet . Since I 've never seen sweetened whipped cream except in aerosol dispensers , I ca n't say for sure .
Sprouted onions are perfectly safe to eat . If far advanced the texture may not be ideal ; yours does not sound very far advanced at all ( not even green . ) Considering you can eat green onions , there 's nothing to fear from onion sprouts .
Buttermilk is already thoroughly packed with live bacteria . During its manufacture , that bacteria already consumed some portion of the available lactose and turned it into lactic acid . Because of the lack of food , acidity , and the extreme competition it is pretty hard for buttermilk to go bad . The good bacteria will stay active and the buttermilk will get thicker and more sour until it runs out of lactose . In fact - when your buttermilk container has about 1/2 cup left you can make more just by refilling the container with milk and leaving it to ferment on the counter for a day . If you use it up more quickly than the bacteria eat the lactose then you can keep this up indefinitely . Do n't worry if it is thicker - if it still smells good then it probably is . As Noctrine said - mold around the lip is the worst risk . I am not a food chemist and despite my personal experience - if you ever suspect that food is bad just throw it out . $ 2 of buttermilk is n't worth an unpleasant afternoon .
The notion that salt or spices specifically do n't scale linearly sounds like nonsense to me . In any recipe involving salt and water , the salt is dissolved , so all that matters is the concentration , and that concentration is going to be the same with linear scaling . Scaling in general is problematic when scaling more than 2x or 4x . When you take into account that : Recipes targeted at home cooks are imprecise to begin with and often use volumetric measurements that are sensitive to heat , humidity , and other environmental conditions , so the imprecision is magnified at larger scale ; Larger portions of food may get cooked less evenly and/or at less consistent temperatures due to the volume/surface area ratio ; that part is correct , but it has nothing to do with salt , it has to do with your equipment . On the stovetop , most of the heat is coming from the bottom of the pan unless you use induction , and even in an oven you 've got one or two heat sources radiating heat in a specific pattern . Cooking times are also going to vary due to changes in things like rates of evaporation . The total amount of heat you 're able to deliver at any given time generally does not increase as quickly as the amount of heat you need to deliver , so very often you need to increase cooking times . I 'm sure you probably already know all this , but the reason I 'm pointing it all out is that I 'm pretty sure that this odd-sounding assertion about non-linear salt/spice scaling is due to some mutation or misunderstanding of general scaling issues . Probably , salt and spices are typically present in very small quantities in most recipes , and those quantities are already wild guesses much of the time , so the effect of compounding all this wild inaccuracy , especially with volumetric measurements , is actually pretty noticeable at large scale . Scaling sucks with these ingredients because the initial quantities and scaling method are both nonsense . Assuming you have a precise recipe that gives weight measurements , and you scale by weight , then you 're not going to have any problems as long as you either cook it in batches or adjust your cooking time/temp accordingly . I suppose I could be wrong , but I spent 20 minutes digging for some evidence to contradict my claims above and came up dry ; you 'd think that somebody would have presented some evidence if the claim were true .
Most cookie recipes ( including the Nestle Tollhouse recipe ) call for 9 - 11 minutes at 375 & deg ; F ( for a 3-bite sized cookie ) . Within this range , finding the exact time ( and temperature ) for your preferred done-ness and with your equipment can be a fussy business . One of the best indicators is the darkening color at the outer edge of the cookie , as shown in the last picture in your recipe . ( For what it 's worth , substituting dark brown sugar for brown sugar may make a significant difference in the outcome of the cookie . ) You can also gently poke the edge of a cookie to test it . ( Only do this if your fingers are used to enough kitchen abuse to be OK with poking hot cookies and gooey melty chocolate . ) The edge of the cookie should be a little crispy and have a texture when done . When un-done , it will be liquid and gooey , like the middle of the cookie . If no other methods prove useful , I fall back to the " test cookie " method , where I bake one cookie at at time at different intervals of time ( 30 seconds ) , wait until they cool , and then re-use the time from the best resulting cookie . ( Same for dialing the best temperature . ) Go with a slightly overdone cookie for a tie breaker ; when baking your batches of cookies , the extra mass will take a little longer to bake to the same done-ness . Yes , this is a tedious and fussy procedure , but once you 've got this figured out , you can replicate it ever time . And , as with all baking , practice makes perfect .
I 'm not going to comment on whether or not it is safe , because that could be any number of issues other than the brown coloring of the meat . However , the brown in and of itself is not an issue . When meat is exposed to air it turns a brown color . This does not effect the falvor of the meat , but the color turns a lot of people off . Grocery stores will actually throw this meat away , not because it is bad but just because people wo n't buy it . Terribly wasteful . From the <URL> : Optimum surface color of fresh meat ( i.e. , cherry-red for beef ; dark cherry-red for lamb ; grayish-pink for pork ; and pale pink for veal ) is highly unstable and short-lived . When meat is fresh and protected from contact with air ( such as in vacuum packages ) , it has the purple-red color that comes from myoglobin , one of the two key pigments responsible for the color of meat . When exposed to air , myoglobin forms the pigment , oxymyoglobin , which gives meat a pleasingly cherry-red color . The use of a plastic wrap that allows oxygen to pass through it helps ensure that the cut meats will retain this bright red color . However , exposure to store lighting as well as the continued contact of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin with oxygen leads to the formation of metmyoglobin , a pigment that turns meat brownish-red . This color change alone does not mean the product is spoiled
No . Sweetened condensed milk has a 40 % sugar content . It is very sweet , suitable for desserts and such . It is entirely too sweet to substituted into a curry . The consistency is drastically different . Evaporated milk is about the same consistency as heavy cream . Sweetened condensed milk , because of its high sugar content , is more the consistency of a warm caramel . Also , they are different colors , evaporated milk is white , sweetened condensed is light brown .
Pasteurized milk is the standard way milk is sold in industrialized countries . How it 's packaged can depend on the country but it 's perfectly safe to drink provided it 's consumed by the " use by " date . <URL> : Pasteurization ( American English ) or pasteurisation ( British English ) is a process invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century . In 1864 Pasteur discovered that heating beer and wine just enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage prevented these beverages from turning sour . This was achieved by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage . Today the process of pasteurization is used widely in the dairy and food industries for microbial control and preservation of the food we consume . Pasteurization is the reason for milk 's extended shelf life . High-temperature , short-time ( HTST ) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks , whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer , sometimes two to three months . When ultra-heat treatment ( UHT ) is combined with sterile handling and container technology ( such as aseptic packaging ) , it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months . This means that most of the microbes in the milk are killed and the milk is perfectly safe to drink right out of the carton . In fact , there are many jokes in the US about chastising teenage boys and young men about drinking directly from the carton/jug of milk . Milk in the US is regularly consumed direct from the gallon jug , see the note under Vitamin D that says " Pasteurized &amp; Homogenized " : Milk in Europe is often in <URL> cartons which do n't have to be stored in the fridge until opened and generally have a longer shelf life due to the UHT handling ( see definition above ) :
UHT ( Ultra High Temperature ) processing kills all the pathogens in the milk , so it can be conserved for a long time . However to make yogurt you add bacteria ( lactobacillus ) , so if there are n't other microorganism it should be even better .
I usually notice when cutting onions and tomatoes . With a very sharp knife cutting an onion does n't cause much tears at all . As it dulls though it does more crushing than slicing which releases more gas into the air , which makes you cry more . Ripe tomatoes help because they are so tender . If it becomes difficult to slice a tomato without crushing it , your knife is too dull . A well used , properly cared for knife should require sharpening every 6-18 months , depending on usage . Mine get sharpened yearly . You may find it beneficial to read these related questions , and their answers : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Are you trying to make Sauerkraut ? Either way for the pink colour you have a non-desirable bacteria growing . While most Sauerkraut has some of this , it is not always safe to eat . Time to throw it away ? If you salt cabbage , you need to ensure not too much salt is used ( 1 % to 2 % max ) , and make sure it is packed down very firmly , so only anaerobic bacteria will grow in any numbers It does n't need to be in a closed container , but it should have a firm fitting lid , without an air gap on the top Also , once it goes past 20 ° C ( 70 ° F ) you run the risk of getting other undesirable bacteria and yeasts , and general food rot
I found this very informative article from the Crown Prince company , an anchovy canner and distributor . Apparently the reason for cold storage has to do with the preservation process and product quality : <URL> Anchovies are a " semi-preserved " product . This means that they are not sterilized by either cooking or pasteurization . Instead , anchovies are preserved by a salting process whereby salt is used to control bacteria which would otherwise render a canned product unusable . The anchovies remain in the salt until just before canning . Therefore , suppliers do not pack ahead of order . Our anchovies are not packed until just prior to shipment . Because they are " semi-preserved " , anchovies will eventually break down and become mushy . The cans may even puff . This occurs because there is a non-harmful bacteria that survives in salt . This bacteria can be inconvenient because when it grows it can eventually form a gas which will puff the can . We repeat that this is not harmful to humans , but is most inconvenient . Heat will hasten the growth of the non-harmful bacteria . Anchovies should always be stored in a cool place , preferably in the refrigerator . Their shelf life when refrigerated is about 18 months . If you do not plan on consuming the anchovies or paste immediately after purchasing , we recommend storing them in the refrigerator . It is important to note that puffed anchovy cans are not indicative of a faulty canning procedure , but rather of improper storage subsequent to canning . Occasionally , customers complain of a white substance in the can . Often , salt collects around the edges of the fish . This is harmless , as it is only salt .
A cold/delayed ferment does several things : Allows for more complete hydration of the starches , and more gluten development . An enzyme called protease , which is naturally occurring the flour , breaks some of the long gluten bonds , making the dough more extensible . ( This is not in conflict with the first reaction , it just controls the gluten length ) . Creates flavors through alpha-amylase action converting starches to sugars . The first two items are lumped into the term autolyse , which can be done in time frames of anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours . The third item of a cold ferment gets more complex ... Additional enzymes ( alpha-amylase enzymes ) that come along with the flour , yeast , other ingredients added to the flour ( malt powders ) , or grain mashes , perform a set of reactions that break starch molecules into sugars . This reaction is what turns malted grain from starchy soup to sweet liquid in the beer-making process of " mashing " . These sugars both add flavor of their own , caramelize to create new flavors , and feed the yeast creating even NEW flavors . The trick , and reason it is cold , is that the yeast contribute valuable enzymes to this process , but can be too energetic . If they are allowed to ferment wildly they would likely over-leaven the bread . The cool temperatures slow the enzymes down as well , but not as much as the yeast , letting the enzymes catch up with the process . Now - no part of this process is dogma . There are people who cold-rest their dough and THEN add yeast the next day . Problem here is that you need to allow at least 6 hours at room temperature for the yeast to catch up , and it is hard to integrate yeast into pre-made dough . The results can be similar , but the scheduling is awkward . Other variations include cold resting only part of the dough , or making a liquid " soaker " that includes some mashed grain , allowing that to sit at room temperature without yeast , which is then integrated into the main dough on the day of baking . Cold-resting dough is also a practical matter - once the dough is mixed and resting , if it spends 12 or 36 hours in the fridge , it does n't matter too much , and once it is pulled out , only requires a few hours to come back to temperature , final proof , and bake . It sounds like a slower way to make bread , but personally , splitting the process into two days makes it easier to fit into a busy life - I start the dough on one day , then the next day ( or two or three days later , if I get busy ) , I can pull the dough after work , proof and bake for a late dinner that evening . The flavor and dough development are icing on the cake . To really dive into this process and what drives it , check out Peter Reinhart 's books " Bread Baker 's Apprentice " and " Whole Grain Breads " , both of which go into the process in great detail , and are excellent reads for anyone wanting to improve their baking . It includes a lot of the science , and enough background information to make you feel comfortable with what you are doing , and comfortable experimenting on your own with variations to the process .
Handling raw milk is risky , and please note this information is not professional advice and is not to be taken as an authoritative response . I will , however , attempt to provide some thoughts on handling raw milk below . Selling unpasteurized milk is illegal in some countries , and official sources usually discourage the consumption of raw milk instead of offering handling instructions ( for good reason ) . The FDA has <URL> on dangers of raw milk . There are other real dangers such as <URL> with which I bouted as an 8-year old . Think of 107F fever . Also , keep in mind when you boil the raw milk you are going through a similar process as pasteurization in regards to the theory on breaking down the complex proteins and <URL> . Probably even more than pasteurization since that occurs at lower temperatures . Those theories , however , are n't proven ( yet ) as far as I know , but you do burn some of the sugars in milk if you go above 70C . The actual answers : 2 : It is better to boil first for sure . Do n't store raw milk for lengths of time . 3 : Theoretically , if you do everything right and vacuum pack the milk , it might last a couple of weeks , but the longer it stays , the more dangerous it can get . Freezing might be a better option ( we keep our pasteurized milk a couple of months in the freezer ) . 1 : I ca n't tell you how long to boil it for , though the last time I had fresh milk , it was kept simmering on the burner for about 5 minutes by the folks at the farm . It was also minutes after it was collected ( fresher is better ) . one of the safest things you can do if you 're going to have raw milk , is to know the source and get it from a farm that takes care of the conditions . If you know the farm , the farmer , and the cows conditions are safe , you 're more likely to be able to enjoy raw milk in peace .
Very simply , bake it for the recommended time in the recipe . Then if it looks golden brown ( note that if the air in the oven is not humid enough the bread may stay pale , on a side note a humid oven helps to develop a good crust ) , tap it in on it 's base and if it sounds hollow its done . If it feels soft in the base and not hollow or If its still not golden brown , put it back in the oven for a few minutes then try the tap check again . Although you stated you dislike the thermometer technique , for others reading the bread should have an internal temperature of 200F or 94C , if not return it to the oven for a few minutes until it is .
If I see a few little brown bits , I 'll cut them out and go ahead an use it . If it was , say , 20 % brown , I 'd throw it out .
In theory you could thaw and refreeze as many times as you like , though the changes in temperature would definitely alter the quality of the meat 's taste and texture . What matters most is how long the meat has been in the so-called " danger zone " speaking from a temperature perspective . The " danger zone " is defined as being between 41 to 135 ° F ( 5 to 57 ° C ) . Here is an excerpt from <URL> : Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than four hours are considered adulterated . Additionally , one should be fully aware that the four-hour period is cumulative , meaning that the meter starts running again every time the food enters the danger zone . Therefore , once the four-hour period has been exceeded , heating , cooling , or any other cooking method can not recover foods .

How can I get salt to stick better to buttered or oiled popcorn ?
The key is to have the finest possible salt . One way to do this is to take any salt you like , and grind it fine in a mortar and pestle . This just takes a few seconds , and then you can customize to a particular sea salt you enjoy and avoid the need to buy a special popcorn salt . A rotating action in the mortar and pestle ( as opposed to pounding ) is most efficient for grinding salt .
You might try reducing the cooking heat a little , say on medium heat . That way , the middle will finish cooking without the outside being overcooked . And usually when you flip a pancake it should be almost entirely cooked through anyway . You want to flip when the bubbles are pretty set on the top .
Dry herbs are slower to release their flavors than fresh herbs ; they will need extra cooking time to impart their full flavors , so add them to the dish sooner . Since they are less delicate and need the moisture , you may also want to add them along with a liquid , to help extract out the flavors . Crushing the larger-leaf herbs up a bit may also help . Use less dried herb than you would with fresh , because they are more concentrated . Although these will help , the sad truth is that even the best-dried herbs will not have the subtle flavors of fresher ones . Edit : One other technique you might use ( if there 's minimal cooking of other ingredients ) is to soak them in oil for a long time to extract flavors . I would suggest an overnight soak in olive oil . You can get more flavor out if you heat the olive oil before letting it sit to soak ; something like 50C/125F is a reasonable temperature to dissolve more flavor compounds , without damaging the more delicate ones .
You can save yourself the waste of making double , while preventing cross-contamination , by using one hand ( clean ) to scoop and sprinkle , and one hand ( dirty ) to direct the spice falling , pat/tamp , and rub the spices . Typically I begin by applying a " glue " ( previously I have used honey and mustard , once I was vegan I went with just mustard ; both worked well on smoker ) to the cut of meat or vegetable before smoking or bbq . I follow applying the glue by washing my hands , then proceed with whatever rub I am using after the glue has had a chance to adhere ( typically thirty minutes medium , but I have followed instructions to let set and congeal for up to eight hours ) . Then , you can apply the rub following the method above : keep one hand clean to pick up handfuls of rub and sprinkle the rub down , use the other hand to press that rub you are sprinkling down against the cut . This sequence minimizes the number of steps , the times where you need to wash your hands , and makes for great bark . Hopefully you can rotate the cut with one hand , if not it adds one hand-wash . I started doing it this way because I hated having the spice turn into clumps from the moisture . Now I not only have no clumps in the spice after , and sanitary spices for further usage , but also a clean left hand for turning on the sink to wash my right hand .
In my reading , injera is a sourdough-leavened flatbread , and it does indeed have the consistency you describe . I 've made it with wheat and ( the more traditional ) <URL> flour . It 's not sweet or quick-bread ( in any sense ! ) but is fun , tasty , and worth a try to eat or make . If I 'm understanding correctly , what you 're looking for is a pancake with qualities I 'm often trying to avoid . :) Guesses on how to get where you want , based on what you 've got so far , based on what I 've done accidentally in the past . Apologies that this is all over the map . Over-mix your batter . With quick-breads you often want delicate crumb ; over-mixing will give you more gluten development ( assuming wheat or other gluten-containing flour ) . This will have a more rubbery mouthfeel . Let your batter rest longer . This will also allow gluten to develop ( and/or relax ) , which might have a similar effect . Use a harder ( higher-percentage gluten ) <URL> . Flours will vary greatly in protein ; try a high protein " bread flour " made with hard wheat . These might help with the sponginess factor also . Might also want to experiment with type and amount of leavening . more or less quantity of baking powder , or perhaps baking soda optionally with some kind of acid ( e.g. , buttermilk ) . yeasted pancakes ! I ca n't immediately find a passable recipe link , but James Beard had a lovely ( albeit a bit finicky ) overnight yeast pancake recipe . Give it about 4 attempts before you abandon it . :) Wackier suggestions : Try soy milk . Unlikely to be how your favorite restaurant is accomplishing it 's feat , but this might do something different because of protein or perhaps if there 's other adulterants or thickeners like gums or so . Go off the deep end : try a thickener like corn starch , arrowroot , carrageenan , xanthan gum , ... Try a gluten-free pancake recipe or mix . Who knows ! Good luck ! Have fun ! And let me know if I 've missed your goal .
Yes , you would remove the peas from the pods . <URL> shows how to do it efficiently . And no , the pods are not normally eaten , although according to <URL> you can .
Unless you coat the popcorn ( with caramel , etc ) , I know of no way , other than SAJ 's vacuuming idea , which is quite a good one , imo .
A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread . If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads wo n't raise much . You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens . The more temperature you can give it the better . Another possible factor may be the yeast . Are you waiting enough ? Are you using enough ? Like temperature , more yeast and longer fermentation times ca n't go wrong .
Italian here :) I know that the oil is a well known trick everywhere ... but Italy . The main problem about pasta is that people just tend to cook it too much . The cooking time for pasta should be between 8 and 12 minutes , above this number it will be sticky . Spaghetti is the quickest kind of pasta to get ready , so just cook it around 8-9 minutes and it wo n't stick .
Moisten your hands with a clean , damp towel . This helps the rice not stick . Look at any sushi bar ; the chef will be frequently moistening their hands on such a towel .
I think using an empty can is a brilliant , frugal idea ... but if you want something a bit more exciting , chain stores like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sell decent tubs of cookie cutters . If you have one of those mailer coupons , you can get a ridiculous amount ( like a pack of 100 ) for less than $ 20 .
You can use Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening : its is on PETA 's ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) shopping list of baking goods , but can work just as well for frying as lard .
This similar ( also has heavy cream ) recipe from epicurious recommends : " Room temperature , up to 3 days ; refrigerated , at least 3 months . " <URL> ... And that conforms to my personal opinion , as well . I would not freeze it .
Refrigerate it and the fat will get on top of the water .
As measured by a Thermoworks IR gun thermometer , I 've reached the maximum range on the thermometer ( approx . 1000f ) on some areas of the cast-iron grates of my charcoal grill on several occasions . I used oak lump charcoal in fairly large quantities ( a few layers , started with an electric coil , supplemental charcoal added after the coals were convincingly ignited ) . It turns out this is n't a very useful temperature , of course , but I did get decent results on a dry-rubbed tri-tip steak ( according to those who ate it ; I 'm basically vegetarian ) . I seared each side and then set it up on a higher rack or a cooler spot ( ca n't remember exactly which approach I used ) because it was too hot . It was still quite rare in the middle even after increasing the distance . I just have a rather typical sheet metal grill with an adjustable shelf for the coals and a cast iron cooking surface .
I use a liquid oil instead of a spray oil ; you 're far more likely to get hot spots with a spray , which is bad for any kind of cooking . That stuff works better as a grease than an actual cooking oil . I also tend to have pretty good success by frying the tortillas up to just a hint of golden-brown ( dark brown spots is overdone ) and then finishing it off ( i.e. to melt the cheese ) in a low-heat oven . As an added benefit , if you 're making a largish batch then that makes it easy to keep them warm until they 're all ready to serve . YMMV , but I find this to be the case for a whole lot of stovetop cooking ; with the direct heat , it 's very easy to dry foods out before they 're cooked to the stage you want . It 's far easier to control the heat in an oven and just use the stove for an initial ( or final ) fry/sear .
Alton Brown talked about this on an episode of Good Eats , and here 's what I remember : If you cut with the grain , you 'll end up with long strands of protein , like this : From what I understand , this means that it 'll be pretty chewy . Your mouth has to work harder to break the strands up into smaller pieces to be more easily swallowed . If you cut against the grain , you get strands like this : You can see that the strands are much shorter , which means the meat will fall apart more easily ( each strand does n't have as much surface area to connect to adjacent strands ) and will therefore be more tender .
Probably the jelly is something like the brand Oetker which comes clear or fruit-flavoured . It is indeed poured warm ; cheesecake will survive if it 's a cm or less layer . Alternatively , boil up some apricot jam ( or strawberry ) , take off heat a few minutes and sieve through a tea strainer over cheesecake . Keep stirring the pot if you are slow .
You will get the roasty , caramelized flavors ; how much influence they will have on the overall flavor of your stew will depend on several factors including : How deeply you roast the them How much you add , proportionately , into the stew How strongly flavored the other items in the stew are Roasting the vegetables will also cook them , so you will want to add them to the stew much later , so they do n't overcook . If you google <URL> , you will find several recipes for inspiration . As to whether this is a superior , or heartier flavor , that would be a matter of opinion . You do n't mention roasting celery or onions ( partners with carrots in the classic mire poix ) , but these are also excellent candidates for roasting , as are all types of root vegetable .
You 're going to have to start over with new chocolate . I 'm sorry to say it but there 's no way to remove the salt from the chocolate .

How long will infused alcohol last ?
I use " one step " to sanitize bottles and caps , like you would do for beer , and bottle my infusions in that , and they 've lasted > 3 years . I 've done raspberry and cherry vodka . If the alcohol percentage is high enough , it will kill bacteria or mold , so it 's pretty safe for long term storage . Probably depends on the final alcohol percentage though , like if you add enough juice that the percentage goes less than 10 or so percent , you have to have more precautions in sanitizing everything . I usually sanitize anyway because it ca n't hurt , and I already have the equipment to do so from homebrewing .
Olives are basically cured in salt , so they will last a very long time . They will last even longer if kept in an air-sealed container in a refrigerator . They will last even longer than that if kept in a salty brine which covers them with liquid and minimizes exposure to air .
There are charts for when bacteria and parasites die . You will just have to check the internal temperature of the meat with a thermometer . Once it has reached the minimal temperature which makes you feel safe , you can remove it from the heat . It does n't matter if you are steaming or using any other method . This is a safety-oriented chart from Jeff Potter 's book <URL> . And this is a detailed protein chart from McGee 's <URL>
Alcohol does not make the meat tender . It even prevents the outside surface of the meat to fully absorb the flavours . Then again , most marinades do n't penetrate into the meat anyway . When it comes to Shashlik , I think what is working for your uncle , is the time the meat spends in the fridge getting aged ( they probably marinate for a day or more ) and the enzymes break down the meat . It is a myth that Alcohol or Acid make the meat tender . In fact , they have the opposite effect . Per food author <URL> : Alcohol does denature and dehydrate meat and fish tissue , and the stronger the alcohol , the stronger this effect . What you should do instead , is to cook off the alcohol from your marinade first . The ingredient that keeps the meat juicy is salt which most marinades have . The less acidic marinade ( beer versus wine ) the more tender the meat . However , some not so acidic wines end up flavouring the surface of the meat enough to provide a pleasant byte .
In the freezer , more-or-less indefinitely , depending on how good your freezer is . Certainly months to years . In the fridge , it depends on the kind of mole . Quick moles ( like various green moles ) do n't keep very long , maybe a week at most . A long-cooked mole should keep a bit longer -- up to 2 weeks -- since all of the ingredients are completely cooked . If you 're not planning to use it within a week , though , why not freeze it ? The texture wo n't take any harm from freezing and thawing .
The short answer is 1-2 years for traditional pickles , assuming a good recipe with adequate salt content and fermentation time ( traditionally anywhere from a month to a few months ) . For modern quick fermented homemade recipes , where the pickles are fermented in a week or so instead of months , I 'd recommend using them up within a month or two . Some representative sources ( note the bolded bits about fermentation time ) : " Fermented or processed pickles also have a very long shelf-life , about two years . " ( <URL> ) " FERMENTED PICKLES : The oldest method of pickling , when a naturally occurring bacteria transforms the sugars present in the ingredient into an acid , preserving the food . These are called ' processed ' pickles , and though they take as many as five weeks to cure , they last up to 2 years . " ( <URL> ) " The product is completely fermented in 3-6 weeks ... In contrast to salt stock brining procedures [ i.e. , pickles removed from their liquid after fermentation and stored in a very heavily salted tank for future processing ] , genuine dill pickles do not require desalting and are often sold with the filtered fermentation liquor that is produced during the process . The product must be consumed within 12 months . " ( <URL> ) While these are common estimates , many books on the subject wo n't even give such shelf-life estimates ( e.g. , Sandor Katz 's The Art of Fermentation ) , because there is so much variability depending on recipe and storage conditions during and after fermentation . The other issue is that fermented brined pickles are " alive " in the sense that they continue to have microbial activity even after refrigerated . Unless you " process " the pickles after fermentation by heating to a high temperature and canning , you should expect that pickles will change their taste and texture continuously . You might like pickles that are " just finished , " but dislike their flavor or texture after a month or two in the fridge ( or the reverse ) . Traditional pickle-makers often take advantage of these changes , for example by selling " half sours " which taste like something between a fresh cucumber and a pickle and have only been partially fermented . " Half sours " and other pickles that have not completed fermentation before refrigeration have a much shorter shelf-life ( usually a few weeks ) , because the lack of full acidity in the liquid and remaining sugars and other nutrients in the cucumbers may still allow other things to grow and for spoilage to occur . Even after a longer fermentation , expect pickles to gradually get more sour and to soften in texture as the months go by . However , with adequate salt content and full fermentation , and as long as you are not contaminating the storage container , there 's no reason to expect they will actually " go bad " at refrigerator temperatures for at least a few months and potentially much longer . Traditionally , long-storage pickled cucumbers were fermented in ( and subsequently stored in ) a cool place , like a root cellar or other underground compartment , which probably stayed around 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit most of the year . At these cooler temperatures , pickles usually needed to ferment for at least a month and sometimes a few months before achieving full flavor . Since the root cellar temperatures were often above refrigerator temperatures , they would then continue to get even more sour and gradually begin to break down as the months went by . However , the purpose of storage was to have cucumbers available throughout the year , so last year 's batch would be used up and then be replaced by the new harvest . Today , most people tend to ferment homemade pickles faster ( often at room temperature ) and often with less salt than the season-long ferments of the past would use . This produces pickles more quickly , sometimes in as little as a week or so , with pickles that are not as extreme in their sourness and saltiness as the long-storage pickling of the past . The flavor profile can also be somewhat different , due to greater activity of some microorganisms at room temperature . Depending on the recipe , they are often not as stable and should probably be consumed within a few weeks or months . ( For example , Alton Brown 's relatively fast pickle <URL> recommends storing the pickles no longer than two months in the refrigerator . )
As with all can goods , as long as the can has no physical defects ( meaning swollen or dented , ectera ) , the contents should still be good . The date on the outside is mainly a best by date , after which a company will no longer vouch for the contents contained therein .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
The following is paraphrased from Andrew Whitley 's excellent book Bread Matters Wheat leaven If you intend to use within 2 days , store the it at ambient temperature For 2-14 days , store it in the fridge . Optionally refresh it before use . For longer , refresh then freeze . Refresh again after thawing . Rye sourdough 0-3 days -- ambient temperature 3-30 days -- fridge , no need to refresh Longer -- refresh then freeze . Refresh again after thawing . Whitley describes " constructive neglect " . He keeps a rye sourdough in his fridge that 's several months old , so that he can demonstrate to students how easily he can take 50g of it and produce a lovely sourdough from it within 16 hours . It 's a great book .
I have always made sure that I only defrost enough to meet the needs of the moment for sushi . If you cut the blocks into 4 to 8 rolls worth , they should defrost under running water in just fifteen to twenty minutes , just about the time it takes me to do a batch of sushi rice . That said , fish once defrosted will start to lose flavor immediately but will remain edible for 2 days . Once it starts to smell , get rid of it immediately , and I would play it very safe on that " starts to smell " the faintest whiff should be enough to send it to the bin .
I 've had apricots that smell vaguely like alcohol before , especially the ones that are not completely desiccated but are still plump and only dried to about half or so of their original volume . I 've never had problems eating them and have n't had them go bad .
In theory the elements could last 10 's of years , there is nothing in typical electric element design that limits their life . I would expect modern oven elements to last at least ten years with daily use They may fail prematurely due to damage ( being knocked ) in the oven while hot , from surface oxidation due to improper cleaning , or because of slight manufacturing faults
It depends highly on how fresh the vanilla is when you buy it . At least here in Germany , vanilla beans from the most common super market brands are mostly parched and IMHO already out of order when you pick them up in the store . For several years , I have ordered my vanilla in larger batches from an independent importer ( current price is about 30US $ for 60 beans ) and I 've at least kept them for a year and a half or perhaps two . The quality of course deteriorates with time , but they are not going bad as in " can not be used anymore " . One problem is however that if the beans are too fresh , they are a little bit tricky to store properly . As scientifics already wrote , it is usually recommended to keep vanilla in an air tight container to prevent them to dry out . If the beans are very fresh and still moist , this will cause water to condensate and I suppose it is not good for the beans to soak in water for a longer period of time .
Not long at all . Usually 1 minute is enough . If it starts to turn brown , it 's been in there too long .
Last summer was a long time ago . The National Center for Food Preservation has this to say about <URL> Oils may be flavored with herbs if they are made up for fresh use , stored in the refrigerator and used within 2 to 3 days . There are no canning recommendations . ... Pesto is an uncooked seasoning mixture of herbs , usually including fresh basil , and some oil . It may be frozen for long term storage <URL> is a serious enough hazard with oiled herbs that I 'd not trust a dash of lemon juice on top of the oil to protect me from getting sick after 9 months storage . You 're much safer freezing the stuff as recommended . Ice cube trays produce nice pesto cubes that you can store safely in a freezer bag for at least a couple years .
Marsala is a <URL> , that is , a wine to which extra alcohol has been added . Therefore , you can store Marsala outside of the fridge , in a cool place ( 15-20 ° C ) , away from direct light . In these conditions a bottle can sit there for several weeks/months with no obvious degradation , as you would expect for fortified wines . Generally it is suggested to drink Marsala or similar wines , such as Porto or Banyuls , in the following 4/5 months , but I had bottles opened for a year or so and they were still good , although the flavour faded a bit . As for Marsala all ' uovo , it has pasteurized egg yolks in it , and even home-made recipes call for a pasteurization step . In general I would store home-made one in the fridge to be on the safe side , but do not serve it too cold . Commercial ones may also have preservatives ( aside from the added alcohol of Marsala ) in them , and are safe to leave in a cool place for several weeks .
There are two levels to this question . If you are using modern whipping cream as a starting point , then the trick for a longer lasting whipped cream is stabilization . If this is some farm bought milk you are skimming the cream from , then you have the additional problem that your cream is not fatty enough . Modern creams are concentrated with a centrifuge . To get good whipped cream , whip it cold until it <URL> . Stabilize the whipped cream by hanging it in a cheese cloth in the refrigerator or by adding gelatin.To use the gelatin , dissolve 2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin into 2 tablespoons of cold water . Work out the lumps . After the gelatin expands , mix in a quarter cup of cream and heat the mixture to dissolve the gelatin . Cool over ice and mix a bit . Complete 2 cups of cream and proceed as you would to finish your whipped cream .
Can you make bitters and spice-flavored tinctures at home ? Absolutely you can ! I do all the time - in fact , I 've successfully engineered a couple of bitters recipes , and even gave a homemade " holiday " bitters to friends as a Christmas favor last year . The process itself is simple and easy ; what is not easy is duplicating a commercial product such as Angostura . If you 're going to try , there are a few things you need to consider . First , extracted spice flavors will be different than the dry version . While many flavors in various spices and herbs are alcohol-soluble , not all of them are , or at least not to the same degree . You 'll also experience the flavor differently in a liquid form , backed up by the burning sensation of alcohol . Although you can expect to extract a very similar flavor to the raw spice , or similar to the flavor you 'd get in cooking or baking , it wo n't be exactly the same , and thus your palate is n't always the best guide to figuring out a precise blend of dry ingredients . A second related point is that of relative concentration and change over time . Some flavors will extract very quickly , and very strongly ; others take a while longer to mature . Cinnamon and clove are two very potent spices that come to mind ; use too much , or infuse too long , and they 'll completely dominate . ( Some bitters-makers get around this by infusing each of their spices separately , and blending them together until they get a desired combined flavor . ) Some spices will also develop a distinctly bitter note when infused . Since this is in fact bitters , that 's not a bad thing ; but again , it will be different from what you experience in the raw version . A third point is familiarity . Many of the spices used to create commercial and craft bitters are quite foreign to home cooks , even those who are pretty spice-savvy . Peppercorns , cinnamon , and dried citrus peels are all pretty common . But I bet you do n't have quassia chips , orris root , horehound , or scores of others found in bitters recipes . So here you 've got the problem that you simply may not be able to identify many or most of the constituent ingredients . Angostura reputedly has over 30 spices and botanicals that go into the mix . If your palate is sharp enough even to untangle them all , I salute you ; if you can identify them all too , you may be <URL> . In point of fact , it 's really difficult to duplicate Angostura at home . What you can do more easily is create similarly-styled " aromatic " bitters , or entirely original creations ( I 've got an apple-cranberry bitters that I 'm quite proud of ) . All you really need to do is add your spices to a strongly-alcoholic base and let them sit for a couple of weeks in a cool , dark place , agitating them every once in a while . Easy , but lengthy , so trial-and-error also takes a while . Many people start from a pre-existing recipe and that 's what I would recommend to get started . You can find good recipes in many craft cocktail books ( including one I 'd recommend that is <URL> ) or by scouring online . This will give you a good base to start with , and you can then start tweaking recipes that you like to branch out . Having done this myself , I 'll offer a couple of tips based on my own experience : You can use any spirit , but higher proof will produce a better extraction . Vodka is actually the best to use if you want a " cleaner " extraction - it will mask the flavor of the spices less than brown spirits . A lot of recipes use whiskey or brandy for the flavor that they add . In any case , I typically use spirits that are at least 100-proof ( or 50 % alcohol by volume ) . They help grab those alcohol-soluble flavors more effectively . Pay careful attention to quantity , whether you 're working from a recipe or developing your own . If your recipe calls for grams , do n't approximate - break out the scale . Remember the interaction of extraction time and relative concentration . Deviate too much and you can totally throw off the balance of your bitters , especially with stronger spices . The result probably wont be bad , but it will be different and probably not quite as good . This is why good bitters recipes are to be prized . Find a good source for your spices . The better product you start with , the better your result will be . You can find a lot of the less common ingredients in co-ops , health food grocers , and herbal-medicine shops . Usually you can buy these in bulk for a pretty good price . There are lots of online vendors , but I have n't found a single one yet to strongly recommend ; some have great prices but poor selection , others it 's the other way around . There is no better infusion vessel than wide-mouth mason jars . Do n't infuse in plastic , or flavors will leach their way into the vessel as well . Glass mason jars do n't have this problem , they are cheap , and they are ubiquitous . Keep in mind that all of this applies primarily to how I 'm interpreting your question : regarding the infusion of dried spices , herbs , or other bo
Egg yolks , optionally covered with water , and in a well sealed container should hold for about 2-3 days in refrigerator . You may also freeze them , but they require treatment with sugar or salt to prevent the proteins from turning them rubbery , at ratio of about ( per the <URL> ) : 1/8 teaspoon salt OR 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar or corn syrup per 1/4 cup of egg yolks ( about 4 yolks ) . Of course , you then have to adjust whatever recipe you use them upon thawing to account for the sugar or salt already mixed into the yolks . See also : <URL>
There 's too many factors to have a set percentage of oil that will stay , but lets cover a few common things that determine the oil in your final product . Heat of the oil : Your oil needs to be plenty hot enough to actually fry in . For fries , you 'll typically want to shoot for between 350-375 F . If you do n't have a thermometer , then get one ! If you really do n't want to get one , a white bread cube will fry brown in about 60 seconds at the right temp - but a thermometer is best . If the oil is n't hot enough to fry in , it will start to absorb the oil . So before you ever fry anything , get that oil up to temp ( and make sure its that way between batches ! ) . Coating of the fry ( or other fried food ) : A batter coating is just going to hold more oil than a plain french fry . If you 're trying to be health conscious about french fries ( but then again , why are you eating french fries !?! ) , avoid batter coating them and go with a ' plain ' fry . Post frying treatment : Shake , shake , shake ! Give the basket a good vigorous shake . Do n't have a basket ? Use a strainer or at least a cooling rack with a mesh-type grate . You 're trying to physically shake as much oil off the fry as you can . Additionally , I like to lay them on paper towels and then fold the paper towels on top . See all that oil ? Simple math , if its on the paper towel , its not in the fry anymore . Crowding the pan : If you crowd the pan you fry in , you 'll lower the temperature of the oil and give the oil not enough circulation . This means longer to fry and more time not at the right temperature . This means more oil in the final product . Its better to do some smaller batches than to try to cram it all in one batch . The right oil : The main thing here is that you need an oil that can fry hot enough without smoking . This goes back to the right temperature . ( In case it had n't sunk in yet , temperature is important ! ) If you ca n't get it hot enough , then you 're going to absorb a lot of oil . Olive oil is a bad choice . I usually use peanut or canola oil .

How to peel peaches ?
By far the easiest method is to use a pan of hot water and a bowl of ice water . Essentially , bring a pan of water ( enough water to cover the peach to a boil . Meanwhile , with a sharp knife , make a small ' X ' shaped incision in the top and bottom of each peach . When the water is boiling gently place a few of the peaches into the water and simmer for around 20 seconds , just until the skin can be seen coming away . At this point use a slotted spoon to remove the fruit from the boiling water and place them in the ice water . After 20 or 30 seconds you should be able to remove the skin with your fingers . The same technique is used with tomatoes
You can use an old tooth-brush it will give better results
I assume you are referring to standard , grocery store , cavendish bananas - They have a ton of water and sugar and have a very delicate texture . This makes them easily disintegrate and get gummy instead of crisp . The key is to deep fry them at a fairly high heat until they are dark and crisp . It also helps to use greener bananas that will hold together better . Butter is not well suited to this because of the necessary oil depth and high heat . Not only would it take a fair bit of butter but the butter would start to burn . Even clarified butter would n't be ideal . Vegetable oil or shortening would be the way to go . Additional notes : To make frying them easier bananas are often coated in something starchy - like a tempura batter . Recipes abound and they are , in my opinion , much better than frying the bananas on their own . <URL> Plantains are more often fried because they are much more starchy than Cavendish bananas . Plaintains actually become sweeter when fried .
You could use them , together with the core , to make apple-glaze ( for your pie ) . Cover everything with water , simmer about 30 min , strain , simmer until you reach the desired density .
My kids love a similar recipe , but they also like them softer . What I do is reducing the second baking time by half . Be aware that the shelf life of the biscotti is also reduced ! ... Not a problem in my case since they do n't survive more than two days ... Edit <URL> Though modern biscotti are associated with the Tuscan region of Italy , the popular Italian cookie traces its origins to Roman times . The word biscotto derives from " bis , " Latin for twice , and " coctum " or baked ( which became " cotto , " or cooked ) . The Roman biscotti were more about convenience food for travelers rather than a pleasurable treat for leisurely diners . Unleavened , finger-shaped wafers were baked first to cook them , then a second time to completely dry them out , making them durable for travel and nourishment for the long journeys -- Pliny boasted that they would be edible for centuries . Biscotti were a staple of the diet of the Roman Legions . After the fall of the Roman Empire in 455 C.E , the country was repeatedly sacked by the Visigoths , the Vandals and others . The people did their best to survive ; there was no culinary development . But with the Renaissance , cuisine also flowered . Biscotti re-emerged in Tuscany , credited to a Tuscan baker who served them with the local sweet wine . Their dry , crunchy texture was deemed to be the perfect medium to soak up the wine ( and how much more flavorful than dunking a donut in coffee ! ) . Centuries later , many still agree that dipping biscotti into Vin Santo is a perfect way to end a meal , or to while away an hour at a café .
When I make home made bread , I decide how much I 'm going to eat in the next day or two and leave that out on the breadboard , usually just covered with a tea towel . I usually put the cut side down on the board to help prevent it from drying out . The rest gets pre-sliced , put in a zip-top bag , and stashed in the freezer . A few minutes in the toaster oven , and the bread is good as new . Pre-slicing it allows you to just use what you need instead of thawing the whole loaf . It lasts pretty much indefinitely in the freezer .
I would leave the peel in . It can continue to improve the flavor , and makes it look like citrus sugar instead of just plain sugar ( important for a gift ) . Be sure to include a note that it should be used within a few weeks , though .
Cooking time will vary greatly depending not only on the cut of fish but also the cooking method . In general , your cod will be done when it reaches an internal temperature of 54 ° C ( 130 ° F ) , regardless of cooking method . Here are some times/temperatures that work for me : Sous Vide : 10 minutes or more at 56 ° C , followed by a quick broiling/grilling/blow torch . Baking ( thick fillets ) : 15 -- 20 minutes at 218 ° C ( 425 ° F ) . Baking <URL> : 15 minutes at 232 ° C ( 450 ° F ) . Deep Frying : 7 -- 8 minutes at 190 ° C ( 375 ° F ) . Steaming : 6 minutes . Poaching : I like to add the fish to the cooking liquid while the liquid is room temperature . I bring it to a simmer , and then turn the heat to low , cover , and cook for about 15 minutes . Pan Frying : This is n't quite as popular a method as the above for cooking cod , however , if you want to do it , I would recommend cooking it on high heat , flipping once the opaqueness has reached about halfway up the side of the fillet . Basically , it does n't matter which method you use as long as your cod ends up with an even internal temperature of around 54 ° C ( 130 ° F ) .
This is one of the reasons I hate working with liquid lecithin - it 's the most viscous and sticky substance I 've ever had in my kitchen ( or , frankly , anywhere ) . Prevention seems to be the best approach ; try not to let the lecithin directly touch any utensils or cooking surface . Grease up your spoons , preferably with something reasonably solid at room temperature like coconut oil , butter , or margarine . That makes the lecithin slide off more easily , and you only need to clean off the grease afterward ( i.e. with soap ) . The only way I 've been able to clean surfaces or utensils coated with the lecithin itself is lots and lots and lots of warm water and paper towels . Warm water is important since lecithin does not dissolve very well in cold water . Good luck - personally , on the infrequent occasion that I need lecithin these days , I just stick to the granules .
Simple : grate it . If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane , it should have a strong , distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away . If it does n't , it 's lost its flavor , throw it away and buy new . It 's fairly likely you 're going to end up replacing it . I 've never seen nutmegs get moldy before , and I live somewhere with 80 % humidity . It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold .
I would keep the one that you are eating the next day out . I would then freeze the rest of them . If you like them warm , you could freeze them wrapped in foil . Before eating pop them in a toaster oven until gently warmed through . If not I 'd freeze individually until solid then put in a bag to prevent your frozen bagels from sticking together , then thaw overnight ( if eating in the morning ) or in the morning ( if eating for a mid-day meal ) to eat .
If the ice cream mix is setting up but tending to leave a buttery coating in your mouth the best thing would be to try cutting back on the cream and replacing it with whole milk or half &amp; half . If it 's a recipe that you 've used in another machine with great success but it does n't seem to in this one , it 's probably a case of how long the frozen bowl is staying cold . I have used the freezer bowl ice cream attachment for KitchenAid machines and have been frustrated more times than not as it does n't freeze up as it should . Too much sugar can also be a culprit in the mix not freezing quick enough . Sugar does n't freeze so a really sweet mix is going to be softer . You might try decreasing sugar content slightly ... not too much or you will end up with an icier result ( If adding fruit to ice cream , combine the chopped fruit with some sugar and cook just a little to allow the sugar to dissolve and the moisture to evaporate . The sugar soaking into the fruit will keep the fruit softer in the ice cream instead of forming icy chunks of fruit . Or , just mix in fruit preserves . ) Make sure that the mix is VERY cold , ideally chilled for several hours or overnight before it goes into the the freezer . If time is n't on your side , then quick-chill it in a metal bowl or container in an ice bath and stir frequently to help chill it throughout . The primary indicator for most ice cream freezers is that the dasher starts to sound labored in its attempt to stir the mix . Or if cranking by hand , you start to sound labored in your attempt to crank it ! Another factor that can affect freezing of ice cream ( although probably not the case in your instance since you do n't have control of the speed ) is the speed of the machine . In the case of the KitchenAid insulated bowl for freezing ice cream , they warn not to go faster than " stir " or the mix wo n't have a chance to freeze to the side of the bowl before the dasher scrapes it . I would try one of their recipes with it to see if it freezes up firm enough without turning to butter and then compare differences between your current recipe and theirs , adjusting sugar , milk to heavy cream ratio , etc. .
No peeling is needed . A good wash and proper cooking will handle all of your food safety needs .
To expand michaels answer ( assuming that you want strawberry icecream and not pieces of strawberry mixed in ) . If you are making a custard ice cream , leave the amount of egg yolks the same , because you want the lecithin from them . Reduce the sugar somewhat , because fruit is sweet . Then decide how much fruit puree you want ( maybe 1/3 the volume of the dairy part ) . Adjust the volume of the dairy so that the liquid is correct . Adjust the fat of the dairy so that the fat content is correct . Example , you start with the recipe for vanilla ice cream French ( = custard ) style by Lebovitz . 1 cup ( 250ml ) whole milk ; A pinch of salt ; 3/4 cup ( 150g ) sugar ; 1 vanilla bean , split lengthwise ; 2 cups ( 500ml ) heavy cream ; 5 large egg yolks ; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract This recipe has 185g fat ( I calculated with 30 % fat in the cream ) , 460g dry matter ( this is both fat and non-fat ) and yields 990g ice cream ( rounded a bit ) . Let 's say that you decide to use 200g strawberry puree . 200g strawberry puree has 10g sugars , 18g dry matter and no fat . A mixture of 5 yolks , 140g sugar ( if you want , you can look at the fructose sweetness coefficient and change the sugar accordingly , but I think this is n't so much of a problem if we just substitute the 10g from strawberries ) , 200g strawberry puree and some salt and vanilla has 25g fat , 225g dry matter and weighs 430g ( rounded ) . You could create two equation systems , the first for the total volume of the dairy mixture needed , and the second one for the ratio of cream to milk , and solve these to get to a mixture with the original ratio . fatamount/total = fatpercentage liquidamount/total = liquidpercentage fatpercentage + liquidpercentage + nonfatdrypercentage = 1 where you know fatamount , liquidamount and nonfatdrypercentage is around 0.1 ( actually 0.08 for milk only and 0.12 for cream only , but we do n't need so much precision ) . Solve for total , then calculate fatpercentage . 0.3 * cream + 0.04 * milk = fatpercentage * ( milk + cream ) milk + cream = total I will take a shortcut here . I specified almost as much strawberries as milk . They have no fat ( unlike milk ) , but a similar ( actually higher ) amount of dry mass . So let 's see what happens when we keep the 500g cream and turn the 50g difference between strawberries and milk into cream too ( because we suspect we want some more fat ) . Then we have 190 g fat , 290g dry matter and 980g ice cream base . At 19.38 % fat , we are above the ratio given in the article , but close to the original ratio ( and I suspect that the article might be about Philadelphia style ice cream , which has less fat ) . The 29.59 % dry matter are again outside of the article recommendation , but close to the original recipe . In fact , I assume that well emulsified fat can prevent ice crystal creation , so the higher liquid content does n't create problems here ( also note that McGee gives a 10-20 % range for fat in ice cream , not 7-12 % ) . Long story short : do n't add fruit puree , it is mostly water . Substitute puree for milk , calculate the new percentage of fat and dry matter ( use the 7-12 % fat and 37-42 % liquid for a recipe without emulsifiers , you can be freer if you have emulsifiers ; egg yolk counts as emulsifier ) . If you are still not there , try the calculation with less puree , or increase the fat and/or dry matter until you are in the recommended range . Or just start with the equations . NB # 1 I did n't check my calculations , could have a mistake there . But the principle should be correct . NB # 2 I calculated with cream density of 1 . This was somewhat surprising , but the nutrition data for cream I found insists that a cup of cream ( 240 ml ) weighs 238 g , so the difference is small enough to not go to the trouble to convert . A recipe given by volume probably ( hopefully ) has some leeway , so this should n't skew the results into a bad recipe .
Although ours rarely lasts for more than a week , we typically just store it in an airtight container with the rest of the cereal . I would imagine the fat could eventually go rancid , so if you need to store it for weeks or months , either refrigeration or freezing should work . You 'll still want the airtight container , however , to prevent any fridge funk from tainting the taste .
You can put a cup/bowl of water ( you can also add some vinegar if you do n't mind the smell ) in there , heat it up to boiling , let the steam out . Then you should let it sit in the microwave without opening the door . Wait for a few minutes , open the microwave , and wipe off the inside . All that steam should have soften any stains or food pieces left in there . You may spray some natural cleaners or lemon/vinegar mixtures to wipe off the inside more .
Depends on the type of cabbage , but I 've had success with prepping as if I was about to boil , and then freeze on a dry cloth ; Once frozen , transfer to an air tight freezer bag , and use as fast as is practical .
Depends on the apple . Apples with softer skins will bake to a more even consistency , but apples with tough skin ( the ' shiny ' kinds like McIntosh or Red Delicious ) tend to get caught in your teeth and throat , and are generally a pain to eat . If you do make a pie with the skins on , use smaller pieces of apple or slice around the apples to create shorter pieces of peel . These are easier to eat and do n't get caught in your mouth as much .
A roux normally is equal parts fat and flour . It should be fairly solid , not runny . However , it is an individual decision . I 've known guys who like it quite solid ( like me ) , but you have to whisk the hell out of it to get out all of the lumps . Normally , if I am making a sauce or soup that I ca n't strain , I will make it a little slack . I also add my roux after so I can control the thickness of the sauce or soup . Normally you are not instructed to do so , but you have greater control . If you do it this way , you have to vigorously whisk while adding , or the starches will congeal together in lumps . No big deal if it you are able to strain , but ...
You want to minimize gluten formation , like in making pastry . So , use a low-gluten ( pastry ) flour . That recipe uses cornstarch alongside flour , which makes sense . You also want to , as much as possible , minimize water and coat the starch granules with fat . So , you might try spinning the flour and fat in a food processor before mixing in the wet ingredients . Definitely use the brandy -- same idea as vodka in a pie crust which helps to prevent gluten formation !

How to get fresh green peas ?
Yes , you would remove the peas from the pods . <URL> shows how to do it efficiently . And no , the pods are not normally eaten , although according to <URL> you can .
When I buy hot chilies , I look for firm , uniformly bright ( or dark , depending on the type ) green specimens . Unless I 'm in a big hurry , I pick through the pile and choose them individually . I avoid any that are soft , discolored ( including the ends ) , missing caps ( the part that attaches to the stem -- they spoil faster after this is removed ) , wrinkly or otherwise look damaged or old . If your store does n't have any that look bright green , crisp and plump , try to find a new place to buy them , or just buy them in smaller quantities and get the least disreputable specimens and use them immediately . You want to buy chilies from a place that has a high turnover on them and most supermarket produce sections do n't really do that much business in hot peppers , so they tend to sit for a while . My favorite place to buy green chilies is at Indian markets ( the busier , the better for turnover ) , second favorite is other Asian food markets , then other specialty markets from places that like spicy food , then farmers ' markets , then a long way down the list , regular grocery stores . When I get them home , I clean them off by hand ( remove any stray leaves or any bad ones I accidentally missed , etc ) and put them in the fridge in a lightly closed baggie . If I bought a large amount ( or if I happen to be growing them and have a lot ripe at once ) , I will sometimes freeze them . I have a small bag of frozen habaneros at home right now . The texture is most definitely affected by freezing , but the flavor is n't ( unless you keep them so long that they get freezer-burned ) , so if you are planning to cook with them , freezing is perfectly fine . I usually do n't wash them before storing , just pick them over . I wash them just before using them , whether I get them from the garden , the store , the fridge or the freezer . If I have chilies I 'm not sure about , I do smell and taste them to see if they are ok . If they feel/smell/taste weird , I do n't put them in the dish . I 'd rather replace green chilies with red pepper powder instead of using something iffy .
Sometimes the outer leaves are a bit leathery ( especially if the quality is n't too god ) . When that 's the case I remove them first . Next , I remove the green stalks -- but Jefromi is right , the tiny leaves are delicious . The kernel in the middle near the base of the fennel bulb is very hard . I usually cut it out by halving the bulb along its length and making two incisions with a sharp knife on either side of the kernel . I chop the rest of the bulb so that it yields thin concentric slices .
Baking soda seems to work well for me , but the best thing is to get rid of old food that is causing the smell , and seal strong-smelling foods in airtight containers .
You can use Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening : its is on PETA 's ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) shopping list of baking goods , but can work just as well for frying as lard .
You need to warm them up a bit . There are a number of ways to do this 20 or 30 seconds on a griddle ( or a <URL> if you have one ) wrap a stack in foil and place in 325 oven for until warm wrap a stack in a clean towel and steam them using a steamer slightly moisten a towel and wrap it around a stack and microwave them for a bit If you 've warmed them and they are still tearing then your tortillas are no longer fresh .
Preface : I 'm not a big fan of fruit-flavored stuff ( I like fresh fruit by itself , just not in stuff ... ) so I ca n't speak to these from personal experience . For fresh fruit , puree in a blender or similar . Moist fruits can probably be pureed in their own juices ; otherwise , you 'll need to add some . You 'll probably want to add some sugar , but offset this by reducing the sugar you add to the ice cream mix . ( Seeds might be an issue too - get seedless if possible . ) As Manako suggested , you can also cook it down and then puree , though this will result in a wetter mixture than with their natural juices alone . This will also present a different flavor profile from the fresh fruit , so experiment to find what you like . Another possibility would be to cook out some of the water from your puree . In any case , you 'll want to reduce the liquid ingredients of your normal recipe by roughly the same amount as the pureed fruit you 're adding . In light of the previous item , you 'll probably want to use a higher-fat cream than normal , since the fruit will add a lot of water . Unlike " chunky " additions , you do n't really care that the ice cream should be at a thick consistency before you add them . ( for suspension ) I 'd just add it directly to the mix before you start churning .
Try using a bow style bread knife . It works well because it allows you to put pressure on the opposite side of the loaf . Also , the bow helps you visually line up the slice .
If you are really set on doing this , just use the same amount by weight or volume , preferably peeling the tomatoes first . ( Cut an x in the bottom , dip in boiling water for 10 seconds , pull off the peel ) . You 'll have plenty of liquid coming out of the tomato , do n't worry about that . But honestly , I do n't recommend doing this . Fresh tomatoes that are any good are so good uncooked that it is a waste , and fresh tomatoes that are n't good wo n't get better by cooking them . Even Mario Batali says you should use canned tomatoes for cooked sauces .
They are a little hard to find , but if you can find a " Bismarck " pastry tip , they have an elongated tip that is perfect for poking into your cream puff to fill . And , on a side note , a couple ways to keep your pastry tube from getting so messy ... Put it inside a drinking glass and fold it down over the sides to fill it . This holds it open and you 're less likely to spill all over the edges . Then , once you gather the open end , use a rubber band to tightly hold it closed . This reduces the mess dramatically .
You probably wont be able to get that exact result with a pastry bag because the almost perfect square grid they are divided into . I still think a pastry bag will be your best bet . I am not sure were you got that picture but my guess is that the tiramisu was machine made and the marks and peaks are from the tooling that was made for the machine to deliver the mascarpone topping . I would try a good sized round tip on a pastry bag and make my dot and slowly raise up and cut it off by stopping the pressure on the bag and pulling straight up . It has worked for me in the past . My background is not in pastry though so you may also just go to a local bakery or wedding cake designer and ask how they would do it . They will probably tell you .
To sweeten it , add your favorite sweetener : sugar , honey , agave ... whatever you prefer . This is important , because sweetness will help bring out the flavor of the fruit . General advice : If you have a fruit you want in your yogurt , pick the form ( chunks , pureed , mashed , juice ) that you want and mix it in . The Chobani yogurts appear have a variety of these forms , always along with some sugar . If you want banana flavor , sure , mash up a banana and mix it in . Or if you want chunks of fruit , chop it up . Assuming the fruit is soft enough , for this purpose , mashing with a fork is probably a good substitute for pureeing ; you 'll get some small chunks and some juice . In response to the updates : if you want actually fruit-flavored yogurt , then you need juice and/or puree . If you do n't have any other tools , mash it as best as you can . If you have a small food processor or blender that will work with small enough quantities ( or are making big batches ) , blend things up and stir them in . Juice and puree will disperse quite well through the yogurt . Bananas mash easily , especially ripe ones , so just do that with a fork . Strawberries are n't as soft , but you should get enough juice to flavor with if you mash them . Pineapple is tougher . If it 's juicy enough , you can probably get some juice out by mashing it ; otherwise you might be better off with a food processor or blender . ( If it 's from a can , you can use the liquid from the can , too - that might also have sugar in it . ) Depending on how thorough you are , you may want to use the juice and discard the fibrous parts that are left over .
Not sure how much rice you are making , but if making about 2 cups of rice , first heat 3 tablespoons of peanut oil over Medium High heat . Add the rice and toast it in the oil until it releases a nutty fragrance - about 1-2 minutes . Then I like to use Chicken stock ( 3 cups ) to finish it off . Personal preference but I like to add scallions ( green onions ) and cilantro to the rice when it is done . Cooking it this way I have not noticed a tremendous taste difference from different brands of Jasmine Rice .
The key is to have the finest possible salt . One way to do this is to take any salt you like , and grind it fine in a mortar and pestle . This just takes a few seconds , and then you can customize to a particular sea salt you enjoy and avoid the need to buy a special popcorn salt . A rotating action in the mortar and pestle ( as opposed to pounding ) is most efficient for grinding salt .
That is wax , it 's done to help keep the moisture in the root . Turnips are also . You know it 's getting along when it gets soft and spongy or when the skin starts to wrinkle , same with turnips , beets , parsnips , carrots ... You pretty much can tell whether they are good or not in exactly the same ways . Are the firm and crisp or soft , flabby and spongy ?
I 've also had this happen when cooking an onion-garlic paste . I 've found several web pages where the phenomenon is discussed , listed below . In summary , it 's normal and happens due to certain chemical reactions between the garlic , cooking utensils and water . In your case , it 's probably not due to the age of your garlic or onions though , as one source suggests it is less likely to occur with aged garlic . I 've only seen the paste turn green myself , though interestingly you could also get blue garlic : Garlic contains sulfur compounds which can react with copper to form copper sulfate , a blue or blue-green compound . The amount of copper needed for this reaction is very small and is frequently found in normal water supplies . Garlic Can Turn Blue Raw garlic contains an enzyme that if not inactivated by heating reacts with trace amounts of sulfur ( in the garlic ) and copper ( from water or utensils ) to form blue copper sulfate . The garlic is still safe to eat . Garlic can turn Green If the garlic was not fully mature or dry , pigments in the garlic may turn green when in the presence of acid . Garlic will also turn green ( develop chlorophyll ) if exposed to an temperature change or is exposed to sunlight . Some people say it can be stored for 32 days at or above 70 - 80 ° F to prevent greening , but I 'm not yet sure that is true . Green garlic is safe to eat .

To expand michaels answer ( assuming that you want strawberry icecream and not pieces of strawberry mixed in ) . If you are making a custard ice cream , leave the amount of egg yolks the same , because you want the lecithin from them . Reduce the sugar somewhat , because fruit is sweet . Then decide how much fruit puree you want ( maybe 1/3 the volume of the dairy part ) . Adjust the volume of the dairy so that the liquid is correct . Adjust the fat of the dairy so that the fat content is correct . Example , you start with the recipe for vanilla ice cream French ( = custard ) style by Lebovitz . 1 cup ( 250ml ) whole milk ; A pinch of salt ; 3/4 cup ( 150g ) sugar ; 1 vanilla bean , split lengthwise ; 2 cups ( 500ml ) heavy cream ; 5 large egg yolks ; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract This recipe has 185g fat ( I calculated with 30 % fat in the cream ) , 460g dry matter ( this is both fat and non-fat ) and yields 990g ice cream ( rounded a bit ) . Let 's say that you decide to use 200g strawberry puree . 200g strawberry puree has 10g sugars , 18g dry matter and no fat . A mixture of 5 yolks , 140g sugar ( if you want , you can look at the fructose sweetness coefficient and change the sugar accordingly , but I think this is n't so much of a problem if we just substitute the 10g from strawberries ) , 200g strawberry puree and some salt and vanilla has 25g fat , 225g dry matter and weighs 430g ( rounded ) . You could create two equation systems , the first for the total volume of the dairy mixture needed , and the second one for the ratio of cream to milk , and solve these to get to a mixture with the original ratio . fatamount/total = fatpercentage liquidamount/total = liquidpercentage fatpercentage + liquidpercentage + nonfatdrypercentage = 1 where you know fatamount , liquidamount and nonfatdrypercentage is around 0.1 ( actually 0.08 for milk only and 0.12 for cream only , but we do n't need so much precision ) . Solve for total , then calculate fatpercentage . 0.3 * cream + 0.04 * milk = fatpercentage * ( milk + cream ) milk + cream = total I will take a shortcut here . I specified almost as much strawberries as milk . They have no fat ( unlike milk ) , but a similar ( actually higher ) amount of dry mass . So let 's see what happens when we keep the 500g cream and turn the 50g difference between strawberries and milk into cream too ( because we suspect we want some more fat ) . Then we have 190 g fat , 290g dry matter and 980g ice cream base . At 19.38 % fat , we are above the ratio given in the article , but close to the original ratio ( and I suspect that the article might be about Philadelphia style ice cream , which has less fat ) . The 29.59 % dry matter are again outside of the article recommendation , but close to the original recipe . In fact , I assume that well emulsified fat can prevent ice crystal creation , so the higher liquid content does n't create problems here ( also note that McGee gives a 10-20 % range for fat in ice cream , not 7-12 % ) . Long story short : do n't add fruit puree , it is mostly water . Substitute puree for milk , calculate the new percentage of fat and dry matter ( use the 7-12 % fat and 37-42 % liquid for a recipe without emulsifiers , you can be freer if you have emulsifiers ; egg yolk counts as emulsifier ) . If you are still not there , try the calculation with less puree , or increase the fat and/or dry matter until you are in the recommended range . Or just start with the equations . NB # 1 I did n't check my calculations , could have a mistake there . But the principle should be correct . NB # 2 I calculated with cream density of 1 . This was somewhat surprising , but the nutrition data for cream I found insists that a cup of cream ( 240 ml ) weighs 238 g , so the difference is small enough to not go to the trouble to convert . A recipe given by volume probably ( hopefully ) has some leeway , so this should n't skew the results into a bad recipe .
There are actually two kinds of tonghao ( as it 's called in Mandarin ) . The one that looks like arugula is called shantonghao ( mountain tonghao ) . You can saute it with garlic . The ' regular ' tonghao has rounder leaves . Both types of tonghao are used in hotpots - you just cook them for a short while and they 're done . Similarly , they 're used in savory tangyuan soup . Tangyuan are small glutinous rice flour dumplings - some are filled with ground meat , some just plain . The savory soup has tonghao , tangyuan , and shallots . This is in Taiwan at least - I 'm not sure whether people do different things with tonghao in other areas .
I do n't know your exact prep but the best thing you could do is bring your dough to a completely thawed state , store bought will work fine . Make sure you beef is at room temperature before doing a quick sear , this will not only add flavor but will give you a layer of protection . Another problem that can occur is the puff pastry releases some steam and it needs some way to escape . After you have wrapped your piece of meat , take a knife and make small slits in it with the tip of a sharp knife . This will help release the steam and should take away the moisture . 425 degrees would be a good temperature to cook at and you should hit your ideal around 40 to 45 minutes . Hope this helps and let me know how to it turns out .
I use a liquid oil instead of a spray oil ; you 're far more likely to get hot spots with a spray , which is bad for any kind of cooking . That stuff works better as a grease than an actual cooking oil . I also tend to have pretty good success by frying the tortillas up to just a hint of golden-brown ( dark brown spots is overdone ) and then finishing it off ( i.e. to melt the cheese ) in a low-heat oven . As an added benefit , if you 're making a largish batch then that makes it easy to keep them warm until they 're all ready to serve . YMMV , but I find this to be the case for a whole lot of stovetop cooking ; with the direct heat , it 's very easy to dry foods out before they 're cooked to the stage you want . It 's far easier to control the heat in an oven and just use the stove for an initial ( or final ) fry/sear .

How to prepare chanterelles ?
The basic technique that I 've found effective is to " dry fry " them in a pan to allow water to cook off before adding any other wet or fat ingredients , including oil or butter . If you skip this step , you 'll often end up with a bit of a rubbery texture . I recommend cooking them in a small cast-iron pan , but a nonstick pan will do . I usually season with little more than shallots and/or garlic , plus butter , salt and pepper . But I always add the butter after a fair amount of water has been extracted from the mushrooms and cooked off . Chanterelles seem to have a lot more water than most other mushrooms . I have n't verified that scientifically , but I tried following the same technique with button or small crimini mushrooms , and little to no water comes out in dry frying . ( Large crimini mushrooms , also called portabella mushrooms , will give off a fair amount of water when roasted , but nothing quite like fresh chanterelles ) . Shiitake and even oyster mushrooms do n't give off much , either .
The leaves are often referred to as " beet greens " , which might return some more search results . I usually see them treated similar to spinach or swiss chard ; that is , either served raw in a salad , or blanched and/or sauteed , perhaps with some garlic and olive oil .
Basically , it is that easy . But it is a costly endeaver . I have know chefs to make it with a pure olive oil or grape seed oil . Some heat it to 220 degrees or so but I have meet some that do n't . The ones that did n't made sure to pull the oxygen from the bottle with one of those wine vacuum savers . I have been told self made truffle oil will lose it truffle flavor due to most the flavor actually coming from an odorant . I have not personally made any so I ca n't speak from experience on how long it will hold . All the above being said . If I had the money to buy some truffle , I am not sure the best use for them would be to make truffle oil .
It 's easiest to skin the deer when it 's still warm , but since that is n't an option let it hang for a day or two , if the weather is n't going to get above around 40 degrees F . If this is your first time , definitely have a helper on hand to help you hold the deer . Have a hacksaw and a sharp knife on hand . A small electric knife/chainsaw is helpful but not necessary . Growing up , this is how we did it : Peel the hide off ( start from top , go to bottom ) . Cut out the tenderloins with your knife . Quarter the deer with the hacksaw and bring the quarters inside individually to cut further . Be sure to look up some more videos/articles , but it 's not too difficult . Have plenty of freezer bags and freezer space on hand . It helps to have a " team " cutting up the quarters ... it 's not hard but it 's a lot of work . Enjoy !
The answer depends on where you live , and what type you have brought . In many countries that import chickpeas they heat treat them to kill seed-borne diseases and insects . The heat treatment process makes them more difficult to cook , and soaking times double or triple . Beans from exporters with phytosanitary certificates can be imported without heat treatment ; these are the ones you want to get . I do n't think you can tell which is which by looking at them . At the moment we have some particularly dark , dry , and dead looking beans that soak up beautifully in 8 hours ! Soak non-heat treated beans for 8 to 12 hours , heat treated beans for 24 to 36 hours . Some overly heat treated beans will never fully revive , and you are best to return these to the shop as " faulty " . Soak and cook without salt , unless you are going to mash them . They fall apart more readily if salted . If you are not mashing them , the secret to great chickpea taste is after soaking and cooking in water , is to lightly fry them with a little olive oil until dark spot appear , keep them or the pan moving so none burn . Then add the sauce , or add them to whatever dish you are preparing .
No you do not need to remove them , unless you 're talking about very large squid . Good to eat ? I prefer the flesh and not the tentacles , but basically anything that is n't what you remove when cleaning ( the internal ' bone ' and assorted goop attached to it ) is fine . Best method for cooking is very , very fast -- squid needs fast nigh heat , usually no more than 40-60 seconds depending on size . Dust with cornstarch and deep fry very fast , or sautee in butter very fast . Too long and you will be chewing rubber .
As with all raw-meat or sushi dishes , this will never be 100 % safe to eat ; at best we are talking about a calculated food safety risk , with steps taken to mitigate that risk when possible . For this reason , it is CRUCIAL that the chicken be kept at fridge temperature as much as possible . When cutting , use a pre-chilled cutting board if possible , and serve immediately . For extra safety , blanch the chicken to kill surface pathogens , and slice off the cooked exterior . Given the slimy , gelatinous texture of raw chicken , I believe the best results would come from finely dicing the chicken ( small cubes ) or very thinly slicing it . These approaches seem to work well for sushi and tuna tartare , which have similar textures . As with sushi , you need a shaving-sharp knife to get clean cuts . For flavorings , your goals are twofold : add flavor and kill pathogens . An acidic sauce or marinade is obligatory , to reduce the pH below 4 and render it hostile to pathogens . The acidity should also reduce the slight sulfurous notes in raw chicken , by reacting with the sulfur in the molecules and making them less volatile . Taken to an extreme , this could produce a result much like ceviche , where the acid denatures the proteins and produces a texture akin to cooking . Fresh cut , finely-minced garlic is delicious and also hostile to pathogens . Many aromatic herbs also have antimicrobial properties , with fenugreek being a notable standout in this area . There are a couple ways you could develop this into a full dish from there : Do it up like a ceviche : fresh lemon/lime juice , garlic , chili flakes , onions , salt , and maybe a little cilantro or coriander . Go European : white wine vinegar , thyme , rosemary , parsley flakes , garlic , black pepper , salt , and maybe a little olive oil Go sushi ! Marinate it in rice wine vinegar , soy sauce , and spices , and serve it in sushi rolls , accompanied with a LOT of wasabi and pickled ginger . Those condiments help mitigate the food safety risk with their antimicrobial/antiparasite properties . Go sushi part 2 : marinate it as above , but serve alone with a horseradish-based sauce containing lemon . EDIT : Apparently there is a real recipe along these lines . Toriwasa , or chicken sashimi . I found several recipes using wasabi ( horseradish ) , soy sauce , parsley , and sake . The chicken 's exterior is cooked , but the interior remains raw . I should add a couple caveats to this : I have serious doubts about raw chicken as an ingredient , even with the best cooking possible . At best I think it will be edible but not delicious . The problem is that raw chicken is incredibly bland , and where it is n't bland , it has an unpleasant , slightly sulfurous flavor . The texture is somewhat off-putting too . I might be wrong , of course , but I think this is better handled as a theoretical exercise and not an actual dish . If you try any of these ideas and get food poisoning , it 's your own dang fault for eating raw chicken ... you boob .
<URL> recommends that you wrap the scallions ( or green onions ) in plastic wrap , and that site also says they 'll last 7-10 days that way . I actually wrap them in a damp paper towel and then in plastic wrap . I keep this little packet in the crisper drawer . I 've kept them about 2 weeks this way . Either way , each time you open the packet you should check for damaged parts and discard them .
Topside is quite a tough cut , so I 'd tend towards a longer cooking time ; as ' low and slow ' as possible , really . With other meats , escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts , like chicken breast or pork tenderloin , which would be cooked relatively quickly , so I 'm surprised your recipes call for topside .
Keep the fats as cold as possible before you start . Done right , it will more than compensate for the warmth of hands , blender/processor parts , and ambient temperature . Having somewhat chilled your choice of fats , separate them into small , 1 inch sized pieces , working with copious flour to keep them from sticking to one another . Place this in the freezer overnight . This allows the blade to chew up even near-frozen bits . I have n't noticed much degradation with this method , though I would n't the leave fats in for much longer than that . Mix your dry ingredients together . Put the thoroughly chilled fats in a blender/mixer , leaving some room . Then , using only as much dry ingredients as necessary , pulse the fats until you have pearls slightly smaller than fish gravel . This works especially good for blenders where the ingredients tend to get stuck at the bottom . If you get the chance , stow the blended stuff in the freezer while you work with the next batch . Once you have completed the blending en masse , you can add the rest of the dry ingredients . You should have a uniform texture to the whole mixture . Add water until the dough comes together with limited kneading . Wrap and return to fridge as soon as possible .
It 's actually hard to hold when it 's almost all the way cooked - it 'll start getting gluey if you let it cool off , but could start scorching on the bottom if it 's not stirred , and get too runny if you keep adding stock . Mario Batali said that risotto is n't finicky in the middle - so you can cook it part way , cool it down ( I think he said he spread it on sheet pans to cool quickly ) , then you can add hot stock and cook it from that point , so you 've already got a 10 minute head start . I 've also been to a restaurant where it was only served on the hour and half-hour .
For sure , @TFD is correct that you should be wary of Wikihow - in the link you shared , the proportions of ingredients listed at the top do n't appear to match the actual amounts of ingredients shown in the pictures . " Honey Roasted Peanuts " is a catch-all phrase that is used to describe just about any type roasted peanuts in a candy coating . The catch-all extends to recipes that do n't even call for much honey ( typically a touch of honey and a bunch of sugar ) and to recipes that do n't even call for much roasting . To get roasted peanuts in a candy coating using an oven , you either have to roast-then-coat or you have to coat-then-roast . The primary difference is oven time . If you use cooked peanuts , you only need to cook the coated nuts long enough for the candy coating to bake onto the peanut - you 're just honey-glazing the peanuts - they wo n't be in the oven nearly as long as they would be if you were roasting raw nuts . It 's a fairly quick process that 's easy enough to gauge by sight . Technically , you 'd be roasting the honey coating onto the nuts - not roasting the raw nuts in honey . Note - Planters nuts are labeled as " Dry Roasted Honey Roasted Peanuts " - the peanuts are dry-roasted first then coated then roasted again . Also , for what it 's worth , the ingredients list shows they contain more sugar than honey by weight : <URL> . If you use raw peanuts , you would need to keep them in the oven long enough for the peanuts to roast as well . Given the oven time your link recommends , raw peanuts would not cook - so that would be one fundamental reason why your link specifies that you not use raw peanuts . Potential flaws of Wikihow aside , your link proposes a way to roast honey onto nuts , not a way to roast nuts using honey . You can certainly honey-roast raw peanuts using more time in the oven - but the timing could present problems with the coat-then-roast method . The candied coating is going to brown as your mixture cooks in the oven making it difficult to visually gauge when your formerly raw peanuts have cooked sufficiently ( or if they are cooking evenly ) . Also , you should be aware that once nuts are cooked and hot , it is very easy for them to go from done to burnt in very little time - it is probably pretty easy to burn your mix if you overshoot the roasting . It would definitely be easier to determine when a honey glaze has roasted onto cooked nuts than it would be to know when raw nuts were finished cooking in a glaze . But if raw peanuts are easier to come by or if you want to have literally roasted honeyed peanuts , it 's definitely possible but I would recommend looking to a more reputable source for guidance ( especially for cooking time ) . And once you start roasting your mix , stir/rearrange the nuts thoroughly and frequently to insure even cooking and to keep burning at bay .
What country are you in ? Every country has some edible insects . Most are terrible . some are toxic , or have toxic parts that must be removed first . This knowledge is hard won , and not readily available . Traditional local people are your best source of information ( though the Coke and McD 's culture has killed that in most parts of the world ) In New Zealand they have the Huhu grub , and in Australia the Witchetty grub . Both of which are edible raw or cooked ( roasted on hot coals for a few minutes ) . They have slightly nutty flavours These are both soft wood eating larvae around 5 to 10 cm in length , quite plump and juicy . Such insects can be found around the world . But not all are edible
Assuming it 's a proper removable ( some old ones were n't ) inner crock pot you could ( as in your other answer ) . BUT That pot will take a long time to warm up when you put it in and turn it on . I would suggest assembling all the ingredients in another container ( which may also fit better in the fridge ) and turning them out in to the ( ideally preheated ) crock pot in the morning . Otherwise you will probably need to add some time even on top of the extra time for starting all ingredients at fridge temperature . This is roughly what the manual for our previous slow cooker recommended . Our new one is a non-stick steel inner pot ( for easy browning ) and will warm up much faster - there 's no recommendation to preheat this model .
Let the butcher do it This is roughly the bone structure of a mammal tail : As you can see , it has very many small bones , with of course all the connective tissue . Unless you have solid knife skill , a very sharp boning knife ( with the needle-like blade ) , a protective chain mail glove , and lots of patience , I would say something like this is better left for a professional butcher . Especially if you have not done much boning , this could easily end up in an injury . For reference Boning knives : Chainmain butcher glove :
Wash the shrimp and remove only the head . Insert a bamboo skewer along the shrimp from head to tail , running along the legs without touching flesh Drop into boiling , salted water for 3-5 minutes ( do not put a lid on ) ; after this period , they 'll change color and rise to the top . If they feel firm , they are cooked . Quickly place them into ice water , which helps them have good color and stops the flesh from shrinking and becoming hard . When shrimp are cold , remove from ice water and drain in a colander . To remove the skewer , use a screwing motion . For nigiri-sushi : Remove shell from around body , but not the tail . Butterfly cut open , cutting from head to tail along the belly with the knife only going halfway in . Use the knife or your fingers to open it up and flatten it carefully , without further breaking the flesh . Remove vein and rinse with lightly salted water . Lay on papertowels to drain . If using for sushi rolls , remove tail and cut in half lengthwise .
I have n't specifically tried to save that variety of squash , but I 've had good luck in general holding other varieties of winter squash for a few days by halving , sealing the cut side , and then refrigerating for . A few notes : If you have a large enough knife , just make a single cut through it . Either place it cut-side down on an appropriately sized dish with a flat bottom ( eg , a casserole dish ) , or cover the cut side with plastic wrap ... ( of plastic wrap , then set in the dish , so you do n't accidentally knock off the plastic wrap in the next couple of days ) . When it comes time to use the remaining half , if the cut surface is dry , shave a little off . Clean out the seed cavity when you 're finally going to use it . ( this allows you to scrape back down to moist flesh , and reduce evaporative loss ) How long you can hold it will likely be affected by things like how often you open your frdge . I 've never tried putting in the crisper after wrapping ( as I tend to have too much stuff in there already ) . If you 're looking to get the longest possible strands out of the squash , I think to need to cut it from stem to blossom end ... but that would increase the cut surface area . If that is n't a goal , it 's probably better to cut it across the stem-blossom axis .
If you are simply looking to convert gluten contents then you can certainly always go higher by adding the correct proportion of vital wheat gluten to dough to get the percentage of gluten that you want . However there are many other differences between flour bags in terms of processing . How is the flour ground ? What wheat variety is it from ? Is it white or whole ? There are a lot of variables . I do speak as someone who has found that Gold Medal is perfectly acceptable for all my baking needs and also routinely uses store brand flour . Personally I suggest simply trying whatever flour you want to try ( not including substituting bread for cake or something along those lines , that definitely will cause issues ) and seeing how the recipe goes . Determine if a higher-end flour brand is for you yourself .
Rinse the salsify first before using , that will help . Use a sharp peeler . Ive found that dull peelers create a lot more sap . as soon as you have peeled it , drop the salsify into acidulated water ( water + lemon juice ) . The acids help prevent the color change that occurs . Also wipe up the area with a damp cloth as you work . This will keep things clean and prevent your hands and everything you touch getting tacky .
The basic technique that I 've found effective is to " dry fry " them in a pan to allow water to cook off before adding any other wet or fat ingredients , including oil or butter .

Why do we soak and squeeze gelatine ?
Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the ( often hot ) food . If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid , you 'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch . It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing . You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess ( unflavored ) water from the exterior . Otherwise , each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water , which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up , and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body .
There are two reasons ( that have also been discussed in many other questions ) Baking powder is n't just sodium bicarbonate + acid . It often also contains aluminum compounds that release gas when they are heated . That means they will make bubbles not just when the batter is mixed but also when it is baking . Baking powder is ph neutral while baking soda is basic . Recipes will often include mostly baking powder with some soda to neutralize acidic ingredients . See also : <URL>
Okay , I did some more thorough searching and found <URL> . Apparently my mistake was that I was letting them ( the doughnuts ) cool off , and according to the article : Glaze is the easiest way to sugar-up a donut . But there are a few things you need to remember . First and foremost ... only glaze donuts when they 're warm . If you do it when they 've cooled the glaze just soaks in and get goopy .
Long story short : It 's the acid , and any acid will do . Food colourings are a type of dye known as an <URL> . Their effectiveness relies on hydrogen bonding which only works in an acidic environment . It 's not that the vinegar does anything special - not exactly . Rather , adding a few drops of food colouring to a large amount of water would give you something that 's not acidic at all , which will diminish or totally eliminate its effectiveness as a dye . Including vinegar in the mix simply allows you to stretch your rations , so to speak - to dilute the colouring in a whole lot of liquid without making it useless as a dye in the process . Basically , you 're creating a <URL> , which is a well-known term in the textile world , as it 's used to dye wool and other fabrics . Warm temperatures ( 140-180 ° F ) also aid in dye absorption , and apparently - although I 'm no expert in textiles - a small amount of Urea also helps . You could definitely use cream of tartar , citric acid or any other acid , but the recipes using vinegar are generally aiming for a specific pH , so you 'll want to adjust quantities of any other acidifier to match . Presumably , vinegar is just the cheapest and most widely available acidifier .
You might not be as consistent as you think . See <URL> . One thing that comes to mind is amount of flour , and how ( and how much ) you 're mixing -- but I do n't know that those would make it ' thin ' necessarily , but it would make them tough if you 're over mixing . It might be a temperature issue , if you 're using a solid shortening ( eg , butter ) rather than a liquid shortening . Also , although you said you 're cooking them for the same amount of time , inconsistent oven temperature might turn that into inconsistent baking -- you only want brownies to be set on the sides when you take them out of the oven -- they should fail a toothpick test if you want them fudgy . Cooking them until they 're ' done ' will result in them hardening up as they cool .
I 'm not sure whether you meant <URL> . If so : These are made of yeast-leavened dough which is quite soft . ( Yeast-leavened dough is also part of toast , pizza , bagels , some kinds of donuts etc. ) In addition , <URL> : Between two layers of dough there is a layer of solid fat ( like butter ) . I think that the fat will make the yeast-leavened dough " extra " moist . To make a simple yeast-leavened dough you need water , ( plain wheat ) flour , salt and yeast . Some other pastries require sugar , fat ( e.g. butter ) , replace water with milk , et cetera ... The flour needs to have <URL> otherwise the dough can not hold the tiny air bubbles that the yeast produces and the dough wo n't be able to rise . Plain wheat flour suits perfectly for this purpose . But it has a disadvantage : If you store the pastry wrongly , the pastry will be frumpy . ( 1 ) Just pick a nice receipe of cinnamon rolls and you 'll see :D If you want to know more about cooking and stuff : " Cooking for Geeks : Real Science , Great Hacks , and Good Food " by Jeff Potter ( O'Reilly &amp; Associates ) . Seems to be a nice book for geeks :D ( 1 ) Source : " Kochen für Geeks " - somehow I could not find the chapter about yeast in the English pendant .
Texture is the main reason , but if you 're going to be blending the sauce , there can be off-flavors from cracking open the seeds . Even if you do n't blend it , they can be these slippery little things that I never much liked growing up . To reduce the amount of waste , you can : cook the sauce , then put it through a food mill to strip out the seeds and skins , thus keeping you from wasting the gel around the seeds . freeze the peeled skins , to save for when you 're next going to be making vegetable stock . collect the seeds and gel , then put it into a muslin bag and hang to let drip to extract ' tomato water ' . ( you typically use crushed tomatoes for this ... I do n't know for sure if the gel will go through the muslin ) . Tomato water is strange as it gives good tomato flavor , without the red color .
For an astringent/bitter twist to the flavour , for a scent , and the visual gloss effect ** Mediterranean people have been doing this for centuries For best effect they are probably using a first cold press oil ( Extra-virgin ) from young olive trees ( less than 50 years old ) . It is often quite green in colour and has a pungent and astringent odour These are often only available from boutique olive farmers , in expensive small quantities e.g. . <URL> or <URL> . Expect prices around NZ$ 50 to NZ$ 100 per litre It is sort of similar in concept to squeezing a fresh lemon over a dish It 's a bit over fashionable at the moment , but in some dishes it really works ** the three s 's - sap ( or ) , scent , shine
I did a little bit of digging on the topic and found this TapTrip blog post : <URL> It also references a Cultura Bunka article in Spanish called <URL> To quote : During Muromachi Period ( 1336-1573 ) , japaneses [ sic ] used to transport the raw fish inside of baked rice to keep it conserved during long trips . Then , they started to eat this meal which was called sushi . [ ... ] But , making sushi was hard because took a long time and was a little expensive . Only during Edo Period ( 1603-1868 ) japaneses started to eat the raw fish freshly caught from the ocean with rice thanks to a sushiman called Hanaya Yohei . So it appears the short answer is indeed " just an accident of culture " ( or history ) so-to-speak . I will also quote from a short article <URL> * Raw fish dishses have been eaten since the Nara-era . At first , people ate raw fish pickled with vinegar as " Namasu " . Then , from the Muromachi-era , people started to eat " Sashimi " . And a bonus small bit on careful preparation of Sashimi : Sashimi is the main dish in the Japanese cuisine , and the cooks consider carefully the best way of cutting the fish , arranging the fish , shellfish and squid , give importance to the proper use of condiments , and the best combination of fish species when serving . The thickness of sashimi is determined according to the collagen ( main protein in the connective tissue ) content of the fish used . * [ Foods Food Ingredients J.

I suspect that your cheese curdled . This happens to me if I overheat the mixture - especially in the presence of acid . ( I do n't have any experience with using beer . ) The cornstarch is there as a safety net to prevent this but obviously it is not infallible . Turn down the heat and try adding a little more corn starch - it may not get back to perfect fondue but you may be able to pull it back to edible .
It boils down to chemical make up . Avocados , like egg yolks , contain a decent amount of fats , carotenoids , and sulfurous compounds . Avocados are one of the most concentrated fruit sources of fats and fatty acids . Both egg yolks and avocados contain carotenoid phytochemicals like lutein , zeaxathanin , and a-carotene . In avocados the sulphur is mostly in the form of glutathione , would likely break down into its cysteine during steaming . Cysteine is one of the primary sulphur sources in eggs as well . <URL>
Meat is pounded as a mechanical means of tenderizing by damaging the connective tissues . It also makes the meat thinner and flatter , which helps the meat cook faster and more evenly . Pound tougher meats ( cheaper steaks ) , and meats of uneven thickness ( chicken breasts ) . Avoid pounding the bones in the meat . You do n't want little pieces of bone chipping off into meal . Do n't pound already tender pieces ( premium cuts , dry aged steaks ) . Think tenderize , not pulverize . You should not be making any holes in it . If you 're going to marinate , do that after pounding . Wrapping the meat in wax paper first will help prevent a big mess . Do both sides of the meat .
I often use this technique at home to cook proteins . It shortens cooking time by using steam as a heat transfer medium to cook the top of the item at the same time as the bottom . You can also use this method on frittatas , dumplings , etc. . You can also use flavored liquids to impart flavor as well . I particularly like hard cider with chicken and pork .
The following excerpt answers questions 1 and 2 . Additionally it reduces the cooking time for the parboiled rice . Also known as converted rice , parboiled rice has been pressure-steamed and then dried in its natural outer husk ( which is later removed ) . This process hardens the starch in the grains so they remain firmer , less sticky , and separate when cooked . It also forces the vitamins and minerals from the outer layer of the grains into the endosperm , which is the part we eat . This makes parboiled rice a more nutritious option than regular ( unenriched ) white rice , which does n't retain any of the goodness of the nutrient-rich husk . There are several techniques you can use to prevent unprocessed cooked rice from sticking to each other : Use medium to long grain rice . Rinse the rice until the rinsing water is completely clear . Use the Boil and Steam method to cook the rice . In this method boil the rice for 5-10 minutes . Then pour off the excess water and steam the rice for an additional 10 minutes . This method of cooking the rice reduces the most starch on the outside of the rice which is what causes the sticking . Source : <URL>
In a word : Science ! The <URL> of an egg contains a large number of complex <URL> , which are large molecules composed of chains of <URL> . The specific combinations and ordering of those amino acids cause the proteins to fold up on themselves into complex structures , which in turn <URL> . The bonds which interact between amino acids and fold the protein in a specific way are fairly delicate , and they can be " denatured " or disrupted by the application of heat , salt , or acid , which changes the shape of the protein . The bonds can also reconnect to other , different bonds when the protein is in its new shape . So , when you heat an egg yolk , the proteins eventually change shape and bind to each other in a specific way that causes the physical changes we refer to as " curdling " . <URL> . This can be avoided when the yolks are heated gently because it takes a certain amount of heat to completely denature the proteins , and it takes a number of unfolded proteins interacting to bind into a new " curdled " configuration . When you heat gently , you 're giving the heat enough time to dissipate throughout the food , so that it does n't exceed that temperature in any given spot and there are n't lots of fully denatured proteins all in the same place . The proteins may still be changing shape , but they have n't reached the shape or concentration where they can bind together and curdle . Which is good , because when they do bind together , those bonds are stronger than the bonds that originally folded the proteins . At that point they 're permanently curdled and no amount of cooling will un-bind them and allow the proteins to re-fold on their own . ( EDIT : ironically , I stumbled on <URL> today which describes how some scientists have managed to do just that with certain egg enzymes . Weird ! ) The final configuration can also be mediated by other proteins , sugars , etc. in the food . For example , in scrambled eggs the proteins in the whites and yolks combined set differently than either of them do separately . The cooking process can also be done gradually enough to produce a smooth texture even if the proteins are completely denatured . For example , in <URL> egg yolks work together with liquid butter to form a smooth emulsion ; even though many of the yolk proteins may be denatured , they ca n't fully set into a curdled matrix because the butter proteins , fats , etc. are also present . A bit more detail on how to prevent curdling in specific culinary applications can be found <URL> .
It 's not so much the taste as the texture . If they have n't been sauted first , the onions stay relatively crunchy during the rest of the cooking . The same is true of the garlic , but you 'd usually have cut the garlic into much smaller pieces so it does n't take as long to soften up , hence kicking the onion off first and adding the garlic a bit later .
The most recent Cook 's Illustrated has a cinnamon swirl bread article that discusses this problem . According to them , the root cause is a lack of binding between the dough and filling . Gas from the yeast , and steam generated during baking , push into the spiral , creating pressure that compresses the dough and widens the gap . In the specific case of cinnamon bread , they recommend using powdered ( confectioner 's ) sugar instead of granulated , and using a large amount of cinnamon . The finer sugar dissolves more easily in moisture from the bread , quickly creating a paste that is reinforced by the cornstarch and by starches in the ground cinnamon . Misting the bread before adding the filling also helps . In order to make a sausage filling adhere to the bread , you would need a sticky , water-soluble element . Cornstarch or powdered gelatin spring to mind immediately as possibilities . The other tactic they employ is to actually expose the filling during proofing , preventing the yeast 's gas ( and later , steam ) from building up alongside the filling . Once the filling is rolled into the dough , the loaf is cut in half lengthwise . With the two halves laid side-by-side , cut face up ( exposing the filling ) , they are wound around each other , folding the left piece over the right until the end is reached ( this is called a " Russian braid " ) . The ends are pinched together , and the loaf is placed in the pan to proof . This , obviously , should help with any kind of filling , not just cinnamon sugar .
Given the source ( Michael Ruhlman ) and that it was linked by Seriouseats , I am willing to bet cash money that not only does it work exactly as stated , it will provide spectacular results .
There are a couple of things that jump out at me : 170 F ( 77 C ) - This is overkill for ground beef . The USDA guidelines recommend 160 F ( 71 C ) . Venting holes - This is unnecessary . There is no need to " vent " a hamburger . What you 're doing is creating holes for the juices to flow out of and get vaporized on the pan . This is likely a significant source of the smoking you describe . Keep those juices in ! I 'm not familiar with electric stoves , so I 'm not sure if 6/8 is too hot or not , but it might be . I cook my burgers on a gas stove at medium-high flame and generally do 5 mins per side for a medium burger ( I grind my own beef ) . My burgers are about an 3/4 " - 1 " thick too . So you might have your stove too hot , try turning it down a smidge . Update I want to clarify regarding the " blood " you are worried about . It 's a common misconception that the red liquid packaged with beef is blood . It 's not . Beef is drained of virtually all blood when it is slaughtered . Beef is 75 % water , so the liquid you see is mostly water and the pink hue comes from the iron &amp; oxygen binding protein <URL> which exists in muscle tissue . When cooking , the juices you are releasing are taking a lot of the flavor with them . This liquid is a combination of liquified fat , water , and proteins . You can verify this at the <URL> site for beef . Another common misconception is that a completely grey-brown interior indicates well done . According to the USDA , 25 % of burgers turn brown before being fully cooked ; this can happen as low as 135 F ( 57 C ) . The inverse is true as well , some beef can be cooked to the USDA recommended safe temperature 160 F ( 71 C ) and still retain some light pinkness in the center . If your concern is merely safety , cooking the beef to an interior temperature of 160 F is sufficient , regardless of it 's hue . If you you 're cooking it beyond that just because you do n't like the sight of pink meat , well you 're overcooking your burgers and doing yourself a bit of injustice . :)
It 's meant to be munched on between sips , and permits a " reset " - the cocktail will be fresh upon the tongue the sip after the bite , permitting you to enjoy its flavor and consistency without being oppressed by the cumulative effect of unctuous , spice and salt that is the hallmark of the beverage . Celery is an astringent and an aromatic - it will cut through the palate-coating tomato juice can leave behind , cool the intensity of the salt and heat , and will interrupt the soup-like consistency with a firm crunch . It 's often included in tuna and chicken salad and served with hot wings for the same reason . Other vegetables that tickle our sense of " bitter " in a pleasing way may be similarly substituted - but celery also acts as a handy swizzle stick .

How hot does garlic need to get to lose its sharpness ?
I ca n't give a specific temperature , as there 's issues : The sharpness is a chemical reaction which mix when the garlic cells are damaged . Cooking the garlic before damaging the cells will convert the chemicals before they 've had a chance to react . Cooking the garlic after the chemical reaction will also remove the sharpness . I 've never tried taking the temperature of garlic as it 's cooking Now , if you 're cooking the garlic cloves ahead of time ( I roast a couple of bulbs at a time , then squeeze out the cloves into small jar and keep it in the fridge ) . It 'll take 30min to an hour , depending on what temperature you 're roasting at ( 350-400F ; I 'll throw it in with something else ... not worth heating the oven just for garlic ) If cooking after you 've cut it , it 'll only take a quick saute as you have more surface area ( maybe 1 to 2 min , depending on pan temp ) -- but be careful , as overcooking garlic will burn it , which is just nasty . And do n't do it in a dry pan , unless you 're planning on ruining your dinner . When it 's golden , you 're done ... do n't let it get to brown , as brown is that stage right before black and time to clean the pan before starting again . Also , it seems counter-intuitive , but finely minced garlic is more potent than coarsely chopped garlic , as you 're doing more damage to the garlic . It wo n't help in this particular case , but in many dishes that just want the garlic flavor without being overpowering will use more garlic , but slice it rather than mincing , saute it in olive oil , then remove the garlic pieces , and use the garlic-infused oil for the dish . ... So , anyway , not not exactly answer the questions ... I 'd go with low and slow cooking ... specific temperatures are going to lead to fast cooking garlic , which gets you burnt garlic and ruined dishes . In dishes where you can , infuse the oil , then remove the garlic . And if you really have to , there 's always garlic powder .
Roasted garlic will get a slightly sweet flavor , dipped in a chocolate fondue can be wonderful and I have seen a recipe for garlic chocolate chip cookies . <URL>
You can use Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening : its is on PETA 's ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) shopping list of baking goods , but can work just as well for frying as lard .
Garlic in pickling recipes is just for flavor . It does not effect the chemistry of the pickle -- either for vinegar pickling , or fermentation pickling ( other than adding more vegetable mass to be pickled ) . ( This part of my little quest to close old questions with no answers , and no other substantive answer has been offered in the week since the question was asked . )
Dry herbs are slower to release their flavors than fresh herbs ; they will need extra cooking time to impart their full flavors , so add them to the dish sooner . Since they are less delicate and need the moisture , you may also want to add them along with a liquid , to help extract out the flavors . Crushing the larger-leaf herbs up a bit may also help . Use less dried herb than you would with fresh , because they are more concentrated . Although these will help , the sad truth is that even the best-dried herbs will not have the subtle flavors of fresher ones . Edit : One other technique you might use ( if there 's minimal cooking of other ingredients ) is to soak them in oil for a long time to extract flavors . I would suggest an overnight soak in olive oil . You can get more flavor out if you heat the olive oil before letting it sit to soak ; something like 50C/125F is a reasonable temperature to dissolve more flavor compounds , without damaging the more delicate ones .
The oven in a standard 20 " kitchen stove will accommodate a bird even as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) . The very detailed chart <URL> , the pertinent details of which are replicated in the chart below , establish the standard dimensions of such an oven as 18 X 16 X 14.5 inches ( 46 x 41 x 37 cm ) . In their downloadable Thanksgiving pdf , for a turkey as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) Williams-Sonoma <URL> a 16 X 13 X 3 inch ( 40 x 33 x 7.5 cm ) roasting pan . A pan of this sort is available with a rack which rises just above the bottom of the pan , as <URL> and pictured below . This kind of pan keeps height requirements down to roughly the height of the bird plus 3 " ( 7.5 cm ) above the bird , plus the standard 2.5 " ( 6.5 cm ) below the bottom rack . With 14.5 " ( 37 cm ) worth of oven height to work with and about a half inch space between the bird and the pan , that still leaves room for a bird 8 " ( 20 cm ) tall . ( We wo n't expect the bird to be half as tall as the pan is long . ) Meanwhile , an 18 " ( 46 cm ) oven depth accommodates a 16 " ( 41 cm ) long pan , and a 16 " ( 41 cm ) oven width a 13 " ( 33 cm ) pan width . Also , as seen <URL> and below , the pan 's handles fold down . Now , none of this is to say that there 's anything the slightest bit convenient about roasting so large a bird in so small a space . But it can be done . It should just be done with every whit of safety in mind .
There are a variety of factors at work here : Freezing foods " improperly " ( i.e. not flash-frozen , not vacuum-sealed ) causes ice crystals to form within the food , damaging the molecular structures . This is what causes many frozen leftovers to become " mushy " or change in texture . Again due to the formation of ice and the movement of water when the food is reheated , tiny particles such as spices can be lost in steam and/or runoff water . Extreme temperatures ( both hot and cold ) can denature enzymes in the food , changing their flavor , texture , etc. . As food sits , flavors in the food may blend together in different ways , causing the food to have less distinct flavors . If your freezer is n't especially clean and your food not well-sealed , your food may be absorbing other odors which are again " masking " the original flavor of your food . Hope that gives you some ideas .
Black garlic is not a substitute for regular garlic , you add black garlic to get a different result . I would never say use 2 cloves of black garlic for every 1 regular or any other ratio because the changes are so fundamental that they really are totally different ingredients . The question is how much black garlic flavor you want , and only you can answer that . I 'd suggest that you taste it when it 's close to being done and if you want more add more then .
Before being cooked , vegetables are like a wall built from tightly filled water balloons . Each cell has is filled with water ( well , technically cytoplasm , but ... ) which is essentially incompressible . One of the components in the cell walls is hemi-cellulose , which dissolves into the water when the vegetable is cooked . This allows the individual cells to partially deflate , expressing water and making the overall vegetable wilt . Think a blown up beach ball . Although the wall is soft and flexible , the air holds it rigid . Of course , air can be compressed , so a beach ball can be squeezed ; but water for all practical purposes is not compressible , so there is no almost no give in the individual plant cells . Once the cell walls loose their integrity , however , it is like the beach balls that comprise the plant have sprung a leak . They loose their shape or rigor , and at the large scale you see wilting or softening . Note that the presence of acid in the cooking medium can inhibit the dissolving of the hemi-cellulose , and permitting vegetables to better maintain their shape . This is one reason why , for example , canned vegetables have acid added to the canning liquid ( another being that acidity above a certain threshold inhibits the growth of certain dangerous food born pathogens . )
The FDA defines a " Use-By " date as the last date recommended for the use of the product while at peak quality . The date has been determined by the manufacturer of the product . After the " Use-By " date the product loses potency and/or freshness . " Use-by " dates usually refer to best quality and are not safety dates . <URL> The product is likely safe to use after this date , however , it will be less effective or fresh . As these dates are set by the manufacturer and vary wildly by manufacturer . Soy lecithin degrades very slowly as noted by <URL> . You likely have a good amount of time ( up to 24 months from date of manufacture ) before the product is degraded sufficiently to require recipe adjustments .
I love fresh ( also called green ) garlic . Some uses : For a quick , simple and delicious pasta sauce , chop a whole bulb of garlic ( with peel and all ) and sautee in some olive oil , rosmary and chili peppers . Add some white wine and reduce . Make a <URL> Clean whole bulbs from dirt , remove the external peel , wrap in tinfoil , sprinkle some salt , olive oil and thyme and bake for an hour . The garlic will turn into a paste which you can then squeeze and spread on fresh loaves of bread .
Soy sauce is not known to chemically influence capsaicin or capsaicin absorption . The effect is likely subjective and has to do with something like spicy heat feeling less objectionable in a higher umami dish . If you used more oil or fattier meat this time , this might be the real cause of the perceivedly milder taste - fats strongly influence how capsaicin is perceived ( they do not neutralize it ! ) because they dissolve and redistribute it throughout the dish .
Yes . The more finely you process your garlic , the more of the flavour-bearing liquid is released from ruptured cells .
Flaxseed oil goes rancid quickly , and refrigeration slows down this process . So , yes , you should do as the label says ( usually a good idea anyway ) and keep it in the fridge .
Yes , you would remove the peas from the pods . <URL> shows how to do it efficiently . And no , the pods are not normally eaten , although according to <URL> you can .
Many hydrocolloids are very heat tolerant . <URL> Some of the options that might work for you are : <URL> A polysaccharide made from boiling seaweed , agar agar is heat stable up to about 90C . It gels when cooled to 40C . It is inexpensive and easy to find , especially in Asian markets . It would be relatively easy to coat the inside of a cone by heating the agar agar to 90C , cooling it almost to 40C and pouring into very cold cones and pouring out the excess ungelled liquid . Obviously it wo n't work if your liquid is hotter than 90C . <URL> Like agar agar , pectin is a polysaccharide but it is extracted from fruit . Regular , off the shelf , pectin that requires a lot of sugar is HM Pectin . It will melt easily . LM Pectin on the other hand , requires calcium to gel . Once gelled it is heat stable and will not melt again . Unless you have a well stocked specialty pastry supply store handy you may have to buy this online and it will definitely cost more than the agar agar . Sodium Alginate Like LM Pectin , sodium alginate gels in the presence of calcium . Often used to make " caviar " preparations of random liquids . It is easier to find for sale as part of molecular gastronomy kits . It forms a heat stable gel but you 'd have to be creative about how to coat a waffle cone with it . Perhaps you could form a sheet of it and " glue " it into the waffle cone . All in all , if your liquid is cooler than 90C , for cost and ease of use I would recommend going with the agar agar .
It is safe to consume the guts . Many people do . More Info : After digging deeper into the above article I spotted it contains the answer . <URL> They 're so small ( only up to 12cm long ) that they 're often cooked whole - head , guts and all . If you prefer , however , you can open up the belly with your thumb and rinse out the innards , and prise out the gills with your thumb and forefinger . Regarding their association with brisling , it seems that the two terms are synonymous ( though somewhat contextual ) : Sprats are sometimes also known by their Scandinavian name , brisling , especially if they 've been smoked and canned .
That 's your meringue weeping . You could either make a very unstable meringue , which will weep uncontrollably , or you can replicate the effect with caramelised sugar - the latter is probably better for consistency and not-having-a-sloppy-mess-on-top-of-your-cheesecakeness .
One of the best ways I 've found to remove ants from the bread is to put it into the oven at a light temperature . Out of the frying pan and into the fire .
The method we use ( for coffee ) is pretty simple ( though it requires some compatible equipment ) : Fill kettle . Shove probe thermometer through " whistle " hole in kettle spout . Heat until desired temperature is reached . Pour water into vessel . If you do n't have a kettle or your thermometer wo n't work , you can do the same thing with any pot and a thermometer that has a clip ( so you do n't have to hold it for 10 minutes while the water heats ) ... but be sure the thermometer is heat safe ( candy thermometers are good for this if they have a high enough temp range ) . You 'll want to keep a couple of things in mind ... The temperature of your mug will cool the water when it makes contact . This is unlikely to make a huge difference but it 's something to think about . If you really want to brew your tea at exactly 70 C , consider heating sufficient water to " warm " your cup ( or teapot ) by filling it part way and swishing the water around to heat up the cup first and then pour the water down the drain . Alternately , you can heat your water to a slightly higher temperature ( 72 C ) . As to your other methods ... I 'm sure any of them would work just fine ... they 'd take longer , though , because you 're waiting for something to boil and then you 're waiting for it to cool off or you 're futzing around with getting it back down to the " right " temperature by adding cool water or tossing it back and forth between cups . Provided you have standard , municipal water that you 're comfortable drinking from the tap ( or filtered ) , I do n't know why boiling it first would matter . I 'm also skeptical about the pickiness of tea being steeped at exactly 70 C. I have a feeling that there 'd be little discernible difference ( to the average consumer ) were the water at 80 C or even 90 C. . . It 'd be an interesting thing to test , I suppose . As this relates to oxygen loss due to boiling , which has been mentioned in some of the answers . <URL> actually discusses that already and the general consensus is that lower oxygen levels in the water is actually bad for the taste of the tea : Dissolved oxygen is reactive , and will most likely extract more substances from the tea leaf , than without it . If these are the good flavour parts of tea , I do not know ? And : <URL> that increased oxygen in the water resulted in milder , less tannic tea . So , it sounds as if not bringing your water to a full boil is actually preferable to the flavor of the tea ( assuming you do n't like the tannic flavors ) because the oxygen is beneficial to the brewing process .

What are the key ingredients in Worcester Sauce ?
DO I has to ? Nobody learned it ? Garum , a fermented sauce made with anchovies as the principal ingredient , was the Romans ' legacy to Britain when they left GB for home . They put the stuff in everything - Roman Fricassee of Dormouse would be naturally adorned with garum , Roman asparagus would have to be served with garum ... There was a sauce , Worcester sauce , that had disputed origins - but was obviously based on an English version of garum , . So there was a historic Dickensian precedent a la Jarndyce v Jarndyce between Lea and Perrins , who sold Worcestershire sauce to avoid argument , and Hammonds of Bradford who sold something very similar marked " Yorkshire Relish " , which they acquired when they bought Goodall , Backhouse of Leeds . What happened was that Hammonds won , in that for a brief period they sold WORCESTER sauce without dispute about the name , instead of calling it Yorkshire Relish . Just after that they were taken over by some multinational who did n't give a tinker 's cuss about that valuable TM , just the market share . Some brands , including Yorkshire Relish , were sold to an Irish company who are still making the " thick " Yorkshire Relish brown sauce in Ireland , but not the " thin " version we are discussing here . Lea and Perrins are still selling Worcestershire sauce . The Hammonds Sauceworks brass band are still performing , although the factory produces no Yorkshire Relish . There is a factory somewhere producing Henderson 's Relish , which is very similar to Worcester sauce , but made in Sheffield with no Garum - never seen an anchovy . At least Lea and Perrins still produce the closest thing to a traditional product which goes back 2,000 years . Whatever they do with the anchovies , that component is said to be left for three years to mature .
In most contexts , I would assume that simply means the leaves from the herb parsley . Depending on where your recipe originates -- especially central Europe , or some Asian cultures -- parsley root may also be used , so the recipe might be trying to make that clear . I suspect , however , it really is the recipe author 's idiosyncratic style . Now , as to chopping them , that would depend on how it is used and what the rest of the recipe says .
I grew up with a Vietnamese mother that used to put fish sauce in nearly everything . While I ca n't exactly recommend all of her uses ( she once used it in a texas beef chili -- was not good ) , there are a few techniques that are good to know . A common method to create a savory sauce is to use fish sauce with sugar at a 2:1 ratio . For example , you can make <URL> by sauteeing fried tofu with diced tomatoes and adding 2tbsp of fish sauce to 1tbsp of sugar . This ratio can also be used in stir-fries . I would make sure to turn on your air vents when doing this -- the smell of fish sauce hitting a hot pan is ... different than what most people are used to . It works as a savory salt alternative in a lot of dishes . I use it to season fried rice instead of using salt or soy sauce . It generally is a good idea to add this during the cooking process , so the liquid can reduce and meld with the food . It can also be used to quick brine ground pork for savory asian dishes . I 'd add somewhere in the vicinity of a tbsp per pound of ground pork . I use this technique when making Thai <URL> . There are probably other marinating/brining applications , but I do n't have much personal experience with that . You can also use fish sauce to create a wide variety of dipping sauces -- in general it is paired with something sweet ( sugar or rice vinegar ) to help balance out the saltiness . It is also commonly watered down ( <URL> ) in vietnamese dipping sauces to keep it from being too overpowering . On a personal note , my favorite use is straight up on crispy fried eggs ( slightly runny yolk ) over white rice . It is n't for everyone , but it 's something I 've been making and enjoying for years .
I have been told that cedar , white and yellow pine , and many other variaties are safe in normal quantities and have high vitamin content . Some have supposed medicinal effect for headaches , such as cedar . My advice is to look up " tea " or " infusion " with each type of needle you want to try so you can avoid a poisonous concoction . As for white pine , I have made delicious tea for breakfast and for the canteen with it while camping and have survived so far . It goes quite well with wild mint .
Splenda , besides giving you the runs , is very hard to bake with . My wife had gestational diabetes so we tried baking with splenda and nothing turned out right . Splenda has no nutritional value . Raw sugar is great , but it has a slightly different taste than processed sugar , similiar to brown sugar . Artificial sweetners would probalby have similar issues to splenda , but I 've never tried them outside of sweetening tea .
Remember that veal is merely very young beef ; the chuck ( which is the beef equivalent to the pork shoulder ) is probably your best choices . The chuck naturally has that best proportion of muscle to fat for sausage making . That said I would actually discourage you from choosing veal as a meat for sausage making , ground veal is [ IMHO ] really ' nothing special ' in terms of flavor . Veal 's ' specialness ' is in its tenderness , which is irrelevant in a sausage . You would be better served to use an mature beef chuck from an angus or longhorn . Lamb would also be a nice ancient flavor .
The purpose of stock is to dissolve collagen out of the meat and bones into gelatin . The liquid is then not so watery , collects a lot of flavor , and can be reduced for sauces if desired , etc. . The problem with the scrapple is that , while it does have a some gelatin , it also has a ton of fat and starch . The fat would melt and have to be skimmed off again . The starch would gelatinize . This would result is not a stock but a gravy . The solution would seem to be to find recipes where the starch and fattiness would be desirable . The first thing that would come to mind would be a thick stew . I would cube and sear the scrapple before adding it . It might take some experimentation to figure out how long to let it stew to thicken the stew without turning the crapple to mush .
It sounds like your water melon simply spoiled in the refrigerator . It is a very perishable food , once the rind is cut off , as it is basically a sugar syrup waiting to be eaten by whatever comes along -- people , dogs , bacteria , yeasts , molds , whatever . The milky liquid would be waste from the metabolization processes of whatever colonized the water melon . You are probably wise not to eat it ; just discard it . Some signs of past-prime watermelon include -- but all of these border on signs of spoiled , because it is a continuous process : Aroma : If you detect an alcoholic , winy , or boozy smell , it is a sign the flesh has started to ferment . Another sign is when the rind is not taught and firm . The melon is light for its size , indicating it may have lost moisture
It is a combination of a regular convection oven with a microwave , so you have both hot air and microwaves cooking your food . So the advantage is you get the quick interior heating of the microwaves combined with the surface browning from the hot air ; convection just makes that hot air cooking faster and more even .
Your typical Tamari is , to my understanding , going to be closer to dark than light soy sauce . So you 'd want light as a second soy sauce . Inside Japan , there are five kinds of soy sauce : Koikuchi , which is your most typical soy sauce Usukuchi , which is lighter because it has fermented rice in it Tamari , which has more soy than wheat and thus is a bit darker Shiro , which has more wheat than soy and thus is a bit lighter Saishikomi , which is " twice-brewed " and thus twice as dark In China , you have two : regular " light " soy sauce , and " dark " , which is the light stuff processed further and aged . Therefore , " sashikomi " is the Japanese equivalent to dark soy sauce , if you want to stick with Japanese classifications . If your recipes are aimed at english-speaking audiences , however , the terms are likely to be used a lot looser and less precisely than in Japan or China . Kikkoman , which is the biggest name brand I 've seen in the US , brews a regular , a Tamari , and a gluten-free ( Tamari can have some gluten in it ) . Therefore , I would normally assume that to an American chef , " dark soy sauce " is Tamari . " Light soy sauce " might mean the low-sodium stuff , or it might mean Shiro or Usukuchi . Your basic unqualified " soy sauce " is Koikuchi .
The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water , and what is dissolved in the water , into the meat . I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine , and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast . The difference , deep into the meat , will be noticeable . It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat , but the oils and dissolved parts . That is why you heat and steep the water before cooling it for brining .
Usually that would mean potatoes that have been simmered to fork tender , but you could use potatoes that have been baked too . It 's faster to dice the potato before simmering , but for some things it actually tastes better ( tiny difference ) to simmer first , then dice . Be careful if you dice first , they will overcook and become waterlogged quickly . If the recipe does n't specify , you can use peeled or unpeeled potatoes . I almost always prefer scrubbed , unpeeled potatoes . Do n't forget to salt the water ! EDIT : One more little note . 1/4 inch dice is small for simmering potatoes . If you do it that way , get them out of the water just before they are completely tender , carry-over cooking will get them the rest of the way . You might also want to rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking .
Here 's the function of each ingredient , as I understand them : Sugar - Obviously , this is the thing that caramelizes . You need it . The amount of sugar determines the amount of caramel . Water - The water helps early in the cooking process by causing the mixture to heat evenly without burning . Most of it boils off . As the water evaporates , the boiling point of the mixture increases . So , you can determine the ratio of water to sugar by measuring the temperature while it 's boiling . Once enough water has boiled off to reach the temperature specified in the recipe , then you know that the ratio of water to sugar is right . Too much water and the caramel will be too soft . If you add extra water , it will take longer to reach the target temperature , but you 'll still have the same amount in the end as long as you get it to the right temperature . Lemon - A bit of acid <URL> . This can be useful if you want a soft caramel because you wo n't have to boil off as much water . It can also reduce the risk of burning because you do n't have to get the caramel quite as hot . Salt - This is just for flavor . In the small quantity normally found in caramel , I would n't expect it to make a difference to the cooking time , target temperature , or texture . A longer cooking time allows more water to boil off , resulting in a harder ( or possibly burnt ) caramel . Otherwise , it does n't affect the outcome that much , unless you 're making a low temperature caramel . There are some dulce de leche recipes , for example , that require cooking for <URL> . At higher temperatures , the reactions happen a lot faster . At 350 F , for example , the caramelization happens so quickly that there 's no need to hold it at that temperature for any significant time .
Compound butter is a very nice accompaniment for fish . " Compound butter is a mixture of softened butter and at least one other ingredient . Some ideas for compound butter are : herbs , spices , citrus zest/juice , honey , fresh mint , soft cheeses ( like goat ) , fresh or dried peppers , and nuts ... you get the idea -- this list could be endless ! " You can cook the fish on its own and then put the compound butter on top to melt over it . While soft the butter can be put into a piping bag and piped as rosettes and refrigerated until ready to use . Makes for a nice presentation . Another common accompaniment to fish is mango salso or a combination of tropical fruits ( mango pineapple for example ) . This seemed like a good link for ideas for sauces for Haddock : <URL>
It does n't do anything , it 's your second suggestion . The feeling of " right/wrong " and " like/dislike " is highly correlated with familiarity . This is proven not only by psychometry , but even physiologically , with fMRI scans . People like most whatever they are familiar with , up to the point that unfamiliar things seem wrong . This applies not only to bay leaves , but also to all other tastes ( or taste combinations ) and many other areas of life , even beyond sensory perception . You can teach yourself to like bay-leaf-less sauce too , by just eating it frequently enough that it becomes familiar . But I do n't see any advantages in doing so . Just cook with bay leaf and enjoy it .
Non-sweetened almond milk is probably what most people on low carb diets drink , when they drink it . It has < 1g of carb per cup . Personally , I completely stopped drinking milk because of carbs years ago and I do n't look back . I only drink a little bit of half and half with coffee , and even though it still has carbs , it 's so little that it makes little difference .
Short answer : yes . Long answer : depends on what you 're cooking . Grilling some popular food items can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) HCAs , a family of mutagenic and cancer-causing compounds , are produced during the cooking of many animal products , including chicken , beef , pork , and fish . In January of 2005 , the federal government officially added HCAs to its list of known carcinogens . Cancer Project nutritionists determined that many commonly grilled foods contain alarmingly high levels of HCAs . This table lists the five foods containing the highest levels . ( Source : <URL> )
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .
They all seem to use different cheeses depending on the brand . The most consistent cheese is definitely mozzarella , which makes sense as it 's the default cheese on most pizzas . Second to that is some sort of hard grating cheese like Parmesan or Asiago ... which also makes sense as it 's a traditional pizza condiment . Other Italian cheeses also seem popular like fontina and provolone But non-Italian cheeses like cheddar certainly show up . Below are some examples . I do n't recommend any of these products , they just came up in web searches and specifically describe which four cheeses they use . Amy 's uses : Fontina , provolone , Parmesan , mozzarella : <URL> Frontera uses : Mozzarella , white cheddar , smoked provolone , asiago . <URL> California Pizza Kitchen uses : Mozzarella ( apparently more than one kind ) , fontina , gouda <URL> Lean Cuisine uses : low fat mozzarella , Parmesan , asiago , romano <URL>
The range of possibilities with a basic pancake recipe is not very broad . There are additional things you can add of course , but the basic recipe is really basic . Eggs are mostly protein . When you cook an egg , it goes from liquid ( basically ) to solid . The egg blended into the pancake batter will do the same . Pancakes are generally cooked pretty quickly over a fairly hot fire , and that quick heating makes the egg proteins lock up and stiffen . Think of the difference between making a fried egg and scrambled eggs : fried eggs should cook fast , while scrambled eggs cook slowly to keep the eggs from being rubbery . ( The other pancake ingredients counter that rubbery toughness of fast-cooked eggs . ) Flour is mostly starch . Starch absorbs moisture ( from the egg and the liquid ) . People started making things like pancakes because flour is relatively cheap and keeps well , and one egg can make a lot of flour-based pancakes and feed a lot more people than the egg alone . The liquid ( milk in your recipe , but other stuff works ) is necessary to thin out the batter ; we 're still stretching that egg out . Without a liquid addition , you 'd have a lump of thick dough . By keeping the pancake batter thin , you ensure that the batter poured onto the hot griddle will remain loose enough to spread out into the familiar flat disc , providing a large surface area for the egg protein to solidify . The salt is there so that the pancake does n't taste bland . That 's an easy one to test . Most American pancake recipes also include some sugar or another sweetener . American pancakes without some additional fat -- melted butter or vegetable oil , usually -- would not be liked by most Americans . The added fat makes the pancakes softer and richer . Using table cream or something instead of plain milk can work too , as would adding an extra egg yolk . Baking powder is a mix of dry sodium bicarbonate and one or more acidic salts . The blend is ( usually ) designed so that some amount of gas is produced as soon as the powder is mixed with liquid , and more produced when the batter is heated . Finally , besides the bill of ingredients , the process used to combine the ingredients is also important . Wheat flour has gluten in it , and too much mixing in liquid will form gigantic protein mega-molecules in your batter and result in disturbingly chewy pancakes . You want gluten development for bread , but not pancakes , muffins , and other " fluffy " baked goods . Generally , dry ingredients ( except granulated sugar ) are pre-mixed separately from wet ingredients . The two are combined as the last step before cooking . You also want some air in the pancakes ( for American pancakes at least ) , and that 's of course what the baking powder does . You can get even more air in by separating the eggs , using the yolks as a " wet " ingredient , and then whipping the egg whites into a soft foam . The foamed whites are then blended in when the wet and dry ingredients are combined . ( Note that you do n't want air in crepes , and that 's the purpose of letting the batter sit for a few hours before cooking : it lets bubbles escape , bubbles formed in the blender or via the whisk used to prepare the batter . )

What is the best way to find a reliable pepper mill ?
Most basic mills with steel grinders will be OK What breaks them are Overly aggressive grinding ; just grind gently and your mill will last much longer Keep them dry ; do not use a pepper grinder over a steaming pot . Grind pepper into a bowl or plate , and then pour into pot Old peppercorns ; as they age and dry , they get tougher to grind , and wear most mills out pretty fast . Store peppercorns in very air tight containers , so they ca n't dry out more than they are meant to be dried Avoid those coloured peppercorn mixes ; whatever makes the light colours , are also very tough . Stick with plain black pepper Contaminants ; pour your peppercorns onto a white plate and check for small stones or twigs before loading into grinder . Also check for " insect parts " , most local food laws allow some of these , but who wants them ! I have gone through a variety of grinders over the years . Some expensive , some cheap . Price was not a factor , usage and care seem to have been Acrylic grinders generally die quickly , as the acrylic cracks as it ages . Solid metal or wooden bodies are better as they last longer in general , and keep the pepper in a light proof container ( which all food should be stored in , or in a light proof cupboard )
First , I would suggest you buy a higher quality can opener . I have a Swing-A-Way that I inherited from my grandmother . I think it 's older than me . Second , do n't submerge the can opener in water every time you use it . I only full out wash it on the rare occasion I splash or drop something all over it . The rest of the time I just use my dishcloth to wipe the blade and handles clean and let it dry in the dish rack before putting it away .
Ceramic will - if preheated - prevent some cooling of your water , but plastic filter-holders do n't have much heat capacity so you do n't lose much with them , either . Plastic filter-holders and paper filters have the advantage of not costing much so you can have one at home , one at work , one anywhere else you want ... As with most coffee preparation , a good grinder is paramount and getting freshly roasted coffee is also extremely important .
You could try lightly steaming it , but in all likelihood there 's no rescuing . Your best bet is to chop it and throw it in a blender to ' grate ' it . Alternatively , blend it with maltodextrin/dextrose to ( re ) obtain the powdery quality .
Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate . I 've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste , but because frankly , I like to play with fire . But lets assume that there is a taste difference , identify where the differences comes from , and how to address them : The smoke from charcoal . This is ( if you 've been using natural lump charcoal ) pretty much just wood smoke . If you 've been using briquettes you 'll also get the smoke of the filler and such , but generally this is n't desirable and we do n't want to replicate it . For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like <URL> . Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner , it should start smoking . Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals , and rising back up to flavor the food . This used to be a big advantage to charcoal , but its largely minimized by new gas grills with ' vapor bars ' . As long as your grill has one of these , you 're in luck . Otherwise , there 's not a good , safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it . Its a long bar usually running the length of burners . Lighter fluid taste . Another undesirable flavor if you 're doing a particular ( and not good IMO ) kind of charcoal grilling . Frankly , its not one you 're likely to miss . Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them . Nowadays the biggest is definitely # 1 , but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially ' porous ' . If you 're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts , I would n't bother if smoke . If you 're doing burgers - maybe/probably . If you 're doing thick steaks , thick pork chops , a whole chicken , or anything that 's going on awhile , then creating some smoke is definitely worth it . ( " Liquid smoke " definitely does n't taste like the real thing . )
The best way ? Plan better . :) The microwave is rarely a good plan for quick defrosting , as you found out . I would suggest putting the container in warm to hot running tap water . The warmer the water is the faster it will melt , but it will also melt more unevenly - though nothing like the microwave . The important part is that the water is running , and is at least room temperature . It 's not going to be quick like a microwave , but it 'll be faster than just letting it sit . Edit I 've never tried this , but I imagine a hair dryer might work well too . It 'll just be noisier :) The concept is the same , just moving air instead of water .
No , it 's not necessary . You can do it , and if you 'd soak them for about an hour , the cooking time will diminish strongly ( half ) . I 'm not sure if this would affect the chalky taste . Which kind of lentils do you use ?
The best way to get rid of the ants ? Toss the ants and the butter in the trash or a trash bag that you can quickly seal to prevent the ants from spreading around your house . Then , wash the container and check it for any holes or openings where the ants could have gotten in through ( can do a water test - fill it with water and see if any water escapes ) . Then , go out and buy fresh butter .
My preferred method by far would be heating them in a pot along with some kind of sauce . Failing that , I think I might try putting them in a tightly covered pot in the oven along with just a little water ( just a tablespoon or so ) -- that would gently heat them and also keep them moist .
I 've received some portions from friends and family , which have always worked well . :-) When I 'm creating it from scratch , I mix 200g of rye flour , a little bit of yeast ( which you can leave out ) , 1 tsp of salt , 1 tsp of honey , 1 dl of organic yogurt and 2 dl of water . I leave this mixture out on the kitchen table ( at around 20C ) for a day with a piece of wet cloth on top . After that I add 2 dl of rye flour and enough water to make the dough soft . This sits on the kitchen table for yet another day , after which is should look like a pool of lava and smell a bit acidic . The honey and the yogurt is the magic touch that makes this starter work , according to my books and research . I 've never done anything special to control the temperature or anything else .
I use two different knives when I dice an onion . First , cut the onion in half , through the root end ( so that each half has a bit of the root on it to hold it together ) . Next , take a paring knife ( the skinny blade is why I use this knife here ) and make vertical cuts that go almost all the way to the root . Next , use the paring knife to make horizontal cuts while using one hand to hold the onion in place . Last , use a chef 's knife to make downward cuts to finish the dice . If you are trying to julienne cut the onion , cut off both the top and root part of the onion and peel it . Then chop the onion in half vertically and cut thin slices of onion on an angle from the outside toward the middle ( about a 10 degree angle should be fine ) . I do all of this with a chef 's knife .
Use a carbon-steel wok ! The shape works very well to keep the unpopped kernels in the hot oil , while the popped kernels end up on the cooler sides . I usually use about 2 T of oil and 1/3 c of popcorn to make enough for two people . If you want to keep with the Chinese theme , Szechuan peppercorn-salt goes extremely well on popcorn ! To make it , grind Szechuan peppercorns and kosher salt in a spice grinder .
The best is the <URL> If you ca n't find that flour locally , there are sellers online . I find a mix of bread flour &amp; semolina works very well too . This is my favourite pizza dough recipe : <URL>
I have the <URL> and it works well for sweet potato fries . The product spec for them lists " Yams " which are sometimes what sweet potatoes are called in the U.S. ( technically , yes , yams are different but real yams are not often available in the U.S. ) . The <URL> specifically lists sweet potatoes : Makes French fries , sweet potato fries , zucchini sticks and other favorites
Short and sweet ... Use cake / pastry flour . At 5-7 % protein vs. 11 % for AP vs. 13 % + for bread flour , that means a lot less gluten formation . This protein , when mixed with water and subjected to mechanical working is what produces gluten . The higher the protein percentage , the ' tougher ' ( due to the gluten ) the final product . Always use cake or pastry flour when making any type of cake , even brownies . And a little extra egg wo n't hurt , either .
The world record holder is currently the Carolina Reaper <URL> ( as of AUG 2013 ) . This pepper began its family tree as a crossbreed between a Ghost Chili pepper and a Red Habanero . The LA Times <URL> that the hottest Reaper has been clocked at 2.2 Million Scoville units . That 's higher than some commercial pepper spray products . They go on to cite a study conducted by Winthrop University ( South Carolina , US ) that claims the average is closer to 1.5 M. For funsies , <URL> of my buddy eating a Scorpion pepper ( the pepper that originally surpassed the Bhut Jolokia at 1.2 M Scoville in 2012 ) to celebrate a viewership milestone on his Twitch channel . Contains cursing and lots of spitting . It 's not pretty . What a time to be alive .
Cast iron is great for bacon , but not a grill pan . The bacon really needs to be floating on its own grease for nice even heating . The best bacon is cooked slowly . Preheat the pan so it is an evenly heated cooking surface , then slide you bacon on to the hot pan . By slide , I mean move it around on the pan before you drop it so the pan gets a coat of grease before dropping the bacon and getting it stuck on the hot pan . Let it cook at medium low heat , it will take longer but you 'll get less splatter , the bacon wo n't burn , and it wo n't dry out either , you also have a larger window of opportunity to pick up the bacon while it 's " just right " whatever that is for you .
The term " ground red pepper " is ambiguous in English . Things sold under that name in the US have a wide range of heats , and likely are made from multiple varieties of peppers , though I 'd say they 're more commonly hot things like cayenne , or other varieties with somewhat less heat . That said , do n't worry about it too much in these cases . Anything from mild paprika to cayenne would likely fit within what the authors meant , and you 're not going to harm a recipe by increasing or decreasing the heat , or by using a chile powder with a slightly different flavor . Just use something ( or a blend ) that provides the heat level you want , and you 'll be fine .
Seasoning does not preserve food . Some foodstuffs normally used for seasoning , like salt and vinegar , can help to preserve food , but the concentration you need will make your ricotta unpalatable . Salting can preserve food , when combined with dehydration . Bacteria need a humid environment to live in . Salt is hygroscopic , it both helps dry out the food you are preserving ( usually meat ) and directly dehydrates any bacteria which come in contact with it , killing them . Even then , you want to use charcuterie salt ( a mix of NaCl and NaNO2 ) to prevent botulism , as pure table salt ( NaCl ) does n't kill Clostridum Botulinum . Trying to get ricotta preserved that way is counterproductive . Not only will it be way too salty to taste well . You will also have to dry it out to the point where neither mould nor bacteria can grow on it . Hard cheeses are durable exactly for these reasons , but dried-out ricotta is not tasty . In fact , I am not sure that " the yellow stuff " you see is " toxic " , it could just be dried-out . Still , I would n't be willing to risk eating it , even if the taste was acceptable . You could try preserving your ricotta by adding acid . To have it hold a long time in the fridge , it has to be as acidic as a typical pickle recipe . I only mention this because you say that you spice it heavily . But frankly , I ca n't imagine anybody wanting to eat ricotta that sour . The option I would choose is freezing . You already mention " the freezer " , but if you are really freezing it , then it sounds like you are thawing and refreezing the whole container . Alternatively , maybe it was a slip of the keyboard and you meant to say that you are holding it in the back of the fridge . Whatever you meant , I would suggest freezing it in portions , for example using silicone muffin moulds . Once you have frozen your ricotta ( you can add spices it first , if you prefer ) , remove it from the moulds and place it in a freezing bag . Only thaw the amount you will need for a single meal . This should work well enough , in the worst case you 'll have a layer of freezer burn to remove .
Personally , I 've switched almost entirely to <URL> for all types of stirring and scraping spoons . They do n't stain , they are fine up to quite high temperatures , they clean up easily and can go in the dishwasher . They are also wo n't scratch the surface of non-stick cookware . It is true that they do n't feel quite so nice as a good wooden spoon , but the convenience is outstanding . ( On the other hand , I stick with metal for the type of spatula one uses to flip a fritter , because silicone ca n't have a thin enough leading edge , it is too flexible . )

Why the overlap in peanut and tree nut allergies ?
So from this - <URL> - it sounds like they both share IgE-reactive ( <URL> ) epitopes . Both native and recombinant nut allergens have been identified and characterized and , for some , the IgE-reactive epitopes described . Some allergens , such as lipid transfer proteins , profilins , and members of the Bet v 1-related family , represent minor constituents in tree nuts . These allergens are frequently cross-reactive with other food and pollen homologues , and are considered panallergens . Others , such as legumins , vicilins , and 2S albumins , represent major seed storage protein constituents of the nuts .
Your microwave is n't exactly cooking your food from the inside out . Instead , what is happening is that some parts of your food that happen to be on the interior are being heated faster than those parts of the exterior that you observe . This sort of uneven heating is intrinsic with how microwaves work . Microwave ovens cook unevenly because a pattern of standing waves forms inside the oven chamber , and the pattern creates an array of hotspots throughout the oven 's volume . An operating frequency of 2.45 GHz will produce a wavelength of around 12.25 cm , and the regions of maximum intensity ( hotspots ) will be at half-wave points , or every 6.125 cm , but in a complex 3D pattern From <URL> So , in your microwave the waves happen to be arranged just so the inside of your casserole heats up faster than the outside . In microwave ovens that do not have a rotating carousel , this effect is even more pronounced , although even using a carousel is not a panacea . Many microwave oven recipes often include instructions to rotate and/or stir the food intermittently as a means of distributing the heat more evenly for the same reasons ; changing the position of the food within the oven has the effect of shifting the hotspots around in the food as it cooks . So , my suggestion is to try changing the position of the food in the oven over time , particularly if it 's being heated over several minutes , as that should help it heat more evenly . If you can , it is also a good idea to stir the food intermittently as well . Personally , after the microwave finishes the allotted time , I also will stir and then wait a few minutes before serving to let the hot spots naturally dissipate a bit via <URL> .
Most freezers are frost-free , which means that they occasionally cycle above freezing to prevent formation of frost on the walls of the freezer . This makes them easier to maintain but it shortens the storage longevity of the food . This makes products stored in them vulnerable to freezer burn , which is a loss of moisture . It can also cause ice and IQF products like frozen fruits or vegetables to solidify into a single mass . If you have ice cube trays , you may even notice them becoming empty after a few months of sitting unused . Freezer burn is a loss of quality , though , not a health issue . The food is n't spoiling . If you have a " deep freeze " or a non frost-free freezer that you only access occasionally , you can certainly keep foods for nearly indefinite periods of time without worrying as much about freezer burn . You can also reduce the likelihood of freezer burn by following better freezer practices . Resources available <URL> and <URL> and <URL> .
When both are used , the fresh yeast is for " added flavor " , the dry for leavening power . Another author who does this is Nancy Silverton . - Some bakers believe that fresh yeast ( a.k.a. cake yeast or wet yeast ) gives a more yeasty flavor to the final product . I do n't think it does . It 's also more perishable , ( sometimes ) more expensive , more difficult to find ( and when you do , it may be near its expiration ) , more challenging to use , and less reliable ( re : reproducible outcome ) . When I encounter a recipe that calls for it , I convert to instant yeast using this old , but reliable chart : <URL> If you <URL> , you 'll find more information ( that may or may not be reliable ) .
At least in the case of marinades containing acids ( such as vinegar or lemon juice ) or certain enzymes , especially from papayas , kiwis , or most commonly ( at least in the US ) , fresh pineapple juice , a certain amount of denaturing of the proteins will occur at the surface of the marinated meat . This will turn it opaque rather than translucent -- chicken will look kind of white . This is perfectly normal , and safe . Depending on the color of the marinade , and the particular cut being marinated , some of the marinade may also penetrate into the meat , changing its color as well . These are normal effects , and assuming you have otherwise respected good practices ( keeping the meat refrigerated during the marination , not holding the food uncooked longer than would be safe without the marinate , and not cross-contaminating and so on ) , the product should be safe to eat . In the case of your meat marinated triple the planned time , the outcome will depend on the nature of the particular marinade . If there was active enzymatic action , it could be very mush to the point of unpleasantness . On the other hand , if the marinade was mostly for flavor , rather than highly acidic , it might just have a more intense flavor from the marinade . Edit : I should add for clarity , above means ...
Meat is pounded as a mechanical means of tenderizing by damaging the connective tissues . It also makes the meat thinner and flatter , which helps the meat cook faster and more evenly . Pound tougher meats ( cheaper steaks ) , and meats of uneven thickness ( chicken breasts ) . Avoid pounding the bones in the meat . You do n't want little pieces of bone chipping off into meal . Do n't pound already tender pieces ( premium cuts , dry aged steaks ) . Think tenderize , not pulverize . You should not be making any holes in it . If you 're going to marinate , do that after pounding . Wrapping the meat in wax paper first will help prevent a big mess . Do both sides of the meat .
Refrigerating accomplishes several things : It is the right temperature to get the intended flavor . Flavors change with temperature , and some dishes get the correct taste when cold . Flavors get to blend more . Aromatic spices sometimes take time to soak into the sauce , and liquids absorb into the potatoes more Cold is an easy way to prevent spoilage . Potato salad usually contains mayonnaise , which is a natural growth medium for bacteria . By cooling the salad you can leave it out to serve for a couple hours without risking illness . Food safety of Potato Salad : For potato salad , you have about 2 hours of safe eating in the 40-140F temperature range . Refrigerating is an easy way to extend this , by cooling below 40F . For hot salads , you can either reheat before serving , or keep it hotter than 140F by using a chafing dish and can of Sterno . About Mayonnaise in Potato Salad : Commercial mayonnaise is too acidic to spoil easily , but when mixed in with potato salad it can be diluted enough to spoil . It is better to refrigerate than take the risk , right ? If you use homemade mayonnaise , you run the risk of salmonella on top of this .
Texture is the main reason , but if you 're going to be blending the sauce , there can be off-flavors from cracking open the seeds . Even if you do n't blend it , they can be these slippery little things that I never much liked growing up . To reduce the amount of waste , you can : cook the sauce , then put it through a food mill to strip out the seeds and skins , thus keeping you from wasting the gel around the seeds . freeze the peeled skins , to save for when you 're next going to be making vegetable stock . collect the seeds and gel , then put it into a muslin bag and hang to let drip to extract ' tomato water ' . ( you typically use crushed tomatoes for this ... I do n't know for sure if the gel will go through the muslin ) . Tomato water is strange as it gives good tomato flavor , without the red color .
In addition to oxidation as put forward by @Stefano , you also have Slow chemical reactions between compounds . Oxidation is only one chemical reaction that happens , there are many more Concentration of flavors due to the evaporation of water will give a more intense flavor
Liquid vanilla extract has alcohol in it , so if you add this extract to hot cocoa , puddings , fudge , or anything you make with heat , the alcohol burns off and so does most of the flavor . If you wait for it to cool off the flavor stays strong . Same thing goes for artificial vanilla also because of the alcohol levels ( but the flavor is just not there to begin with with artificial flavor ) . If you use vanilla beans , open up the pod and scrape the inside of it and put it in the beginning with the hot mix . That is another story . It is very delicious , but you see teeny tiny little beans swimming in your lighter mixes like vanilla bean ice cream .
As a child , I used to hate the feel and taste when I conciously bit on a piece of onion ( strongest offender : medium-sized chunks , sautéed glassy but still firm ) . Sometimes that still happens . However , I use onion a lot myself now in cooking . Lots of dishes really need the kind of taste onions can supply ; even though that taste may by itself be a bit gross , it 's really useful in the mix . ( This is true for many other ingredients as well ! ) I can only speak for myself , but very likely , there are some dishes where you do n't even notice that onions are in , but they are -- and you would n't like it if they were n't ! Do use onions , just do it consciously . There are broadly three ways of preparing them that I consider effective , each suited to different cases : Disperse them throughout the dish . Either chop them really fine and saut&eacute;e ( with the right technique and a decent knife you can get the chunks down to only a few millimetres ) , or boil with other vegetables and then pur&eacute;e . You 'll get all the good taste , but nowhere too strong and without any unpleasant mouth-feel . Ideal for light/creamy sauces or soups . Caramelise them boldly . Frying changes the taste of onions a lot , it makes them much sweeter , gets rid of the pungency in exchange for a really concentrated savouriness , and almost completely tames the consistency . Browned onions play great together with strong seasonings like garlic and pepper , as flavouring for chewy mushrooms or meats . Or the opposite : keep them mostly raw ! The freshness and crunch of raw onions can also be very useful without evoking what I call the bad onion effect -- albeit in a completely different way . Thinly sliced in salads , or very quickly stir-fried in rice dishes , you keep the raw pungency in check while staying clear of the uncanny softness . Again , it 's a good idea to define the taste heading with other sharp flavours : vinegar or chilies work well . Perhaps you wo n't be able to befriend yourself with all of these preparation methods , but you should give them a try .
A latte is similar to a cappuccino but with different proportions . It 's unsurprising that a similar method and equipment would be used . Cappuccino needs steamed milk to get the froth , so a coffee bar machine has a steam pipe . To boil the milk for a latte would require an extra piece of equipment and the associated space . Is perfectly possible to make an espresso-based drink with milk heated on the stove or in a microwave , that would be a close approximation to a latte -- possibly indistinguishable . But if you boil the milk , it will change the flavour .
The usual reason given is that Aluminum will react with the alkalis in dishwasher detergent and discolour . <URL>
Essentially , it 's like a giant chicken with a " deeper " and more distinctive flavor . The main reason I like them ( other than the flavor ) is the sheer quantity of meat you can get from one roasting session . One could roast multiple chickens for a similar effect , but with a turkey you only have one skeleton to pick meat off of , so it goes faster . Leftovers can be frozen and/or reused in all sorts of ways ( sandwiches , soups , casseroles , etc. ) . taste The breast meat of turkey is a little different from chicken , but they have a similar texture and both tend to be rather mild in flavor compared to game birds . If you had access to a wild turkey , the meat will be gamier . The dark meat of the turkey ( particularly legs and wings ) is generally much more flavorful than chicken , with a " deeper " flavor that some people love and others dislike . ( This may be the reason for the increasing popularity of whole turkey breasts sold by themselves in the U.S. , which can be roasted like a whole bird , but do n't have the " other parts " that are seen as less desirable by many . The vast majority of people I know tend mostly to eat turkey breast meat , usually served with gravy and stuffing . ) I 've seen turkey wings and legs sometimes offered at Southern U.S. BBQ joints ; when slow-cooked , they are a bit of a " Southern delicacy . " On most farm-raised turkeys I 've had recently , the thigh meat does n't have as much of that " rich turkey " flavor that I seem to recall in the past , but it has a more distinctive flavor than the breast meat . Internal organs ( " giblets " ) also tend to have a stronger flavor than chickens , if you 're into eating livers , gizzards , hearts , etc. . There 's often more fat in various parts of the bird than in typical U.S. chickens , which adds to a richer flavor . However , there 's usually not as much fat as found in other common U.S. poultry ( particularly duck and goose ) . appearance When prepared and ready to buy at a butcher , turkeys essentially look the same as any large poultry . They are often much larger than chickens , easily going to 20 lbs . ( 10 kg ) and more . There are some differences in proportions and details that you 'll see when cutting up or eating . In particular , the legs and wings have a bit more connective tissue and bony/cartilage bits than a chicken , since it 's a larger bird and needs more support . This also tends to make the leg and wing meat a bit " stringy , " which may be the reason for the slow-cooked versions I mentioned above , allowing time for the meat to break down more than when just roasting the whole bird . The meat is also a bit darker in color than chickens , particularly noticeable in the " dark meat " sections . cooking If buying a whole bird , most people in the U.S. essentially prepare it as they would make a large chicken , which usually means roasting in the oven . They are usually cooked at somewhat lower temperatures than chicken , to give time for the whole turkey to cook without drying out the exterior . Given the long roasting time for such a large bird , there 's been a bit of a trend recently to cut up the turkey so it lies flat ( " butterfly " or " spatchcock " ) , which allows it to cook faster and potentially more evenly . Other than that , one can often buy individual turkey parts and use them in similar ways to chicken parts , keeping in mind the longer cooking time required . They can also be used ( as with other poultry ) for soup meat , etc. .
Peanut butters that are not " all natural " include cheaper oils along with sugar and emulsifiers to keep the mixture from separating and to make it lighter and smoother . That lack of emulsifiers could make a huge difference but it depends a lot on the recipe . In a normal cookie dough fat is creamed with sugar and eggs are beaten in one at a time which adds a ton of emulsification power from the lecithin in the yolks . Additionally - the fat will bind with the flour and be baked into the cookies . Like Jefromi - I have not had any problem with the fat from natural peanut butter separating out after baking . If you made a cookie dough and either left out the yolks or did n't beat it well enough to properly emulsify - and then let the batter sit out for a while before baking I would fully expect the peanut oil to separate .
Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the ( often hot ) food . If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid , you 'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch . It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing . You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess ( unflavored ) water from the exterior . Otherwise , each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water , which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up , and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body .
It sounds like fermentation to me . That 's what you 'd expect when you 're making mead or hard apple cider . I 'd personally dispose of it ... partially because I ca n't think of a good use for alcoholic lemon juice , but also because you do n't know exactly what the bug is doing the fermentation .
Roasted garlic will get a slightly sweet flavor , dipped in a chocolate fondue can be wonderful and I have seen a recipe for garlic chocolate chip cookies . <URL>
Corn ( Maize ) is <URL> , and not any of the other things you mention . Even the farmers and agricultural agencies consider it a grain - it 's one of the " official grains of Canada " and regulated by the <URL> . I 'm not sure when or why it started being called a vegetable , but as far as the culinary definition goes , it has far too much sugar and starch to fall properly into that category . The typical culinary definition of a vegetable is savory , not sweet . Botanically , the kernels can be considered a type of fruit called a <URL> ( AKA a grain ) , although it 's not normally eaten as fruit ( for one thing , it 's normally cooked ) . It may accompany vegetables reasonably well , just like rice or many other grains . But it is a grain .
Ricotta is not supposed to melt , or dissolve , or anything like that . It is made up of protein clumps . The only way it can appear very smooth is if the manufacturer created a cheese where the clumps have been made very tiny mechanically - because chemically , they are still clumps and stay that way after heating . You said that you changed brands . There you have your explanation - your old brand must have been more finely " ground " than the new one , so you are noticing the clumps in the new one , while the ones in the old were too small to be noticed . This effect works in parallel with the gums Batman mentioned .

How to use cast-iron teacup ?
The cast iron tea equipment is a Japanese development . In Japan , tea is most commonly a green variety , and brewed at a lower temperature than boiling . This can be as low as 104 ˚F ( 40 ˚C ) for high grades of gyokuro , or as high as 167 ˚F ( 75 ˚C ) for more common varieties of sencha . The lower grade the tea , or the more oxidised/fermented the tea , the higher the temperature of the water recommended . In western tea culture , where black tea is the norm , the water used for tea preparation is usually boiling , 212 ˚F ( 100 ˚C ) , so if you are using cast iron equipment to prepare tea in the western fashion , you may be in for some burned fingers . This may also be the case for some Japanese ceramic tea services . I have one favourite Japanese stoneware tea cup that is equally likely to burn you if you put boiling water in it , unless you wait 5 minutes or more for it to cool . In any case , the cost associated with cast iron tea services is such that they are more often used for more formal settings in which a higher grade of tea , and therefore , a lower water temperature , are more likely to be indicated .
With thin cuts of meat ( like chicken breast or a steak ) , you want to make sure you put the thermometer in to the thin side of the meat so that the whole thermometer goes in to the meat , rather than putting it in through the " top " so that only a little of the thermometer is in the meat . If you 're putting it in the top , you can get wildly inaccurate temperatures . Also make sure that the thermometer is n't touching a pan , exposed to air , or touching a bone . Any of those can have a negative effect . Also , you only need to cook chicken to 74C / 165F . That may be part of the problem in your case . You may also want to check that your thermometer is accurate . You can stick it in boiling water to check that it reads 100C / 212F ( assuming of course it goes up that high ) .
You can season the exterior of the kettle to help prevent rust , if you like . The interior of a cast iron tea kettle is often rust-proofed through chemicals that accrue during normal use . One of these is lime scale . Repeatedly boiling water , especially hard water , will build a coating of lime scale that will keep rust at bay . Another set of chemicals that help reduce the occurrence of rust are tannins . The tannic acid in tea leaves will react with red iron rust on the kettle to produce a more stable , blue-black compound called ferric tannate . To " season " a brand new tea kettle you can save used tea leaves and bags then place several in the pot and adding boiling water . Allow the " tea " to sit for 20 minutes then discard and rinse . As other answers state , a traditional fat-polymer seasoning of the interior is unnecessary because you do not need to prevent food from sticking to the kettle .
Keep in mind that whipping cream or egg whites by hand may take longer than you expect . That said , there is a proper way to whisk egg whites , and it is quite likely that taking breaks due to your fatigue is interfering . See <URL> for detailed instructions . In particular , see below for an excerpt on one possible problem ( although there are numerous things that can potentially go wrong ) . We will split the whisking of egg whites into two parts . The first covers the disintegration of the mucous mass up to the point when it becomes a grayish , roundish mass . This part requires mixing with an easy and rhythmic effort . The second part covers the conversion of the round , gray mass into a smooth , light , firm , stunningly white batter . This second part , unlike the first , requires a very vigorous and accelerated effort . During both these periods , the whisking , even though different in strength and speed , must not be interrupted . Under no circumstances should you stop once you have begun to whisk . Stopping causes the whites to disintegreate . Instead of rising and firming up more and more , their mass will remain semi-solid and will take on a blotchy , grainy look .
I believe that the " clichéd image " you refer to is popular ( and cliché ) because of chili con carne 's long history of being cooked outdoors in big cauldrons or at least over an open flame . As any camper will tell you , iron is the traditional material of choice when cooking with fire . As for what actually happens - cast iron is a porous material , unlike stainless steel or aluminum . The seasoning in cast iron is essentially a layer of baked-in grease that fills those pores and over time absorbs the flavor of everything you cook in it . It absolutely does impart a characteristic flavour , but what that flavour is depends to no small degree on what 's been cooked in it before . If you do n't care properly for your cast iron , that flavour might very well be rancid fat . So whether or not the flavour you get with your chili makes it better , worse , or just different is largely a matter of personal taste and habits . As for the acidity : Yes , acids can react with the iron , but cast iron is fairly corrosion resistant . Cast iron is also used for pipes , so this is pretty well-documented by engineers ; you need <URL> to corrode cast iron to any significant degree . Pure tomato juice is not a strong acid ; it has a pH of <URL> , which is just at the threshold ; when you consider that this is being diluted with tomato purée , water , meat juices , and various other lower-acid substances , it 's evident that you 're well within normal tolerances and can cook chili and other tomato products for as long as you like . Also , the seasoning itself provides some measure of protection for higher-acid foods , since the acid has to penetrate the grease , and water is not good at penetrating fat - that 's why food rarely sticks to well-seasoned cast iron . Now this is not to say that the iron wo n't react at all , it just wo n't noticeably corrode or make your sauce/chili taste like metal . Consensus seems to be that you 'll end up with up to <URL> , which comes out to about 160 mg for the whole 3 quarts . That 's not good for you if you eat it all at once , but <URL> every day for a prolonged period of time , so unless you 're eating an entire quart/litre of chili or tomato sauce a day , it 's not going to be a health hazard . So do n't fill your cast iron pot with lemon juice or dump half a cup of vinegar in there - but do n't worry about a few tomatoes either . If anything , it just improves the nutritional content . As far as heat distribution is concerned , <URL> . It 's far more prone to hot spots than reasonably-priced aluminum - or copper-bonded stainless steel . What it does do is retain heat very well , so it 's excellent at maintaining just the right simmering temperature for something like chili , which you would otherwise need some fairly expensive stainless steel to achieve . But you have to be very careful of scorching when you cook chili in cast iron ; stir often . A few times I 've left my cast iron chili pot sitting around unattended for just a little too long and found some of the meat stuck to the bottom . Last but not least is the seasoning and the answer is no , you would n't season it any differently . As I alluded to above , the seasoning really does n't have much an effect when you 're cooking a sauce or stew as opposed to a piece of meat or something else that has a tendency to stick . The only function it really has here is to impart a tiny bit of flavour and insulate the iron from some of the acidity of the tomato juices , which is n't necessary anyway . All in all , I find cast iron to be very good for chili and other stews primarily because of its heat stability , but it 's no panacea , and if you 're only using the pot for chili then you wo n't get many of the benefits ( in particular the beautiful " black " seasoning that accumulates after hundreds of rounds of greasing and cooking ) . So by all means use your existing cast iron for chili and stews , but I would n't recommend for anybody to run out and buy a cast iron pot just for that purpose .
First of all , with omelettes -- any sauteed eggs really -- I much prefer butter . And with omelettes , less than a teaspoon is sufficient ; swirl it around the pan until fully melted , then pour off the excess . In this case , you would be using the butter for flavour , not any specific physical properties . For scrambled , user rather more . Fried eggs are generally the only time I will use olive oil , and even then I will use a mix of olive oil ( for the heat ) and butter ( for that flavour which goes so well with eggs ) . In general I prefer to avoid sprays ( unless you are talking about a pump-action spray bottle which you fill yourself ) as there are propellants and such used in sprays to make them work . Personally I prefer to avoid multisyllabic synthetic chemicals in my food whenever possible . But if you must ... sprays are most useful when you need a very thin but even coating of oil . Omelettes are a good example , though honestly I can not think of another use in cookery where I would find a spray advantageous . In baking , however , sprays can be quite useful . Especially when baking tarts , pies , or cakes which call for the pan to be buttered and then floured . A quick spray makes things much simpler .
A really well-sharpened santoku-style chef 's knife is usually my choice . But , it does depend on the type of slicing ... such as thick/thin discs , wedges , or dicing . While I understand that a serrated blade can help with slicing a super-ripe tomato , when I want really thin disc-shaped slices , something very sharp and preferably a thinner spine . The favorite in my kitchen is definitely a Henckel santoku chef blade . Some versions can have a very thick spine , and would n't work as well , though . This type of choice is also more utilitarian if you 're cutting any other veggies at the same time , or making additional cuts in the tomatoes , such as when you 're also going to be halving the discs or full-on dicing . Things I like the thinnest slices on are a ham and cheese melt , roast beef sammy , a sub for the road , and sometimes for a garnish . ( hors d'œuvre , anyone ? ) Also , when I 'm cutting tomatoes into wedges , I also like to use this same type of sharp , non-serrated blade . Otherwise , I find it harder than necessary to do the smaller divisions after the 1/4-of-a - tomato size . I nearly always do 1/8 or 1/12 sized wedges for salad , so it is n't terribly often I use a " real " tomato knife . When I do , is when it 's for a lunch and I do n't want to sully a larger blade , or when doing large batches . Getting the core out is certainly easiest with a smaller , serrated blade .
It can be a bit tricky , a couple of tips : Use a lot less liquid in the blender than normal . Do batches if needed . Vent the lid so the steam can escape . A lot of lids have a center piece that can come out . Using less liquid will stop stuff coming out the top . As Ocaasi suggests , you can cover the open lid with a kitchen towel as you start to insure there 's no spray . Start the blender slow and then speed it up . This may not work depending on how fast your slowest setting is . But once the vortex gets going , the liquid wo n't splash . It 's only when the blades start that you have that issue . Slower start speed means less splash ( a vita-mix can start very slowly and have no splash at all , great for hot liquids but the price tag is a bit high ) .
Do n't reuse an old milk jug for storing the new , combined milk . The standard plastics used in milk jugs in most areas can not be properly sanitized for reuse ( even with standard sanitizing solutions ) . Instead , use a properly sanitized and covered glass or plastic container , preferably one that you clean in a hot water dish washer . Milk stored in a properly cleaned container will have the maximum shelf life ( and reduced chance of other contaminants ) .
Here 's a website that goes into it and includes a picture of the gizmo to which you refer : <URL> " This little single serving device is meant to fit over a cup , hold about two tablespoons worth of coffee , and the required amount of water for brewing . There is a screen on the bottom , and a plunger with another screen on it that screws down on top of the coffee to smush it between the two filters . The tightness of this top filter controls the strength of the coffee . The tighter it is , the slower water flows , and the stronger the brew . " EDIT : Regarding the " bonus question " : I 'm not aware of chicory as an ingredient in Vietnamese/Thai iced coffee , I 'm only familiar with it as a traditional New Orleans addition , having migrated from France . It became a popular substitution during the French Revolution when coffee became prohibitively expensive . I dug up a recipe for New Orleans chicory coffee <URL> . " Ingredients 1 lb . coarsely ground coffee , 1 1/2 oz . roasted and chopped chicory , 2 1/2 quarts water , 3 oz . simple syrup , Tools Large stockpot , Wooden spoon , Fine-mesh sieve , Large Mason jar , Combine the ground coffee , chicory and water in a stockpot . Stir with a wooden spoon , cover and let steep at room temperature for 8-12 hours . Carefully break the crust of the coffee grounds with a spoon and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the Mason jar . Add simple syrup to concentrate and stir to combine . Serve over ice and add milk to taste -- most people opt for about a 50/50 ratio of milk to chicory-coffee concentrate . Keep refrigerated and use within 1-2 days . Yields 4-5 cups of concentrate .
The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on . Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat . Give cast iron ample preheating time , and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan . That equals crispy . Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron . You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan . That alone probably would n't make much of a difference , but considering that you 're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes , the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan . That is not a friend of crispiness . You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature . I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan . Teflon , on the other hand , should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time . Some people go so far as to say that you should n't preheat it all . So if your beginning temperatures were about the same in the pans , they should n't have been . After you put in the potatoes , forget about it . You 'll never get the same kind of crispy sear with a teflon pan as you will with cast iron , even if you do n't know how to best exploit the advantages of cast iron .
You would know if the dutch oven was covered in wax . Cast iron prior to seasoning is a light grey color . It will rust very quickly just from atmospheric moisture , so they cover it in paraffin wax to preserve it . The process of seasoning the utensil forms a tough , yet smooth , black coating of polymerized oil . If your dutch oven is a slightly shiny dark black , it is safe to say that it has already been seasoned . With the proper care your dutch oven will last you many lifetimes -- enjoy it !
Coconut oil is a saturated fat , which makes it solid at room temperature . Above room temperature , it behaves exactly like any other oil and has a very high smoke point . You do n't need to treat it in any special way . I personally just use a knife or spoon to dig a little bit out of the container . Coconut oil is considered to have a neutral flavour ( with the exception of some " virgin " coconut oils ) . It 's much weaker than , say , olive oil . You 'll most likely not be able to detect any coconut flavour from oil alone - you have to use something like creamed coconut ( a common ingredient in satays ) for that . P.S. Although it might appear to be similar to butter or margarine , keep in mind that it is actually a cooking oil , unlike butter which has milk solids that burn , or margarine which is hydrogenated to make it solid . Coconut oil is just barely solid and wo n't always work as a substitute for those other things .
Bear in mind that I 'm using an electric kettle , rather than a stove-top one . First , the advantage of a kettle is that it is quite efficient , and turns itself off once the water is boiling . This as opposed to the microwave , which only stops after a set time , rather than relying on the condition of the water . Second , a microwave can cause water to superheat , particularly in a ceramic or glass container . This means that there is a certain risk that the water will " jump out " at you once you add something to it or put a spoon in . Additionally , most kettles have more power than the average microwave , so the kettle is probably faster to boil water .
Iron is simply an element , so it can not be destroyed by cooking ( or generally temperature changes ) , as vitamins and other organic structures potentially can . Cooked spinach inevitably has a much lower water content , thus the relative density of all other components must increase . So gram for gram , it makes sense that cooked spinach should have a higher concentration of iron ( and possibly some other things ) than raw . However , the actual process of cooking does nothing to change the amount of iron .
I would do it the other way round , I 'd fry the sausages first , then add the veg . This has a few benefits as I see it : - The sausages will brown more evenly , purely aesthetic but some people will think they are not cooked if they are not brown . You 'll get the oil out of the sausages so you 'll have a better idea of how much oil to add when you add the veg , if any . The veg will sweat down in the sausage oil which is likely to be much nicer than the other oil You can cook the sausages on a really low heat to start with so that they really get sticky and caramelised , then when you add the veg back in you can add a spoon of water/vinegar/stock to deglaze the pan an get that lovely sticky sausage goodness all over your veggies , which will be delicious . You could optionally take the cooked sausages out of the pan and do the veg separately , or keep 'em in there , I 'd probably take them out so I could turn the heat up a bit without having to worry about the sausages . I 'd say that when you do add the veg you want a thin ( 1mm ish ) layer of oil in the pan . Depending on the pan this is probably a tables spoon or 2 . You probably do n't need to scale up as if you are cooking a bigger batch you will probably use a bigger pan , and so a similar depth of oil should suffice . If you are using the same pan , but with a deeper amount of veg , then I would add a little more , but I would make the depth of oil in the pan proportional to the depth of veggies . Remember the golden rule . You can always add , you can never take away . And once the veg start to cook down and the volume decreases then the oil ratio will be higher , so start out with a little less than you think , just enough to coat the veg when tossed in it .
If it 's properly seasoned , and affixed well to the pan , there should n't be any problem . In fact , it 's what I typically use to <URL> even if I 'm not making a sauce . If you 're reducing a sauce that 's highly acidic , you might have cause for concern , as you do n't want to have acids in the pan for long periods .
Look at : <URL> Conversion Measurements for Using Different Yeasts in Recipes :
The bottom of the 8 " pan is a bit less than half the size . For a 2 " deep-dish , there 's a 2-inch high ( if you take it to the top ) 8π circumferential strip for another 16π , and presumably the 12 " dough is for a flat pizza . At 32π . vs. 36π I 'd do the whole box , unless your deep dish is n't really all that deep . I 'm also a bit concerned about the " never used " cast iron pan needing some seasoning , but perhaps it 's " lodge logic " pre-seasoned .
I have made refried beans out of pinto , small red , black , and even navy beans . I almost tried using kidney beans once but it seemed wasteful . They were all different in texture but they were all good . Black beans , for example , have a much more fibrous skin so the refried beans are not as smooth - I actually prefer it to the homogeneous pinto mash . Obviously their color is also more interesting . There are a lot of different bean varieties and I do n't know what is available to you . In general I would say to just try whatever you have - it will probably taste good even if it is n't exactly like pintos .

How do I avoid hot fudge turning my ice cream into a soupy mess ?
I think isolating the fudge could be a good way to fix this . It might complicate your dish , but it might add both to the presentation as well as to the texture of the ice cream . Try getting hold of or make your own biscuit rolls ( I do n't know the name ) . Fill these up with hot fudge . The biscuit will act as isolation keep the texture of both the ice cream and the fudge . In this way the only time the two will get in contact with each other is when one breaks up the biscuit to eat it . If biscuits does n't cut it , chocolate tubes or similar could do the same trick .
In NZ normal pure cream is close enough to " double cream " in performance , it 's around 35 % to 40 % fat . By general global definition it should be called " heavy cream " NZ cream is pure skimmed cream from fresh milk , and does not need thickening or other processing to produce excellent results as a whipped product , or for a thick cream additive in sauces or fillings Cream can get a little seasonal just after calving time ( Aug ) , but in general it 's just perfect The export variety is often labelled " Culinary Cream " and is 38 % fat or higher . This is what many people around the world would consider NZ cream ( other than NZ butter or AMF ) If you want closer to 50 % fat cream , ask your local farmers for some raw milk and skim out the lumps of fat from that . Let the milk settle overnight and skim the cream from that . Then gently heat the fat lumps to melt and carefully mix into the skimmed cream . Not for the faint of heart ! NZ " Thickened cream " or " Mascarpone cream " is standard pure cream with a thickener like E1442 added , you can <URL>
Well , yes and no . A lot of recipes for semifreddo are n't truly semifreddo because they are hard frozen . Recipes like that can be fried just like ice cream . The key to fried ice cream is to hard freeze the scoops of ice cream . By definition , that is n't semifreddo , but definitions do n't seem to matter much to writers of recipes . So , if the " stuff " is hard frozen , it can be coated and fried like fried ice cream . Perhaps after being deep fried , the name " semifreddo " is more apropos .
Corn starch only thickens when heated to 180 F , so it probably is not helping at all with your whipped cream . I live in the US , so I can not compare to whipped cream in the UK . Whipped cream for cake fillings is often beaten almost to the breaking point to make the foam as thick as possible . I assume you are whipping the cream sufficiently , and it still is n't getting as thick as you would like . If that is the case , you might try <URL> . The link is one of many I have found on a quick search , and it specifically calls for 35 % cream . This <URL> also has some interesting thoughts and advise . This <URL> also provides an interesting method of using creme fraiche .
Thinking about this from first principles , a banana is about : 75 % water 20 % carbohydrates ( mostly sugar and a small amount of starch ) Less than 5 % combined fiber and protein Trace amount of fat ( generally considered to be zero ) . The anti-crystallization effect of guar gum works on the water component , so adding a small amount of guar gum actually should be of some benefit . The hard part is getting it all dispersed ; you do n't want to over-process the banana ( you 'd lose the creaminess ) but you also need to hydrate the guar gum in order for it to work its magic . You also need to avoid over-thickening , which might be difficult even with the very small starch content in a typical banana . Bananas convert more starch to sugar as they ripen , so I suspect you 'd have more success trying this on very ripe bananas that are , essentially , little more than sugar and water to begin with . Incorporating and maintaining air is something that I just do n't think you 're going to be able to do . Proteins and fats can both participate in foaming ( egg whites being an example of the former , and heavy cream being the canonical example of the latter ) , but bananas have neither of those . There 's simply nothing to whip , and thus nothing to stabilize , so neither xanthan gum nor any other emulsifier/stabilizer is going to do you much good here . If you really want to incorporate air then you 're going to need more than one ingredient . My instinct would be to say coconut milk , which has relatively high fat and pairs well with banana ( and obviously is also vegan / non-dairy ) , but I can say from experience now that coconut milk just does n't have enough fat . You could try cooking it down first to get the fat ratio up , or using coconut oil , but I 'm not sure how it would taste . Traditional ice cream is about 60 % water , which means the amount of guar gum that most people seem to get the best results with ( about 1 tsp/qt ) is about 0.87 % of the total water . For a small ( 100 g ) banana , that 's about 75 mL of water corresponding to very close to 1/8 tsp of guar gum . So , I 'd give this a try with 1/8 tsp of guar gum , forget the xanthan gum . Try adding it after you 've frozen the banana for the first time , when you first pop it into the blender . No guarantees , but , you can probably afford to waste one banana in the attempt . Update : I thought I 'd give this a try myself since ( a ) it seemed pretty easy and ( b ) I can always use more non-dairy dessert recipes . Here 's how it came out with 1/4 tsp of guar gum for 2 bananas , after being frozen for two days : You can see that ice crystal formation is pretty minimal , and although some parts did harden a bit ( much like ordinary homemade ice cream with low overrun ) , they returned to normal consistency within just a few minutes . Of course it still tastes like frozen bananas , so if I were to do this again I think I 'd probably try adding a few other flavours . Also note that even though the texture is decent , the colour is getting dark , and I have no doubt that this would eventually turn black after enough time in the freezer - and the lemon juice trick does n't really work so well when the whole thing has been blended up .
Well , if it was a boat , you 'd swab it every few days ( " swab the desk " ) so it stayed wet and swollen . You could also treat the bucket with a food-grade mineral oil . You can find it in most kitchenware stores for protecting cutting boards . The oil will evaporate much slower than water will , but it will still evaporate . You might try putting the whole thing in a large plastic bag or similar container , so whatever moisture evaporates stays in the air surrounding the bucket , slowing further moisture loss ... but moist , stagnant air is n't good for long periods of time , either , as you could end up with mold that would be even more annoying to deal with . Or , as the bucket 's only touching the ice &amp; salt mix , and not coming in direct contact with food , you could always use wood treatments available from any hardware store . update : I was reading up on walnut oil , and wikipedia linked to a woodworker <URL> for finishing wood that would come in contact w / food , but that you should re-coat each year . I assume the beeswax would give it longer durability as compared to straight mineral oil sold for cutting boards .
As someone who uses liquid nitrogen as part of their daily routine ( in a lab ) and who has made liquid nitrogen ice cream on several occasions , my advice would be to not use a plastic container to hold liquid nitrogen unless it 's designed to . Yes , the plastic vessel may become brittle and may fracture . I have seen some materials shatter with extreme violence when frozen with liquid nitrogen ; do not attempt this . Vessels for handling cryogenic liquids are designed especially for the job , and made from materials such as stainless steel , styrofoam , teflon , HDPE or silvered borosilicate glass . Unless you know with certainty that your container is designed to withstand temperatures of -196 & deg ; C ( -321 & deg ; F ) , do not attempt this procedure .
Spanish hot chocolate and Italian cioccolata fiorentina both use cornstarch as a thickening agent . Both are used more for dipping or sipping ( churros in the former case ) , however you could easily just use less cornstarch to make it more ' drinkable ' . Try a teaspoon of cornstarch , mixed with a little cold water , added to the milk when you boil it . As Kate Gregory suggests , you could also use full-fat milk , or loads of shaved chocolate .
Disclaimer : I am not an expert on foams . I 've made a couple before , successfully , but never anything like a lobster bisque foam . So I would advise any casual readers to do their own fact-checking and try this on a small scale - at least until somebody can verify it . Now , onto the questions : I have Lecithin and Mono/diglyceride from a set . It says they 're both emulsifying agents . Which should I use ? What 's the difference ? First of all , what you want for a foam is a stabilizer , and <URL> . Personally , I have never heard of mono/diglyceride being used for a culinary foam . Some research suggests that it is actually an <URL> ! Stick to the lecithin . Note : For the sake of completeness , lecithin is also considered a <URL> , which means it facilitates the foaming itself in addition to stabilizing it . This is especially important when making foams out of things that do n't naturally foam , like teas or juices . What 's the appropriate ratio of emulsifying agent to liquid ? How does changing the ratio affect the foam ? <URL> suggests starting with a 0.6 % ratio , but most people ( myself included ) use a ratio of 1 % - in other words , 1 g of lecithin for every 100 mL of liquid . See <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> . The ratio is not quite as sensitive as some other hydrocolloids where you need to measure out sub-grams , but it is still important ; too little and your foam wo n't hold at all ( seems to be what happened to you ) , too much and you 'll end up with soy-flavoured soap . Note : When making a foam out of something that does not naturally foam , such as juice , you may need to up the ratio as high as 2 % . Milk-based foams rely partially on the foaming ability of milk itself . Does temperature effect how the foam forms ? Sort of . Actually , if you 're making a milk-based foam then it 's pretty much the same as just <URL> - i.e. for a cappuccino . The only difference is that you 've added a stabilizing agent , so it will stay foamy . So basically you just need to keep it under 80 ° C or 175 ° F , otherwise it will burn . Lecithin can dissolve in cold water , so you really do n't need to be very precise , but anecdotally , it 's best if it 's slightly warmed , say around 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) . What consistency should my bisque be to make a good foam ? Does it need to be thin , or will it work thick ? You want a very thin consistency , close to the consistency of water , for the same reason that it 's better to use skim milk for frothing and egg whites for meringue . Generally speaking , it 's the proteins that are most active in creating culinary foams ; large amounts of fat ( such as in cream ) can interfere with the foaming action and also add weight , which is not at all what you want in a foam . I have n't made lobster bisque , but I believe it 's very thick and made with cream - not a good candidate for foams . I looked at <URL> which involves tomato paste , corn starch , and cream ; if making a foam I think I would substitute a thin tomato sauce or juice , reduce or eliminate the corn starch , and use skim milk instead of cream . Remember that you 're not trying to serve this bisque , you 're using it in a foam . What else should I know before trying to make this ? I do n't have a Vitamix , and maybe it can do a lot of cool things that one ca n't do with an ordinary blender , but nevertheless , I 've never heard of a culinary foam being made in an actual blender . A stick blender ( AKA hand blender , immersion blender ) is much more reliable for foaming .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
The goal is to evaporate alcohol and concentrate flavor . If adding wine to a mirepoix , or sofrito ... some sort of early stage aromatic vegetable ... reduce the wine almost until the pan goes dry , but not dry enough to cause sticking or burning . The flavor will be absorbed into the vegetable and you are good to go . If there is another instance of wine addition that you are considering , please specify .
You want to make a " mint infusion " . Googling this will give you many recipes . Basically you brew the mint like herbal tea : Remove stems , Bruise the leaves a little , Add the leaves to a cup of very hot water , Let steep for a few minutes , strain and throw away the mushy leaves and use the liquid for your flavoring . The liquid will be brown as you are destroying the chlorophyll that makes the leaves green . In most applications I add food coloring to fix this . As you are making chocolate mint ice cream this should not be a problem . Save some of your mint leaves to use as a garnish . I love chocolate mint and I am very excited for you having a bumper crop of it .
What you want is cream with 35 % -40 % milkfat , and no gelatine or other stabilizers for whipping . If you use a lighter cream , then it will not have the rich , creamy texture , and evenly thick consistency you seek . In fact , if you use a light enough cream , it will not thicken properly . Now we enter the murky realm of regional naming differences , trying to find the appropriate kind of cream ! In Australia , this would be called pure cream ( 35-56 % milkfat ) ... which might be the same as " cooking thickened cream . " Read the label and make sure it is just cream , not gelatin or foam stabilizers like " thickened cream " . It could also be labelled " single cream " too ( ~ 35 % milkfat ) . In America , we call it heavy cream , or heavy whipping cream , and it is defined as 35 % + milkfat , and is generally around 38 % . In the UK , <URL> I found the uses a mixture of milk and " double cream " ( cream with 48 % + milkfat ) . They mix 100 mL whole fat milk + 426 mL of double cream . The final milkfat content is somewhere around 40 % . In the rest of the EU , the same procedure appears to be the best bet , since I ca n't find clear names for heavier creams besides double cream ( which appears to be the same as the UK ) . Edit : You may also be able to get a good result using straight double cream . I 'm looking at a French recipe that uses it . The catch is , of course , that while the minimum fat content is specified , actual fat content in double cream can vary considerably , potentially giving erratic results .
Brew it strong and then add ice . Alternately , freeze some coffee in ice cube trays and use those frozen coffee cubes to chill the new batch without diluting it . Agitation ( shaking ) with cubes is a good substitute for crushed ice -- both ensure that the hot coffee meets the cold surface of the ice quickly . If you sweeten your iced coffee , using chilled simple syrup will help cool the brew and avoid problems getting the sugar to dissolve ( sugar does n't dissolve well in cold liquids ) .
To expand michaels answer ( assuming that you want strawberry icecream and not pieces of strawberry mixed in ) . If you are making a custard ice cream , leave the amount of egg yolks the same , because you want the lecithin from them . Reduce the sugar somewhat , because fruit is sweet . Then decide how much fruit puree you want ( maybe 1/3 the volume of the dairy part ) . Adjust the volume of the dairy so that the liquid is correct . Adjust the fat of the dairy so that the fat content is correct . Example , you start with the recipe for vanilla ice cream French ( = custard ) style by Lebovitz . 1 cup ( 250ml ) whole milk ; A pinch of salt ; 3/4 cup ( 150g ) sugar ; 1 vanilla bean , split lengthwise ; 2 cups ( 500ml ) heavy cream ; 5 large egg yolks ; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract This recipe has 185g fat ( I calculated with 30 % fat in the cream ) , 460g dry matter ( this is both fat and non-fat ) and yields 990g ice cream ( rounded a bit ) . Let 's say that you decide to use 200g strawberry puree . 200g strawberry puree has 10g sugars , 18g dry matter and no fat . A mixture of 5 yolks , 140g sugar ( if you want , you can look at the fructose sweetness coefficient and change the sugar accordingly , but I think this is n't so much of a problem if we just substitute the 10g from strawberries ) , 200g strawberry puree and some salt and vanilla has 25g fat , 225g dry matter and weighs 430g ( rounded ) . You could create two equation systems , the first for the total volume of the dairy mixture needed , and the second one for the ratio of cream to milk , and solve these to get to a mixture with the original ratio . fatamount/total = fatpercentage liquidamount/total = liquidpercentage fatpercentage + liquidpercentage + nonfatdrypercentage = 1 where you know fatamount , liquidamount and nonfatdrypercentage is around 0.1 ( actually 0.08 for milk only and 0.12 for cream only , but we do n't need so much precision ) . Solve for total , then calculate fatpercentage . 0.3 * cream + 0.04 * milk = fatpercentage * ( milk + cream ) milk + cream = total I will take a shortcut here . I specified almost as much strawberries as milk . They have no fat ( unlike milk ) , but a similar ( actually higher ) amount of dry mass . So let 's see what happens when we keep the 500g cream and turn the 50g difference between strawberries and milk into cream too ( because we suspect we want some more fat ) . Then we have 190 g fat , 290g dry matter and 980g ice cream base . At 19.38 % fat , we are above the ratio given in the article , but close to the original ratio ( and I suspect that the article might be about Philadelphia style ice cream , which has less fat ) . The 29.59 % dry matter are again outside of the article recommendation , but close to the original recipe . In fact , I assume that well emulsified fat can prevent ice crystal creation , so the higher liquid content does n't create problems here ( also note that McGee gives a 10-20 % range for fat in ice cream , not 7-12 % ) . Long story short : do n't add fruit puree , it is mostly water . Substitute puree for milk , calculate the new percentage of fat and dry matter ( use the 7-12 % fat and 37-42 % liquid for a recipe without emulsifiers , you can be freer if you have emulsifiers ; egg yolk counts as emulsifier ) . If you are still not there , try the calculation with less puree , or increase the fat and/or dry matter until you are in the recommended range . Or just start with the equations . NB # 1 I did n't check my calculations , could have a mistake there . But the principle should be correct . NB # 2 I calculated with cream density of 1 . This was somewhat surprising , but the nutrition data for cream I found insists that a cup of cream ( 240 ml ) weighs 238 g , so the difference is small enough to not go to the trouble to convert . A recipe given by volume probably ( hopefully ) has some leeway , so this should n't skew the results into a bad recipe .
An easy way of incorporating a spicy kick into any existing chocolate cake recipe that uses actual chocolate would be to substitute a portion of the called for chocolate ( with a matching chocolate type ; i.e. dark and dark , milk and milk ) that already has cayenne or some other hot pepper ingredient . Of course , you will need to experiment to get the right level of heat . Adding straight cayenne powder while the chocolate is melted , or shredded would also be an ideal time to ensure even distribution of the spice . In the event your recipe does not use an actual chocolate base , but rather something that replicates the flavor , the time to add the cayenne would be when the ' flavor packet ' is added .
I think your ' troubleshooter ' and the desire to know what to do to get a different result ( ' more chew , or a flaky crust , etc ) are definitely one in the same . You 'll need to understand the basic chemistry of bread ( and some critical techniques as well ) . Baking in general is more ( not all ) chemistry than normal cooking . If you throw too much of something in , it may not just taste different , but change the entire critical chemical reaction in the oven . Once that 's cemented in your head , then if your bread does n't rise , you immediately know that its one of a few things . If you want a crisp crust , you 'll know what to add . Its the same knowledge . The best two references that I 've read in regards to this are : <URL> - Its pretty much a classic now and a must read for anybody wanting to get into baking . Its got great chemistry , technique , and recipes in it.This is the book that made MANY things with bread just ' click ' with me . A large chunk of this book deals with sourdough . <URL> - Just like on TV , he goes through the why and the how of everything . It 's a general baking book - not just for bread , but there 's a whole section on dough . I like the techniques and understanding here , but found the recipes to be a bit lackluster . ( He 's got pancake info here too ! ) Additionally , I 'd encourage you to ask specific problems in regards to your bread issue on here . There 's a wealth of knowledge on the site and absorbing some via here would be a perfectly valid resource .
In Scotland we make a kind of fudge that is deliberatly hard and crystallised known as <URL> . This was a popular treat when I was growing up . Essencially the recipe for tablet , soft fudge , toffee and caramel are quite similar . The difference is made by how you cook and treat the mix as it cools . Essentially you need to know about <URL> . There are two important levels used : soft boil , and hard boil . My cook books suggest using a sugar thermometer to get the perfect boil but I 've never found a sugar thermometer in the shops . Instead I rely on a great deal of practice , the colour , the texture and the drip of the mix to gage how hot the sugar is . In a soft boil ( 234 -- 240 ° F or 112 -- 115 ° C ) , if you drip the mix onto a very cold surface or into cold water , then touch the drip with your finger , it will be soft like caramel . Additionally the colour will change from cream to yellow/tan . In a hard boil ( 250 -- 266 ° F or 121 -- 130 ° C ) , dripping again onto a cold surface or into cold water , then touching the drip with your finger , it will be firmer or even hard . The colour will darken slightly to a dark yellow or light brown . For caramel and fudge you go to a soft boil then cool . For tablet and toffee you go to a hard boil . The next part is the cooling . This is equally important as the boiling . The faster you cool the mix the smaller the crystals become . The slower , the larger . If you want a caramel or a toffee , you must avoid agitating the mix as it cools . For fudge you should stir the gently as it cools slightly before pouring onto the try . For tablet , the mix should be vigorously stirred until stiff then poured onto a try .
I 've never done anything in particular . I just do n't use soap on it .
You will need to be careful about extra liquid in your sauce . Your base recipe should be adaptable . Go ahead and use the garlic and onion , but I would omit the white wine . If you are using canned whole tomatoes , drain liquid before using them . Simmer it to reduce it down until it is " spreadable " rather than " pour-able " . We make a lot of home-made pizza sauce with canned whole San Marzano tomatoes , drained and puree 'd in blender . Salt , pepper , garlic and a few spices . My husband loves bright red color in the sauce so a bit of citric acid does the trick . Enjoy your pizza .

How do you finely dice an onion without crying ?
Breathe through your mouth . The tear-causing chemicals in onions are absorbed through the nasal mucous membrane . By breathing through your mouth , they do n't get much contact with the fumes and wo n't absorb nearly as much .
The tearing of the eyes is a result of enzymes that form a sulpherous gas when the onion is cut ( concentrated inside the inner core or bulb of the onion ) being released into the surrounding air . You have a few options to avoid this - one would be to not cut through the center of the onion but to extract the " core " . This is kind of a pain and means you are discarding a decent chunk of onion , so I do n't like it too much . Another option is to use a fan to blow the gases away from you . A small fan next to you blowing horizontally should do the trick . You could also wear goggles , although you 'd have to leave them on for a while until the gas dissipates from the area . Another technique is to cut a lemon in half and rub the fresh lemon against both sides of the blade . You 'll have to keep " refreshing " the juice coat and your onions will have some lemon juice on them , so this is somewhat limited by that factor .
Cook 's Illustrated recommends storing lemons in the fridge in a tightly sealed ziptop bag with the excess air removed . I would imagine that the same applies to limes . As I understand it , the idea is to prevent air circulation in order to reduce the rate of dehydration . <URL>
Clearly , your flatmate was misinformed . Firstly , Italian cuisine is defined regionally . There are vast differences throughout the country , usually defined by local ingredients and historical influences . However , there are many Italian dishes ... from north to south that contain both onion and garlic . It could be true that someone 's specific recipe for , spinach , for example may only have onion ... or only have garlic , but if you like the combination , there is no reason not to use it . There is no such general " rule " in Italian cuisine .
If the banana flower was astringent it is because of the flower , not the cooking method . When the flowers are large and young they taste a lot better . If you wait until the bananas are formed and the stem to the flower is long then it will be astringent . The best time to pick the flower is when the stem is 10cm or less from the banana bunch . If the flower is old it will not be as good . The variety of banana will also influence the taste of the flower . Sugar bananas often have the best flowers . You can eat the pink section but it is not as pleasant as the white section . If you eat the small individual flowers you need to take out the stepal in the centre which is incredibly time consuming . Putting the banana flower in lime water is simply to stop it going brown before you cook it . It does not significantly change the flavour . There are many ways to cook banana flower . Here is my preferred method . Peel the flower until you come to the white centre . Discard the red outer section and the individual flowers hidden within this . I like to quarter the centre and then I place in boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes with some salt . For me it is delicious just like this with some lime , but from here you can put it in a cooked curry , salad etc

That is simply caramelized sugar that coats the dish before the custard is poured in for baking . As the flan is chilled , the moisture from the custard liquefies the caramelized sugar and results in the sauce . If you 're wanting to make it for other desserts and are n't making flan , then simply caramelize sugar and then add water to it . Be careful as the steam can easily burn you if you 're standing over it . The sugar will seize up and then as it continues to cook the crytallized caramelized sugar will liquefy . You will then have caramelized sugar syrup .
Adding salt and lemon should do it , or at least help a lot . What you want to do is to chop them up and rub in a little salt and a splash of lemon juice ( vinegar should work too ) . Obviously you do n't want to add so much of either that you wo n't want to eat the onion . Leave to sit in the fridge overnight and enjoy .
I trim the stem and remove the outer leaves till they snap to get to the fresh inner core and steam them the night or morning before grilling so they are cold and moist . I prefer steaming because I want all of the nutrients to remain in the artichoke . I cut them in half for the grill , remove the choke and brush them with grapeseed oil where they come into contact with the grill . First , facing down grill them till they feel hot on top then ; flip them over to keep the yummy inner side tender . fill the cavity with garlic butter and ... lemon if you wish . I prefer the brown color to the lemon flavor . I cook them till the butter melts . I like mine barely smokey because artichokes take on the smoke too easily and will taste burned . You ca n't taste the flavor of the artichoke if it gets too smokey .
Pureeing onions makes them release a lot more of their water than just chopping them , and if you added extra water on top of that , you probably had a very wet paste . That makes it take a lot longer to cook - while you 're just boiling away water , it 's not hot enough to brown much . So cook it as long as it takes - it 's not going to become bitter . ( If anything , it 'll get sweeter ! ) And if you want it to cook faster , do n't add extra water . If you watch carefully , you can also turn the stove up hotter at the beginning to boil off water faster , then reduce the heat once it 's drying out enough to avoid burning it . If whatever you used to make the puree does n't work well without the extra water , you can still use it ; just know that it 'll make it take longer to cook . Otherwise , you could try grating the whole onion on a cheese grater , which does a surprisingly good job - it 'll still be really juicy though !
I 'm afraid this is impossible . It 's the freezing , not the thawing , that causes this . Remember , water expands when freezing , so the freezing process breaks the cell walls , so when the pepper thaws , it has lost its crispness . This does n't matter if you 're going to mince it finely or cook it , though ! I freeze peppers regularly .
That 's all there is to it . It seems you already know this , but just to be sure , be aware that " blackened " refers to the spice and not any burning or charring that is done . Burnt spices taste horrendous .
If you ca n't get a bigger cutting board , here are a couple pointers to getting the most done CLEANLY in a small space ( mostly tricks from my kitchen manager ) : Use a sharp knife . It 's easier to control , and when you chop , pieces do n't move as much . Hone it at least daily to keep the edge aligned . Organize your work on the board . If you 're right-handed , keep raw ingredients on the left side , and finished , cut product on the other . Keep the spot you 're using to cut clear . It may only be 4-6 square inches , but it should n't have anything to get in the way . I like to use the bottom middle of the board for cutting and the corners &amp; top to organize stuff in various stages of cutting . Remove trash ( trimmings , ends , unusable vegetable scraps ) from the board . Either keep a trashcan next to the counter , or use a bowl to collect garbage . This frees up space on your cutting board . You can use additional bowls to store uncut material , and finished results . This frees up more cutting board area . All of these tips help , but I 'll tell you what my chef told me : the bigger your cutting board , the more room you have to work , and the faster you can go . As your knife skills improve , you will be able to work in a smaller space without problems . But first , start off with plenty of room . As you you gain experience , your cuts become more precise , you organize your space , and work faster and cleaner . With this advice in mind , you should move to a larger cutting board . The extra space to work make it much easier to develop proper knife skills , because you 're not trying to cramp yourself in . I suggest the largest board that you can comfortably fit in your sink for cleanup . With professional knife skills , I can handle prepping multiple items on an 8.5 " x 9.5 " cutting board ; however , I find that my 11 " x 14 " board provides a lot more room to organize my work , and is more comfortable to use . At work , I use the biggest board I can fit on my station .
If you have a metal strainer then I Fill a large pot with water . Just enough so it almost comes up to the bottom of the strainer when you place it on top . Insert the strainer so it is balanced above the water . Fill strainer with vegetables and cover with a lid Boil Take off when the vegetables are steamed to your specifications Enjoy
I just asked the exact same question here ! : <URL> I found a pretty good answer online . It actually would be easier and cheaper for you to throw it out , as you do n't have to buy as much organic flour in the future to feed your starter . Imagine buying 5 cups each day to feed your starter when you could just use 100 grams ! : During the " initial " development - and by this I assume we 're talking the first several days of your brand spanking new starter , what you 'll be throwing away is likely not even " starter " but rather flour soup wherein there 's a fairly good chance you 're also growing a few less-than-desirable cohabitants . This would explain why you 'd want to chuck it out rather than use it . You also cut back on your starter so you do n't end up with gallons of it since quite early on you do begin to make your feeds at a ratio of 1:1:1 or 1:2:2 . For illustrative purposes , let 's follow the 1:2:2 ratio and just assume we 're using cups ( easier to visualize ) although you really would be weighing , of course . So let 's say on day 1 morning feed , we begin with a half cup of starter . Half a cup sounds like nearly nothing , right ? To that we 'd then need to add twice that amount of each water and flour , so we add 1 cup water and 1 cup flour for a total of 2.5 cups . Still not that bad . Day 1 evening feed , we 're not reducing so we need to add to our 2.5 cups of starter 5 cups water and 5 cups flour for a total of 11 cups . Set it on the counter , hope it does n't overflow everywhere and go to bed . Day 2 morning feed , we 're still not tossing away so to our 11 cups we have to add 22 cups of water and 22 cups of flour . We now have 55 cups of starter or about 3.5 gallons . Remember , this is only the third feed and we started with just a measly half cup yesterday morning . At tonight 's feed , we 'll have 312 cups or 19.5 gallons of starter . Just enough to fill up four of those white Home Depot buckets although you 'll want at least eight of 'em so the starter can double in size . By morning of day three , you can fill your bathtub , if it holds 97 gallons ; it very well may not , and definitely wo n't hold the expanded starter . By afternoon , you 'll also be borrowing an additional four neighbour 's tubs for your 488 gallons . How soon before you need to move this out to a local swimming pool to continue ? Well , by the end of day five , you 'd be the proud owner of 305,175.8 gallons of starter . Or 4.8 million cups . Seriously . An Olympic size pool is about 600,000 gallons . By the morning of day six , you can fill two and a half of them , with leftovers . And it has n't even been a full week yet . And that 's why you cut your starter back down to a manageable amount each time . It 's a lot cheaper to toss a little bit out than to keep it and feed it . Source : <URL>
I recommend ( and use ) a <URL> . Not only are they fairly tough and sharp , you can adjust the blade to the depth you need ( you do n't want to cut too deep ) . And the blades are cheap to replace ... As others have noted in the comments , be careful with this as you would with any knife : the blades may be small , but they 're quite sharp .
Another option is to make your popcorn in a pot using butter as the oil for the bottom . I find that if you toast the unpopped popcorn kernels in the butter , it gives a bit of a butter flavor to the entire pot -- less than if you were to put butter on the top , but plenty for me .
Perfect . Sounds like your pizza stone is nicely seasoned . Scrub it with your stiffest brush , rinse with water , no soap , done . If you 're paranoid about germs , cook it before cooking on it . Throw it in the oven at a few hundred degrees , for 15 minutes or so . Ideally , you 're supposed to heat the stone ( thus sterilizing it ) before slapping the pizza upon it anyway ( although that requires a <URL> ) .
Have you tried using a marshmallow recipe that is only made from gelatin and cooked sugar syrup ( sugar , water , and light corn syrup to soft ball stage , 240 degrees F ) ? I have made various piped marshmallows that will hold swirly shapes using this type of marshmallow recipe . It is a bit more stable than the egg based recipes . The most important thing is to make sure that the marshmallow mixture is whipped to a nice fluffy , shiny , smooth stage ( about 7-10 minutes on high speed ) and piped very quickly into whatever form you want before it sets up using a large round tip . Timing is of utmost importance here and you may lose some marshmallow during this process at home . I would also recommend piping onto a silpat ( silicone ) lined sheet tray or a piece of wax paper that has been lightly dusted with a mixture of cornstarch and confectioner 's sugar .
Heston Blumenthal has brought his unique scientific approach to bear on this recently . The main pointers for a perfect poached egg are as follows : The egg must be fresh . A fresh egg has a thicker , more gel-like albumen . As it gets older , this becomes watery , and so just disperses throughout the water when you add it . To test if your egg is fresh , place it in a jug of cold water . If it floats , it 's not fresh - the egg has had time to absorb air through its shell . A fresh egg sinks and stays sunk . The water temperature should be 80ºC / 176ºF exactly . You can measure this with a sugar or probe thermometer . The egg should be at room temperature . The egg should not come into contact with direct heat , so put a plate or small bowl on the bottom of the pan , bottom up . Once the water ( in a medium to large saucepan ) is up to temperature , carefully add the fresh egg and cook for 4 minutes exactly ( for a large egg of the domestic chicken , Gallus gallus domesticus ) . Drain and serve - the white should be set but not rubbery ( a drawback of using vinegar ) and the yolk should be creamy and rich .

Do people eat clotted cream AND butter at the same time ?
It 's really a matter of preference . Some people like the salty dimension that butter gives along with clotted cream and jam , others think the cream is enough saturated fat to be going on with .
I think the problem lies in that the beans are not water blanched , but rather oil blanched . The technique is called " dry frying " , and is a traditional Sichuan cooking method . The oil temp is kept low to dry out the inside while cooking the outside of the food . After the dry frying you can then stir fry the food . This technique should give you the required look and texture to the food . Hope this helps .
When you 're determining the doneness by time , you 're doing it wrong :) There are too many differences between individual fish to go just by weight , thickness , oven temperature , and time . The best way is to measure the internal temperature ( stick a thermometer into the thickest part of the fillet ) ; I like about 120 F ( 50 C ) for salmon ( carryover cooking raises the temperature a little higher after taking it out of the pan ) , but then it has to be good quality fish . You need to check early and often , because it can go from undercooked to overcooked fairly quickly . Now , like zanlok says , my experience is mostly with pan frying , and I 'd expect using the oven would be a bit slower than using a pan because of slower heat transfer ; so you should be a bit safer . If you do n't have a meat thermometer , an easy way to test fish for doneness is to look for translucency . Salmon can still be just a little translucent in the middle . Also , properly done fish flakes along the natural " seams " . Another nice trick ( which does n't work for boneless fillets - sorry ) is to find a bone in the thickest part of the fish : if it comes out fairly easily , then the connective tissues have mostly dissolved and it 's done . That leaves the temperature for your oven . I would go with very high - that way the fish gets the least possible time to dry out ( which is going to be a big risk with this cooking method , I would think - unless you wrap your salmon in bacon or something like that ) . At a guess , I 'd try 450 F ( 230 C ) .
The idea of creaming is definitely to incorporate some air into the fat-sugar mixture , which should give the final product a lighter texture . So perhaps your cake was a little heavier than it was supposed to be . Good creaming also helps distribute the fat well . But maybe you managed to mix some more air in later in the recipe - certainly I imagine you could do better beating the batter with a stand mixer than I can by hand ! And with a stand mixer I 'm sure it was all mixed fine , too . So if the cakes were n't too heavy for you , it 's not anything to worry about .
There is a particular baked good called kastera in Korea , but they pretty much use the term as a generic name for any Western-style sweet cakes ( source : my Korean mother-in-law ) . So the answer is yes and no . You will find a kastera equivalent to Japanese kasutera , but it is a subset of the kastera set . The closest comparison I can think of would be the term " barbecue . " It would very specifically mean slow-smoked meat in certain regions of the United States . In other regions , " barbecue " is a bigger tent , and includes , among other things , anything that is cooked on a grill .
The percentage of milk-fat determines the name . It is different from region to region . In the US , heavy whipping Cream is above % 36 fat . You can see <URL> for the naming convention and fat content . For a chocolate mousse you 're generally looking for cream with fat contents between % 30 and % 40 . Otherwise you can get a phase-inversion in your mousse emulsion ( it break or collapses ) . There are Chocolate mousse recipes using butter instead of cream . It makes for a slightly different tasting chocolate mousse , but hey , it 's chocolate mousse . You may be able to cheat using an emulsifier such as soy lecithin to keep the emulsion stable . Gelatin does thicken things , but you 're likely to lose the air bubbles in the mousse and get a denser mix .
Pros : Higher smoking point . Regular butter 's smoking point is 325-375F while clarified butter is around 485F . But it can still smoke and burn ! However the higher smoking point means it 'll be much more applicable in terms of sauteing food without worrying about burning the butter . 100 % fat . Often times its hard to calculate the exact replacements in baking when you want to replace a fat with butter because regular butter is n't 100 % fat . Using regular butter , you would need to factor in how much extra water you are introducing into the recipe . Longer shelf life . Without the water and milk solids , the shelf life of the clarified butter will be much longer . Can even be stored without refrigeration . Cons : Less buttery flavor . The milk solids that you are removing makes up a lot of butter 's flavor . By removing this , you are removing flavor .
A roux is just cooking flour in an equal amount ( or thereabouts ) of fat . If you 've already done it in butter , you already know what you are doing . Butter is tricky because there is some water left in the butter and the fat itself has a low smoke point . After making a roux with butter , another fat is easy . Butter contains water , but it 's not so picky that the small amount of water matters as far as measuring the butter ; it 's more about compensating for the butter 's behavior and not allowing it to burn . Do the same thing with any oil as you have with butter , and you will be fine . If anything , you will find it easier with another fat . Just go roughly 50/50 and take your time .
The general rule of thumb with cakes and quick breads is that within certain limits : The larger the cake the lower the temperature The smaller the cake , the higher the temperature The reason is that you want to get nice crust formation and browning in the time in takes the muffin or cupcake to cook through . However , mini-muffins or cupcakes have so little mass that they will bake through quite quickly , and may be easy to over bake at higher temperatures . This article at <URL> , in regards to converting standard cupcakes to mini-cupcakes recommends : While most cupcakes take about 15-20 minutes to bake , most mini cupcakes take from 9-14 minutes or so to reach donenss . Check your minis at 9 or 10 minutes with a toothpick and bake longer as needed . The only thing you really need to look out for is the fact that it is easy to overbake these miniature cakes , so keep a close eye on them while they 're baking and check them at very short intervals when they 're close to being done . This matches my experience for full sized muffins and cupcakes : full sized muffins should bake in about 18-22 minutes -- if they take longer , raise the oven temperature on the next batch slightly . They do not suggest changing the temperature for minis . The tips at <URL> concur : If recipes do n't specify mini baking times , note that minis will take more than half of the baking time recommended for standard size cupcakes . My survey of a number of mini-cupcake recipes shows the general consensus is about 10 minutes , or half the time of a regular cupcake . Remember , however , the smaller the cake , the more little factors like your actual oven temperature , how much batter you put in the tin ( and how consistently you fill each cup ) , the moisture level of your batter , and so on affect the outcome . All of my experience is with standard sized cupcakes and muffins , or muffin tops . If I had a mini , pan , I would determine the best baking time by : Doing a half-tray , and checking it when they start to smell done ( if you are an experienced baker , you will know what this means ) , or at about 8 minutes . Continue checking every minute or so , until you find they are done with the toothpick test . Bake a second half-tray to that time without all of the door opening , to confirm your findings . Adjust as necessary , and you will then know the best time for your oven and that particular recipe -- assuming you fill the tins consistently . ( I use a food disher -- like an ice cream scoop -- for this purpose . ) Note : the purpose of the half tray is to have less cakes with a less than perfect bake . Once you dial in the ideal baking time , go for full trays for less work . I also suggest not doing multiple trays at the same time , as they will change the way the air circulates in the oven , and mask the radiant heat from each other . This makes for less consistent results .
<URL> answered this question . Here are some quotes from the webpage . According to the USDA : Round chicken/turkey : 165 ° F / 74 ° C Whole chicken/turkey : 180 ° F / 82 ° C Poultry breasts , roasts : 170 ° F / 77 ° C Additionally , the USDA says the thighs and wings of poultry should be cooked " until the juices run clear . " Although the following temperatures will make the meat safe to eat , you might want to drop the temperature by 3-5 ° C for more flavor .
Try a <URL> . This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time ( weeks , not days ) .
No , it 's not . White vinegar ( also known as distilled vinegar ) is made of acetic acid diluted in distilled water . Its flavor is simple -- its just sour . Typical concentrations range from 5 -- 7 % acetic acid . White wine vinegar is made by allowing white wine to turn to vinegar . It has a much more complex flavor profile . It is also frequently less sour ( acidic ) than distilled white vinegar .
In NZ normal pure cream is close enough to " double cream " in performance , it 's around 35 % to 40 % fat . By general global definition it should be called " heavy cream " NZ cream is pure skimmed cream from fresh milk , and does not need thickening or other processing to produce excellent results as a whipped product , or for a thick cream additive in sauces or fillings Cream can get a little seasonal just after calving time ( Aug ) , but in general it 's just perfect The export variety is often labelled " Culinary Cream " and is 38 % fat or higher . This is what many people around the world would consider NZ cream ( other than NZ butter or AMF ) If you want closer to 50 % fat cream , ask your local farmers for some raw milk and skim out the lumps of fat from that . Let the milk settle overnight and skim the cream from that . Then gently heat the fat lumps to melt and carefully mix into the skimmed cream . Not for the faint of heart ! NZ " Thickened cream " or " Mascarpone cream " is standard pure cream with a thickener like E1442 added , you can <URL>
It depends on the meat and how it 's cut . A ' solid ' uncut piece like a pork loin will take longer to marinade properly than if it was cut into thin strips for stir frying , for example - I 'd want to marinade the former at least 7-8 hours , while the latter could probably get away with 1 .
What will happen is that you will make Escoffier cry . Nothing more . In a more serious tone , the naming of sauces is somewhat arbitrary/tradition driven . There are five mother sauces , Hollandaise being the only emulsion among them . All other sauces are derived for them , making Mayonnaise a Hollandaise derivative . There are hundreds of derived sauces , and the difference is always slight . The use of butter instead of oil ( or the other way round ) would be enough for the result to be considered a completely new sauce , neither mayonnaise nor hollandaise . While it is a common occurence in home kitchens , I do n't think there is an official name for these switched versions . Some cooks even use the name Mayonnaise for a pure water-yolk-veg oil emulsion , without the mustard and vinegar ( for example Ruhlman in Ratio ) . Technically , there is no reason not to do it . The slight difference of water to fat ratio when you are using butter should n't matter . A yolk can emulsify lots of fat , and the amount of fat you use per one part water is mostly a matter of taste . So you can go ahead and substitute butter in a mayonnaise recipe . The taste will be different , but you will be as successful as with a normal mayonnaise . Only remember to serve it warm , I would expect it to harden a bit when cooled .
As long as you monitor each cake for doneness individually , there is no reason not to bake them together -- assuming they both need the same temperature . If the sizes are radically different ( in terms of the thinnest dimension , which is usually the depth ) you may need to adjust temperature to control crust formation during the time it takes the cakes through to the center . If the cakes are close in depth , they should bake in approximately equal times . You may wish to use cake strips or aluminum foil to protect the thing easily burned permiter of a hemispherical cake . Note that 150 C ( 300 F ) is an atypically low temperature for baking a cake .

Your common ' non-solid ' high-protein items are : peanut butter , or other nut butters eggs yogurt cheese ( cream cheese or served melted ) tofu Depending on how strict you 're being with the fat intake , you can go even further ... low fat or non-fat yogurts and cheese ( eg . neufchâtel instead of cream cheese ) ; whites only for the eggs , etc. . Be warned that if you try to go too low-fat during this time , your body might actually crave more feed , making the problem worse . If it 's not a problem with your body being unable to process fats , you might want to reduce protein but increase fats during this time . The good news is that unless you 're a body builder , having a lower protein diet for a week or two while things heal wo n't cause your body to start eating itself -- in fact , most American diets have more protein in it than our bodies need -- about 3-5oz of meat per day ( not per meal ) is enough ; exact amount depends on your size and build . As you can get away with soft foods , and not just non-solid : Scrambled eggs ( leave out a few yolks if you 're really sensitive to the fat ) . Pulled pork , roja vieja , pot roast cooked ' ragout ' , or similar ( you might need to also chop it up if the bits of meat are long ) . Pasta with an egg sauce ( like carbonara , but might have to avoid the black pepper and/or crispy meat ... might be able to use a soft ham and/or add extra salt or worcestershire ) or a cheese sauce ( eg , macaroni and cheese , alfredo ) Tuna fish ( canned in water ; can either make into a tuna salad ( avoid celery . Use a grater to extract onion juice for flavor without solid bits of onion . Pickle brine can help brighten it up while being non-solid ) Refried beans ( make your own , and you can cut down the fat significantly ) Many soups . ( either make a strong stock , cook the meat 'til it 's soft , or put it through a blender ... or egg drop soup ) Cheesecake ( use neufchâtel cheese , or find a recipe that uses soft tofu ) Flan , custards , or ice cream ( made with a custard base , but low-fat milk ) You can also work some extra protein into other dishes ... thin your mashed potatoes with ( pre-heated ) stock a bit more than you typically would , then while still hot , blend in a egg or two . Or add neufchâtel cheese instead of milk or butter ( add stock if you still need to thin it further for your tastes )
For smoothies , the main body of the drink is fruit that has been blended with some limited quantity of liquid or ice . Typically , one of the fruits is banana , and other fruits ( berries , strawberries , kiwi , etc. ) are added for flavor . They often include a sweetener of some sort , such as honey or turbinado sugar . Milk Shakes are typically composed primarily of milk or ice cream , and may include limited amounts of fruit for flavor . They also usually include some sort of sweetener , such as sugar syrup or malt syrup , or a flavored syrup such as strawberry or chocolate . The general principle is that smoothies are mostly fruit , milk shakes are mostly milk . For your drink , I think it being a smoothie or a milk shake depends on the proportions of the ingredients added ( i.e. more banana means smoothie , more milk means milk shake ) . Based on the general principles from above , you could call your drink either a milk shake or a smoothie and be correct . That said , the original Banana Smoothie , as recorded from 1941 on <URL> , included two big ripe bananas and two and one-half cups of milk . Since that seems to be exactly what you 're making , I 'd say that your drink is a smoothie based on the original definition of the term .
I 'd say 3 to 5 people , depending on the heaviness of the sauce , the meatiness of the rabbit etc. .
It means the butter is made from cream that has n't been fermented . Butter made from fermented cream is known as " cultured cream butter " , and it has distinct sour , lactic acid notes . Sweet cream butter tastes , well , sweet , and if it is from really good fresh milk you may be able to taste grassy notes . Both are good in their own way .

How long should roast pork be cooked so that it stays light pink ?
The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 160ºF ( about 71ºC ) for pork to be considered safe to eat . The exact time and temperature for your oven will depend on many factors , so always use a probe thermometer to check . If you 're worried about it getting overdone , start checking the temperature a while before you expect it to be done ( based on your previous experiences ) . There are also thermometers which you can leave in the oven , and have a remote part that can sound an alarm when a certain temperature is reached . Also note that the internal temperature will continue to rise a bit after you remove the roast from the oven , so you may want to aim for a few degrees below your target temperature . 210ºC ( 410ºF ) does seem too hot to cook a roast , so I 'd aim for something on the lower end . Whatever time/temperature combo you use , it 's always the internal temperature of the roast that matters , both for safety and for taste .
It really depends on the texture you are looking for in your finished product . If you want a chunky chicken salad then bake your chicken breasts seasoned or not , I season mine , and then cube them . If you want something a little more exciting pan grill the breasts to the point of a little char and then dice . If you want your chicken to be flavorless and get all of your flavor from the mix you are tossing your chicken into , boil it or put it in a slow cooker if you are cooking up a big batch . It all really comes down to how you like to eat your chicken salad , and more importantly how pretty you want it to look in your serving method , because a cajun blackened chicken salad sandwich can look down right homely . I say try them all until you fall in love with one temporarily and when that has lost its passion try a different version . Also as a side note if I am preparing it for me and not for someone else , so it does n't have to be all white and pretty , I use thighs instead of breasts since they are more forgiving and generally cheaper . If I am not just breaking down a whole chicken and using the leftovers .
It should be slightly duller than a fresh razor blade . Skill can make up for lack of sharpness , but if you do n't have the skills you 'll mash the fish more than slice . This is why instructors and surgeons can get away with dull knives ; they 've got years of experience cutting flesh . Traditionally , fillet and boning knives are sharpened to a shallower angle than general-use chef knives , to allow a keener edge . The only knife in a cook 's arsenal that should be sharper is the slicer , which sees rarer use , and needs to be super-sharp for thin slices .
There 's a <URL> that deals with this very problem . The general advice is to not crowd the pan because of the concomitant release of water ; however , the guys found that doing this is actually beneficial because , although a lot of water is initially released , by the time the liquid has eventually evaporated the mushrooms have collapsed and cook far better in the oil that 's left . Here 's the full explanation : To make the test really severe , I decided to cook the soaked mushrooms in one batch in an extremely crowded pan , and the dry mushrooms in 3 batches with plenty of room . We weighed out identical amounts of salt and oil ( this is the crucial part ) and began cooking . As we expected , the soaked crowded mushrooms formed a soupy mess in the pan . The dry mushrooms did n't stew and cooked quickly . Here is where it got weird . The dry mushrooms ended up absorbing all the oil . In fact , I had underestimated the amount of oil they needed . They wanted more . I could n't add any more oil , however , because it would have ruined the experiment . When the soaked and crowded mushrooms had finally evaporated all their extra water and stated to sauté , they did n't absorb all the oil . When they were finished , a significant amount of oil was left in the pan . They looked as good and tasted better and less oily than their dry cousins -- by a lot . Our explanation : While the mushrooms are boiling off their water , they are n't absorbing oil . By the time the boiling stops they have already collapsed , so they are n't as porous as a raw mushroom and do n't want to absorb oil . The dry mushrooms start absorbing oil from the get-go . What I do now is this : Add the all the chopped mushrooms to a pan over a medium heat with some salt and water and cover . The mushrooms steam and release and ton of their own water : allow to cook for a good 5-10 minutes . Drain the mushrooms - reserving the released mushroom water - and dry the pan before returning it to a high heat . When the pan is very hot , add a few tablespoons of oil ( depending on the volume of cooked mushrooms ) and throw in the mushrooms . When they are nicely browned , deglaze the pan with the mushroom water The reason for the two stage process is that I found if you wait for the water to evaporate naturally the residue from the dissolved solids in the water can stick to the pan and burn while the mushrooms are frying . By covering the pan initially , the water does n't evaporate and can be siphoned off with any dissolved solids ( that now ca n't get stuck to the bottom of the pan ) and then reintroduced right at the end . As the pan is so hot it only takes a minute or two for all the water to evaporate and any new <URL> created by actually sauteeing the mushrooms gets used as well .
I found <URL> in the LA Times with detailed experiments suggesting that soaking beans is unnecessary and it takes away the flavor and texture .
From what you 're describing , I think the cheese ( or cheese-like substance , in this case ) ' broke ' ... that is , the oil separated out of it . I 'd recommend : Do n't melt it at full power Stir it multiple times during melting Melt the cheese ( or " cheese-food " ) seperately , then add the tomatoes , so the tomatoes do n't get hot , causing uneven heating . I 'm not sure if there 's a good way to recover cheese once it 's broken . Some starch will help keep dairy from breaking in the first place , but I do n't think it 'd help you in this particular case .
Yes , with any kind of ' stewing ' sauce , the flavour improves the longer you cook it ( provided it 's a slow , gentle process ) . The longer you leave it , the more chance the flavours have to ' marry ' . I have a recipe for a pasta sauce that calls for 6 hours of slow simmering ! You may also have noticed in the past that left over pasta sauce that you eat the next day is really good , for the same reason as above . Any stew , in fact , like bolognese , casserole , chilli , bourgignon etc , is really delicious when left overnight and reheated .
I do n't think a pork sirloin roast will stand up to that kind of cooking very well . That is a very lean piece of meat , which does not lend itself to long cooking times at low temperatures . That type of cooking is best reserved for cuts of meat with lots of fat and/or connective tissue . If you put a pork sirloin roast in your cooker for 8 hours on low , you 're going to have one tough , dry piece of meat when you are through . You would be better served by cooking it in the oven at higher heat , for a relatively short period of time , like 400F for an hour or so . Bear in mind , you 're not going to get to a fall-apart tender state with a sirloin roast . This is n't a pork butt with which you 're dealing , which you 'd take up to an internal temperature of 195F or more . Rather , you 're going to want to target the safe temperature , and no higher . You want the meat to be juicy . Cut into thinner slices to achieve maximum tenderness .
Cook the chicken ahead of time . I doubt your pizza cooking time and your chicken cooking time will be a perfect match , and it is more likely than anything that your chicken would be undercooked . That would not be good for anyone . If you are worried about the chicken being dry on your pizza , you can try par-cooking the pieces instead of fully cooking them ( though that may be a little dangerous , too ) , or you can add the cooked pieces to the pizza after it has begun baking .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
With broccoli or cauliflower , if you cook it for too long , it 'll get mushy and fall apart . Boiling will exacerbate that a bit , so if you 're looking for firmer cauliflower , I 'd recommend steaming it , and keeping an eye on it . When the fork goes in without a lot of work , it 's done .

... as long as it needs to , depending on a wide variety of factors . You can shape it for baking , put it in the fridge , let it rise , pull it out of the fridge and put it in the oven - no warming up time at all . If you are going to punch down/knead/form after it comes out of the fridge , you can do all that cold , and let it rise as long as it needs to before baking - which will depend on the dough and the room temperature . Or you can let the bulk dough warm a while .
I 'm still happily using a non-stick frying pan that I 've had for almost 4 years . I only use Teflon utensils . I never use harsh abrasives . After cooking , I fill it with boiling water , let it soak for a while and then wipe out with paper towels . Most of the time I just give it a quick rinse and it 's ready for the next time . And buy quality - " Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten " .

There 's no reason to peel besides the aesthetics of it . There 's no major flavor or nutritional difference either way . If the ginger is going to be seen then peel it , if not do n't bother . The best way to peel ginger is to use the edge of a small spoon to rub it off , it works really well , takes seconds , and does n't waste as much as using a knife .
I 'd look towards a dutch oven and cake-like items : upside-down cakes cobblers / crisps / grunts / bettys / slumps / etc. . In all of these , the fruit on the bottom helps to protect from the bottom of the cake-like-item cooking too quickly . You can either cook directly in the dutch oven , or drop another pan inside the dutch oven to speed on cleaning if you 're going to be cooking a few of 'em . You 'll also want to look for dutch ovens that are made for baking -- they have a lip on the lid , so you can put coals on top and pull the lid without the ash falling into what you 're cooking .
Even given a standardized recipe and method , cooking times are always only a guideline . Quality recipes always give you a test for knowing when the product is done . The reason for this is that there are many uncontrolled ( at least from the recipe author 's point of view ) such as , in the case of ribs : Exact dimensions of the ribs Natural variation in the composition of the ribs Starting temperature Variation in your particular oven That said , the variable most controlling over the time it takes to cook ribs , given a standard recipe and method , is the thickness of the set of ribs . A longer strip of ribs ( btw , the full set of ribs on one side is called a slab of ribs -- country ribs are not normally sold this way ) does n't make much difference , as the heat will penetrate through the thinnest dimension . Ribs are a complex food to cook as they benefit from low-and-slow cooking methods , which allow the touch connective tissue of the ribs ( collagen ) to slowly convert to unctuous gelatin . This conversion is temperature dependent , taking many , many many hours at around 140 F , but happening in an hour or two at 180 F. Note also that <URL> are a different cut than <URL> ( the baby variety come from a younger , smaller animal ) . Country style ribs are cut with a lot of meat on the bone . In practical recipes , the amount of time this takes will depend on the exact cooking method such as braising , roasting , or barbequing . Recipe request themselves are off-topic here at Seasoned Advise , but you can find many recipes easily by googling " <URL> " . Indivdual recipes will give you a guideline for a basic cooking time related to the method used in that recipe , and a test or condition for knowing when they are done . For example , this recipe for <URL> s from the Food Network suggests an estimated cooking time of 1 1/2 hour braising , and tells you that they are done when when the meat is tender ( which you would test by poking with a fork , or just trying some ) . An alternate method , as suggested in <URL> from Cooks.com is to roast the ribs in the oven . They use three-stage method where the ribs are covered in foil in the middle stage , but the total cooking time is about 3 1/4 hours . They carefully describe how you know when the ribs are done : " the meat should just about fall off the bone . " . Note : I have n't tried these particular recipes ; they only serve as examples . The bottom line is , ribs are generally done when they are quite tender , which you can easily tell by poking them with a fork or trying them . How long this takes will depend on what method you used , the size of your ribs , and a myriad other factors , but will be on the order usually of 2-3 hours .
Common noob mistakes : Cooking things too long . Meat dries out when it 's cooked to too high an internal temperature . That 's the whole thing , and it 's true no matter how you cook something . If you like your meat to be completely devoid of pink inside , it will be dry . No avoiding it . Find out what 's a good temperature for the doneness you desire , and use an instant-read thermometer to find out when you get there . You will also find that some cuts of meat want more cooking than others . A skirt steak wants hardly any cooking because it dries out easily . A New York strip , with good fat marbling , can withstand more cooking because it has that nice fat to keep things moist . Cooking with too much heat or too little . When the heat 's too high , you burn the outside before the middle can get to the temperature you want . If it 's too low , you never really get a good sear on the outside , and miss out on much of the grilled food experience . And you 'll need to learn to tailor your heat to the needs of what you 're cooking -- fish typically needs less than chicken , which needs less than beef or lamb . Putting the meat on too early . You need to wait for the charcoal to ash over and stop flaming . If you do n't wait for the coals to get right , you run a much greater risk of flare-ups and scorched food , not to mention off flavors from unburned wood or fillers in your charcoal . This is a non-issue with gas grills . Not preheating the grate . You need to put the grill grate over the coals as soon as you can so it preheats well . If your grate is n't preheated , you wo n't get grill marks , and your meat is more likely to stick . You need to do this if you have a gas grill too -- maybe more so , since they typically do n't get as hot . I 'd recommend that you find a basic book about grilling . Any of Steven Raichlen 's books will give you the general tips on how to do things . I 'm not wild about his overuse of rubs and sauces -- I think they 're totally unnecessary most of the time -- but he does know his way around a fire and a grill grate . However , if you want your meat well-done , be prepared to eat a lot of dry ( and likely tough ) meat . Your only option at that point is to switch to low-and-slow techniques that cook things like pork shoulder for a really long time at a low temperature ( traditional barbecue ) . The meat gets fully cooked , but because it has a lot of fat and connective tissue to render , retains a moist mouthfeel . But this is n't grilling , per se , and takes many hours .
I 'd say freeze nearly all of them uncooked and bake when ready . That way they go through only one cooking and maintain the fresh lasagna taste/feel . The sauce and and the cheese will freeze ok . Mozzarella is a pretty sensitive cheese and once it 's been baked , it 's not going to hold as well when thawed and re-warmed . In my experience it gets gummy and the fat runs off . You have much better chance of enjoying a good meal with the cheese frozen raw . Unfortunately , your noodles will likely take the hardest hit , but will likely fare better than going through two heat cycles . The ground beef and sausage will also fare better that way . The reason I suggested freezing MOST and not all , is that there are times when you 're behind the 8-ball , hungry , and do n't have the time to bake the sucker , and even ponder settling for dog-food . At that point having a silver bullet in the freezer is a bonus ;) and you 'll be ok with inferior lasagna .

How do banana peels reflect its ripening state ? Can we influence that in our kitchen ?
Alright , I 'll go ahead and post this as an answer . The fact of the matter is the Cavendish/dessert bananas should not be refrigerated . They will develop a sickly green/grey tinge to their skin . This does not really affect flavor , texture , or to the best of my knowledge , nutritional value , but it makes them look like ass . Now , to the crux of your issue : you say this is a commercial kitchen . And herein lies your problem : your produce almost certainly gets delivered in a refrigerated truck . What the delivery drivers should be doing , but almost certainly are n't , is wrapping the bananas ( and tomatoes , but I digress ) in a nice heavy blanket . But let 's be realistic , no truck driver is going to waste time doing that . So your bananas ( and tomatoes ! ) are showing up , pre-refrigerated by your produce purveyor . And there 's not a damn thing you can do about it . Or is there ? There is something you can do . But it wo n't be easy , or particularly fun , unless you 're a sadistic bastard who likes yelling at people . Get yourself a laser thermometer and meet the delivery truck when it rolls up . When the door opens , temp the bananas . ( Actually , you should do this with every time/temperature sensitive product you receive . ) If the bananas are less than ~ 50 ° F , send 'em back . Demand a fresh case . Refuse to pay . Keep doing it until you get the bananas you want . After a few rounds , your driver will make damn sure the bananas are perfect .
As you can see at the Chapter 7 : Storage of horticultural crops of the book <URL> : If you look p. 166 ( p. 173 on the PDF ) , you can see that the onions need to be stored in this conditions : between 0-5 ° C with a relative humidity ( R.H. ) of 65-70 % If you look p. 168 ( p. 175 on the PDF ) , you can see that the potatoes have different needs : Fresh market : between 4-7 ° C Processing : between 8-12 ° C seed potatoes : between 0-2 ° C But must of all , potatoes need very highest relative humidity ( R.H. ) : 95-98 % versus 65-70 % for onions So , if you store them together , either one or the other will be in bad storage conditions . Further , as you can see at <URL> : Dry onions ( Group 3 ) are very sensitive to moisture , which makes their storage incompatible with the high R.H. needed for potatoes . New potatoes ( Group 6 ) may also produce ethylene , which will badly damage green onions ( Group 2 ) if stored together . Anyway , storage of horticultural crops can not just be resumed by " do n't put this or that together " , as you may have seen : it is important to consider R.H. , temperature , and many other factors . If the subject interests you , all this ( and many other things ) is pretty well explained in the following references : <URL> <URL> <URL> Ethylene is also a " critical factor " , and this topic is more developped in the following resources : <URL> <URL>
Folding a burrito is serious business . Get it wrong and you 'll end up dumping most of the contents all over the place and look like a burrito noob . Get it right and your hands and plate will be perfectly clean , and you 'll no longer be hungry . Beware : publicly flaunting these skills might lead to people wanting you to fold their burritos for them . General Tips First off : make sure your tortilla is ready to be folded . A cold or dried out tortilla is likely to crack or split . Use a warm and moist tortilla . Second : do n't overfill the tortilla . If you have small tortillas do n't try to make a giant burrito and expect that to work . How to fold Now that we have the basics out of the way let 's get to folding . See <URL> ( which I 've converted into an image here ) : Place the contents in the approximately center of your partially folded tortilla . Leave plenty of room on the ends otherwise you 'll most surely have food spilling out once it 's folded up . Hold the filled tortilla so the weight of the filling pulls it tight . If your burrito busts through now , it will certainly burst later . If not , proceed to step 2 . Fold one end towards the center . Fold the other end over . Roll the bottom ( the end nearest you ) up towards the top . This is n't the intuitive way , but it 's the right way . Make sure not to let the food squeeze out . I hold it with my fingers at the crease where the bottom edge that 's been folded up meets the food . Keep rolling it up . Om nom nom .
As someone who has raised beef cattle ( here in Oklahoma ) I must say the TFD is ( unfortunately ) mistaken , ( at least here in the U.S. ) Most cattle fall into one of two varieties , Beef and Dairy ( there are also some breeds that are almost exclusively show cattle ) The most popular ( and common ) Beef varieties are Angus , Limousine , Herefords , Longhorn ; This list , including cross breeds ( for instance , limangus , what I raise , is a cross of limousine and angus ) and constitutes somewhere around 90 % of beef production with in the US . ( not include ' beef ' used for things like dog food ) . I would consider that list to be in descending order of beef quality ( but that is a matter of opinion ... ) There are several varieties of cattle which are raised for dairy production , and these do not generally produce quality cuts of meat , but do produce copious quantities of milk . These breeds are led by Holstein-Friesian , Brown Swiss , Guernsey , Ayrshire , Jersey , and Milking Shorthorn . Buffalo ( or Bison ) is a separate breed altogether and is no longer all that exotic . I regularly use bison to make chili . Yes , cows are ' females ' but not all cows are heifers , a heifer is a female that has not yet given birth to her first calf . And @Scivitri while feeding and ranging cattle do make a difference the driving force in beef flavor is still the breed . I can tell the difference between breeds by flavor but the difference from feeding and ranging is really more about tenderness and texture .
It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container . If the moisture is at a safe ( low ) level , then mold wo n't grow . See for example , <URL> , which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8 % for retail storage/shipping , although if you look at their data table , it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5 % range ( which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool , dry place ) . Honestly , cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities . Most likely what you 're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats ( the process which causes rancidity ) without actual full-blown rancidity . Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure . If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer ( sealed , to prevent contamination or off-odours ) . Although most ( all ? ) nuts are considered shelf-stable , they do keep longer in the fridge or freezer .
The only difference between the two is that puree has a little more liquid . You should add more puree than the recipe calls for paste to compensate for it being more dilute . In some recipes , the extra liquid could be a problem , however , I do n't think it will make any difference in pad thai in the quantities that it is used .
Yes , cream soups are typically roux-based . If you add some flour ( roughly an equal amount to the butter ) to the fats , whisk and cook the flour for a couple minutes and then slowly whisk in the milk , it will be much less likely to separate . The soup will also be thicker , which I would imagine is a good thing .
I 've used both sugar and orange juice to sweeten mulled wine in the past , but obviously orange juice would change the flavour significantly . Add more sugar slowly , tasting as you go .
even the greatest knife masters will forget every once in a while to clean with the edge in the opposite direction No , they wo n't , not after cutting themselves a couple of times . It 's natural to cut yourself while cutting food , occasionally , but I have never cut myself while slipping food from the blade . Always keep the edge away from you , place the side of your finger against the flat of the blade keeping it absolutely rigid and straight , and run your finger down the blade . It 's that simple . Using the side of your finger reduces the chance of you curling it around the cutting edge .
I had an application not long ago for which I needed the answer to the question as written . <URL> ( sorry , paywalled ) has a recipe for banana bread that I love . I save over-ripe banana chunks in the freezer until I feel like making banana bread . The recipe calls for " 6 large very ripe bananas ( about 2 1/4 pounds ) , peeled " . My bananas were already peeled and chunked . I wanted to follow the recipe very precisely because the recipe and particular methods were new to me . So how much peeled banana equals 2.25 pounds of unpeeled banana ? My doctor has been nagging me to eat breakfast , so most days I manage to eat a banana early in my day . For one week I weighed the banana unpeeled and peeled . Then I struck an average . My average banana weighed 183 grams unpeeled , 116 grams peeled . 185/116 = 1.58 . So , 2.25 pounds ( 1021 grams ) of unpeeled banana = 1.43 pounds ( 647 grams ) of peeled banana . My average banana ( very average in the store , Dole brand ) was 62.4 % edible .
I do not think that there is a better way they not to squeeze the lemon until you need them :D Regardless , if you want to do testing and are concerned about the bitter notes that develop , I recommend doing the research with grapefruit instead as it turns bitter is a matter of minutes and has a much stronger bitter flavor then the lemons do . That way you at least have a shorter turn around time .
Reasons to wash your rice : Reduce/Control Starch levels Often when you 're cooking rice you want distinct grains of rice and for your rice to have texture . In the case of Chinese fried rice for example , you specifically want your rice grains to not stick to one another . If you 're talking white rice especially , there will be a lot more loose starch that will form a thickish paste if if you do n't rinse it away . To clean out impurities I imagine there was a time when there were a lot more impurities ( dirt , dust , bugs , etc. . . ) . I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case these days with modern manufacturing . If you 're concerned about your source , then this may be a factor for you . There 's also the <URL> that suggest rinsing to reduce levels of something like arsenic ( see <URL> on arsenic in rice ) ... I think 1 . is your bigger factor here though . Reasons to not wash your rice : It removes nutrients . This is true for fortified rice . See <URL> on the fortification process . Note , whole grain/brown rices are less often fortified ( I want to say they 're not fortified , but I actually do n't know for sure ) . So it would depend on what kind of product you 're buying and where it came from . You actually want to keep the extra starch . This is the case for things like risotto where the starch is what gives the dish it 's creaminess . <URL> that talks about the process .
You can get red jalapeños at some markets , but you 're right , most places sell them when they 're still green . They sell them for the same reasons they sell green bell peppers , which includes : some people prefer the milder , grassier notes ( or just do n't know better ) they 're cheaper to produce ( do n't have to wait for them to ripen , reducing water use ) they store and ship better ( as they 're not ripe yet ) . it lowers the risk of losing the harvest ( due to weather , blight , etc. from waiting 'til they 're fully ripe ) it reduces the number of field hands needed ( as they 're not trying to pick all peppers at the peak of ripeness ) if frees up the field for another planting . In the case of hot peppers , it 's more complex than the simple colored bell peppers -- the ripe peppers are often further processed ( smoked or dried ) and then sold under a different name : chipotle == smoked &amp; dried jalapeño ancho == dried poblano colorado == ripe anaheim
Unfortunately , even if you press it , it will tend to crumble . The way the curds form in small curd cottage cheese forms a skin that makes them tend to fall apart . The same thing can happen in making Indian style paneer if you let the curds boil . ( At least , I think it is why it happened ! ) Probably your best bet is to drain it then make something like vada or kofte ( for malai kofte ) out of it , mixing in some maida or cooked potato or besan and kneading it into a dough , then forming it into balls or patties . I think it will still be tasty , even though it is n't what you planned for .
Ugh , I feel for you ! Just based on the description , it 's probably some type of flour beetle ( normally either red flour beetle or confused flour beetle -- but check on wikipedia for pictures ) . I 'm no exterminator , but I 've dealt with infestations of both in my pantry . The only thing that I 've found that works is to go through all food stored in the pantry ( including that in sealed packages ) and make sure that you throw out anything that is infested . I 'm not sure how you feel about chemicals , but at this point , I bug-bombed the house . After you 're sure that you no longer have an infested food , seal everything in plastic food storage containers . In theory , that should contain any further infestations to a maximum of one container . The other thing that I 've done is to store as much of my dry goods as possible in the fridge/freezer ... so stuff like flour is now stored in a sealed container in the back of the fridge . My exterminator has said that a lot of times the beetles come in a package from the grocery store ( a couple beetles in a box of pasta , for example ) and they just overrun/overpopulate as much as they can .
Generally speaking , maple syrup will work fine in any recipe that calls for honey . They may have slightly different viscosities and water content , but that could be true between two honeys as well , so I would n't worry about it a lot . The only thing I think you really have to consider is whether the flavor of maple syrup is appealing in the dish you would substitute it in . In most cases , I think it will be fine , especially if the dish would have worked well with a dark , fully flavored honey . You might also like to try sorghum syrup , molasses , or agave nectar as other possible replacements .
Most of the weight in fresh fruit is water , which has no calories . When you dry the fruit , the remainder is concentrated , so there are more calories in a given volume or weight . <URL> is a preservative with anti-microbial properties . The claim of 3.6 times the energy is specious .
If your pastry cream can handle being stirred ( most do and as you will be including whipped cream anyway ) , you should be fine . Stirring will soften your pastry cream a bit , but not make it completely liquid . You can even add the vanilla to your cream , whip it together and need not worry about stirring well enough or uneven distribution of liquid in your pastry cream .
It 's caused by the high amount of potassium in the banana . Microwaves react with metals , bouncing off and cause arcing . You can even create a cool light show by putting a raw peeled banana in the microwave . Do n't worry , it wo n't explode , but it will make a mess , it 's also harmless . This can also happen in some <URL> depending on the soil conditions they grew in . As noted in the linked article , other high concentrations of metals such as magnesium , iron , and zinc can be the responsible mineral . Momentary brief sparking is harmless and wo n't harm your microwave , but the USDA recommends turning off your microwave if you see sparks nonetheless . If it does start a fire , unless it 's a very small fire , do not open your microwave door . The safest thing is to turn off the microwave and let the fire burn itself out by consuming all the oxygen . Opening the door could create a dangerous backdraft induced fireball . Edit : Found a <URL> . See Also : <URL> <URL>
A splash of lemon juice mixed in the banana right off the bat can fix that colour at the beginning , but the molasses will turn it brown afterwards ... So if you want it lighter in colour , you 'll need to substitute the molasses ... Can you use white sugar and throw in a bit of rum in the end ? If you must keep the molasses then just go for the darker route ... Perhaps let the banana oxidize as much as possible before mixing ?

How can I tell whether an egg has been hard-boiled , through the shell ?
Take an egg from the carton and ' spin ' it on the work counter . If it spins , it 's cooked , if it does anything else , it 's not .
You ca n't ( or at least I ca n't ) tell without a lot of experience with teas of that sort . Generally , a sufficiently fresh tea will have a decently strong fragrance when you smell the dry leaves . As it grows stale , the fragrance will be replaced gradually by mustiness . But which fragrance to expect varies dramatically by the tea . For instance , pan-fried greens like dragonwell ( longjing ) tend to smell vaguely nutty , while a sencha will smell more grassy . Dragonwell will also be more yellowish while the sencha will be more greenish . But these are two of many different varieties of green . Also , there 's a continuum of oxidation from green to black , so " too oxidized " is really a matter of taste . If you buy a Darjeeling ( black ) , it 'll tend to be lightly oxidized for a black tea ; if your green is darker than that , maybe it should n't be called green . I 'm sure with appropriate analytical chemistry equipment you could determine some aspects of tea " quality " -- but this would be complete overkill unless you 're running a major tea business and you want to ensure quality . And even then , you 'd probably be better off hiring a number of taste-testers . There is one test ( but it 's not definitive ) : brew the tea , then leave the cup out for a day . If it does n't get dramatically darker by the end of the day , it 's already mostly oxidized . In any case , if you like the tea , why do you care so much about the quality ? You can find some outrageously expensive teas -- I 've noticed some South Korean greens in particular -- that start getting into the price ranges of fine wines , but unless you 're doing this to impress people , you 're better off trying a variety of samples and then getting the one/ones you like . ( Hopefully you wo n't find that you really like those South Korean greens ... )
Well , first off , mold grows from spores , and your Pyrenean cheese was likely already " contaminated " with Penicillium roqueforti , Penicillium glaucum , and Penicillium candidum spores at the cheese shop ( it 'd be surprising if the cheese shop is n't covered with them ! ) . So , if you keep it in a environment habitable to them , they will grow . I suspect that you 'd get the same results even if you put them in two different plastic containers . As to its safety , if it was indeed one of the used-in-food Penicillium molds , it should be safe to eat -- you can make sheep 's milk blue cheeses ( e.g. , roquefort ) after all . But the problem is that the same humid environment that encouraged the Penicillium colonization also encourage other molds -- many of which you do n't want to eat . Also , I 'm pretty sure there are blue-green molds you do n't want to eat .
When they say " probiotic " , what they mean is that there are microbe cultures present in the kombucha . It 's really nothing more than a sweetened tea which has been <URL> . The odor and distinctive flavor is the result of a low alcohol content and acetic acid ( the same acid found in vinegar ) produced by the fermentation process . While these cultures do tend to edge out other bacteria that would spoil the drink and potentially cause illness , it can eventually go bad like anything else . More to the point , because the cultures are still alive , they 'll continue the fermentation process as long as they can , especially once you open the container and start introducing oxygen . This can throw off the balance of the culture , but it can also just make the kombucha unpleasantly acidic . Once it gets to that point , it might still be effective from a probiotic stance , but the acid could have an adverse effect on your digestion . If you keep it sealed and refrigerated , it 'll last a couple weeks , but a week or so is probably the effective maximum when you 're opening the container frequently . You 'll want to stick to purchasing an amount that you can drink within a week or so , but do n't worry overmuch if it has a slightly vinegary tang and odor .
In theory you could thaw and refreeze as many times as you like , though the changes in temperature would definitely alter the quality of the meat 's taste and texture . What matters most is how long the meat has been in the so-called " danger zone " speaking from a temperature perspective . The " danger zone " is defined as being between 41 to 135 ° F ( 5 to 57 ° C ) . Here is an excerpt from <URL> : Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than four hours are considered adulterated . Additionally , one should be fully aware that the four-hour period is cumulative , meaning that the meter starts running again every time the food enters the danger zone . Therefore , once the four-hour period has been exceeded , heating , cooling , or any other cooking method can not recover foods .
It depends a great deal on the kind of rice you use . My father always steamed rice in a closed pot with a measured amount of water using American long grain rice . The ratio was one cup rice to two cups of water . When I got my own place I used the boiling method but chose Basmati rice , as is commonly used in india . This rice has a longer grain and holds its shape after cooking . I tried the boiling method with American long grain rice and found it also worked well . There is no need to measure the water as you cook by timer and taste the rice before draining . It 's something similar to how you might cook pasta . Contrary to what ElendilTheTall said in his answer , when boiling rice you do not have to make careful measurements of rice an water . You put in enough rice for how ever many people and an excess of water . Too much water . You cook the rice in an open pan , so you can see it . When the rice has cooked long enough , you pick out a few grains on your fork and taste them . If they are just soft enough , not too soft , then you quickly drain the water in a sieve or colander and serve . Timing is crucial . Now , when I move to China , I found a very different kind on rice . It was shorter grained and required several washes before could be cooked . This rice did n't boil well . The unless really well washed , the rice powder in the water turns in into something reassembling wall paper paste . Instead the steaming method must be used . To steam you need to carefully measure the rice and water to get the correct ration . You put on the heat and cover . When the rice has boiled almost dry , you take it off the heat and serve .
The California Avocado Commission recommends this ( safe but wimpy - see below for a better way ) three-step process : Start with a ripe avocado and cut it lengthwise around the seed . Rotate the halves to separate . Remove the seed by sliding the tip of a spoon gently underneath and lifting out . The other common seed-extraction method - striking the seed with a knife and twisting - requires some skill and is not recommended . Peel the fruit by placing the cut side down and removing the skin with a knife or your fingers , starting at the small end . Or simply scoop out the avocado meat with a spoon . Be sure to sprinkle all cut surfaces with lemon or lime juice or white vinegar to prevent discoloration . <URL> Source : <URL> Notes : Another ( and my favorite ) way to remove the pit is by holding the half with the pit in one hand and striking the sharp edge of the knife used in step one into the pit , then twisting to remove . This is the " pro " way to do it , but takes a little practice . <URL> , it 's not that hard . If you 're going to be chopping the avocado up , you slice it up using the tip of the knife still in the shell , then scoop the sliced avocado meat out with a spoon .
This probably refers to whole eggs mostly ... A microwave can boil water very rapidly , and a tight but fragile container like a whole egg will violently rupture if such rapid boiling happens inside it , because the overpressure inside it is already significant when the shell finally breaks . Here is a <URL> showing an experiment with ca. 180 eggs in a microwave oven , which after a minute or two rupture simultaneously and with enough force to blow the oven open , with debris being propelled several meters .
Take an egg from the carton and ' spin ' it on the work counter . If it spins , it 's cooked , if it does anything else , it 's not .
In Germany we have an old ( joking ) saying that roughly translates to " head off , tail off - bunny " , so your question is legitimate . But first thing 's first : There is no health risk involved if you ate the latest shipment of " meowling rabbit " . ( To cat lovers everywhere : This is no endorsement , I have a much loved and pampered cat , too ! ) The most obvious differences are head ( look at the teeth ! ) , tail ( short vs. long ) , and feet ( cat claws are quite distinctive ) . But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale , so we 'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy : Shoulder blades : Cats ' shoulder blades are rounded on top , especially in the front , making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts , rabbits ' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side . Femur ( thigh bone ) : A cat 's femora are straight , whereas a rabbit 's is more or less bent , especially pronounced in older animals . Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna ( forearm ) , but they might have been removed . Ribs : Cats ' ribs are " rounder " than rabbits ' ribs according to <URL> . I ca n't say by how much , but <URL> 's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie <URL> . Pelvis : The same source as above states that the <URL> ( = the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint ) is oval in rabbits and round in cats . I could n't find a good picture to show this , though . Here 's a rabbit : Source : <URL> And a cat :
First , as a gardener who 's grown these , I can tell you that acorn squash -- like all winter squash -- need to be left on the vine to ripen . After picking , they will get a little sweeter as they sit for a couple weeks , but if picked too early , they wo n't actually continue to ripen . That said , there 's no great trick to picking a good one . If you see some some orange color in the skin , it 's almost certainly ripe , though they can still be mature when all green , too . Ideally , you should be able to trust that the farmer harvested these properly , but if you 're getting unripened winter squash , someone probably screwed up out in the field . If you think the store gives a damn , it 's probably worth mentioning that you 're getting some bad ones .
I have had great results by taking individual garlic cloves and cutting the root end off each , but leaving them in their papery skins . Then you put those dry into a small saucepan ( ideally one with a thick bottom ) over low-to-medium heat . Put a lid on it , and let it go for 20 minutes or so , shaking vigorously every couple of minutes to turn the cloves over . When the cloves are really soft , you 're done . The paper skins protect the garlic cloves from burning , but the direct contact with the hot pan cooks them nicely . When you 're done you can squeeze the soft , roasted garlic goodness out of the root end of the skins . This is a particularly nice technique when you want roasted garlic flavor but only need a few cloves , not a whole head . The first time I did a recipe that called for this process , I was sure the garlic would scorch or the skins would catch fire , but it worked great .
Whole wheat flour goes rancid . There is a lot of fat in wheat germ and when it oxidizes the flour becomes very bitter and has a very noticeable , unpleasant scent . First of all - if you use bleached white flour there is little to worry about . Bleached flour has had much of the wheat removed to give it a longer shelf life . At the expense of flavor and nutrition of course . Keeping whole wheat flour out of light , sealed from oxygen , and cold will keep it from going rancid . Any one of those will extend the life of the flour - putting it in the freezer sealed from air will keep it good indefinitely . In the cupboard I will start noticing off flavors in my fresh ground flour in a couple weeks . In the freezer I have gone as much as a year with no discernible degradation . You will notice if it has gone bad because it will smell and taste bad . This rancidity is n't dangerous so if the flour smells and tastes fine then it is .
Enzymes which degrade proteins , called proteases , are found in many fruits . There is no simple test for it other than holding some in your mouth and seeing if it " eats " your flesh away after a few minutes Commercial test are not practical or portable as they require maceration , heating , centrifuging and using florescent dye markers . Or just make some in gelatine and see what happens :-) A quick list would be : Fig - Ficin Ginger - zingipain Kiwi fruit - Actinidin Papaya ( Pawpaw ) - Papain Pineapple - Bromelain Also to a lesser extent Banana Guava Mango It is in many other fruits , but at levels where they will not be a problem , of course at different levels depending on the specific fruit variety etc. .

Let it sit , pray carryover cooking does the job ( unlikely ) Wrap it in plastic wrap , tightly spin the top to close . Twist ' the tail ' into a knot or secure with string . Put it back in the water . Position it ' hole-up ' on a baking sheet , put in an oven ( time-consuming ) Crack the egg over a bowl , finish in a pan on low heat ( not ideal for runny yolks ) Microwave ( sad , but could work ) I vote for number 2 .
The yellow color could be just a sign of what it was fed . According to the USDA : THE COLOR OF POULTRY What is the usual color of raw poultry ? Raw poultry can vary from a bluish-white to yellow . All of these colors are normal and are a direct result of breed , exercise , age , and/or diet . Younger poultry has less fat under the skin , which can cause the bluish cast , and the yellow skin could be a result of marigolds in the feed . You could have an older chicken that had marigolds in what it was fed . On the flip side , I was always taught that if any meat smells bad , it is n't good to eat . If it was my chicken in the kitchen , I would take it back to the store or just throw it out . If you are still debating on if it is good to eat , you could always take it back to the store where you purchased it , or contact the <URL> .
Fried Eggs : Sunny Side Up -- Not flipped , unbroken yolk . The top of the egg is just barely set . Basted -- Sunny Side Up , hot fat spooned over until the white surrounding the yolk is opaque . Over Easy / lite -- Flipped , whites fully cooked , unbroken yolk , yolk runny . Over medium -- flipped , whites fully cooked , unbroken yolk , yolk creamy ( not completely runny ) . Over Medium Well -- Flipped , unbroken yolk , yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center . Over Hard -- Flipped , broken , fully-cooked yolk . Over Well -- Flipped , intact , fully-cooked yolk . Broken / Lightly Scrambled -- Broken in pan and gently stirred while cooking - yolk and whites should not be mixed entirely . Scrambled Eggs -- Made in many different ways . Generally the eggs are mixed in a bowl before being put into the pan , and often stirred while cooking . Some recipes add fat to the eggs in the form of milk , cream , butter , or oil . A distinction can be made between Wet/Loose or Dry , which refers to the degree of doneness . Omelettes : Filled Omelette -- Eggs mixed before cooking , possibly with added fat as in Scrambled Eggs . Cooked in fat in a saute pan ; when set but the interior still wet , previously-cooked fillings ( cheese , onions , mushrooms , peppers , tomatoes ... ) are added , and the eggs folded over into a half-moon shape . Spanish Omelette / Western Omelette -- Same as filled , but the egg mixture is poured over the fillings in a hot pan and cooked , thus incorporating the fillings into the egg . Fluffy Omelette -- Whites and yolks beaten separately . Yolks are gently folded into the whites without breaking the structure of the whites . Optional toppings are added . Cooked slowly in a pan , or baked ( an electric frying pan with a lid works well for this preparation ) . Boiled : Cooked in shell in water for a timed period . Some people will refer to degree of doneness by cooking time , i.e. , a " 3-minute egg " is soft-boiled with some runny white around the yolk . Some recipes call for eggs to be added to boiling water , others to be started in cold water . In the cold-water start , the pot may be left on the heat or removed when the water reaches a boil . The eggs may be shocked in ice water when removed . Soft -- Yolk runny , potentially with slight unset white around the yolk . Medium -- White completely set , yolk firm but with a dark , wet appearance . Hard -- Yolk completely set and pale yellow . Poached : Egg cooked , out of shell , in water , stock , or other liquid -- excluding fats or oils -- at a temperature in the range of 160-180 ˚F ( 70-82 ˚C ) . There are possible degrees of doneness , however the typical poached egg has a runny but warm and thickened yolk and fully-set white . Coddled : An egg that has been very lightly cooked ( poached eggs are sometimes considered coddled ) . This can either be accomplished with an egg coddler or cooking an egg in its shell with water that is slightly below boiling point . Shirred : An egg cooked in an oven at the low-mid 300 's ˚F ( ~ 160 ˚C ) , contained in a ramekin , until the whites are just set and the yolk is runny but thickened . Often butter or another fat is placed on top before cooking . Steamed : Very similar to shirred eggs , but the ramekin is covered with some aluminum foil and put in a steamer for 7-15 minutes . In a basket : Eggs fried in a hole made in a slice of bread
That is wax , it 's done to help keep the moisture in the root . Turnips are also . You know it 's getting along when it gets soft and spongy or when the skin starts to wrinkle , same with turnips , beets , parsnips , carrots ... You pretty much can tell whether they are good or not in exactly the same ways . Are the firm and crisp or soft , flabby and spongy ?
An avocado will keep a few days in the refrigerator after it has been cut . The cut portion will turn brown/black due to oxidation , you can just cut that off , it is not harmful . From <URL> to keep the avocado from discoloring sprinkle it with lemon/lime juice or vinegar and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or place in an airtight container . From <URL> storing a cut avocado with a piece of cut onion in an airtight container will stop the oxidation . I do n't know why this is , but I suspect that it has to do with the sulfur compounds that the onion releases . This is the same sulfur that makes you cry when you chop onions , but it is also used as a preservative . The onion 's smell and taste do n't seem to transfer to the avocado , as far as I can tell . But I 'm not overly sensitive to onions , so you may want to check this out first if you are . When not to use , from WebMD if your avocado 's flesh has become very dark or the flesh has become stringy you should avoid eating it , particularly if there is any sign of mold . Avocados have a very high fat content , so they oxidize and become rancid very quickly at room temperature and will need to be thrown away .

What impact does the order of assembly have when making cookies ?
Generally with baking you mix all the wet ingredients , then all the dry , then incorporate the latter into the former . This prevents clumping and helps make sure everything is mixed uniformly . In some recipes , adding the eggs ( often un par un , or one by one ) also contributes ( via the yolk 's supply of lecithin ) to emulsifying e.g. butter and milk together . The best way to find out , of course , is to experiment . Next time you 're making these cookies , make a double batch . Do one according to the recipe , and the other your way . Honestly with cookies I doubt you 'll see much difference ; they 're basically foolproof ( I have , when in a hurry , made chocolate chip cookies by dumping everything in the mixer , whacking it about with the paddle attachment , and then folding in the actual chips . Worked fine , basically ) . When it comes to baking things that are more finicky -- cakes etc -- I would follow the recipe directions .
That is almost certainly a " best by " date , not an expiration date . <URL> calls the shelf life of uncooked white rice " indefinite " . Yes , you can cook and serve your rice assuming that it is free of contaminants .
Mostly , it 's just more efficient from a time perspective . You can do all the stuff that a restaurant kitchen does at home on a smaller scale , but it may seem like a lot of work for just a small portion . For example , the prep time to make homemade broth , then put together ingredients and cook a homemade soup for 4 servings might take you most of an afternoon . Maybe by adding an extra hour for processing ingredients , you could easily make 100 servings of that same soup . The difference between making 1 loaf of bread and 20 loaves of bread is minor , assuming you have equipment to handle the larger quantities . You 'll spend a few more minutes dividing and shaping , but otherwise most of the time is just waiting for the dough to rise and then bake . So it 's really about efficiency . If a recipe says " stir for 20 minutes while simmering , " you 'll probably have to do that for roughly 20 minutes whether you 're making a cup or 3 gallons . And because all that prep work is tedious for just a few servings , many home cooks wo n't bother -- they 'll substitute store-bought broth or bullion , they 'll buy pre-mixed bread dough , etc. . Those " shortcuts " are often one main difference that can make your home cooking not as good . Otherwise , there really are n't specific advantages for most dishes . In some cases , you may need to adapt techniques or recipes to handle larger vs. smaller quantities . But flavors can be effectively developed in most dishes whether you 're making one portion or a hundred .
Remember that veal is merely very young beef ; the chuck ( which is the beef equivalent to the pork shoulder ) is probably your best choices . The chuck naturally has that best proportion of muscle to fat for sausage making . That said I would actually discourage you from choosing veal as a meat for sausage making , ground veal is [ IMHO ] really ' nothing special ' in terms of flavor . Veal 's ' specialness ' is in its tenderness , which is irrelevant in a sausage . You would be better served to use an mature beef chuck from an angus or longhorn . Lamb would also be a nice ancient flavor .
The way I do it is put 1-2 tbsp of oil in my pot , add 1/3 cup or so of corn , cover , and heat on medium until it starts popping , then turn down a bit and shake the pot occasionally until it is all popped . So , not oil free , but not a whole lot of oil either .
The Yolk and White are very different and I would expect to see a significant difference in result . That is n't to say it will be bad , just different . The Yolk is the source of fat . It is going to impart flavor to the dish and provide a creamier texture . The White is mostly protein and so will set more , have more of a texture impact . If it called for several whole eggs and you wanted to take a Yolk or two out for less fat , that would have less of a variance , but switching several Yolks to several Whites should definitely alter the results . Extra info : Here is some nutritional information of a Large Whole/White/Yolk . <URL> You will see they both carry protein however the Yolk has almost twice as much fat as protein while the White has less than 2 % of fat as it does protein . This makes their behaviors very different .
Since I 'm not an expert in Indian cuisine , I ca n't say this for certain , but I agree with the comments so far that this seems basically equivalent to the separation of the oil from the curry . To my mind , the wording makes perfect sense , because in some cases with a lot of oil/butter , you can get separation happening early on the pan 's edges . Oil tends to float on top , and usually the center of a pan is heated more strongly over a burner . Thus , you tend to get boiling/bubbling in the center , which tends to push any floating oil toward the edges . But these recipes are not looking for that small amount of oil along the edge ( which , depending on stirring and the thickness of the curry , can stay there through much of the cooking process ) . They are specifically waiting for the time when separation increases and fat appears floating on the surface even away from the edges of the pan .
The antioxidants in blueberries lie in the berries themselves , not in the pesticides residing on their skin . Washing them before freezing means that water freezes on the outside . The water crystals puncture the skins of the berries , changing the texture .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
As I understand it , it 's down to the flavour you get from frying the rice . However , it does also break down some of the starch which reduces the thickening it can do when the risotto cooks , which might cause a problem . I can attest to the flavour , but I 've not done experiments about thickening . Serious Eats had a good article on the topic though , in which such experiments were described . The solution in that was to wash the rice in the stock , then fry the rice , then add the stock containing all that undamaged free rice starch during cooking , thus giving you toasty flavour and creamy risotto with no questions asked . I have n't tried that , but it seems like a fairly sound idea to me . <URL>
There is one reason I might do this . If the core is green , that is starting to form a sprout . I cut that out as it can be bitter . Otherwise I do n't know why one would do that .
There are several reasons for adding orange juice : The first is for flavor . The second is to act as an acid . Although in this particular case , the acid is already in the baking powder . All baking powder needs to act as a leavening agent is some kind of liquid . Unless you meant baking soda , in which case an acid is necessary for leavening . The third is to inhibit mold growth . The real reason vitamin C is added is as a dough enhancer , not for gluten development . Since this is a quick bread ( no yeast ) , gluten development is not a main concern . The fourth reason for the orange juice is to make a tender crumb . Because of the fructose found naturally in it . Sugars are added to baked goods as a tenderizing agent . This recipe sounds yummy !
The smell is of rancid fats in the flour . It is a very distinct smell , but hard to describe . I would agree that " sour " is part of it . The best way to learn is by comparison . Smell some fresh , clean flour and remember what it is like . Any kind of unpleasant odor than that is rancidity . You may have smelled it also if you opened a box of cereal that has been around too long , or even poppy or sesame seeds - anything with fats that sits around at room temp will eventually go rancid .
Perhaps you can use one these ? <URL> Buying one these might be little over the top : <URL> <URL>
Baking soda also raises the PH of the product resulting in better browning . Soda can be left out . Many recipes - especially for chewier cookies - do n't call for any leavening besides the eggs . <URL> Cookie recipes often call for the dough to be chilled so that it spreads less in the oven before it sets . This creates a taller , less crispy cookie . Cookie recipes do n't typically have very much water in them for the soda to dissolve into . Much of the water is tied up in the butter and wo n't be available until the dough melts in the oven .
I found a quote from <URL> One thing you may not want to do with a press pot , especially a larger model , is use beans roasted less than 2 or 3 days before . What , am I crazy ? Nope . There 's a problem with ultra fresh beans and it is called " bloom " . When beans are only a day or two off the roast , they contain heaps of Co2 . Heaps of it , I tell you . That Co2 will translate into a massive bloom of brown suds on top of your press pot , possibly overflowing , but also making it easier for big particulate matter ( your ground coffee ) to hop and skip over the top of the filter portion when you first apply it . Bloom looks cool , but can make using a press pot more difficult . The poor filtering part sounds questionable to me , so I googled it and found a few bloom-related comments <URL> . It seems like some people start timing their soak time only after they see bloom . This seems like the real reason to me . I know for sure that the air content in ground substances can vary significantly : one cup of flour can contain double the volume of another if one is loosely sifted and the other is compacted . The above quote is accurate about that in my opinion . Apply this logic to coffee and in order to produce an accurate , general recipe for how long some compounds take to come out of coffee grounds , you need to factor out a variable between coffee grounds : how much air is in the grindings . Maybe the first small pour will saturate with coffee compounds , or drop in temperature quickly , reducing how much it can extract from the grounds . Once it squeezes out all the air , the rest of the water is poured in to do the real extraction work .
The fat in your dough started to soften/melt - especially if you have a hot oven running in the kitchen . Keep your dough cold in the fridge between batches . See <URL> for more details on the issue in general , but for your situation , keep it cold between batches . You seem to have started correctly , which is good - you just have to keep it going right .
If you 're planning to smoke your sausages , natural casings will allow for greater smoke penetration than many non-natural casings , and they wo n't impart any odd flavors of their own to the meat . That said , when you first open a container of natural casings , they may have a strong smell because of gas build-up ; let them air out ( in the fridge ! ) and they 'll be fine .
In addition to allowing fermentation to begin before the addition of fermentation inhibiting other ingredients , as @J . A.I.L. <URL> , according to <URL> , after explaining the benefits to flavor of a long , slow fermentation : A quick , warm fermentation will allow time for the yeast to produce enough carbon dioxide to raise the dough , but not enough time for the enzymes to work or for the development of the other flavour compounds . If we ferment our dough for too long , however , the gluten becomes too weak to hold the shape of the loaf . So artisan bakers generally use a preferment ( pre-ferment , not prefer-ment ! ) as part of their dough . This allows the bread to gain flavour from the longer fermentation , but still maintain a strong gluten network for a good rise .
Egg whites need to be heated up to a certain temperature in order to coagulate ( " set " ) . Lowering the pH ( increasing the acidity ) of the cooking liquid is one way to lower the temperature required for coagulation of the egg whites . So , in a way , this does prevent " feathering " of the eggs , but not because of any direct reaction ; rather , the reason the eggs feather less is because they have less time to feather , because they do n't need to get as hot . Any acidic liquid will have a similar effect . White vinegar is probably the most effective , but you could also add lemon juice or wine to the poaching liquid . In fact , eggs poached in red wine sauce ( " Oeufs en Meurette " ) is quite a popular preparation method . For reference , the coagulation temperature is also proportional to the salinity ( add salt to lower the coagulation temperature , add sugar to raise it ) , and inversely proportional to the number of eggs used ( more eggs = lower coagulation temperature ) .

Is there such a thing as pork stock ?
There certainly is such a thing as pork stock , it 's made the same way as beef and chicken stock - by cooking down bones to extract the flavors . With beef you use beef bones , with pork you use pork bones . Supermarkets stock the products that make economic sense , they do n't carry items which wo n't move - especially if they have a very limited shelf life . Beef , chicken and vegetable stocks are the most widely used ones in many parts of the world , so they will carry those as they have a good chance to be sold . Pork , lamb , and fish stocks can be found in supermarkets in areas where enough of the customer base will buy it . If you ca n't find it in your local supermarket then there may be specialty stores ( online or bricks and mortar ) which you could get it from . Butchers may carry it as well . If not then making stock is very simple , all you need is some bones , vegetables , a heat source and some time .
From Harlod McGee 's " On Food and Cooking : The Science and Lore of the Kitchen " : The muscles that make up meat are mainly water and the protein fibers that do the work of contraction , which are not dispersable in water . The soluble and dispersable materials in muscle include about 1 % by weight of collagen , 5 % other cell proteins , 2 % amino acids and other savory molecules , 1 % sugars and other carbohydates , and 1 % minerals , mainly phosphorus and potassium . Bones are around 20 % collagen , pig skin around 30 % , and cartilaginous veal knuckles up to 40 % . Bones and skin are thus much better sources of gelatin and thickening power than meat . However , they carry only a small fraction of the other soluble molecules that provide flavor . <URL> Accordingly , that 7 % ( 5 % + 2 % ) may be considered the upper bound for protein extraction , which will obviously depend on the specifics of the meat and cooking process . McGee then goes on to discuss the proper process for extraction , starting with cold water gradually heated : The cold start and slow heating allow the soluble proteins to escape the solids and coagulate slowly , forming large aggregates that either rise to the surface and are easily skimmed off , or settle onto the sides and bottom . A hot start produces many separate and tiny protein particles that reamin suspended and cloud the stock ; and a boil churns particles and fat droplets into a cloudy suspension and emulsion . <URL> This also indicates that the the amount of emulsified fat will depend greatly on on the cooking process in addition to the fat content of the original ingredients . ( I have n't been able to find much on differences in the extraction process for different animal fats . )
I 'd say that it 's not that we ca n't make cast iron pans as good as the old ones . It 's that for most companies that 's not where the money is . A company does n't make money by making super high quality cast iron ( " like the old stuff " ) that costs $ 100-200 per pan and selling them to a few cast iron enthusiasts ( those prices are random , I do n't actually know how much those would cost if they were made , but it would be a lot more than the current price ) . They make money by selling $ 15-30 cast iron cookware to loads and loads of consumers . Back in the day when manufacturing was n't as automated and people were involved in the process at a lot of steps , it did n't add much incremental cost to also sandblast and polish the surfaces , yielding the super-smooth surfaces that you used to see . Now , when lots of the manufacturing process is automated , adding in the additional time adds significantly to the cost of the product percentage wise . So , could we do it ? Yeah , sure . But big companies wo n't . I just suggest making your own :) As a side comment , newer cast iron is n't as nice as the old stuff for a number of reasons , but I use the newer style cast iron all the time ( my mom has not yet bequeathed me her old cast iron pans ) and it works great . Not as non-stick , heavier , and so forth , but still excellent for cooking .
Actually it is neither filler nor binder , but moisture retainer . Breadcrumbs in your ground meat will absorb much of the natural juices during cooking and then will release that moisture back into the meat as it rests resulting in a ' juicier ' burger , meatball or meatloaf .
Chives are an herb , green onions are part of ... well an onion . They are often used in similar ways and in similar dishes . You can substitute one for the others in most cases , but I could not say they are interchangeable . They have distinct flavors and it will change the dish to change the ingredient . Also do not attempt to replace green onion with dried chives 1-to-1 ( or fresh chives for that matter ) . Dried chives , not uncommonly found in pre-packaged spice racks , have about as much flavor as straw and will not deliver the desired result ( unless you like straw ) .
Yes , there is no real difference . Be aware that if you one from the hardware store , it should be one where the flame does not fluctuate when you tilt the torch . This usually happens with the very cheap ones . This becomes a big problem when you try to uniformly brown something . Aside from that and maybe " esthetically " I see no reason not to use one from the hardware store .
Well there 's a few things . First , higher temperatures mean more volatile aroma and flavour compounds will be released , leaving a flatter-tasting stock . Second , boiling means more motion within the liquid , which makes it harder to skim off the protein scum which forms on the surface while a stock is cooking . In addition , some of the scum will just become reincorporated into the stock via a process similar to emulsion . Third , boiling induces faster breakdown of proteins and other particulate matter , leaving you with a cloudier end product . This is of course of very little concern for stocks which will end up incorporated into ( opaque ) soups or sauces . Of the three , only the first is of any real concern to home cooks . The other two issues are n't a huge deal at the restaurant level ( modulo need for clarity in consomme etc ) , particularly if the restaurant uses Superbags or algae filtration for clarifying stocks .
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
There are cultured soy and coconut milk products ( generally sold with yogurt ) which can be used as a sour cream substitute ; it 's frequently advisable to add a little extra vinegar or lemon juice as these products do n't generally provide as much kick as real sour cream .
Probably not . Cans are generally marked at point of filling , not at point of manufacturing The plastic liner looks plastic ' y in all cases , it 's very hard to tell . Epoxy is harder than other plastics , but there are epoxies that are BPA free anyway Aluminium cans are more likely have a epoxy liner that will give off a trace of BPA Many steel cans do not use epoxy or other BPA plastics Having said that the tested BPA release from a can is 100 's of times lower than the recommended maximum daily dose . So in theory there is nothing to really worry about The common sense answer is , if epoxy dissolved into the cans contents they would n't use it would they . The whole reason it 's there is to stop the contents ' eating ' the can
Well , if you really want a " definitive " way to measure when lactic fermentation is complete , you 'd have to do a laboratory test directly for residual sugars . Most traditional foods that are lactic-acid fermented do n't have enough sugar to reach a final acidity that will self-limit continued fermentation by killing all the bacteria . ( Foods with too much sugar also often tend to spontaneously undergo yeast fermentation and lead to alcohol production instead if not monitored . ) Given the wide variety of fermentation products that can result from initial ingredients and different fermentation conditions , it 's really difficult to come up with some sort of " test strip " or something for residual sugar that is accurate . Home fermenters rarely bother with such things , but large-scale commercial fermentation sometimes tests residual sugar content for batches to ensure shelf-stability . That said , a specific recipe with specific starting ingredients will often have a target pH range , depending on the quantity of sugar in the ingredients , the amount of salt ( which in excess will inhibit further fermentation ) , desired flavor , etc. . The composition of the ingredients will determine the mininum possible pH when fermentation is effectively complete . The desired pH of lacto-fermented foods can vary anywhere from about 3.0 ( even down to ~ 2.75 for some sweet relishes ) to 4.5 ( more common in grain-based ferments , or quick-fermented vegetables meant to be used up quickly ) . To answer the specific question for sauerkraut , I 'd say most people would say sauerkraut fermentation is " complete " when a pH of ~ 3.5 or below is reached ( though opinions may vary ) . Part of the difficulty in answering the question is that home fermentation is often done with the intention of keeping the food " alive " even when it is consumed , which means fermentation will still be ongoing . In most traditional food cultures around the word , lactic acid fermentation is often deliberately incomplete , only used for a short period to transform an ingredient and then use it within a dish for consumption . This contrasts with much alcohol production , where continued fermentation in your final product can obviously create various difficulties for bottling , proper aging , etc. . And some people just prefer food at various earlier stages in the fermentation process . To take sauerkraut as an example , a pH of 4.0-4 .5 will be achieved rather quickly ( usually within a few days , depending on temperature , salt content , etc. ) . Some people prefer the taste of a fresher , crunchier product , and they may only ferment for a few days and then refrigerate to slow down fermentation significantly . Other people like to go much further and will ferment sauerkraut anywhere from a month to several months , again depending on temperature -- to achieve a final pH below 3.5 and even down to ~ 3.0 . Over time , the final product will obviously get more sour , but it will also soften and various nutritional changes will take place . It 's all a matter of preference when done at home . Lastly , in reference to the " lagering " aspect of the question , I think the closest analog in lacto-fermentation is the fact that various processes ( and various bacteria ) will work better at different temperatures . A higher temperature fermentation , for example , may result in a greater acetic acid component in the final ingredients , enhancing the " sharp " vinegar notes . At lower temperatures other bacteria may become more prominent in the fermentation , and in some temperature ranges enzymes and natural ( spoilage ) reactions may help to change flavor and texture too . Anyhow , for these reasons , some people prefer to refrigerate fermented foods or hold them for a while at " cold cellar " temperatures to allow these " aging " mechanisms to work as bacteria slow down ( analogous to lagering ) . Whether this is done after fermentation is effectively complete or at an earlier stage when the food is less sour again depends on individual preference .
My wife loves it toasted . Toast shredded coconut in a dry pan or oven and put on ice cream and other deserts . It 's really tasty . Like toasting other nuts be careful as if you blink it may burn .
The resource we generally use here on Seasoned Advice is <URL> . Feel free to edit this answer to include other resources .
Well , I see no reason this should n't work . Although I would change the process order slightly . If you think about it you 're basically suggesting making smoked bacon and then confiting it . Brine the meat , adding moisture to the meat . ( Make bacon ) Smoke the Bacon ( Smoked Bacon ) Confit it ... Smoking wise I would advise a cold smoke as it will help stop the meat drying out before the confiting . When doing the confit part I would highly recommend a really low fat/oil temperature , around 110c again to help stop the meat drying out and getting tough . Low and slow will save your meat . When I say make bacon I do n't mean brine it for 2 days but if you brine it for 4-8 hours you 'll help start the osmosis without actually creating full on salted bacon . It might taste great , but I see no reason why it would n't taste good . Maybe not the " Ultimate Pork Chop " ...
Properly ? You throw it in a pit with hard wood coals for at least 8 hours . Of course we do n't refer to that as roasting . :) Oven roasting is easier . Turn the oven on to 250F or so . Put something flavorful on the roast . Stick in a probe thermometer and put it in the oven . Remove when the thermometer reads 150F . Let it rest for a few minutes before carving . For more color and fat rendering you can roast at 450F for 10 minutes before dropping the oven to 250F and putting in the thermometer . Flavorings are varied of course . Apple works well .
If you 're buying bacon at the store , and trying to reduce the actual sodium in the product you 've just purchased - you 're out of luck . Like most things , you ca n't un-salt it . You can reduce the flavor , but in your case , the sodium is still there . Alternative options include : Buy reduced sodium bacon Make reduced sodium bacon Use less bacon , in order to reduce the total sodium intake .
According to <URL> , industrial and food grade CO2 generally come from the same plants : The slight difference between industrial-grade CO2 and food-grade CO2 is the type of tests that are done to qualify CO2 as beverage or beer gas-grade compared to industrial-grade . Currently , the FDA 's requirement for food-grade CO2 a 99.90 % purity rating . The other .09 % is made up of impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . Industrial grade CO2 is 99 % pure CO2 , also containing impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . However , the nature of those impurities extremely important . They go on to suggest : One impurity that all homebrewers should be aware of is benzene . Benzene is a no-no for homebrewers . If the CO2 that you are purchasing has high benzene levels , it will leave you and fellow drinkers with terrible headaches . When I say high levels , we are not talking about much . Benzene is usually an impurity that is referred to in PPB . The benzene level should be around 20 PPB . They suggest you ask for a profile of the impurities , although I suspect that Dick 's will be unable to comply . You will have to assess your own tolerance for risk , but you may better off seeking a more appropriate local vendor .
Maybe ! There 's one big potential issue : panini presses are hinged differently . There 's a bit of variation exactly how , but the effect is that the entire top can lift up , so that it can press down flat on whatever you stick in there . Waffle irons are just designed to be filled , so they hinge at the back . If your sandwich is much smaller than the waffle iron , you can put it in the front part ( as far from the hinge as possible ) , and it wo n't matter too much , but if it takes up a decent fraction of the area , it 'll be squeezed pretty tight at the back compared to the front . This will probably make it cook unevenly , and depending on what you 've got in there , might squeeze things out . Some panini presses also have better temperature controls than waffle irons , but that 's probably not as much of a concern . So I 'd give it a shot and see how it works , plan on possibly flipping your sandwich around halfway through , and do n't be too upset if it 's not pretty ! ( rfusca 's comment above is also good - if you 're able to take off the hinge , you 'd avoid the whole problem . )
No , it 's not . White vinegar ( also known as distilled vinegar ) is made of acetic acid diluted in distilled water . Its flavor is simple -- its just sour . Typical concentrations range from 5 -- 7 % acetic acid . White wine vinegar is made by allowing white wine to turn to vinegar . It has a much more complex flavor profile . It is also frequently less sour ( acidic ) than distilled white vinegar .
Sardines are canned , which means the high heat of a pressure canner . That is what softens the bones . If you are wanting softer bones for other kinds of fish , you can either cook them using a pressure cooker or can them . However , this will only work for smaller fish that have smaller bones . If your main concern is that you will swallow a bone and choke , then buy your fish as fillets only . Most fish fillets have no bones at all . The pin bones that are in salmon fillets can be removed with needle nose pliers , and are so small that you could n't choke on them if you tried .

Why do chefs finish with olive oil ?
For an astringent/bitter twist to the flavour , for a scent , and the visual gloss effect ** Mediterranean people have been doing this for centuries For best effect they are probably using a first cold press oil ( Extra-virgin ) from young olive trees ( less than 50 years old ) . It is often quite green in colour and has a pungent and astringent odour These are often only available from boutique olive farmers , in expensive small quantities e.g. . <URL> or <URL> . Expect prices around NZ$ 50 to NZ$ 100 per litre It is sort of similar in concept to squeezing a fresh lemon over a dish It 's a bit over fashionable at the moment , but in some dishes it really works ** the three s 's - sap ( or ) , scent , shine
Reaching back to my time in culinary school at Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence , RI : The style of hat originated in the Greek orthodox monastaries during the middle ages where chefs ( often taking refuge with other educated members of society ) would distinguish themselves from the monks by wearing a white hat ( <URL> ) . The early chef hats were slightly elevated but not as tall as they eventually became . Marie Antoine Careme ( commonly called " Chef of Kings and King of Chefs " ) is credited as the father of classical french cuisine for the development of mother sauces and standard garniture and classification of terminology used in kitchens . He 's also credited with much of the organization and division of labor in kitchens still used today . To designate role and stature in the kitchen he had his cooks wear hats of various height . His being the tallest designated him as the Head or Executive Chef . Traditionally it is said that the now traditional pleats indicate the number of ways that the chef wearing the hat can prepare an egg ( of course this predates the disposable paper hats we now use ) . 100 pleats is considered to be the " ultimate " number to be desired . However as a chef with 25 years experience in commercial kitchens , I 'd be hard pressed to name 100 ways ( without including eggs as an ingredient in recipes ) to prepare an egg .
Long story short : It 's the acid , and any acid will do . Food colourings are a type of dye known as an <URL> . Their effectiveness relies on hydrogen bonding which only works in an acidic environment . It 's not that the vinegar does anything special - not exactly . Rather , adding a few drops of food colouring to a large amount of water would give you something that 's not acidic at all , which will diminish or totally eliminate its effectiveness as a dye . Including vinegar in the mix simply allows you to stretch your rations , so to speak - to dilute the colouring in a whole lot of liquid without making it useless as a dye in the process . Basically , you 're creating a <URL> , which is a well-known term in the textile world , as it 's used to dye wool and other fabrics . Warm temperatures ( 140-180 ° F ) also aid in dye absorption , and apparently - although I 'm no expert in textiles - a small amount of Urea also helps . You could definitely use cream of tartar , citric acid or any other acid , but the recipes using vinegar are generally aiming for a specific pH , so you 'll want to adjust quantities of any other acidifier to match . Presumably , vinegar is just the cheapest and most widely available acidifier .
The coating you are talking about is potato starch that is browning on the bottom of the pan , similar to what happens to roux when it is prepared . If you deglaze the pan using alcohol , it will come right off without any effort ( water works too , though more is needed ) . As for how to get the potatoes not to stick , it 's important that the pan and the oil are quite hot when the potatoes are added to the pan . As described at <URL> , the hot oil encourages a steam barrier to appear between the potatoes and the pan , temporarily protecting the potatoes from sticking and encouraging the formation of a crust that will permanently keep them from sticking . Depending on the amount of potato being cooked , the amount of oil added to the pan will have to be adjusted for thermal mass , since the addition of uncooked potatoes will cause the oil to cool down very quickly .
How liquid was it when you say liquid ? Our kitchen is very cold in winter and may very well get to fridge temperature at night time and the olive oil gets white balls of solidified oil in it , and then goes very sludgy , making it difficult to pour , if not impossible . But it does n't exactly solidify . So it depends on whether you mean it is completely liquid like normal or not . This website implies that most oils should be unpourable by 35F ( 1.7 C ) , which is the lowest temperature for a fridge ( i.e. any particular fridge or part of a fridge may be slightly warmer than this ) : <URL> ( This same information is found on a multitude of sites , so I do not believe this is the original source ) However , it also says that olive oils may be " winterized " which means they do not clump or cloud , even at 32F/0C . This is so they can be used in salad dressings , etc , that are stored in the fridge . So you would need to find out if your olive oil had been so treated . I am not sure if this process is just used for oil sold for commercial use or not .
Technique is the key here . If she is using oil expect she is adding the eggs before the oil is hot , she is probably also rushing her attempt to turn/flip/scramble / move them . One of the hardest things to learn when frying eggs is to walk away immediately after adding the eggs to the hot pan . I notice you are in Germany , I do n't know what your access to the USA 's " Food Network " is but this episode of a Alton Brown 's " <URL> " can <URL> . ( pardon the pun , could n't resist ... )
I do n't see a point to doing this at all . The lemon oil may act as a mild surfactant in larger quantity . Use water and elbow-grease to clean your veggies -- you 're primarily trying to remove dirt . Use of Scotch Brite-style scrubbing pads ( so long as they 're detergent-free ) works nicely for heartier veggies like carrots and potatoes , and a vegetable brush or cloth for more delicate things . If you 're trying to kill germs , you may want to try soaking briefly in a VERY mild bleach solution . If you 're trying to prevent browning via oxidation , particularly in cut vegetables , acidulated water should do the trick -- add some lemon juice or crushed vitamin C tablets to water and soak until needed .
Just slice it into thin discs ( a mandoline is quick ) and the kids use it as chips 'n' dip . Try some natural or Greek style yoghurt and whole seed mustard as a dip . Very crunchy and tasty If the skin is dry or blotchy I quickly run the potato peeler over it first Otherwise , just grating it into soups or stews is a nice vegetable filler EDIT Doh , forgot the best thing to use it for Coleslaw , it replaces cabbage perfectly . Or you can mix cabbage and broccoli . Just coarse grate it with some carrot , onion . Blend it up with a little mayo and yoghurt , or lemon juice and olive oil . Add some ground fennel and cumin seeds or some chopped mint for extra zing
You could use them , together with the core , to make apple-glaze ( for your pie ) . Cover everything with water , simmer about 30 min , strain , simmer until you reach the desired density .
Since it sounds like they are basically a dried out batter at this point , I would turn to implementations that rely on those kind of food-stuffs ; With some further baking and possibly additional brown sugar and butter or apple-sauce , I would use them for a crumble topping . If they are coffee and cinnamon an apple-cardamom cobbler would benefit nicely . The crumbles could be incorporated into a biscuit batter recipe In all likelihood , any kind of recipe that relies on a granola could probably be referenced for further ideas . You could also use the crumble as a stand-in for oat based no-bakes . The no-bakes might feel mealy to the tooth , so not entirely eliminating the oat might work best . If you wanted to repurpose , you might try thinking of it as a material to be suspended . With an ingredient like well-blended coconut butter ( not to be confused with coconut oil or milk or cream ) you could create a base with which to make a kind of post-raw bar cookie ( basically press and chill the coconut butter in a pan on top of wax/parchment paper , pulse the muffin bits with some dates or brown rice syrup , and once the butter sets press the bits/dates mixture into the top and drizzle with some ganache or whatever ) .
Cleanliness , as pTerry reminds us , is only next to godliness in a very sternly abridged dictionary . However , working clean has three main things going for it : order ! when you 're trying to bang out a couple hundred dishes as fast as possible , being orderly and methodical in your work is not just important , it is absolutely vital . safety ! see above . if your area is a mess , you 're more likely to injure yourself or others . Bear in mind that we play with sharper knives and hotter burners than you do at home health ! a clean work area is one that is free of cross-contamination . Per calumbrodie 's answer below , I 'd like to expand a bit on the need for order . I 'll do this by telling you about my day today . We 've just rotated the kitchen ; chef does this from time to time to make sure everyone is cross-trained on all stations . So right now for the restaurant I 'm responsible for sandwiches ( one hot menu sandwich , one daily special ) , prepping one of our appetizers , one hot appetizer , soup daily , and one of our main courses ( crepe stuffed with pan-roasted wild mushrooms , caramelized shallots , and barre boulard cheese which is just heavenly ) . In addition to that , we also have a takeout counter and a satellite location elsewhere in the building ; for those I am responsible for sixteen sandwiches daily ( different from the restaurant sandwiches ! ) as well as stuffed chicken which goes with a salad . We start work at 9:30 AM , everything for the takeout must be ready by 11:15 , and restaurant service runs from 11:30 until 3PM . You should be able to see the time constraints this imposes . When I walked in this morning , here is what I had to do just to get the counter stuff out , and be ready for service : Bake bread ( parbaked , frozen , from a local artisanal baker ; we simply do not have the room to bake our own , although chef is open to the idea of tasking me with that ) Bread , par-fry , stuff , and bake chicken breasts . Deep-fry onions until crispy ( garnish for the menu sandwich ) Make crepes ( must be done fresh daily ) Make sandwiches for the counters ( today I was lucky ; I had some of the mise ready from some free time on Saturday ) Oops , mayonnaise did n't come in Friday 's delivery , better make some ... Make garnish for the soup I made Saturday Double check all my mise en place in case I forgot something . Chef has slimmed down the menu somewhat , but I still have roughly fifteen to twenty different components which must all be ready , all the time . With backups in case we get slammed . I have 1h 45m to do all of these things . And while I work best in a situation that looks like chaos to the outside observer , everything is carefully organized and planned . For example , crepes are something that -- if you 've made enough of them -- you can interweave with another task : make the batter first . Ladle batter into pan , spin around , put back on the heat . Good , now I have a minute or two to work on another task ; make a sandwich . Flip crepe , cut and wrap sandwich . Remove crepe from pan , repeat . And this was a slow day . On a busy day , this list could easily be twice as long , including some things that will simply take time and require undivided attention . So that took right up until service . During service I 'm still prepping : everything I need for tomorrow that can possibly be done today , I do . So ... roasting turkey for tomorrow 's sandwich , making a cranberry aioli , making crab croquettes for the entremetier station ( so : mashed potatoes , chilled -- oh dear that 's going to take two hours to come down in temp , better get started now -- then folded around a crab mixture ) , some sort of stuffing for tomorrow 's chicken ... and on top of that I 've got to be planning for Wednesday , for which I will need a new soup ( and garnish ) , got ta roast another lamb leg -- and that needs to chill too so I can slice it carefully , make sure I 've got enough bread in stock , and oh wait -- we have a catering function Thursday for which I need to make about a dozen things , best figure out when I 'm going to do that ... And all of this is being done while chits are coming out of the printer , so I need to be organized in such a way that I can not only stop whatever project I 'm working on , but that having those ingredients/tools on my station wo n't impede my ability to serve food in a timely manner . ... you get the point . ( There 's a much better treatment of this , from an exec 's POV , in Bourdain 's Kitchen Confidential ) . Without some order to my workspace ( which is thankfully large ) , I would quickly be dans la merde and everything would go a bit pear-shaped . I 've had those days , and it is difficult for me to convey how much it sucks to look at the clock , know you have five minutes left , and know that you have fifteen minutes of work still to go . The thing about working in a kitchen is that , apart from a very few places which run with military precision ( Alinea , Fat Duck , elBulli , Moto , the Laundry , etc ) , there is never enough time . Ever . And when there is enough time , well , there 's
Perhaps I 'm stating the obvious , but is your oven rack perfectly level ? Muffin mix initially has low enough viscosity that it can be influenced by gravity as it gradually rises . Even a small inclination of the tray/rack is likely to cause this .
Japanese style whetstones made of natural material , also known as " waterstones " , rely on water to make a paste from the material , and this paste is abrasive and aids in sharpening . Oil is not as effective as water in making this " mud " as the stone material is n't as soluble in oil . Further , once you have used oil on any type of whetstone , water may no longer be used as a lubricant , as it will be shed by the oil that has soaked into the stone and be ineffective in carrying away the swarf ( metal abraded from the blade by sharpening ) . Here is a <URL> on natural waterstones from an online retailer .
Oil or fat is absolutely not necessary to cook rice . I suspect you may have been taught the pilaf method where the rice is first sauteed in oil or butter , and then liquid is added and the rice is fully cooked . The purpose of the pilaf method is to add depth of flavor . When making pilafs , additional herbs , spices , or aromatics ( such as onions ) are often included . If you have been taught to add oil without the sauteeing , then the only purpose of it would be to add flavor . It wo n't really help prevent sticking , and is n't needed for the rice to cook properly . There are many methods to cook rice in addition to the pilaf method , and many to do not require any fat . Simply boiling or steaming in water is completely traditional in many Asian cuisines . In some cuisines , the crusty rice that sticks to the bottom of the pot or rice cooker is actually highly prized ( see Wikipedia 's <URL> article ) . You can mitigate the crusting of the rice by making sure to use the lowest flame or heat setting that will keep the rice steaming . I actually prefer to put the whole pot in a moderate oven , rather than do it on the stove top . You can also use the pasta method of simply boiling the rice in water , and then draining it when it is done to your liking , to completely avoid the crust . This will result in less sticky rice since the surface starches will be left in the boiling water . I understand this method is popular in some parts of India and Pakistan .
In our culture we eat olive pits ( especially Kalamata ) for generations and no one has ever had a problem with eating them in small quantities ( 3-4 max ) . They seem to be digestible ( never noticed any of them coming out ! :)
Disclaimer : I 've never tried to make a ganache with olive oil , so take that into consideration as you read the following . First , I have to assume that you 're trying to use olive oil to replace the cream that 's normally used in making ganache , perhaps to make a non-dairy ganache . If that 's not right , please clarify your question . Ganache is essentially an emulsion of cocoa butter ( usually from chocolate ) and cream , plus vanilla and/or other flavorings , that is allowed to cool to the point where the cocoa butter solidifies . It 's the solidified cocoa butter that gives ganache it 's firm texture . The greater the ratio of cocoa butter to cream , the firmer the ganache will be . If you want to replace the cream , you 'll need to make sure that you replace all the components that have an effect on the emulsion . Harold McGee 's <URL> explains the structure of ganache : The continuous phase of this mixture , the portion that permeates it , is a syrup made from the cream 's water and the chocolate 's sugar . Suspended in the syrup are the milk fat globules from the cream , and cocoa butter droplets and solid cocoa particles from the chocolate . He does n't say it , but I 'd guess that the milk proteins from the cream might act as emulsifiers to help stabilize the emulsion , much as they do with <URL> . The melting point of olive oil is obviously different from that of butterfat , but since you heat the cream in order to make ganache anyway , olive oil might still work . Given what McGee says , you 'll need to make sure that you add an appropriate amount of water so that there 's enough syrup to suspend the butterfat , cocoa butter , and solids . How much is an appropriate amount ? Cream is usually 20-40 % butterfat , so starting with a 1 part oil for 2 parts water seems reasonable . You might also need to add something that 'll act as an emulsifier , like lecithin .
Sometimes finishing is referred to as enriching , and from what I 've seen , the finishing ingredient tends to be something that breaks down or otherwise changes in cooking , like walnut oil or cognac . The purpose is to keep the flavour of the ingredient without cooking it ; finish it when you reheat it .
Yes , the freshness is the factor . In the US eggs are sold in three grades : AA , A , and B ( rare ) . The grading is based primarily on age . AA are the freshest , and B the oldest . Here is a diagram depicting the internals of an egg : The characteristics of the freshest eggs are : A large thick albumen ( white ) A small thin albumen A sturdy thick chalaze A small air space A sturdy round yolk when lying flat As the egg ages the following things happen : Thick albumen breaks down , getting smaller Thin albumen gets larger Chalazae degrades getting thinner and weaker Air space increases Yolk membrane weakens , when cracked it lies flatter Embryo may become visible as a red speck As a result of the weakening membrane the yolk is indeed easier to break . Michael 's suggestion to use your fingers to separate the eggs is spot on . The edge of an egg shell is a little too risky for reliable separation of eggs .
When tomatoes are fried , you can see that the oil becomes coloured red - so at least some of the colour components are preferentially soluble in oil . I will hazard a guess that , under the circumstances mentioned , the oil coats the tomato particles , and some of the colour migrates into it to give a red surface . Because the oil forms a coating , that coat will inhibit oxidation . The oil will also improve the mouth feel of the soup . Just the way I see it ...
I do n't want to disappoint you , but the sad truth is that extra virgin olive oil is unsuitable for all the cooking methods you mention . When you heat any oil past its smoking point it starts to deteriorate and can even become dangerous . Olive oil , extra virgin in particular , has a lower smoking point than most other oils . In fact , you will be better off with an olive oil of lesser quality . Such an oil will have been processed and thus purified , increasing its smoking point . You may think that butter is unhealthy , but at high temperatures it will actually withstand the heat better than extra virgin olive oil . Good oils for the purposes you mention are canola oil , sunflower oil , peanut oil , and grapeseed oil .

Is a black coating dangerous when cooking on cast iron ?
Black stuff on a cast iron skillet is most likely just a thin layer of burned food . It 's not horribly dangerous ( I 'm sure you 've eaten some charred things before ) but it does make your food look worse , so you may as well just keep your skillet clean and well-seasoned and avoid it .
I 've never heard of anyone trying this . I think its very unlikely though . Those gas deflectors are actually specially designed to pull in the appropriate amount of atmospheric air for a proper flame . This is why the flame you see is so blue and has very little orange . I 'd look into seeing if there is some way to get a replacement deflector that is better suited for wok cooking . You could also do what Alton Brown does and use the bottom half of a turkey deep fryer , outside preferably , and not over any pipes or electrical wiring or gravel .
I 've never heard of milk being used to season a pan and so I am a little skeptical of it . Pan seasoning is always done with fat that is heated until it polymerizes . This creates a very hard non-stick surface that makes cooking easier and protects the pan from rust . See this question for more about how to season your pan : <URL> See the article linked in one of the answers : <URL> This process , while slightly more labor intensive , produces the best seasonings I 've ever seen .
The cast iron tea equipment is a Japanese development . In Japan , tea is most commonly a green variety , and brewed at a lower temperature than boiling . This can be as low as 104 ˚F ( 40 ˚C ) for high grades of gyokuro , or as high as 167 ˚F ( 75 ˚C ) for more common varieties of sencha . The lower grade the tea , or the more oxidised/fermented the tea , the higher the temperature of the water recommended . In western tea culture , where black tea is the norm , the water used for tea preparation is usually boiling , 212 ˚F ( 100 ˚C ) , so if you are using cast iron equipment to prepare tea in the western fashion , you may be in for some burned fingers . This may also be the case for some Japanese ceramic tea services . I have one favourite Japanese stoneware tea cup that is equally likely to burn you if you put boiling water in it , unless you wait 5 minutes or more for it to cool . In any case , the cost associated with cast iron tea services is such that they are more often used for more formal settings in which a higher grade of tea , and therefore , a lower water temperature , are more likely to be indicated .
Spanish Chorizo comes in two forms both of which to the best of my knowledge are fully cured ( cooked ) : one which is more for eating on its own ( like salami ) and the other which tends to have a higher ratio of fat in it and is used primarily for cooking . The latter one being what the recipe is referring to as " cooking chorizo " . Oftentimes the cooking chorizo is in a paper casing that must be removed ( unless you need some extra fiber in your diet ) . Either one of these would work , however you might need to add a little oil to the pan if you need to cook other things in the fat that would normally be rendered out . Mexican chorizo is always a raw product which must be cooked and is usually in a plastic casing .
If there really is fat inside the steak , it is terribly undercooked . But this is unlikely to happen . Animal fat is a saturated fat which melts somewhere around 35 ° C . If your steak has n't reached 35 ° C internal temperature , it will be very visibly raw on the inside , with no apparent difference from the cold steak from the fridge . It will still be oozing blood-like liquid even after resting for over 10 minutes , and the liquid will be thicker than the juices of cooked steak . It will be deep red and slimy , and cold to the touch . Even the rarest steak you can buy is taken above 40 ° C . But not everything white inside meat is fat . Connective tissue/fascia are white too . They are not really lump-shaped , but I do n't know how precise your description is . Try cutting through one of the lumps . If it is tough and rubberlike , it is connective tissue ( and if there is lots of it , your meat is not meant for roasting , but for a slow cooking method ) . If the knife goes easier through the lump than through the meat , it is fat , and your cooking method is seriously wrong . In any case , the best way to know when steak is done is to use a meat thermometer . Stop when it shows around 61 ° C , the remaining heat transfer after removing from the heat will give you a medium steak .
First off , you can use a gas grill as a gas burner , and cook anything you could on the stove . It wo n't be very efficient , and wo n't be as pleasant as using a stove , but it 'll work . The one big inconvenience is that since the burner wo n't be appropriately sized to the pan , or directly beneath it , you 'll need pots and pans that can handle heat all around - in particular , you ca n't use anything that ca n't take the heat on the handle . Cast iron might be your best bet . But from there you can do whatever you want - saute , sear , etc. . You 're not really limited to one technique . You can also essentially use the grill as an oven if you want to . You wo n't have precise temperature control like you would in the oven , and the temperature will vary more from side to side and top to bottom than it would in an oven , but it can reach the same kinds of temperatures . If you get a thermometer with a probe that can be left inside the grill , then you 'll be able to adjust the heat as needed and get a sufficiently precise temperature to do most things you could do in the oven . You 'll want to use indirect heat to do this , so that whatever you 're cooking is n't incredibly hot on the bottom . If you have three burners , you can use the two on the sides and put the food in the middle ; if you have two you 'll have to use one on one side and put the food on the other , resulting in somewhat less even heating . Here again , you 're not really limited to one technique . You can do braised things inside a dutch oven ( like a pot roast ) . You can wrap things up in foil and roast them . You 'll have a bit more trouble with things that are meant to cook open and care more about even heating , so for example thinner slices of meat ( or fish filets ) on a baking sheet might not be a great idea , but there 's still plenty you can do . All-in-all , I would n't think of this as learning a list of techniques . I 'd just look for recipes you 're interested in trying , and see if they seem like they 'll work on the grill given all that .
Yes , yes there is . Black truffles are dark , earthy , sexy in flavour . Renaissance writings compare them to ' unwashed slatterns ' and ' bedchambers , rooms of sexual congress , unaired and reeking of the recent activities contained therein . ' White truffles are lighter in aroma and flavour , with distinct garlicky notes . Each has their place -- black works better on its own , white works better as an adjunt or finishing note to a dish . I am personally partial to white truffle oil drizzled on cured duck breast , or a black truffle risotto with charred endive .

Golden Syrup improves with age according to Heston Blumenthal 's " In Search of Perfection " . Here he analyses a 70 year old glass jar of Tate and Lyle Gold in the lab finding that the " older treacle contained the same flavour compounds as the normal stuff , but each was intensified " . In his recipe he fakes the ageing process by baking the tin at 70ºC ( 158ºF ) for 24 hours noting that the flavour will continue to improve up to 100 hours .
The <URL> clearly recommends not leaving cooking appliances unattended when no one is home : Based on 2006-2010 annual averages : Unattended cooking was by far the leading contributing factor in home cooking fires . [ ... ] Ranges accounted for the largest share ( 58 % ) of home cooking fire incidents . Ovens accounted for 16 % . At the time this <URL> was written , the Fire Administration said ( they have since updated the page ) : The leading cause of fires in the kitchen is unattended cooking . Stay in the kitchen when you are frying , grilling , or broiling food . If you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time , turn off the stove . If you are simmering , baking , roasting , or boiling food , check it regularly , remain in the home while food is cooking , and use a timer to remind you that you 're cooking . Stay alert ! To prevent cooking fires , you have to be alert . You wo n't be if you are sleepy , have been drinking alcohol , or have taken medicine that makes you drowsy .
First , use oil . Many people use no oil at all on nonstick , but it wo n't work that way on a cast iron pan . Second , preheat it properly . With iron , it takes a long time . If you have a resistive electrical stove , it will be quite longer than you expected . Third , you might want to steer away from non-bound starches in the beginning , until the seasoning has set through use .
Scrub the heck out of it with Kosher salt and the tiniest amount of water , then start all over again seasoning it . A fair amount of work , but well worth it to save a good skillet .
I have friends from Hong Kong who always use steel woks in their take-away . A cast-iron wok would require a different technique for stir frying . It would be slower to heat up and retain heat when you did n't want the food to continue cooking . Stick with the one you have ...
Yes , it is safe . It is really more a question of quality . I would suggest that , in your specific situation you get a browning dish . ( It would be something that you could still use after your move , if you like . ) Please see the excerpt below from <URL> . There is nothing like a charbroiled steak straight off the grill . But for the times when you do n't want to fire up the grill - or even get the broiler dirty - there is a way to sear steaks in the microwave on an accessory called a browning dish . A microwaved steak will not brown well without one , and the dish is really the only acceptable way to brown in the microwave . Browning dishes can be either flat rectangular plates or black skillets that are designed for the microwave . Embedded in the plate or skillet are metal strips that cause the microwaves to couple or link , producing an electrical current . The dish also is coated with a metal that is resistant to the electrical current . You can read the rest of the article and the how-to information by following the link .
Why stove top and why oven ? The stove top provides high heat for searing , which generates browning ( the famous <URL> ) which creates delicious , savory flavor components . The oven provides an even , gentle heat for longer cooking without burning . The beauty of the braise Braising is a technique where a food , usually a meat , is cooked slowly in a moist environment , partially covered with water . It is an ideal technique for tougher , generally less expensive meats , because it converts collagen to gelatin , changing the meat from tough to meltingly tender and wonderful . Braising is more common than you might think . Chili con carne , and pot roast , osso bucco and coque au vin are all braised recipes . Searing and braising Many braising recipes start with a sear , which is most commonly done stove top , because of the high intense heat that is easy to generate . Alternate methods would be to use a broiler or an outdoor grill , but these are often not as convenient . The purpose is to generate the savory flavors ( not as the old kitchen myth said , " to seal in juices " ) . Then the dish is finished in its liquid ( which will later usually become the sauce ) at a much more gentle cooking pace . Braising is flexible You can braise in the oven . The advantage is the heat is very even and predictable , and you can just let the pot sit in the oven for 2 , 3 , or even 4 hours without worrying about burning or sticking . You can braise on the stove top , with a gentle flame ( or lower electric element setting ) . You simply adjust to leave the pot contents at a slow simmer ( bubbles form lazily , not continuously ) . There is slighty more risk of burning , and the occassional stir might not hurt , but especially with a good pan , no risk . So almost any braising recipe can be easily converted to be stovetop only , by simply ... erm ... using the stove top for the long braising time . I prefer the oven personally , but that is a matter of convenience and easy control . Quality cookware Quality cookware like good multi-ply stainless steel , or your now famous dutch oven ( from your previous questions ) is ideal for braising because it can be used for both the sear ( just like a cast iron pan ) and for the slow braising portion . No need to dirty two pots or pans . Recipes that are just stovetop There are a countless myriad recipes that you can cook in your cast iron just on the stove top . Anything : Fried Deep fried Boiled Braised The one thing you may choose to avoid doing is highly acidic recipes , like tomato sauce , which are not great for your seasoning . On the other hand , in rotation with other recipes that rebuild the seasoning , or just doing some direct seasoning , there is no true harm done either . Recipes that are just the oven There are many recipes that would only be done in the oven . Many braises skip the searing part . Even recipes that call for it can be done without , at some loss of flavor . Any recipe you see for a crockpot can be done in a dutch oven in the regular oven .
It is honeydew honey . It is not made from nectar , but from tree parasite secretions . It has a quite different taste from regular flower/nectar honey , and it is much darker . Sometimes it is also called forest honey . Wikipedia has a paragraph on it : <URL> There is a slim possibility that it is not a real honey at all , but pine honey , which is actually a jelly made from pine flowers/leaves ( it uses the fresh tips where the needles are very soft ) . It is used as a bee honey substitute , not a fruit jelly substitute , and the name also includes the word " honey " , so there is a chance for miscommunication , especially if a language barrier is present . But I think you 'd have described the taste differently . It is also a richer taste than normal honey , but a bit sharper , not caramel-like mellow , and the pine resin aroma is discernible .
Black Vinegar is basically what it 's called , and has a smoky and mellow flavor . It is made from rice , sometimes from glutinous rice and is sometimes used as a full-flavored but much cheaper balsamic vinegar . Hope this helps ! :)
Actually , there are really only a few oils you can substitute for each other , at least without any significant side effects . The oils which generally are used interchangeably are peanut oil , canola/rapeseed oil , and sunflower oil . These oils have similar smoke points , do n't impart any really noticeable flavour , and tend to be used primarily for high-heat cooking ( pan-frying , deep-frying ) , so if you 're paranoid about saturated fat for instance , you can substitute sunflower oil for peanut oil . Corn oil is in the same group , but I rarely see that used anymore . You can also use the " light " olive oil , but that will change the flavour of the dish . I believe walnut oil has similar properties , but it 's considerably harder to find . But keep in mind that oils are used for far more than frying . Many have highly-specialized uses : Extra virgin olive oil is most commonly used in sauces and salad dressings ( " oil and vinegar " almost always means olive oil , there really is no substitute ) ; Chili oil is really more of a condiment than a cooking oil . Even if you could cook with it , the result would be inedible due to the heat . Toasted sesame oil is used as a flavourings in Asian dishes . It 's useless as a cooking oil ( and cooking with it would be a terrible waste ) . Regular sesame oil , on the other hand , is often bought in a refined form and is generally used as a cooking oil . There are a lot of other more esoteric types of oil such as palm oil and coconut oil , which you really do n't want to use unless you know what you 're doing ( you can ruin the flavour ) . I could go on , but for now I 'll refer you to the <URL> as a starting point . Cooking oils really are n't freely interchangeable in all situations ; even if you 've accounted for smoke point and flavour , sometimes a significantly different fat content ( i.e. grapeseed oil which is mostly polyunsaturated vs. canola oil which is mostly monounsaturated ) can seriously mess up a delicate recipe . It 's better to be asking which oils you can substitute in a specific situation than to assume everything goes and list the " exceptional " circumstances .
Sandwich or quick bread has different heat requirements than artisan breads . Artisan breads require a blast of high heat and humidity right from the beginning . They are usually baked on flat , preheated stones that store a lot of heat . With breads baked in loaf pans the bread is proofed in the pan which is obviously not preheated . The goal is not a blast of high heat but generally even heating . Stoneware and cast iron will hold a lot of heat but that is n't very useful for this type of bread . The big difference that a stoneware loaf pan will make is in the bread 's crust . Unglazed stoneware will let some moisture escape during baking . Stoneware loaf pans are often used for dishes other than bread such as meatloaf where the even heating and heat retention when serving is valuable . Bread baked in stoneware will be crustier in the area covered by the pan than bread baked in metal . This is a more compelling advantage with quickbreads . In my opinion sandwich bread does n't need to be crusty . Metal bread pans are cheaper , lighter , and less fragile . They wo n't even out any heat gradients in a sloppy oven . If you know your oven is unreliable consider getting a thermal mass ( such as a pizza stone ) to even out the temperature . I have n't used a cast iron loaf pan but my first inclination would be to use it for southern-style cornbread . This type of cornbread is normally cooked in a cast iron skillet . The pan would be preheated with hot fat and the cornbread batter would be poured in . The stored heat in the pan would fry the bread before it rose and set . I do n't know why a cast iron pan would be used for normal bread .

How come mere water buffalo milk and lemon juice mixture turn into yogurt ?
This is not yogurt per definition , you are making a fresh cheese . You can actually use other types of milk for such a cheese , but the mouthfeel and taste will be very different and wo n't be as similar to yogurt . There is a large class of acid-curdled cheeses , including paneer , tvorog , quark and many others . I do n't know if yours has a specific name . I know that there are people who for some reason ca n't tell the difference in taste betwen quark and yogurt . But it is still cheese , even if it tastes similar to yogurt .
Greek yogurt has more fat than a " normal " yogurt , about 10 % . Further an original Greek yogurt is made from sheep 's milk since there are n't many cows in Greece . This might taste a bit odd for people used to cow 's milk though ... When buying Greek yogurt made from cow 's milk I recommend you look out for the native brand <URL> .
As you mentioned it is all about how the crystals form . Some of the factors off the top of my head : How saturated is the solution - The more sugar packed into the syrup the more easily it will crystallize . How quickly it cools - The slower the bigger the crystals Interference - Do you have a starch or other sugar molecules gumming up the works ? Obviously you already knew this from your question . Not using other sugars will help . You might also try adding more sugar to the recipe at the beginning to fully saturate your solution . The fact that you add sugar at the end and it still dissolves in makes me think your solution could take a bit more . Letting the solution cool slowly with your seed sugar at the end should help . You would think it would be easier to get it wrong . Perhaps you simply have too much experience doing it right . Ask an amateur to try out your recipe and see if they fail properly .
Start with the milk and add ice cream till you reach the desired consistency . If you want to add ' bits ' start when it is about halfway to the thickness you want
It will if you add more icing sugar but you may end up with a lot of buttercream depending on how much of the icing you have left . A basic ratio is 4 cups icing sugar to 1 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of liquid which makes 3 cups of icing . You may have to add more icing sugar , then more butter to compensate for the water if there 's more than 1/4 cup in your original biscuit icing .
I 'm culling a lot of information from one of my <URL> for this one . Yes , limes have a slightly higher acid content ( on average ) than lemons do - about 6 % for limes , compared to 4.5 % for lemons . More importantly for their flavor , lemons have about 2 % total sugar , while limes have somewhere between 0.5 % and 0.75 % . Sugar/sweetness has quite a suppressive effect on the perception of sourness , so lemon juice will most likely taste a bit less sour than lime . The composition of acids in the two also differ . The acid in lemon juice is almost entirely <URL> , which also makes up most of the acid in limes . However , limes include about 10 % each of <URL> and <URL> which have an effect on their flavor . Malic acid is most recognizable as the sour flavor from tart apples and rhubarb . About succinic acid , Wikipedia states : It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness , bitterness and acidity . Personally , I think the difference is perceptible in beverages , but less so in cooking . Culturally , lime would most certainly be the traditional choice for Latin American cuisine . Lime is much more readily available in Central and South America ( three of the <URL> are located there ) . How the difference in acid content would contribute to the browning of avocados is more questionable . EDIT : Here 's <URL> , suggesting that <URL> ( vitamin C ) is more effective at preventing avocado browning than citric acid . Which is an interesting wrinkle , because lemons contain significantly more vitamin C than limes do ... EDIT 2 : And along comes Jolenealaska , with <URL> that seems to undermine the entire assumption that acid reduces browning of avocado at all ! Seems like the real secret may just be keeping your avocados either uncut , or refrigerated and tightly wrapped if you have to cut them ahead of service .
If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge , it means you did it right ! Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin ; that 's the very essence of stock-making . The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock ; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency , but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture . The more you reduce the stock , the more gelatinous it will become , so if it turned out stiffer than you expected , it 's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate . Typically , when making stock , you use a very low simmer ; just a few bubbles per minute . Any more than that and your stock will reduce . But reducing is perfectly OK , and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few tablespoons ; it 's like bullion , only without all the salt and preservatives . Heavily-reduced stock is called glace de viande and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick , imparting a powerful meat flavour . But you probably did n't reduce it that much . If you 're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous , even at higher temperatures , you can feel free to dilute it . For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1 , but taste as you go along just to make sure you 're not watering it down too much . When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator , it is probably fat , which you should skim off and discard ( or reserve ) . The rest is your actual stock , and in your case it sounds delicious . Also , since you mention vacuum-sealing - I prefer to use covered ice cube trays for freezing stock . That lets you portion it out much more easily than a big solid blob .
Using stock ( or broth ) has two advantages over plain water : It is more flavorful , giving your pie a better , deeper background richness It contains gelatin , which may improve the mouth feel of your pie , giving it a thicker , silkier , richer texture Depending on your particular pie recipe 's filling , this may not make a huge amount of difference , or it could be the difference between a so-so and a great pie .

Whisk ( e ) y has some crazy chemistry going on inside of it , due to the complex interactions between water , alcohols , oils , esters and other compounds of various complexity . The profile of these chemicals will vary between different whiskey/whisky styles , but the overall chemistry is similar . Simple effects of dilution Adding water , or serving on the rocks , has a number of simple effects , such as diluting the ethanol a bit ( ethanol anesthetizes your taste buds a bit ) , and cooling it ( making your taste buds slightly less sensitive to certain flavors ) , but the fascinating part is what happens to the oily flavor compounds during dilution . Dilution masks some flavor compounds Oily hydrocarbons are somewhat soluble in high-proof whiskey . There are long-chain esters and short-chain esters of many varieties . As you add water , the whiskey becomes more polar , and the long-chain esters become supersaturated and start to precipitate in the form of micelles , microscopic " droplets " of esters that have clumped together . In some liquors like absinthe or ouzo , these droplets can get so large that they become visible , and visibly cloud the drink ( an intended feature of absinthe preparation ) . In whiskey , these droplets are usually microscopic and do n't visibly cloud the drink , because most of the oils have been removed during <URL> . However , these droplets do something important , in that short-chain esters , being more soluble in the droplet than they are in the diluted whiskey , enter the droplet and become trapped inside . These compounds are now less available for tasting or smelling . Fortunately , these compounds are the oily , grassy compounds that many people do not like in their whiskey , and masking them is considered an improvement . Dilution releases other flavor compounds There is another type of micelle " droplet " that forms in whiskey . Ethanol , in high concentrations in water , forms it 's own clusters , as ethanol molecules gather up with one another . Interestingly , warmer solutions cause more clustering of ethanol molecules , as do higher concentrations . Like before , these micelles trap compounds that are more soluble in ethanol than they are in water , volatile flavor compounds . However , unlike the oil droplets , these flavor compounds are desirable . Cooling the solution and diluting the solution both serve to " pop " these ethanol micelles , allowing them to release their trapped compounds for aroma and flavor . So cooling and adding water can have the effect of both masking certain flavors by forcing them out of solution , and enhancing others by promoting their release back into solution . In the end , the result of the changed flavors is a matter of taste , which is why some people prefer neat , with water , or on the rocks , but one can not deny that real chemical changes are in play .

One of the first things I learned in Indian cooking is that the combination of tomatoes , onions and ginger is self-thickening . As time went by , I realised that the thickening effect is far more noticable with old varieties of tomatoes - " beef " tomatoes and a lot of the modern varieties are difficult to thicken unless partially fried first . Despite the absence of ginger , I suspect that the thickening is purely a natural action between the tomatoes and the onion , and that the tomatoes used were some particularly nice old variety .
Short answer : you can let coconut milk separate and skim it to get a little coconut cream , but ca n't convert coconut cream back to coconut milk . Diluting the cream just produces something runny and disgusting . Long answer : Coconut milk is made by grating coconut and running very hot water through it to extract oils and flavor , then straining out the coconut pieces . It is a mix of water soluble parts and fats , and can emulsify just like normal milk or thicken sauces similarly to milk cream . If you allow coconut milk to sit , the fatty part will rise to the top . This part is skimmed off to make coconut cream , which is much richer in fats . It cooks very differently because of the higher fat content , and does not emulsify or thicken well ; however it is quite delicious ! If you 're looking to substitute for coconut milk , but only have coconut cream , the best substitution will probably be a little coconut cream + a lot of heavy ( milk ) cream . Note : Some people refer to the liquid contained in fresh coconuts as coconut milk , but it is more accurately called coconut water . This confusion has ruined many a recipe !
They are technically two different pastries . Shortcrust pastry made with water is called pâte a foncer , ' lining pastry ' . Shortcrust pastry made with milk is called pâte brisée . Pâte brisée typically contains a bit more butter , and is generally lighter and flakier than pâte a foncer , which is conversely crisper and firmer . So it 's up to you really ; both are very similar . The pâte brisée is more delicate , so if you have a ' heavy ' filling , say , lots of fruits , it might be better to go with the foncer .
Making <URL> means letting <URL> alter the texture and chemical composition of milk by digesting lactose and producing lactic acid , which in turn interacts with the proteins in the milk , causing the milk to thicken and taste sour . Unlike in cheese making you are not separating curds and whey , so you are not " losing " significant amounts of substance . Yes , there might be some fluctuation - an increasing number of lactobacillae and them eating lactose - but on a very small level . For our general kitchen precision , 500 g milk makes 500 g yogurt . Side note : 500 ml milk is not exactly 500 g , in fact , it 's 510 g according to my sources , but I consider these values precise enough for general cooking purposes . Otherwise , you ca n't even stir , as minute amounts will remain on spooons or in your pots and pans . This is a kitchen , not a lab .
Assuming the cod was the same quality as before and you de-salted the fish in the fridge for 24 to 48 hours , then I would also guess overcooking . Rendering the gelatin at 45 & deg ; C ( as suggested in the paper <URL> ) should prevent the fish from cooking and give enough time to get it into the oil . You can always cook the fish in a separate step after you made the pil pil . Modern techniques for salting cod use less salt and create a product that will not be edible by future archeologists , so store in a dry cool place ( tightly wrapped in the fridge ) .
First of all , if you 're seasoning tilapia , you 'll want to add some oil to it , since tilapia has almost no fat . So , here 's the steps : Drizzle oil over the tilapia ( both sides ) . Sprinkle it lightly with the spice mixture , all over Let sit 10-15 minutes . Sprinkle with starch ( e.g. flour ) at this point if you 're frying them . Optionally , you can also add some lemon or lime juice ( just a little ) in step 1 . You also want the tilapia sitting on something flat , with the filets in one layer , like a large plate or baking sheet , not heaped up in a bowl . For spicing small filets , you want a finely ground , moderate-flavor spice mixture . Unlike beef or pork , you 're not marinating the fish for a long time , and you 're not cooking it for along time . So the spicing on the fish is n't really a " rub " ; it 's spicing to eat . I recommend against using rubs designed for meat on light fish like tilapia .
You can neutralize the acidity of your drink by adding a half teaspoon of baking soda , but do n't do this . Apart from fizzing up like a volcano , your lemon drink , or what is left of it , will taste pretty awful . What you want to do is reduce the perceived acidity . This can be done simply by adding more honey . I suggest adding a teaspoon at a time until it tastes about right . I like about double the amount of honey you specified if we 're talking teaspoons .
<URL> has a vast amount of information on beer styles . To answer your specific question , an ale is top-fermenting whereas a lager is bottom-fermenting . Lagers are generally fermented at lower temperatures than ales . I believe that lambics would constitute a third category , since they are traditionally fermented by wild yeasts , but opinion may vary on this , I do n't know . There are dozens of styles of ales and lagers and a few different lambics , but the method of fermentation is the main distinguishing characteristic between the three types .
What we perceive as " flavor " often comes from a lot of aromatic and volatile components that we smell . We smell them because they are volatile , which means that they tend to evaporate off food ( if they are small molecules ) or tend to be carried off of food ( for larger molecules ) . Aside from the basic sweet , sour , bitter , salt , and umami notes , the rest of the complexity of flavor comes from smell and volatile flavor molecules . If the only thing that evaporated when reducing a sauce was " pure water " in the form of steam , you would n't be able to smell it . Yet , when you cook a stock or sauce for a long time , the whole kitchen and house often smells with great aromas . More aromas in your house means more flavor lost from the sauce . So , if you do add water back into a sauce , your sauce will often taste somewhat more diluted . Or , more likely , it will taste " unbalanced , " since the smaller flavor molecules tend to escape faster and easier in evaporation . When we cook down a sauce and concentrate it , we 're used to the way the flavors change . But when you dilute it again , the flavors may not have the same proportion as the original . All of that said , the magnitude of this effect varies a lot depending on the sauce and types of flavors in it . If you over-reduce slightly and just add a bit of water back in , it 's not likely to make a huge difference . But if you took a giant pot of flavorful meat stock ( which tastes fine as-is ) , then reduced it down to a demiglace , and then added water back in to try to re-create the original stock , it definitely would taste very different and many flavor notes would be significantly weaker or lost altogether . As Harold McGee notes in On Food and Cooking ( pp. 600-601 ) : Slowly simmered until it 's reduced to a tenth its original volume , stock becomes glace de viande , literally " meat ice " or " meat glass , " which cools to a stiff , clear jelly . Glace has a thick , syrupy , sticky consistency thanks to its high gelatin content , about 25 % , an intensely savory taste thanks to the concentrated amino acids [ large , non-volatile molecules ] , and a rounded , mellow , but somewhat flat aroma thanks to the long hours during which volatile molecules have been boiled off or reacted with each other . ... Intermediate between stock and glace is demi-glace or " half-glace " which is stock simmered down to 25-40 % of its original volume . ... [ I ] t also has the advantage of sparing some of the stock 's flavor from being boiled off . ... Demi-glace is the base for many classic French brown sauces . Or , listen to James Peterson , author of Sauces : Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making ( 3rd ed. , p. 91 ) : Do not overreduce . Stocks are often reduced to concentrate their flavor and to give them an appetizing , light , syrupy texture . Although reduction is an almost essential technique for converting stocks into sauces , much of the delicacy and flavor of meats is lost if reduced too long . Many of the flavors contained in stock are aromatic and evaporate when simmered over a prolonged period , leaving a flat taste . In a later chapter ( p. 112 ) , he adds : " Stocks and sauces that have been overly reduced often have a flat , cooked taste that must be offset with more assertive flavors . " As Escoce 's answer points out , when you reduce a sauce significantly , it may " overcook " the flavors . Some of that may be due to browning ( Maillard ) reactions , but prolonged cooking will also break down some large flavor molecules , again lessening certain flavor notes and altering the balance . In tomato sauce in particular , you may also <URL> ( specifically pectin ) by overcooking , which will make your sauce more watery . For vegetable-based sauces , this can often be prevented by boiling the sauce briefly to deactivate enzymes before simmering to reduce . Because of the flavor changes and loss during reduction , many cuisines around the world have a tradition of adding some " fresh " ingredients near the end of cooking and/or when serving , such as fresh herbs , a spritz of fresh juice , or some chopped fresher vegetables . The flavors we associate with " fresh " are often the most volatile ones , given off early when a food is first cut or cooked . Adding them at the end can give a depth of flavor that would n't be preserved in a long-cooked reduced sauce . If you do end up with an overreduced sauce , the flavor is often best salvaged by adding some flavorful new ingredients ( as in the Peterson quotation above ) or at least adding some more of the " base " back in , such as more stock in a reduced stock or more tomatoes/tomato paste in a tomato sauce rather than plain water . So , how do you minimize flavor loss when reducing ? It 's tough , but it depends on whether more problems are created in flavor loss through evaporation or through chemical changes in the remaining liquid ( like flavor molecules breaking down ) . In most cases , the evaporation is actually a greater concern when making a sauce , so simm
Some ingredients do not dissolve well in hot water - the starch swells and thickens , forming lumps that may have raw powder in them and are nasty . They need to be added to cold or lukewarm water and heated after they are dissolved . Other ingredients , most notably pasta , will partially dissolve in cold water making a thick gloppy soup . But if you add them to hot water they will " seal " ( in a way ) and stay together as they cook .

Substitute fresh garlic instead of garlic powder ?
I 'd say about 1 clove for every half-teaspoon of garlic powder . There is n't going to be anything particularly scientific about this , since garlic cloves vary in size , strength and flavor but that will be in the ballpark .
You could do both . Fresh , you already know . If it is smoked , sautee in a little oil , then remove . The oil took on the flavor , so then you can add back the sausage at the end .
The only difference between the two is that puree has a little more liquid . You should add more puree than the recipe calls for paste to compensate for it being more dilute . In some recipes , the extra liquid could be a problem , however , I do n't think it will make any difference in pad thai in the quantities that it is used .
In general the FDA recommends that you consume leftovers within 3-5 days ( See their website for specific foods ) . In this case , I do n't think the garlic is what 's holding you back . While garlic and herb infused oils do present some botulism risk , I think what they are getting at is the can of preserved garlic you 've had in the fridge for 9 months .
It will produce the same effect , however it might alter the taste ( depending on the type of beer ) , and will almost certainly alter the color of the final product , as beer contains sugars that will increase browning .
If you cut it with a knife , you 'll tend to get a very smooth surface . If you tear it open , whether by hand or with the aid of a fork , it 'll tend to break on more natural places in the crumb , giving a bit rougher surface . When toasted , that tends to result in more contrast of texture - the bits sticking up will brown more and get crunchier .
When both are used , the fresh yeast is for " added flavor " , the dry for leavening power . Another author who does this is Nancy Silverton . - Some bakers believe that fresh yeast ( a.k.a. cake yeast or wet yeast ) gives a more yeasty flavor to the final product . I do n't think it does . It 's also more perishable , ( sometimes ) more expensive , more difficult to find ( and when you do , it may be near its expiration ) , more challenging to use , and less reliable ( re : reproducible outcome ) . When I encounter a recipe that calls for it , I convert to instant yeast using this old , but reliable chart : <URL> If you <URL> , you 'll find more information ( that may or may not be reliable ) .
Oxtail would be your most likely substitute , but you have indicated you can not obtain it . The next best choice ( of those widely available ) is probably chuck , which is the shoulder muscle , and is well worked and flavored . It requires low and slow cooking for best results , much like shanks and tail do . Some stores -- even the chain grocery stores -- will special order for you if you ask them to , so you might be able to get shank . Depending on where you live , you may also try butchers at farmers ' markets , Dutch markets , or similar .
Store cocoa powder in a dark , cool , dry place , sealed against vermin . Dark and cool both slow the process by which volatiles ( i.e. , flavor ) degrade . That said , do n't keep it in the fridge or freezer unless sealed airtight , because both types of chill-chests are relatively humid environments . Humidity promotes mold , even on cocoa . By the way , for future reference : When buying cocoa powder , note the manufacturer 's suggested use-by date . Cocoa powder should last about three years , properly stored . If the use-by date is much less than that , look for another container .
From a purist perspective , cabbage is fairly important to the recognizability of the dish by that name ( as well as the pickled matchstick-cut ginger ) . Additional ingredients beyond those two are far more substitutable ( at least from common Japanese perspective ) ; the cabbage actually contributes a fair amount of flavor to an otherwise unremarkable dish . In fact , the presence of a mere two leaves suggests to me this is a pretty small portion . So here 's a " how to avoid substituting " answer , followed by a how to substitute answer . Cabbage tends to survive a good 2 weeks in the refrigerator , so I would n't fret about it too much . It also makes a good garnish , shredded ; additionally , it was super trendy for a few years for izakaya in Japan to serve raw cabbage with miso paste ( sometimes sweetened ) . I know many shops that will even sell a half a head ( in Japan it 's easy to buy even a quarter head of cabbage ) , or you may find a small package of pre-chopped , unseasoned coleslaw mix , which typically contains cabbage and carrots . Finally , cabbage makes an excellent foundation for a vegetarian soup stock , so it 's great way of making sure any surplus does n't go to waste . The only substitutes somewhat consistent with the style of the dish are other variations of cabbage ( bok choy , napa cabbage , possibly kimchi ) or certain crispy roots like kohlrabi . But frankly , those steer the dish into a non-Japanese style of pan-fried noodles . Not that there 's anything wrong with that , but the texture and flavor differences are fairly pronounced . In a pinch , we 've made these substitutions in my home , but in that case it was more about using up available ingredients , rather than trying to find an alternative .
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
Possible reasons : Horrible temperature control - this is simply a problem of cheap construction . One could theoretically build an excellent toaster oven with precise temperature control , but why would you ? Low thermal mass - If you get an oven to 400F and open it for long enough to put in food , the result is an oven at very slightly less than 400F , and which will quickly return to 400F . Do that with a toaster oven , and who knows what temperature you 'll get , or how quickly it will get to your desired temperature ( if ever , see # 1 ) . This is not a slam at toaster ovens , this is just due to them being approximately 2 % of the volume of a standard oven . Closeness to elements . It 's easy for toaster ovens interiors to vary by nearly 50F from middle to edge , simply based on distance to elements Now do n't get me wrong , I once made some kickin ' Oysters Rockefeller in a toaster oven , when I thought that they would be the difference between serving an appetizer and being allowed to serve breakfast the next morning ( wink , wink ) . If you know what you 're doing , and watch carefully and continually , a toaster oven can be an excellent source of high ( ish ) direct heat . But they are extremely difficult to control , and extremely unforgiving of errors . I ca n't think of a circumstance where a toaster oven would be my first choice of cooking tool ( and that includes microwave , campfire , plumber 's blowtorch ) .
Garlic flavors are soluble in oil , simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well . I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes . Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal . How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste . 5 tbsp of rice is n't much , for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough . With the garlic I grow I 'd add a few slices from a clove at most . Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards , The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain .
I 've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses . Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer . You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1 , but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness . Increasing the amount of instant coffee , however , would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want . Also , instant coffee takes longer to dissolve , so it needs to be added straight to a liquid . There 's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes , such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes , because the recipe has no water in it in the first place . In the rare recipes where there is water , you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water + espresso powder , and this would likely work fairly well . So , summing up : there 's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I 've found with some significant experimentation . Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me .
It 's not so much the taste as the texture . If they have n't been sauted first , the onions stay relatively crunchy during the rest of the cooking . The same is true of the garlic , but you 'd usually have cut the garlic into much smaller pieces so it does n't take as long to soften up , hence kicking the onion off first and adding the garlic a bit later .
The reason for turning the food when baking is so the side that is in contact with the pan can get hit by the hot air . In the case of turning on the bake and then turning on the broil , you would still have the medium of what ever your food is sitting in . If you are willing to elevated your food above a drip pan , turn on just the bottom heating coil ( if possible ) , and set the food directly on the rack you could eliminate the need of turning halfway through the process .
Whether or not it 's a good idea is subjective , but the Chinese seem to break that rule a lot ! For example , Northeastern Chinese sweet and sour pork ( guō bāo ròu ) is <URL> . The Sichuan classic twice cooked pork ( huí guō ròu ) calls for boiling the pork with ginger . A <URL> condiment for beef dishes/sauces is <URL> . Perhaps this saying is associated with a specific Chinese regional cuisine ?
Yes , you do n't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things , but it also means that you do n't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink , which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans , as they 'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly ( at least , compared to something of the same material , such as a cast iron skillet ) More importantly , in my opinion , is that without the sides , you do n't hold in moist air , so when cooking things like hash browns , you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them .
Garlic will spoil faster in the fridge actually . I do n't know how long it will last in the fridge , but I understand that it lasts longer if you leave it in a cool , dark , dry storage . I believe one reason is that your fridge is generally too humid . In my experience , garlic kept in the fridge is also more likely to develop mould ( goes soft , and dark discolouration ) . I keep mine in a ceramic thing in one of my cupboards . It lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on the garlic ( probably how long it sat before getting to my kitchen ) . If you store it like that , garlic that goes " bad " will usually start to sprout ( green shoots , will come through the top .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .

How do you properly soak and cook barley ?
You probably misread the recipe . It 's suggested that dry beans soak overnight so that they cook in a reasonable amount of time the next day ( unless you use a pressure cooker . ) There is no need to soak barley , pearled or not . It 's my guess that you mistook the bean soaking for barley in the recipe . That , or it 's a typo .
I have had the same issue when cooking lots of quesadillas , and have found the following combination of techniques to work quite well . The obvious answer has been hit upon already , lower the heat . But I think that 's missing an important aspect of the issue . What 's happening is most likely that you are turning on the heat and then cooking your first omelet before the pan has actually reached temperature . Depending on the type of pan , it can take up to 5 mins for the pan to reach temperature . So , as you continue to cook , the pan is getting closer to temperature . Of course , each time you add more cold egg , the temp decreases again . So your heat is too hot , but it does n't really become apparent until the last omelet . Rather than just starting at a lower temperature though , start at the same temp you tried and then turn down the temperature as you continue to cook . The pan can also heat rapidly between omelets . Take the pan off the heat , swirl your butter or oil through it , add the egg , and then put it back on the heat . If it seems really hot when you add the egg , you can cook it for a second with just the radiant heat of the pan before returning to the burner . This will stop the pan from getting too hot between omelets .
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
Topside is quite a tough cut , so I 'd tend towards a longer cooking time ; as ' low and slow ' as possible , really . With other meats , escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts , like chicken breast or pork tenderloin , which would be cooked relatively quickly , so I 'm surprised your recipes call for topside .
The only real bacterial problem you have to worry about with steak is e. coli , which lives on the outside . Since even in a blue application the outside is cooked sufficiently to kill any bacteria , you should be fine . ( Presuming you are using fresh steak , naturally ) . For blue : get a pan screaming -- and I mean screaming -- hot . Toss the steak in to sear , flip to sear the other side . Do edges if needed . Serve immediately . For rare , just do the steak in a normal pan or grill , flip once , about two minutes per side ( less if the steak is very thin ) . For both blue and rare applications you will want steaks that are on the thick side , and with not much marbling ( intramuscular fat ) , as the short cooking time wo n't melt the fats . I suggest tenderloin/filet .
I 've been reviewing old family recipes , and I 've seen pickled onions called for in some soup , stew , and casserole recipes as an accent ; this may or may not be because my foremothers grew and canned loads of onions . It 's worth an experiment or two , I think !
Use <URL> . It will handle considerably higher temperatures without burning/smoking .
In most cases , curdling occurs because proteins in the sauce are denatured and bind up with each other forming clumps . In cooking , proteins are denatured by excessive heat , acid , salt , or enzymes . Heat and acid are the usual culprits for me . For example , when making a hollandaise sauce - the egg yolks are slowly cooked to allow them to set . In most recipes the lemon juice is added later . If the sauce is heated too abruptly or too high then the egg proteins will curdle . To prevent curdling you have a few options - Do n't expose the sauce to as much heat . Be careful to not overcook egg rich sauces . If possible add the protein rich ingredient later in the process - for example adding yogurt to a sauce just before serving . Heat the sauce gently . Heating too fast will also make proteins denature . Many sauces are cooked in a double boiler - not to keep the sauce from overheating but to ensure that it heats gently . Do n't expose the proteins to too much salt or acid . Dropping a couple tablespoons of lemon juice into warm milk is a recipe for paneer not sauce . Take out some insurance . Proteins bind with each other after denaturing when there are a large quantity of similar molecules all together . One solution then is to introduce a lot of dissimilar molecules that will interfere with the protein 's ability to bind to itself . Common candidates for this are starch or fat . It is difficult ( but not impossible ) to curdle the milk protein in cream based sauces with just heat because the high concentration of milk fat gets in the way . This is why reduction sauces can add cream to a very hot liquid and let it reduce . However , adding acid and heat can still be enough to curdle so be careful if your reduction sauce is very acidic . Many otherwise fragile sauce recipes will call for a little bit of corn starch as an insurance policy . In the related question that you posted - yogurt sauces are particularly susceptible to this because low-fat yogurt is very high in protein and low in fat , and starch .
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .
Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the ( often hot ) food . If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid , you 'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch . It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing . You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess ( unflavored ) water from the exterior . Otherwise , each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water , which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up , and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body .
So <URL> and <URL> suggest that there are 3 kinds of rinds . Summary below : Bloomy : Appears white , soft , maybe fuzzy . Can also be reddish/brownish . Comes on softer cheeses that have a more custard-like flavor . Formed by a spray of penicillium candidum before aging . Edible , but the flavor changes and may taste ammoniated over time ( consume so long as it 's palatable ) Washed : Color ranges from pinkish red to orange or brown . Caused by bathing the cheese in some kind of solution , be it a salty brine , beer , brandy , wine or some other alcohol . Contributes to the flavor in some cheeses , and tastes unpleasant in others . Natural : Formed by letting the cheese age on its own , drying out and growing whatever molds might be present in the cheese or air . Tends to have a concentrated flavor of the cheese , but may not be palatable . Examples : Stilton , Montgomery Cheddar , Parmigiano-Reggiano . Sometimes comes under a cloth cover . Should be edible , minus the cloth . Additionally , there are two other possibilities No Rind : There should be no guessing here . You 've probably had cheeses with no rind ... because they might come in a container . Ricotta , fresh mozzarella , and creme fraiche come to mind . Wax/Twig/Cloth : Inedible . Should be discarded My personal takeaway from this quick research is that I should learn to distinguish artificial covers ( cloth/wax ) from rinds . It seems like those that separate from the cheese will either be an artificial cover or an old rind , both of which are undesirable . If it 's indeed a rind , then I 'd taste it , both alone and with the cheese , to determine if it 's palatable . For Parmigiano-Reggiano specifically , I 've read that it goes well in soup . Perhaps this is because it 's unpalatable-y hard , but still contains the concentrated flavor . TLDR : look for cloth/wax . If none , is it tasty ? Does it feel good in the mouth ?
There are a few factors that could effect this : 1 ) How the meat is cooked and how lean or fatty it is . If you overcook the meat ( although I doubt that you would ! ) or if it 's leaner or fattier . If its a fattier meat add say an extra 2 tbsps or so of sauce and if it 's leaner ( or overcooked ) I would add a tbsp or so less of sauce . 2 ) The viscosity and composition of the sauce . If it 's a white wine sauce ( thinner , less rich ) you would want to add more , however if it 's a hollondaise sauce ( thicker , richer ) you may want less . 3 ) Opinion , some people like more sauce , some people like less . It may depend on the type of sauce which you may want more or less of . Saying this I would say around 4 tbsp of sauce , then account for the additions and your own personal preference . Any more sauce and it may become swamped , any less and you will not have enough sauce to taste or keep the meat moist . It is a very subjective subject so do keep that in mind .
This is absolutely fine , especially if the eggs are pasteurised . I 've seen plenty of recipes that have raw egg in them that say it ; s fine to freeze them . You can even freeze eggs ( that have been mixed up a little ) for up to three months . So yes , I 'd say freeze it as soon as possible . Also , if you were concerned about freezing the quinoa that will fine as well ( a lot of people do n't know you can store grains in the freezer ) . Enjoy !
Take them to a professional . Nothing you can affordably buy in your home will work well . Personally , I do n't buy quality serrated knives . I buy cheap and replace when dull . Only my normal blades are quality , and these I have sharpened yearly .
If you want to turn your cold butter spreadable quickly , patience is about your only option . You can try microwaving it very briefly , and maybe on the " defrost " setting , but you run a strong risk of melting it too much . If I 'm thinking of the same thing you are , a butter conditioner is really just a unit that allows you to keep your butter in the fridge but still keep it closer to room temp -- so that 's more about storage than turning hard butter into spreadable butter on the spot . A storage option that allows you to keep your butter fresh for a pretty long period , but still leave it out on the counter so it 's soft , is a butter bell . You can look them up online -- many shops have them . It 's basically an inverted cup that sits inside a larger one with a little water at the bottom . The butter is packed into the inverted cup and stays put when you place the cup so the edges are under the water in the other cup . The water keeps air out so the butter stays fresh even at room temperature . You could do the same thing by mashing a bunch of butter into a teacup , then setting it upside down in a saucer full of water . If it 's too hot in your house , though , the butter will slip out of the inverted cup , so I mostly only use our butter bell in the winter . One thing to note about butter itself : Some butters are more spreadable at cooler temperatures . The Irish and French butters we can get here are much closer to spreadable at refrigerator temperatures than the regular US supermarket brands . I 'm not sure what the difference is , though .
I do n't know how you would describe the flavor of bay -- I would call it a subtle savoriness , with a complex aroma . Bay is very tough -- almost sharp . It is generally not eaten directly . Instead , the whole leaf ( or several whole leaves ) are put into a dish or sauce to cook with it , then removed prior to service . The shortest recipe I have for using bay is in a rice pilaf while it cooks , which is 15-30 minutes depending . I am not aware of an upper time limit . Here is a Miami Herald article offering some other perspectives on using bay leaves : <URL> As they Herald points out , many folks prefer Turkish bay rather than California bay , because it has a more complex , subtle flavor . ... I believe custard in Britain had bay as a traditional ingredient -- you might make a custard with a single bay leaf to get some sense of what it tastes like without lots of competing strong flavors . ... Update : Serious Eats Food Lab has just published an article , <URL> with lots of good information that may be of interest .

With thin cuts of meat ( like chicken breast or a steak ) , you want to make sure you put the thermometer in to the thin side of the meat so that the whole thermometer goes in to the meat , rather than putting it in through the " top " so that only a little of the thermometer is in the meat . If you 're putting it in the top , you can get wildly inaccurate temperatures . Also make sure that the thermometer is n't touching a pan , exposed to air , or touching a bone . Any of those can have a negative effect . Also , you only need to cook chicken to 74C / 165F . That may be part of the problem in your case . You may also want to check that your thermometer is accurate . You can stick it in boiling water to check that it reads 100C / 212F ( assuming of course it goes up that high ) .
<URL> . For both Camembert and Brie . Next time do n't buy it ...
Nuke or boil the spuds first to get them 75 % to 90 % done before they hit the grill I would n't use foil either , they grill much nicer bare skinned . Root vegetables suck up the smoke and get tasty dark patches from the grill , just keep and eye on them , and turn as needed

How can vanilla essence and vanilla extract be used interchangeably ?
Imitation vanilla extract is meant to be used in place of the real stuff , and most recipes probably assume you 're using the fake stuff anyway , so you would use 1 tsp . You only need to adjust the amount if you 're using something like twofold ( 2x ) extract .
The USDA recommends storing hard boiled eggs , whether peeled or not , for 1 week . I personally have kept &amp; eaten them after 2-3 weeks . I have also cracked one open that was no longer edible &amp; believe me - You will know when that happens ! The egg will will smell rotten &amp; you will have no question as to whether or not to eat it ! Some additional Info on storing eggs : Eggs should be stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees F , mainly to reduce the chances that any bacteria on the shell will multiply and cause a risk of illness . Buy refrigerated eggs and store them in the refrigerator as soon as your get home . However , even under refrigeration , eggs slowly lose carbon dioxide , which enlarges the size of the air cell and causes the yolk to flatten and the white to spread . Fresh Egg - Refrigerated raw shell eggs will keep without significant quality loss for about 4 - 5 weeks beyond the " sell by " date or about 3 weeks after you bring them home . Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days Fresh egg yolks ( unbroken and covered with water ) - 2 to 4 days Deviled eggs - 2 to 3 days Leftover egg dishes - 3 to 4 days
This is not a precise term , you can not go and buy " moist " and " dry " vanilla beans . But the pods can be prepared to different degrees of dryness , similar to prunes . And the ones with more remaining moisture have more taste and are generally higher quality . This is why they specify it . If you only have access to dry pods , I will still try out the recipe with them , just change the source for the next buy . Regarding the comment above , I have never had vanilla beans with a grade denoted on the packaging . But I have had both moist and dry ones , so it is n't a case of only one grade being marketed to end users . It is surely better if you can distinguish them based on some kind of grading , but chances are , you wo n't know what grade you are buying .
I would use it for anything other than deep frying or high temperature frying . It would be great for anything that requires oil but not cooking , like hummus .
UHT ( Ultra High Temperature ) processing kills all the pathogens in the milk , so it can be conserved for a long time . However to make yogurt you add bacteria ( lactobacillus ) , so if there are n't other microorganism it should be even better .
It should n't be a problem , since their cooking times are similar .
Bourbon , <URL> is aged in a fresh oak barrel . The oak heartwood naturally contains aromatic compounds including ( you guessed it ) vanillin -- the primary flavor component of vanilla itself . But beyond the already-present aromatics , the wood is further treated to produce even more flavor . About 20 % of the oak 's mass is made of lignins . When exposed to temperatures of 750 ° F the lignin breaks down to more aromatics including , once again , vanillin . Your bourbon barrel is charred in an open gas burner for 15 -- 45 seconds , making these flavors ready for extraction into your bourbon . The alcohol will then be able to further break down some of the solid mass and dissolve the aromatics . So bourbon is a good vanilla substitute because of the relatively high portion of vanillin that it contains
Practically all dairy starts with full fat milk , this is all that comes out of a cow . The process of cheesemaking centers around separating the curds from the whey ( except for making true ricotta , which is made from whey ) . The fat stays with the curds . So the fat content of your cheese goes sharply up compared to the liquid you started with , because you are throwing out most of the water , as well as some proteins and carbohydrates , but keeping all the fat . There are cheeses which start with cream . In theory , they can also be said to be started from milk , because cream itself is made from milk . In practice , if you want to make them at home , you will start with store-bought cream . As far as I 'm aware , it is not possible to make mascarpone or cream cheese when starting from milk . If there is a way , it would require a recipe different from the one starting from cream . So , if you have a recipe which asks for cream , you should follow it with cream and not with milk . Else , even if you manage to get the correct fat percentage , the ratio of proteins to fat or water to fat wo n't be right . But if you just have the milk and want to make any fresh cheese , you can make one of the many fresh cheeses which are not started with cream . Tvorog , paneer and quark are all milk based fresh cheeses , and delicious in their own right .
Personally the only way I 've ever achieved a good suspension of vanilla in my Brûlée 's is by cooking the custard over a bain-marie until thick and ... custard like . Once it 's nice and thick I 'll then pour it into my molds and then bake them for 10-15 min at around 110 ° c just to finish off . Be very careful not to over cook them the last thing you want , after all that stirring over the bain-marie , is curdled eggs . The extra thickness of your custard helps stop the vanilla seeds sinking to the bottom . However , you will still get a little sink-age . The trick for Pannacotta , is to stir them as they begin to set . Or to whip them after they have set and then stick them back in their molds and chill again . This also helps make your Pannacotta lighter and aerated .
The vanilla chapter of Ian Hemphill 's " Spice and Herb Bible " says , Vanilla is also delicious in savory cooking because it is not overtly sweet . An innovative Mauritian restaurant in Sydney served a delicious vanilla chicken [ ... ] It was aromatic delicate and beautifully balanced . The same book has a recipe for Vanilla Salmon Salad where vanilla seeds are scraped into the dressing . I did a quick taste test using vanilla extract with various savory things from my fridge . Here are the results : Cheese : tasted fine , but I would n't call it a taste sensation ; Vegeburger : nasty combination ; I think the leeks in the burger were a problem ; Avocado : actually quite a nice combination ; Roasted aubergine : not bad ; Tomato : fine ; Savory omelet : not good ; onions do n't seem to work with vanilla extract ; Baked beans in tomato sauce : very nice . Note that using vanilla extract and a vanilla bean to flavor a dish are not the same thing . There is an amount of alcohol in the vanilla extract I used ( bourbon ) and this may completely invalidate the test . Having said that , the first indications are that alliums ( onions , leeks , garlic etc ) do n't go with vanilla . So onion soup may not be a good plan . And since curry generally contains plenty of onion and garlic , I 'm skeptical about using it there too . Turning to the question of whether vanilla and vanillin become dangerous when heated , the answer is almost certainly no . That does n't mean that heating vanilla is inconsequential . Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " mentions that vanilla beans contain more than 200 volatile compounds and notes , Prepared vanilla extracts [ ... ] are best added toward the end of cooking ; any period of time spent at a high temperature causes aroma loss . On the other hand , heating vanillin at normal cooking temperatures ( i.e. normal for soup and curry ) is not a problem . Its <URL> . As another answer mentions , vanilla has a more complex taste to pure vanillin . Most of what you will read comparing the two will be very much in favor of using real vanilla beans in cooking . Instead of repeating this advice , I 'm reminded of having read that in a Cook 's Illustrated <URL> to synthetic vanillin , the artificial flavoring came out on top . It 's probably not be enough to conclude that vanillin tastes better than vanilla but may encourage you to forge ahead if vanillin is all you can afford . Update : Having read @papin 's suggestion that you may need to caramelize the onions , I just did a quick taste test with rostad lök ( not sure how it translates from Swedish , the literal translation is toasted onion ) . It tasted slightly better but still not great . Again , I 'm using vanilla extract so my taste test is not necessarily valid .
Disclaimer : I 've never tried to make a ganache with olive oil , so take that into consideration as you read the following . First , I have to assume that you 're trying to use olive oil to replace the cream that 's normally used in making ganache , perhaps to make a non-dairy ganache . If that 's not right , please clarify your question . Ganache is essentially an emulsion of cocoa butter ( usually from chocolate ) and cream , plus vanilla and/or other flavorings , that is allowed to cool to the point where the cocoa butter solidifies . It 's the solidified cocoa butter that gives ganache it 's firm texture . The greater the ratio of cocoa butter to cream , the firmer the ganache will be . If you want to replace the cream , you 'll need to make sure that you replace all the components that have an effect on the emulsion . Harold McGee 's <URL> explains the structure of ganache : The continuous phase of this mixture , the portion that permeates it , is a syrup made from the cream 's water and the chocolate 's sugar . Suspended in the syrup are the milk fat globules from the cream , and cocoa butter droplets and solid cocoa particles from the chocolate . He does n't say it , but I 'd guess that the milk proteins from the cream might act as emulsifiers to help stabilize the emulsion , much as they do with <URL> . The melting point of olive oil is obviously different from that of butterfat , but since you heat the cream in order to make ganache anyway , olive oil might still work . Given what McGee says , you 'll need to make sure that you add an appropriate amount of water so that there 's enough syrup to suspend the butterfat , cocoa butter , and solids . How much is an appropriate amount ? Cream is usually 20-40 % butterfat , so starting with a 1 part oil for 2 parts water seems reasonable . You might also need to add something that 'll act as an emulsifier , like lecithin .
The key issue is getting the contents of each jar up to the requisite temperature for the necessary time , all the way through to the center of the jars . It would be conceivably possible to use steaming to do so , if the requisite controlled temperatures and times could be regulated , and appropriate recipes developed . However , according to the USDA as reported at the <URL> : Steam canners are not recommended because processing times for use with current models have not been adequately researched . Because steam canners do not heat foods in the same manner as boiling-water canners , their use with boiling-water process times may result in spoilage . If purpose built steam canners are not recommended , I would strongly urge you not to improvise with other devices . You should only use recipes and methods for canning that come from highly reputable sources , such as a University Extension .
In sum : YES , sugar DOES really help to extract fruit flavors . The answer quoted in the edit does NOT imply that " absorption is slowed down " in general . It merely states that in a sugar solution , sugar will generally not move out of fruit ; it does n't say anything about what else happens . Osmosis is simply a process by which the stuff on both sides of a barrier tries to come to equilibrium . Increasing sugar content in a solution will only decrease the amount of sugar that comes out of the fruit , but it will often simultaneously increase the water that diffuses out ( along with many things dissolved in that water , like fruit flavors ) . In other words , in a plain water solution , sugar will diffuse out of fruit to raise the water 's sugar concentration . However , in most cases when a sugar solution is used , it is deliberately higher in concentration than the sugar content within the fruit cells ( as in the strawberry example mentioned in the question , where there is basically no water at first outside the fruit , so water is forced out to bring the system into better equilibrium ) . Sugar is very <URL> , which basically means it attracts water . If the sugar solution has a higher sugar content than the moisture within the fruit cells ( as is true in most recipes using this technique ) , water will diffuse out of the fruit . Anything that is water-soluble , such as various flavor components , will come along with it to some extent . Meanwhile , sugar will also be forced into the fruit , changing its texture -- when done in excess over a period of time , such a process can actually preserve the fruit by lowering the water content substantially ( driving it out into the solution ) while raising the internal sugar content of the fruit , resulting in <URL> . You may note that candied fruit generally lacks many of the flavors of fresh fruit . This is because many flavor components were extracted along with the water by the sugar solution . Regarding questions that were raised in comments , the same process occurs with alcohol in a solution . There 's almost no alcohol inside the fruit , so alcohol 's presence outside the fruit will force water out of the fruit , carrying flavors along with it . Alcohol also tends to dissolve certain flavor components that water does n't dissolve as well , so it will gather different sets of flavors than water alone . Note also that different flavor components will come out of the interaction of this osmosis process with the cell membrane compared to , say , simply crushing the fruit , again partly because some flavor molecules are more soluble in alcohol .
If you look here , at the last paragraph of <URL> , he gives you a fairly easy way of removing the air from a plastic bag without a vacuum . Put your food in the bag and then submerge the bag in water just to the zip . The pressure will expel all the air . Then zip the bag up as you pull the closed portion underwater . This gets results comparable with a home vacuum sealer , I think , with the added benefit that you can include liquids easily . While I would n't consider myself an expert on this topic , I would n't fill the bag with anything you would n't want to marinate your meat in .
Like Bob said , surely boiling some noodles is way less of a bother than breaking out the pasta machine ? If you really want to make fresh pasta , I do n't see any reason you could n't use it for lasagna without boiling it - the reason one boils dry noodles is because it 's hard to get them to soften in the time it takes to bake the lasagna . But just like when cooking fresh noodles , you need to be careful not to overcook it , so make sure all your fillings are fully cooked before you start layering . It also should be perfectly fine to not cut the noodles into strips - the reason dried noodles come that way is for easier handling . It is possible to make lasagna using dried lasagna noodles without boiling them first , but you need to add more water and bake it longer . A search for " no-boil lasagna " will turn up scores of recipes .
I do n't want to disappoint you , but the sad truth is that extra virgin olive oil is unsuitable for all the cooking methods you mention . When you heat any oil past its smoking point it starts to deteriorate and can even become dangerous . Olive oil , extra virgin in particular , has a lower smoking point than most other oils . In fact , you will be better off with an olive oil of lesser quality . Such an oil will have been processed and thus purified , increasing its smoking point . You may think that butter is unhealthy , but at high temperatures it will actually withstand the heat better than extra virgin olive oil . Good oils for the purposes you mention are canola oil , sunflower oil , peanut oil , and grapeseed oil .
I 've never heard that . I have picked end of season tomatoes when they were green and let them ripen and used them for any purpose that I would normally use ripe tomatoes . And I know others who do also . It 's much better than losing them to a frost or to animals . If there is any downside , it would be that they might not be as flavorful as vine-ripened , but that still beats losing them . Also consider that most of what we get in grocery stores come from large farms where they are picked green . Just for the sake of saying it , many stores now also sell vine-ripened or locally grown tomatoes but they do cost more .
I did this as an experiment last month , because I wanted a marble cake . The part that I wanted chocolate , I just swapped out a half-cup of the flour for cocoa . I should note , however , that while it tasted great , it made a denser , slightly drier cake than did the white cake batter . Next time , I plan to add a couple of teaspoons of grapeseed oil and some extra baking powder to counteract that problem .
Imitation vanilla extract is meant to be used in place of the real stuff , and most recipes probably assume you 're using the fake stuff anyway , so you would use 1 tsp . You only need to adjust the amount if you 're using something like twofold ( 2x ) extract .
You could fold with a heat-safe silicone spatula , that will let you reach the whole surface of the pan so you do n't get scorching , without introducing so many bubbles . Or if you happen to have a vacuum machine , put your sauce in a bag after you make it and vacuum out all of the air . Voila , bubbles gone .

Will a pineapple marinade reduce a beef roast to paste ?
Pineapple contains <URL> , which is " one of the most popular proteases to use for meat tenderizing . " Since it 's sold as a meat tenderizer , I 'd say it really just depends on how long you marinate with it -- it 's possible to over-tenderize something . <URL> warns about over marinating , and mentions recommended times : The same process that tenderizes steak can also break it down into mush if you marinate it too long in the pineapple , and it 'll start distorting the meat 's color and taste . For cuts thinner than 1 inch , stick to about 10 to 15 minutes of soak time ; for moderately thick steaks of 1 to 1 1/2 inches , marinate for roughly 15 to 20 minutes ; and for thicker steaks , marinate for about 30 minutes .
Making a stew without browning is relatively safe since the prolonged cooking should kill off most pathogens . This is especially true if you are careful about your kitchen cleanliness and cut the meat down from a larger piece yourself instead of buying pre-cut " stew meat " or ground meat . Whole cuts of meat such as steaks or roasts usually only have E. coli on the surface , which makes the E. coli easier to kill by cooking . When the meat is ground or mechanically tenderized , E. coli on the surface can be transferred to the inside of the meat . This is why ground meat and mechanically tenderized meat are more likely to cause illness than whole cuts of meat . Like ground meats , prepackaged " stew meat " can contain tissues from multiple individual animals , thereby increasing the chance that there is E. coli present in the package . Each additional surface is another place for E. coli to grow while that package is sitting at the store or in your fridge . Browning , however contributes a significant amount of flavor to the stew , which will be lost . The good news is that you <URL> ... One alternative that I use is to buy the quantity of meat I plan to use as a whole roast ( instead of pre-cut " stew meat " ) then sear the entire roast before cutting it down to stew-size chunks . You get the flavor benefit of the Maillard browning with less time spent browning little pieces and less overcooked meat . If you use a lidless , oven braise technique , as suggested in Harold McGee 's On Food and Cooking , you will get further browning on any pieces that are n't totally submerged as well as flavor concentration from evaporation .

Well , at least here in germany it really is common to make liverwurst with beef liver ( or more often and expensive : calf liver ) . So go ahead - you really wo n't regret it ! Taken the percentage of actual liver in liverwurst you wo n't taste any difference , though I 'd say beef liver tastes better .
I generally put garlic , rosemary , and thyme in the pan for a roast . As the meat juices and butter flow into the pan , they make a wonderful infusion of flavour that is well worth bathing the roast in . I 'm all for it - I feel the roasts I 've made and basted are better than the ones I did n't baste . That said , I have n't done any double-blind studies .
Yes you will damage plastic . At the very least , you will scratch them . At worst , you will get plastic dust in your food . Do n't do it . If you do n't believe me , take empty plastic bowl ( one you do n't mind damaging ) and push pestle against it 's wall . You will see for yourself .
I believe it 's another name for the tenderloin . <URL> Also , if you check out this other fillet of beef recipe from the same show : <URL> You can see a much better picture of the meat . That one is clearly a tenderloin . So The Fillet Mignon is part of that technically ...
For the US crowd , silverside is the part of the round closest to sirloin , so it 's a working cut and fairly lean . In order to keep this juicy you 'll need to bard it , in other words add fat . I 'd do this by wrapping the whole thing up in streaky ( US style ) bacon and then sear it at high temperature to give it that crust before turning it down and continue the roasting at a lower temperature . So turn your oven up full-whack and let it get good and hot , then rub your roast with some salt , then into the oven for 20 minutes , then turn it down to 160 and roast it until it reaches 120F/50c . Remove and cover with foil , then let it rest for at least 30 minutes . If you do n't let it rest it wo n't get tender at all . In all honesty silverside is n't a cut I would roast , and I 've tried . It just too lean and has too much connective tissue to be tender . It does make a good braise though , which is what I 'd do with it .
In Indian cooking we usually add Ghee ( Clarified butter ) to reduce the heat of a chili pepper . Most Indian dishes , we would add a good heaping spoon of ghee before feeding little ones . This helps temper the heat but keeps the flavors alive so that the children get used to them and can gradually learn to eat hotter foods .
Almond paste is a finished product . It can be eaten without cooking . In fact , one of my favorite tart recipes is Julia Child 's " Pear and Almond Tart " from her Mastering the Art of French Cooking . The four parts of the tart ( crust , almond filling , poached pears and currant glaze ) are cooked separately and it is assembled without being baked afterwards . It uses a " frangipane " that cooks the eggs rather than leaving them raw as many almond pastes do . I do n't have a copy of the book to confirm but <URL> the correct version of the recipe . 1/2 cup almonds 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 3/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup flour 1 cup whole milk 3 tbs butter 2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp almond extract Heat oven to 350 degrees . Toast almonds until brown ( about 10 minutes ) , then pulverize in a bender , food processor , or with a mortar and pestle . Whisk egg and egg yolk in a large mixing bowl until combined . Gradually add sugar and beat until mixture is pale yellow -- about 3 minutes . Beat in the flour . Heat milk on the stove over moderate heat until it reaches the boiling point . Beat a small amount of milk into the egg mixture , to temper the eggs . Then pour in the rest of the milk and whisk vigorously . Pour milk mixture into a sauce pan and heat over moderate heat . Stir slowly , until mixture begins to thicken and coagulate into a stiff paste . Beat vigorously over low heat for 2-3 minutes to cook the flour . Off the heat add the butter , vanilla and almond extracts , and almonds . Let cool . To prevent a skin from forming , cover custard with buttered parchment paper . If you 're making the almond paste on your own , you might consider substituting this one for it . It 's really amazing and was hard to stop eating .
The difference between sweet and tart cherries is not so much the sweet , but more the tart . If you look at the nutrition information you 'll find that tart cherries have about 2/3 as much sugar as sweet , but twice as much Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) which is what gives them their tart flavor . With this in mind , most sweet cherry pie recipes include lemon juice , while tart cherry pies recipes do n't need the lemon juice for balance . Recipes for both type seem to use between 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar , so as Stephie says , " It 's mostly a matter of taste " From personal experience - I made 2 cherry pies using a tart cherry pie recipe , except substituting Bing cherries . I got more great reviews for those pies than you would believe . ( It might have something to do with the sweet tooth gene on that side of the family )
I have used a rice cooker lid as a replacement on an old crock pot . It has a small venting hole as you described . I have been using this lid for years now and have yet to have a dish dry out . The hole is just too small to let much water out .
Anything will cook in a rice cooker , eventually . You will need to experiment with the size of the meat chunks . When the meal is done cooking , take them out and see if they are cooked and at the correct temperature . If not , finish cooking them and cut them up smaller next time . What I would do however is cube the meat , sear it , and then throw it in to the cooker . You will end up with a better texture this way .
Because onions contain a lot of flavour compounds that we like , and which are synergistic with meats .
The salt in the cure inhibits bacterial growth ( particularly if the salt is one made for curing , and contains nitrates ) . So you should be warned that you are trading a few blood pressure points for enhanced risk of foodborne illness . Unfortunately , I think your options are rather limited -- either to keep the salt as-is , or forgo jerky in your diet .
To toast walnuts , pecans , pistachios , macadamias , and other nuts , follow the same procedure as for toasting almonds : spread them in a single layer on a baking pan . Bake at 325F until they are light brown and fragrant , about 5-10 minutes depending on the amount of nuts . Check the nuts frequently and stir them to ensure even toasting . Always cool your nuts before chopping them . Nuts have a great deal of oil that has been brought to surface by the heat , and the oil must be allowed to be reabsorbed , or the nuts could turn greasy during chopping .

Black bean paste is also incorporated into Asian cuisine , and has a similar flavor , although earthier . Add a little sugar , maybe a little ground cashew or peanuts for nuttiness . It wo n't be the same , but it should work well enough . Since black beans are more common , this may work well enough for you .
Kneading does two things . First it mixes all the ingredients uniformly . You have to do this no matter what , but you only really have to do it enough to mix the ingredients . If you keep kneading beyond the mixing stage , you are applying energy ( which equals heat ) to the yeast which makes it ferment , generating the tiny bubbles which make bread fluffy . The yeast will ferment on its own , but kneading just accelerates that process . Historically , dough was proved ( left in a hot humid place ) for about 18 hours allowing it to rise slowly in order to make bread . In 1961 a process was developed in England called the <URL> . Essentially you work the heck out of the dough with high-speed mixers . The extra few minutes of high energy mixing applies heat to the yeast , which dramatically reduces the fermentation period required , allowing you to make bread much more quickly ... at factory-type speeds . Factories can make bread in a couple of hours instead of having to prepare dough one day and bake it the next .
MSG has a flavor itself ; it tastes of " umami " , the savory , meaty flavor . This is because it 's made of <URL> ( or glutamate ) , with a little sodium ( less than salt ) . Glutamates are the compounds responsible for the basic umami taste , and they are found in high concentrations in kelp , cheeses , soy sauce , and oyster sauce . To the best of my knowledge , it 's not like salt , which is said to enhance existing flavors ; this would be more like cooking broccoli in bacon grease to impart a bacony flavor to the broccoli . Therefore , it depends heavily on the existing flavor profile of the food in question and the taste preferences of the person involved . If the person likes broccoli dunked in soy sauce , it might be worth a try .
It depends on the meat and how it 's cut . A ' solid ' uncut piece like a pork loin will take longer to marinade properly than if it was cut into thin strips for stir frying , for example - I 'd want to marinade the former at least 7-8 hours , while the latter could probably get away with 1 .
Topside is quite a tough cut , so I 'd tend towards a longer cooking time ; as ' low and slow ' as possible , really . With other meats , escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts , like chicken breast or pork tenderloin , which would be cooked relatively quickly , so I 'm surprised your recipes call for topside .

How can I speed up banana ripening ?
Bananas are imported unripe and then ripened in the country of sale . This ripening is achieved by forcing ethylene gas through the bananas in special pressurised rooms . Bananas naturally produce ethylene as they ripen , so you could just put them in a sealable plastic bag to contain that gas . Tomatoes also produce ethylene , so you could pop a couple of those in as well , but be aware that they 'll also ripen faster too .
In recipes , buttermilk brings liquid , some milk solids , some acid , and if it is not made from skim milk ( it is a cultured product ) , some fat . In a pinch , you can substitute approximately 1 cup milk with 1 tbl lemon juice or vinegar . For information on making your own cultured buttermilk , <URL> . It is made from milk and an active culture starter from commercial or previous buttermilk batches , much akin to making yogurt . Edit : As hinted in Fisher 's answer , for some applications , particularly quick breads and muffins , buttermilk can also be substituted one to one with yogurt or sour cream .
Corn starch only thickens when heated to 180 F , so it probably is not helping at all with your whipped cream . I live in the US , so I can not compare to whipped cream in the UK . Whipped cream for cake fillings is often beaten almost to the breaking point to make the foam as thick as possible . I assume you are whipping the cream sufficiently , and it still is n't getting as thick as you would like . If that is the case , you might try <URL> . The link is one of many I have found on a quick search , and it specifically calls for 35 % cream . This <URL> also has some interesting thoughts and advise . This <URL> also provides an interesting method of using creme fraiche .
Sounds like you want <URL> . If you search google you will undoubtedly find recipes for this abomination . It is designed to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the need for utensils . You did say taste and texture were n't important .
What I would suggest is rather than adding a syrup , to take some of your cooked beans , cook them a bit more , then liquify them in a blender . This should give you a thick sauce that tastes like the beans , therefore compliments them perfectly . You can then thicken them very slightly if the consistency is still too runny , be sparing with the flour though . In fact , you could probably make something satisfactory by simply using less thickener . If you have a pasty , sticky sauce it 's a classic symptom of too much thickener . Try making a roux with some butter and flour , cook it awhile for a dark roux which gives deeper color and more flavor . You can then add the roux in small amounts to your cooking liquid until you get the right consistency . If you are pressed for time and have some available a couple big spoons of refried beans may just do the trick too .
" Best " is subjective . The different choices of baking pans will effect texture and baking time . The more surface area the more crust and the faster the baking time . Recipes call for a bread pan simply because then it looks like bread and is easier to slice . As you noticed , it does require longer to bake . Muffin pans are also very popular because of the convenient shape and faster baking time . If you like the shape and texture of your bread in a baking dish then by all means keep using it . I wo n't criticize you for it .
Most bakers refer to this as a starter and it is extremely easy to keep up . You will need a plastic bag or a jar to keep it in , a cup of warm water , and some flour . You can either grow some wild yeast or add a particular strain to the growth solution depending what you are trying to do with the yeast . Once you do that , just leave it someplace warm but not over 100 degree F . Then once a day , you feed the yeast by removing half and adding back a half cup of flour and a half cup of water . Once it starts foaming remove to the fridge and remember to feed once a week . It will be with you for the rest of the your time on earth . Also , that half you take out when you feed it ? Makes a great gift to other baking or cooking friends . Also , if you devolop a dark smelly liquid , just stir it back in , it is normal and nothing to worry about .
Cut it in half before peeling , so that only the end is exposed . Wrap the exposed end with plastic wrap , and place in the refrigerator . The skin may darken , but that is okay . You should get a day or two easily . Or put all the half bananas in the freezer , and when you have enough , make banana muffins .
Most of the weight in fresh fruit is water , which has no calories . When you dry the fruit , the remainder is concentrated , so there are more calories in a given volume or weight . <URL> is a preservative with anti-microbial properties . The claim of 3.6 times the energy is specious .
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
" Completely " definitely is n't a standardized term ; however , since we 're talking about making ice cream here , the correct answer is going to be " as cold as possible without freezing " . When making ice cream , it 's important to get the mixture as cold as possible before you freeze it , especially if you 're not using an ice cream machine , so that you give it as little time as possible for ice crystals to form . If large ice crystals form , then you wo n't have ice cream , you 'll have ice . So get it all the way down to refrigerator temperature and work quickly when you take it back out of the fridge . It 'll be quicker and easier if you chill the bowl or receptacle first .
As a rule of thumb for a whole fish , and not a fillet - the gills should be bright red the skin/scales should be bright and shiny like metal this fish should n't really smell of anything except ' watery ' the flesh should rebound quickly when pressed the eyes should be bright and clear really fresh fish is also quite slimey to touch if it 's straight out of the water . I remember being quite surprised at this from my first fishing trip a few years back .
This is an art . Anyone who appreciates REAL tacos , can understand that this is not easy . God Bless anybody that can pull this off accurately ! I have it down to a science . I learned from my grandfather . His biggest secret was in the fork you use . We use cooking forks . 3 prong cooking forks ( most of the ones I see on google have two prongs ) . You can use regular forks too , but they arent made for cooking in high temp oil . First you must get the oil HOT . 350 atleast , preferably 400 degrees . Just before it starts smoking . You need really high oil heat . Once the oil is PLENTY hot , you hold a tortilla in one hand , and drop it in the oil halfway . It should be at 90 degrees , with your hand still holding the dry half of the tortilla . ( Note : keep your cooking fork ready for the next steps ) If your oil is hot enough , it will cook that half of the tortilla almost instantly . Let it cook until it hardens up , which should be less than a minute . Once the first half the bent tortilla is crisp , use the cooking fork to grab the tortilla half that is crisp and cooked . You will flip it here , putting the dry tortilla half ( that was in your hand ) into the oil , while the cooked half , sits above the oil with your fork . Now it should cook the other half of the taco shell . The art is using the fork well enough to create a gap at the base of the shell ( for meat or whatever you stuff with ) . And then flipping it and holding it with the fork while the other side crispens and finishes up . I would like to make a youtube video that shows this process , and it truly is an artform . Many people make great tacos but horrible tortilla shells . I grew up near Mexico , I was born 4 miles from Matamoros . I have seen my share of taco cooking , in the strangest of places . The best tacos Ive ever had use this method . And the best taco makers Ive ever seen wouldnt do this any other way ( by hand ) . It 's hard to do this without burning your hand ( s ) . Be careful . The dry tortilla absorbs the hot oil , even when your holding it over the grease in the first step . Youd be surprised how a corn tortilla will drink the oil right up to your hand . Give it practice . You will mess up a few tortillas . Dont worry about that , they make great quesadillas or nachos :)
Revised answer ( old answer removed due to accidentally swerving off-topic and to some extent containing incorrect information ) Even though ethylene biosynthesis happens throughout the banana most-likely none of it occurs in the stem itself as it contains a small percentage of the metabolically active tissue . There are n't as many studies that focus on the stem of the banana specifically as I imagine it 's not a very attractive topic , but the current-day findings that we have highly support the assumption of insignificant ethylene gas production ( or none at all ) in the banana stem and it 's why wrapping it will pose virtually no difference in the further ripening of a banana .

You said that you 're using deep pans to get the right shape for decorating . If you 're using something deeper than the recipe calls for , you should expect to have trouble . It will take longer to bake through , while the top and bottom overcook , and if you 've gone too far , the structure may not hold up as well during baking . You can probably get away with something 25-50 % taller than the recipe is meant for , baking longer at a lower temperature , but in general , you should really try to use the correct size pan , and make multiple layers if you want something taller . Wrong sized pans aside , reducing the temperature is definitely the best first thing to try . In pretty much all types of cooking , burning some parts before cooking others is a sign of too much heat . You should also check the temperature of your oven . Ovens thermostats can easily be significantly off . If you 're having this problem with multiple recipes , it 's plausible that yours is too hot . Depending on the source of your recipe , it 's also possible that whoever wrote it was compensating for a too-cold oven . Also , make sure that the cake is centered in the oven . The top of the oven is hotter , and too high a rack can definitely cause overbrowning on the top . Of course , if you lower it too much , you may overcook the bottom . Shielding the top with foil is also very effective . If it 's just that this is a particularly sensitive cake , I 'd definitely try loosely covering with foil . Protecting the pie crusts is such a common version of this that you can buy pie shields , rings of metal to cover just the outside edge . I would n't try to turn your oven into a steam oven for this ; steaming will affect the texture of the surface of the cake .
If you 're simmering it in a decent amount of liquid for a while , like curry , the slimy stuff ( mucilage ) will all go out into the curry and end up just thickening it . The okra itself wo n't be slimy . This is one of the traditional ways to thicken gumbo ! Even just stewed okra , with a decent amount of tomatoey goop , usually is n't very slimy .
Just look out for artificial flavorings ; a lot of bacon comes with artificial " hickory " or " maple " flavors , which are disgusting and often taste like chemicals . The better bacon wo n't include such things . Nitrate-free bacon is important if you 're sensitive to nitrates . The fat content is more of a matter of taste than a hard-and-fast rule ; personally , I like a fair amount of fat because I like to cook other things in the rendered fat ! Same for the thickness . If you like very crispy bacon , you may want your bacon slightly thinner than the " thick-cut " styles that command a price premium .
It 's caused by the high amount of potassium in the banana . Microwaves react with metals , bouncing off and cause arcing . You can even create a cool light show by putting a raw peeled banana in the microwave . Do n't worry , it wo n't explode , but it will make a mess , it 's also harmless . This can also happen in some <URL> depending on the soil conditions they grew in . As noted in the linked article , other high concentrations of metals such as magnesium , iron , and zinc can be the responsible mineral . Momentary brief sparking is harmless and wo n't harm your microwave , but the USDA recommends turning off your microwave if you see sparks nonetheless . If it does start a fire , unless it 's a very small fire , do not open your microwave door . The safest thing is to turn off the microwave and let the fire burn itself out by consuming all the oxygen . Opening the door could create a dangerous backdraft induced fireball . Edit : Found a <URL> . See Also : <URL> <URL>
Try peeling the asparagus . This would work better with <URL> . Since the outer skin of asparagus is so smooth , I can see how glaze would just slip off . Peeled asparagus will have a slightly stickier surface for the glaze to hold on to . An added bonus is that some of the glaze should penetrate if the asparagus is peeled . Be aware that peeled asparagus will cook faster than unpeeled . See also : <URL>
In the freezer , more-or-less indefinitely , depending on how good your freezer is . Certainly months to years . In the fridge , it depends on the kind of mole . Quick moles ( like various green moles ) do n't keep very long , maybe a week at most . A long-cooked mole should keep a bit longer -- up to 2 weeks -- since all of the ingredients are completely cooked . If you 're not planning to use it within a week , though , why not freeze it ? The texture wo n't take any harm from freezing and thawing .

How can vegans alleviate the effects of spicy food ?
I have done no testing of this at all but I was surprised to find <URL> that they recommend trying a spoon full ( or cube of ) sugar . Perhaps the easiest way of calming down a flaming mouth is by sucking on a sugar cube or holding a teaspoon of sugar in your mouth . This helps by absorbing the spicy oil that is coating your mouth , as well as giving you a different , strong taste to concentrate on . A bit of mind-trickery and science combined ! Other things I 've eaten in the past include starches , like bread or rice . Here 's a fun infographic and most of the items on it are vegan : <URL> from <URL>
Baking soda seems to work well for me , but the best thing is to get rid of old food that is causing the smell , and seal strong-smelling foods in airtight containers .
There are several negative effects from over-kneading bread dough : Overheating - if the dough gets too warm , it will ferment too quickly ( or over ferment ) and will therefore lack flavour . Oxidisation - kneading for too long can cause the flour to oxidise and bleach , again impairing flavour . Breaking down - eventually the molecular bonds of the gluten will break , which is obviously not what you want to happen ! The latter two are really only possible with electric mixers , however . Most doughs are ready for fermentation when they reach an internal temperature of 77-81ºF ( 25-27 ° C ) . You can also check the gluten development with the Windowpane Test : pull off a chunk of dough and stretch it with your hands . It should stretch to form a very thin translucent sheet , without tearing .
In Indian cooking we usually add Ghee ( Clarified butter ) to reduce the heat of a chili pepper . Most Indian dishes , we would add a good heaping spoon of ghee before feeding little ones . This helps temper the heat but keeps the flavors alive so that the children get used to them and can gradually learn to eat hotter foods .
@niemiro , in your post does " go bad " mean food quality or food safety ? As for safety , you were no where near the " danger zone " either temperature-wise or time-wise . Initially safe , properly stored , frozen food that warms to -6 C ( or 22 F ) for 30 minutes will not render it unsafe to eat . In terms of food quality , freezers ( most of which these days are self-defrosting ) , go through temperature cycles regularly . The problem with this is not food safety , but the accumulation of ice crystals in foods , which degrades quality . Freezer burn is the extreme example . Of course , attention to packaging ( vacuum sealing , for example ) helps .
Brown/black mustard seed is hotter and more intense than yellow . So , powdered mustard seed that is predominantly brown/black is going to pack quite a wallop compared to powdered yellow mustard seed . In the US , recipes calling for powdered mustard are going to expect you to use yellow . See <URL> for an interesting article on the subject .
Chuck ? As in beef chuck ? Not that it wo n't work , but it 'll be slightly different taste and texture wise than the more common pork sausage . I do n't think the # of grinds is the issue . I 'd be looking more at : temperature . Do you put the meat in the freezer for an hour or so before grinding , and are your bowls/grinder/etc cold ? If your meat gets too warm , it 'll separate from the fat , resulting in a mealy sausage . are you beating the ground meat &amp; spices with the paddle blade and a bit of liquid at the end ? You want to do that to produce a bind and end up with a tight ( not crumbly ) sausage .
Cumin is most often used ground , yes . You can , if you prefer -- and as in common in Indian and other cuisines -- toast it first until it is fragrant ( a minute or two in a dry skillet at medium heat ) . Then , grind it in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle .
In my experience , the most likely impact of a gentle boil vs. a furious rolling boil is going to be on texture of starchy foods , such as potatoes or other root vegetables , rather than flavor . I 've found that a gentle simmer of potatoes will result in a mostly intact shape and consistent texture , whereas an aggressive boil without perfect timing can result in the outer layers of the potato breaking apart , sometimes before the center has time to cook fully . I 've seen similar issues with stuffed parcels of pasta like ravioli or boiled won tons . I 've also found that open pot egg poached eggs have much nicer results with a gentle simmer than an aggressive boil , perhaps for related reasons . Since part of how we experience taste is texture , you could say that the " taste " is affected .
It 's been a while since I made sushi but 2 tablespoons does sound a little on the ridiculous side . Various other recipes use similar amounts ( to each other ) : <URL> : 1 tsp salt ( for 1/2 cup vinegar and 4 tbsp sugar ) <URL> : 1 tbsp kosher salt ( for 2 tbsp vinegar and 2 tbsp sugar ) <URL> : 1 tsp salt ( for 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup sugar ) <URL> : 1/2 tsp salt ( for 2 tbsp vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar ) In fact , although sushi rice recipes tend to vary significantly with respect to the proportions of rice , vinegar , and sugar , they are all remarkably consistent on the amount of salt . The Alton Brown recipe calls for a tablespoon , but 1 tbsp of kosher salt is in fact equivalent to 1-2 tsp of table or sea salt . Even on the Epicurious recipe , the 1/2 tsp is only for 1 cup of rice - you 'd double it to the same 1 tsp for the standard 2 cups . I assume that the recipe you 're looking at must have meant 2 tsp and not tbsp , but I think even that is too much ; I would stick to the 1 tsp used in almost every sushi rice recipe I 've ever seen .
There are four methods for thawing frozen foods which are recognized as safe : In a refrigerator In the microwave Under cool running water As part of the cooking process These four methods all meet the criteria that they minimize the amount of time the food spends in the danger zone ( 40-140 F , 4-60 C ) where bacteria can grow . The pros and cons of the following often-recommended methods are also reviewed : Leaving food on the counter overnight Thawing in a bowl ( or sink ) of water On a metal pan or with a " miracle thaw " device In the refrigerator Thawing food in the refrigerator is slow ; it can take a day to thaw several pounds ( a kilogram or two ) , and even more time for larger foods like a whole frozen turkey . The advantage is that the refrigerator is at a safe temperature , and bacterial growth is already inhibited , so there is little risk . This is probably the preferred method for many foods , if you have the time . In the microwave Thawing in the microwave is fast , but it has several disadvantages : It requires a lot of attention , turning or rotating the food to get even coverage from the microwaves ; for items like ground beef , you might even need to scrape off the thawed portions and continue defrosting the frozen portion . It is easy to accidently go to far and start cooking the food , especially if it has an odd shape or small pointier parts sticking out ( like wings on a chicken ) . For this reason , microwave thawing is best done only for foods like soup or stew , where you can stir them and if one part boils a small amount while another part is frozen , no harm is done . Under cool running water This one is most surprising , but it is true : the fastest way to thaw food safely is under cool running water ( at or below 70 F / 21 C ) , like the cold water from your tap . The reason is that that water has an extremely high capacity for carrying heat , and the forced convection from running water ensures that it transfers heat from the food item as rapidly as possible . In the Good Eats episode <URL> , Alton Brown thawed several frozen ice duck sculptures by various methods . The one under cool running water was almost completely melted , even when the one in the oven at 200 F was still fairly recognizably bird shaped . It is important that the water be running , to ensure strong convection . You can do this by setting the food in the sink under a very small stream of water . If the food should not get wet , you can put it in a zip-type bag or similar to keep it dry . Try to remove as much air as possible , to get the best contact between the water and the food ( through the bag ) . This is the best method for forced , rapid thawing ( at least when microwaving is not appropriate or inconvenient ) , but it is probably less convenient that the refrigerator method . You also have to monitor the food , and remove it when it is thawed , or it will come to the ambient temperature of the water , which is probably in the danger zone . As part of the cooking process Some foods can be cooked starting from the frozen state , thawing and then cooking in one operation . Among the ones most suitable for this are are smaller or thinner items , such as : Cookie dough lumps Hamburgers Chicken parts Pizza Stew meat Frozen , chopped vegetables Frozen stock ( at least in smaller quantities ) Bad idea : on the Counter overnight This is a bad idea , especially for meats and other highly perishable items . You have no control over the temperature the surface of the food will reach , and it may begin to spoil at the surface before the center is thawed . Bad idea : In a bowl ( or sink ) of cold water Again , a bad idea . Without the convection , the thawing speed is reduced . There is also no source of newer , cooler water , so the temperature of the water itself will rise . Some parts of the food may reach dangerous temperatures before it is fully thawed . Also , if you do n't check the food frequently , the temperature can get into dangerous territories , facilitating spoilage . Risky : On a cast iron , stainless steel or other metal pan , or a " miracle thaw " device This method is most often used with thin foods like steaks or frozen hamburgers . Physics are with you , as the specific heat capacity and conductivity of the metal are very high ( higher even than water ) . The large surface area of the metal acts like a radiator or heat sink in reverse , conducting heat away from the food more rapidly than air alone would . This method is not approved by health codes for commercial use , and carries some risks . You need to monitor the food closely , and cook it or move it into the refrigerator as soon as it is thawed . Failure to do so will allow the food to spoil , and the conductivity of your metal will become your enemy , more quickly bringing the food to ambient temperature . While this method is not officially sanctioned , you may choose to assess its risks for yourself . See also : <URL> <URL>
A vegan is not going to eat your pan , just the food that was made on it . As no animals were harmed in the making of your pan ( well , probably but how would you know ) the pan itself would n't be an issue . Of course if a tiny bit of pan seasoning could go into the food , however anything else used in the preparation of the meal like cutting boards could cause a small amount of meat product to go into the food as well . Your kitchen is not vegan , and if a vegan has a problem with that they should not come over for a meal . I 'd be extremely surprised if the subject of your pots and pans came up to be honest , vegans I know appreciate people going to the effort of making a vegan meal for them .
So to sum up , so far , we have : use a silicon tray , there should be no problems there . put the tray in warm water for a short while and they would let go .
One method I found over time : Chop it into tiny pieces and stir fry it with bacon and onions ( also chopped up ) . Once that 's soft , leave it to cool , then mix it in meatballs in a 50:50 ratio . If some eggs and breadcrumbs are added a fine meatball is made that tastes a bit sweeter and veggy and is healthier . :)
Celery is an aromatic , and 1/3 of a <URL> . It 's used for the base flavor of a lot of French and Cajun/Creole cuisine . It does n't serve any important chemical role that I 'm aware of , so you can omit or substitute it if you really do n't like the flavor .
i have found that a lampe berger works well to eliminate strong scents after cooking ( http://www.lampeberger.us/ ) -- after all , they were originally invented to help reduce the odors in hospitals and mortuaries ! ( you can read about their history at wikipedia : <URL> ) . i use mine after a night of deep frying food to get that smell out . i 'm pretty certain it would work on fish just as well .
Its less that the simple act of cooking it at home causes shorter life of the product and more that at-home cooks are cooking for the sake of avoiding the chemicals and preservatives that are what give the commercially made things their long shelf life . In some cases it is preservatives ( sulfates in dried fruit ( I think ) ) , in some cases it is an extra processing step ( ultra-high-temp-pasteurization for organic milk ) , while in other cases it is a matter of equipment that is simply not available for the home cook ( for example canned pureed pumpkin - this is not safe to make at home ( even with a proper pressure canner ) but with the commercial equipment and processes it becomes shelf stable ) . Usually I think it is a combination of all three of these . That being said , in regards to ice cream - I recently read somewhere that if you put the container with the ice cream in it into a Ziplock baggie then it helps it stay soft for longer . I still have some ice cream ( technically sorbet ) in my freezer from over a year ago that I keep forgetting about . When I decide to chip some off the solid block it has become ( I did not store it in a Ziplock baggie , just a container ) it is still quite good .
<URL> says no , you can enjoy your shot for a little while : In reality , there are only a couple of things that happen to espresso over the course of a few minutes . First , the crema or foam that sits on top of the espresso reintegrates with the liquid . Crema , on its own , contains some of the best flavors and aromatic qualities of the espresso in high concentrations . Drinking it straight can be overwhelming but , it stands to reason , that having the crema reintegrate might actually be a good thing . Second , the espresso cools down . The temperature of espresso has a lot to do with how we taste the various flavors contained within it ... I am not an espresso fan myself -- I like regular coffee , but not after it has cooled down , and never reheated . Many folks are perfectly content to microwave a cold cup and drink it . I imagine that older , colder espresso is palatable to you to the extent that you are willing to tolerate it . A small shot of coffee -- and lets face it , that is all espresso is , even if it is brewed in a fancy manner -- is going to cool off much more rapidly than a full cup , or a full pot .
Use a boiled cornstarch wash for an in oven glue Egg wash is a great glue , but generally lets go again when heated in the oven . Best used after baking not before
I tried this recently . Washed &amp; dried them and put them in a plastic bag in freezer for 30 mins only . It worked well for me - they were much tastier and a better texture .

How do you form Marshmallow Ropes ?
Have you tried using a marshmallow recipe that is only made from gelatin and cooked sugar syrup ( sugar , water , and light corn syrup to soft ball stage , 240 degrees F ) ? I have made various piped marshmallows that will hold swirly shapes using this type of marshmallow recipe . It is a bit more stable than the egg based recipes . The most important thing is to make sure that the marshmallow mixture is whipped to a nice fluffy , shiny , smooth stage ( about 7-10 minutes on high speed ) and piped very quickly into whatever form you want before it sets up using a large round tip . Timing is of utmost importance here and you may lose some marshmallow during this process at home . I would also recommend piping onto a silpat ( silicone ) lined sheet tray or a piece of wax paper that has been lightly dusted with a mixture of cornstarch and confectioner 's sugar .
My grounds bin has a lid . So while the grounds still collect static , they do n't fly all over the place when I remove the bin from the grinder . Giving the bin few sharp taps on the counter top prior to opening seems to shake off most of what clings to the top and sides . Then I tap out the grounds , wipe out the bin with a napkin , and I 'm ready for the next morning . Beyond that , try switching up your coffee . The cheap " 8 O'Clock " stuff I keep on reserve is terribly staticy , while the beans I roast myself do n't have nearly the trouble . I tend to enjoy a lighter roast , so keep that in mind - you might benefit from grinding beans with just a bit higher moisture content ( of course , if you have a strong preference for dark roasts , this does n't help much ) .
Standard prep for beef tongue seems to be : scrub it well and rinse , then soak it in cold water for 2-3 hours . Heat water to a low simmer ( about 200F ) and cook slowly for at least an hour per pound . Preferably cook as long as you can ( 5-6 hours ) to get a more tender result . When meat is tender and cooked , remove meat and save the broth . Cool the tongue and peel off the outer skin . The broth may be reduced and added to vegetables and meat to create a richer , meatier taco . I also found a tongue taco ( how is that NOT slang for some sexual act ? ) <URL> . Personally , I 'm also a big fan of cold boiled beef tongue with horseradish sauce . You can go from the cooked tongue straight to that just by slicing it up . Now I really want to make tongue tacos .
I recommend a dedicated , rotary style coffee grinder for home spice grinding . Whole spices last longer , usually taste better , and are often less expensive than pre-ground . In many food cultures , whole spices are often toasted whole , then ground . It makes a big difference for not a lot of effort . I picked up a rotary style <URL> for $ 3 at a thrift store . I use it to grind all kinds of spices . It never needs to be washed . If it starts to taste like last weeks spices , I just grind up some rice and shake it out . It works great , I 've ground spices in the same grinder for 5 years .
It 's easiest to skin the deer when it 's still warm , but since that is n't an option let it hang for a day or two , if the weather is n't going to get above around 40 degrees F . If this is your first time , definitely have a helper on hand to help you hold the deer . Have a hacksaw and a sharp knife on hand . A small electric knife/chainsaw is helpful but not necessary . Growing up , this is how we did it : Peel the hide off ( start from top , go to bottom ) . Cut out the tenderloins with your knife . Quarter the deer with the hacksaw and bring the quarters inside individually to cut further . Be sure to look up some more videos/articles , but it 's not too difficult . Have plenty of freezer bags and freezer space on hand . It helps to have a " team " cutting up the quarters ... it 's not hard but it 's a lot of work . Enjoy !
It 's not a standard . ' Antipasti ' ( before the meal ) would be the typical replacement for ' appetizers ' . Quite a few of the categories on the menu could be classified as antipasti : Olives Salumi Formagi As Catija points out , the items all seem to be vegetable dishes intended as a starter . In my opinion ( having taken courses on classification &amp; thesaurus design ) , the menu 's a bit of a mess . I suspect that it 's in part from mixing lunch , dinner &amp; bar menus , they have starters , salad &amp; soup courses , small plates ( which includes stuff from the starters ) , main dishes ... and even one category ( vegetariano ) which mixes both main &amp; side dishes . They 're also inconsistent on the text after the title ... sometimes it 's a translation ( Coppa Classic / Fragrant Spiced Pork ) or description of the item ( Taleggio / Cow 's Milk , Nutty , Aromatic , Semi-Soft ) , some list sides it comes with without translating the main ingredient ( Stracci di Grano Arso / Broccoli Rabe , Tomato , Onion , Garlic , Red Chili , &amp; E.V.O.O ) or ( Veal Osso Buco / Gremolata ) . ( Note that this says nothing about the food itself -- it might be excellent ... it 's just a confusing menu )
That 's all there is to it . It seems you already know this , but just to be sure , be aware that " blackened " refers to the spice and not any burning or charring that is done . Burnt spices taste horrendous .
This has happened to many of us . Your oven is hot . You have a beautifully crafted pizza ready to cook . You are minutes away from food time . You give your peel one last shake , but only part of the pizza moves . If you ca n't get it unstuck with shaking alone ( and this typically is n't enough if you have a leak ) , you will need to try to carefully lift the stuck spot . Using two spatulas , and even a third hand , if available , can help out greatly . I recommend easing a large plastic or metal spatula to start with . While it may have limited reach , a larger spatula will allow you to lift the pizza without stretching it too much or disrupting your toppings . Then , using a second , smaller , rubber or silicone spatula , shove some flour or corneal under the first spatula . If you see a sauce leak , I recommend using flour . Think about it this way : if you spilled oil on your driveway , you would probably try to soak it up with kitty litter rather than tennis balls . If the stuck spot is large enough , you will need to repeat this process from another direction . As you work to unstick the pizza , keep shaking , and work the pizza towards the edge of the peel . If you get the pizza unstuck , try to keep shaking it until you are sliding it into the oven . If you ca n't get it to stay unstuck and all else fails , get your large spatula ( s ) under the sticky spots , place the leading edge of the pizza on the baking surface in the oven , and shimmy/shove the pizza off of the peel . Only try this if the oven temperature is low enough that you can do this safely . If you are using your standard home oven , you should be fine , especially if you use something to protect your hands . It also helps to have another person to open the oven and help you out with another spatula if needed . You might end up with a pizza that is shaped like Texas or a donut , but it probably wo n't be a total loss , and you will probably get better with time . While I am at it , I will share some prevention tips , specific to your situation , that I have learned , but have n't found elsewhere . You can find a few more <URL> , but it sounds like you 're already familiar with those tips : If you see a weak spot in your dough once you 've stretched it out , you can preempt it with extra flour underneath it before you start adding toppings . If feasible , you can also try using little or no sauce on that spot . If you are making pizza , there is a good chance that you have another human around , waiting to consume it . Conscript that person to either help with toppings , or to shake the peel at regular intervals . This can help you get to the oven faster , giving your pizza less time to stick . If you use that person as a shaker , you will know as soon as your pizza starts sticking . Try to handle any adhesion as soon as it happens , when there are n't as many toppings to disrupt .
Honestly , do n't grill . Do n't run away ! Hamburgers were originally cooked in pans , not on grills . One of the reasons for this is thta with grilling you lose any fat and moisture that comes out of the burger . So I use Heston Blumenthal 's method now . While I tend to ignore the preparation elements ( I have neither the time nor the money to hand-grind my burgers with a specific ratio of this cut to that cut to the other cut ) , the cooking method is flawless : Make your burgers . Over very low heat , place a pan with just a little oil ( or bacon/duck fat , which is lovely ) . introduce burgers to pan . As soon as they release easily from the surface , flip . Thirty seconds later , flip . Repeat until cooked through . ( fifteen to twentyish minutes ) . This will give you the juiciest , most tender burgers you have ever had in your life . I promise . Essentially what you 're doing is basting the burgers in their own fat . Alternatively , if you have an immersion circulator , cook your burgers sous vide and then just mark on the grill when done . I 've had burgers done this way and they are excellent . Burgers will flare on the grill -- that 's all the fat ( and therefore flavour ) being squeezed out by the action of cooking and burning away .
I have ( nearly ) no sense of taste and smell , and what sense I do have is heavily distorted . As a result , my senses are non-indicative of dish quality . Nearly every meal I cook is shared with at least one person , though , so I 've had to adapt . I iterate over the same recipe over and over varying the spice mixtures and ratios , and ask for comment every time . I write down said comments with the recipe , and then adjust from there . Usually my recipes stop evolving by the time I 've written iteration # 4-5 ( less for newer recipes , as I can now " play " the flavors by ear ) . When I 'm cooking for people I do n't see often , I use my well-rehearsed recipes . I also select foods where the cooking is more of a science , where it 's hard to mess up the flavor , or where people take a self-seasoning approach ( e.g. baking bread , grilling steak , baking potatoes ) . Edit : Here 's some simple spice trends from my personal recipes . These have been calibrated almost exclusively on Southern U.S. guests : Mild Spanish Paprika ( Pimentón ) is great for grilling and pan-frying pork ( along with the usual suspects like salt and pepper ) . Add 1/person dried bay leaves ( whole ones , not chopped or ground ) and 1/person garlic cloves to your rice when cooking it . Remove them after cooking . Do the same for stews , and really anything that cooks in water ( other than pasta and potatoes ) . Add some granulated garlic ( which is basically powdered garlic without the dust issues ) to nearly everything . It 's quick , mess-free , and I think most people ( at least near me ) harbor a terrible addiction for garlic . Use actual garlic when doing stews , sauces , or you just have the extra time to peel it . Substitute bacon fat for butter when cooking things other than bread and pork . Only thing people are more addicted to than garlic would be bacon . Use both garlic and bacon fat when making mashed potatoes , watch them cry happy tears while they ask for additional helpings . Instead of plain vegetable/frying oil , get a bottle of non-virgin olive oil and a bottle of peanut oil . After cooking with them a few times you 'll get a feel for which is right for each dish ( rule of thumb : higher temperatures means peanut ) . I have yet to find a dish that was n't improved by sprinkling some parsley on top at the very end . It adds color ( specially to anything that does n't have green otherwise ) , and everyone either loves it or is neutral to it .
The problem is that you 're using a lid . Spatter screens keep the oil mostly contained , while still allowing any moisture to escape . A lid , on the other hand , collects the moisture on the underside of the lid . When you go to lift it , the water drops back into the oil , and causes increased spattering . You 're actually better off without a lid , if you do n't have a spatter screen . Yes , you 'll likely have to clean everything in the vicinity of the vessel of hot oil , but you do n't have the problems associated with the lid .
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .
Take them to a professional . Nothing you can affordably buy in your home will work well . Personally , I do n't buy quality serrated knives . I buy cheap and replace when dull . Only my normal blades are quality , and these I have sharpened yearly .
Did you let the meat cool completely before attempting to slice it ? Even meat that is completely-fall-apart tender straight out of the ( crock ) pot will firm up quite a bit when cooled .
You would use raw corn . You can either grill it on the cob , or use a <URL> .
Here 's a website that goes into it and includes a picture of the gizmo to which you refer : <URL> " This little single serving device is meant to fit over a cup , hold about two tablespoons worth of coffee , and the required amount of water for brewing . There is a screen on the bottom , and a plunger with another screen on it that screws down on top of the coffee to smush it between the two filters . The tightness of this top filter controls the strength of the coffee . The tighter it is , the slower water flows , and the stronger the brew . " EDIT : Regarding the " bonus question " : I 'm not aware of chicory as an ingredient in Vietnamese/Thai iced coffee , I 'm only familiar with it as a traditional New Orleans addition , having migrated from France . It became a popular substitution during the French Revolution when coffee became prohibitively expensive . I dug up a recipe for New Orleans chicory coffee <URL> . " Ingredients 1 lb . coarsely ground coffee , 1 1/2 oz . roasted and chopped chicory , 2 1/2 quarts water , 3 oz . simple syrup , Tools Large stockpot , Wooden spoon , Fine-mesh sieve , Large Mason jar , Combine the ground coffee , chicory and water in a stockpot . Stir with a wooden spoon , cover and let steep at room temperature for 8-12 hours . Carefully break the crust of the coffee grounds with a spoon and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the Mason jar . Add simple syrup to concentrate and stir to combine . Serve over ice and add milk to taste -- most people opt for about a 50/50 ratio of milk to chicory-coffee concentrate . Keep refrigerated and use within 1-2 days . Yields 4-5 cups of concentrate .
Butter is typically added when the fudge is first taken off the heat - but it is n't mixed in . The butter is allowed to melt across the surface to keep it from forming a skin on top . Vanilla , nuts , and all other additions are mixed in at the end of the cooling period when the fudge is stirred . Alton Brown , with some help from Shirley Corriher , <URL> .
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
I am not familiar with nopales , but I would be astonished if their green color was determined by something else than chlorophyll . Chlorophyll is usually destroyed by normal cooking techniques . If you want to keep the color mostly green ( some dulling is inevitable ) : cook the vegetable in an alkaline fluid . The easiest way is to use water with some baking soda added . The problem here is that humans like food which is slightly acidic , and alkaline food tastes soapy . Also , vegetable fibers soften more easily in alkaline environments , so they will be somewhat mushy . So use a very small amount . If they are to be added to a dish which is acidic ( in a Mexican dish , the culprit will probably be tomatoes ) , cook the green vegetable separately , and only combine it with the rest of the dish at the last possible moment . Right before serving is best . Heat destroys chlorophyll too . Cook the green vegetable as short as possible . Blanching is perfect , do n't forget the ice bath at the end . It will probably be enough as a preparation method . While I do n't know how hard a nopale is , I find blanching to be quite sufficient even for broccoli ( provided the water contained either salt or baking soda ) , and their stems are one of the woodiest things we eat . If you do n't think they are softened enough after blanching , cook them longer , until you find they are sufficiently softened .
Most dishes require a chopped leek in any case , but for an uncut leek you will have to separate by hand and wash each leaf separately . If you want the leek in an untouched form I think you 're out of luck . You could try reassembling it after separating and washing :) Depending on the form you want your leaves in there are different ways . If you want them in strips you just cut lengthwise from above the root - keep the root on for now . Then you can rinse the leaves as they should be easy to separate . After rinsing remove the root . For ' chopped ' leaves cut the leek lengthwise and chop crosswise , removing the root in the process . The leaves will separate , and you can then wash the dirt from them in a colander . Skipping the lengthwise cut will usually make the leaves stay together , trapping the grit you want to get at . If you want to make doubly sure , you could first place the cut leeks in a bowl and swirl it around . The dirt will separate to the bottom . You can then take out the leeks and finish rinsing in the colander . Do n't pour the bowl into the colander as this just pours the grit over the leaves .

What is the " idea " behind thawing out meat ?
I would think that USDA would err on the side of conservative when it comes to safety , especially with no financial interests in the equation <URL> Perishable foods should never be thawed on the counter , or in hot water and must not be left at room temperature for more than two hours . Even though the center of the package may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter , the outer layer of the food could be in the " Danger Zone , " between 40 and 140 ° F -- temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly . When thawing frozen food , it 's best to plan ahead and thaw in the refrigerator where it will remain at a safe , constant temperature -- at 40 ° F or below . There are three safe ways to thaw food : in the refrigerator , in cold water , and in the microwave . They 're all covered in the above link , but here 's the fastest one since it best meets your requirement of reasonably quick results : Microwave thawing When thawing food in a microwave , plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during the thawing process ( bringing the food to " Danger Zone " temperatures ) . Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present would n't have been destroyed and , indeed , the food may have reached optimal temperatures for bacteria to grow . After thawing in the microwave , always cook immediately after , whether microwave cooking , by conventional oven , or grilling . Foods thawed in the microwave should be cooked before refreezing . And when all else fails : Cooking without thawing When there is not enough time to thaw frozen foods , or you 're simply in a hurry , just remember : it is safe to cook foods from the frozen state . The cooking will take approximately 50 % longer than the recommended time for fully thawed or fresh meat and poultry . From personal experience , I prefer the cold water method to microwave for fast thawing , but I rarely if ever use a microwave anyway so others on here might have techniques that minimize the flavor/quality downside of it . The factors that make the microwave method less safe are what also lower the quality , taste and texture of the food -- the unevenly thawed parts , over-cooking some of it while undercooking other areas , etc. .
A standard tomato implies that there is a standard salsa , which there is n't - but let 's stick with your specific case of pico de gallo AKA salsa cruda . The distinguishing characteristic of salsa cruda is that it uses raw tomatoes - the cruda literally means raw . Since you are n't going to be cooking them , and since water is going to be your primary binding agent , you 'll want to use plump , juicy tomatoes that have potent flavour when raw , and that just so happens to be those bog-standard globe tomatoes you see in the supermarket aisles . Of course , if you can get garden-fresh tomatoes , so much the better . Cherry tomatoes are also a great choice - they 're very juicy and a little sweeter than globes - the only downside is that for a chopped salsa ( as in pico de gallo ) , they tend to make preparation much more difficult and messy . If you 've got the time and patience , give it a try ; cherry tomato salsas taste much " fresher " than those made from globes . The other common types of tomatoes , most notably roma and pear tomatoes , are really meant more for cooking . That 's not to say you ca n't eat them raw , but they do n't have a lot of juice or raw flavour , so they do n't make a good base for cruda . Roasted roma or heirloom tomatoes ( especially fire-roasted ) make a great addition to salsa , but of course , it 's not really " cruda " anymore if you cook any of the ingredients . Do yourself a favour and do n't use the plum tomatoes in a can ; they 're plenty juicy but have almost no seeds and no flavour . So , all in all , for pico de gallo I believe that regular globe tomatoes are the most appropriate , but any tomatoes with strong flavour and plenty of juice will do .
Alcohol does not make the meat tender . It even prevents the outside surface of the meat to fully absorb the flavours . Then again , most marinades do n't penetrate into the meat anyway . When it comes to Shashlik , I think what is working for your uncle , is the time the meat spends in the fridge getting aged ( they probably marinate for a day or more ) and the enzymes break down the meat . It is a myth that Alcohol or Acid make the meat tender . In fact , they have the opposite effect . Per food author <URL> : Alcohol does denature and dehydrate meat and fish tissue , and the stronger the alcohol , the stronger this effect . What you should do instead , is to cook off the alcohol from your marinade first . The ingredient that keeps the meat juicy is salt which most marinades have . The less acidic marinade ( beer versus wine ) the more tender the meat . However , some not so acidic wines end up flavouring the surface of the meat enough to provide a pleasant byte .
I would go with hickory ; it always taste strong , and it is the best for me .
Let 's start with the assumption that Safety is never in the balance . Safety has to be taken into account for any method that we use and that means that we want to keep any food that is time and temperature sensitive out of the danger zone . The danger zone is the temperature range from 40 degrees F to 140 degrees F . If you have plenty of time , letting the turkey defrost in the refrigerator is safest and easiest , since there is little that you have to do . The turkey is always out of the danger zone and all you have to do is put it in the refrigerator . However , it can take a very long time , 24 hours for each 5 pounds of turkey weight ... 4 days for a 20 pound turkey . Assuming you have n't planned that far ahead , the other safe method is to defrost in the sink with cold running water . The water does n't need to be pouring out , just a steady stream so the water turns over regularly . Water is a better conductor of heat than air , so the turkey will defrost more rapidly than in the refrigerator . The danger zone is why you do n't want to defrost the turkey using warm water , or just sitting on the counter . In either of those cases , the outside meat is warmed into the danger zone before the inside defrosts , so you have some of the meat ( the part that is most likely to have come into contact with contaminants ) in a temperature range that promotes bacterial growth .
It depends on where you live , and what type of mussel you are eating The blue mussel popular in Europe and North Pacific typically has an uncooked meat ratio of 25 % to total weight , and 20 % when cooked The New Zealand Greenshell mussel ( available flash frozen in Europe ) typically has an uncooked meat ratio 55 % , and 50 % when cooked Around US$ 2 per Kg . These will vary by season and supplier of course
Meat is pounded as a mechanical means of tenderizing by damaging the connective tissues . It also makes the meat thinner and flatter , which helps the meat cook faster and more evenly . Pound tougher meats ( cheaper steaks ) , and meats of uneven thickness ( chicken breasts ) . Avoid pounding the bones in the meat . You do n't want little pieces of bone chipping off into meal . Do n't pound already tender pieces ( premium cuts , dry aged steaks ) . Think tenderize , not pulverize . You should not be making any holes in it . If you 're going to marinate , do that after pounding . Wrapping the meat in wax paper first will help prevent a big mess . Do both sides of the meat .
There are a couple of fluff pieces on the web that appear to indicate the George Forman Grills remove fat from foods , due to the tiled bed allowing draining : <URL> <URL> In my opinion , both have the feel of echoing press releases from the manufacturer . Neither compares the effectiveness of the tilted bed grill to a more traditional grilling method . Consider griddling a hamburger on a flat griddle or in a flat style panini press , with or without raised grooves . Even without the grooves , as the hamburger cooks , it expresses fat and other liquid as the proteins in the meat tighten . With a fatty hamburger , this can be a considerable amount , even though it is not draining away . The issue in expressed fat is not the tilt , but rather the squeezing effect the cooked proteins have , forcing the fat out of the food . This happens regardless of the angle of the bed . Consider also that it is the contraction of the meat that is important in expressing the fat . If the fat were simply liquefied but the proteins not fully tightened , less or no fat is expressed . This can be seen in low temperature sous-vide cooking . Adhesion and capillary action would keep the fat in the meat otherwise . The logical conclusion is that the tilt of the bed is irreverent in expressing the fat , but does help clear it away and collect it . This may have some minor effect on the amount of fat adhering to the outside of the food item , but is not the major effect . You can argue whether the clearing of the fat away during cooking is a positive or negative for culinary quality , but it does n't affect the amount of fat .
Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom , along with cinnamon and cocoa . Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world , not just in India . If you have reason to want to try this particular recipe , then try the recipe as written . There are thousands of beloved recipes for all kinds of chili . There is no reason to say , " That one looks good , I 'll do it just like that but omit a certain ingredient 'cause it makes me nervous . " Your friend 's advice is a bit odd to me because Garam Masala usually contains cardamom ( sometimes black , green and brown ) My advice is to either try the recipe as written , or find another with which you 're more comfortable . Or come up with your own . There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chili . BTW , I love cardamom in savory . I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup ( Pho ) that I crave if I have n't had it for a while . It would n't be right without cardamom .
It is to cool it down without dilluting it - ice cubes would melt . And yes , you could simply cool the entire bottle , but it would n't look that fancy . Note that some purists would wrinkle their noses and insist that whisky1 is best enjoyed at room temperature and perhaps with a small dash of spring water . 1 And I 'm soooo not going into a whisky vs. whiskey debate here .
It depends on the meat and how it 's cut . A ' solid ' uncut piece like a pork loin will take longer to marinade properly than if it was cut into thin strips for stir frying , for example - I 'd want to marinade the former at least 7-8 hours , while the latter could probably get away with 1 .
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
There are two main types of provolone : piccante ( sharp ) and dolce ( sweet ) . Most braciola recipes I 've seen call for the sharp version . Sharp provolone tastes very similar to cheddar , which I assume is abundant in the UK . The issue is that " real " cheddar is a hard cheese and provolone is only semi-hard . Here in the US , we have a softer version of sharp cheddar-style cheese that is made in Wisconsin . If a similar semi-hard sharp cheddar variant is available in the UK , I would recommend that . It should also be noted that the term " braciola " ( or sometimes " braciole " ) means a lot of different things to different people . <URL> , likely including the author of your book , it takes on the Sicilian meaning of an involtino . Sometimes the meat will be filled with a soft cheese mixture like mozzarella mixed with grated pecorino romano . However , if the recipe calls for a harder cheese like provolone , it is likely referring to a variant that is very popular in the US in which the provolone is cut into thin slices ( usually using a deli slicer ) and layered on the meat before the meat is rolled . Therefore , any substitute for the provolone should ideally be thinly sliced .
Roasting the bones first will add a deeper flavor . The roast flavor may or may not be desired , it depends on your preferences . This is from the article I 've posted below : " Roasting caramelizes them , heightening sweetness and deepening flavor . But any blackening will make meat stock bitter . ' You do n't want that burned bone thing , ' cautions Keller . " <URL>
Not sure if there is a correct way . It 's basically skewered hunks of meat on a wood fired BBQ You can do your own Churrasqueira by using a Weber " kettle " style BBQ or a B.D.S. ( Big Drum Smoker ) . Use long steel skewers ( or swords ! ) for your meat and BBQ away Thick steaks of beef and lamb work well . Also try chicken drumsticks and some small Chorizo ( spicy sausage ) Do n't marinate the meat , but toss some coarse salt onto the meat surface before and during cooking . Do n't go crazy with it , but it seems to absorb the roasting flavours and really boost the taste Use a smoky fire , if your wood wo n't smoke add some fresh wood or herbs that do . Try lavender bush ( wood and flower ) , grape vine or kiwifruit vine cuttings , or any other fresh cut aromatic wood Watch the amount of fat dripping onto the hot coals ; too much will make the meat taste bad . Shield the coals as required or trim off large chunks of fat There is no need for motorised skewers that takes the fun out of it . Occasionally turn the meat by hand while enjoying your favourite beverage , and " chewing the fat " with a friend Serve by taking a skewer to the diners plate , and hold skewer nearly vertically above plate . Use an extra sharp carving knife and slice onto the plate with a downwards cut so juices and other slicing splatter goes onto the plate and not onto the diners If you are having a Churrasco party , give each diner a flippable symbol ( e.g. red/green ) to indicate to the server ( probably you ) " GIVE ME MORE ! " , or " I am stuffed " . Serve a round of each meat as their outer layer becomes done Coolest Churrasco cooker I could find The rails on the top are what the skewers rest on Following the car theme , some more cool Churrasco cookers here <URL>
Very high fat , thoroughly marbled ribeye is a good start , but there 's a fair amount of variation . The extremely thin slices are also not something that every butcher is accustomed to producing , but that should get you to the right beginning .
It is basically the anethole ( a phenol ) of the star anise that react with the sulfur in the onion to create sulfur-phenolic aromatics . In Chinese cuisine the same family of reactions is used with duck and pork . The sulfur-phenols are also produced during the Maillard reaction , the reaction that gives grilled meat its characteristic flavor , so adding star anise to the onions will give your dishes more of that grilled , browned flavor . The reactions of the compounds in the star anise with those in the meat are not the relevant reactions for flavor or texture . From averaging a few recipes , I would say 1 star anise for every 250g of chopped onion . Too much star anise will highlight the other aromas in star anise , so one has to use it in moderation and allow enough time for the reactions to take place . Garam masala , a common Indian spice combination that is used in meat dishes , may have star anise . Star anise is sometimes used in French onion soup -- it intensifies the caramel flavor of the onions -- and in Vietnamese cuisine , which today incorporates French elements .
Is this normal ? Yes , it is . Sinew and other connective tissues ( silverskin/fascia , ligaments ) are very tough stuff ; you need to remove as much as possible by hand before grinding . Sinew and ligaments are strong , whitish strands or " cables " connecting bones to muscles and to other bones , respectively . They 'll be in the same place on every piece of a particular cut of meat : a poultry drumstick has an easily-identifiable piece of sinew -- actually the " Achilles ' tendon " -- heading from the fleshy part to the exposed end of the bone . Silverskin is a connective boundary between muscles . It 's a thin , clingy , and annoying sheet , translucent silvery white , that you will find on the surface , and defining the divisions of , various cuts of meat . It might make it through the grinder if your blade is nice and sharp and the piece is n't too big , but it 's best to take it off ( your teeth ca n't deal with it much better than the grinder can ) . You 'll need a thin , sharp , narrow blade for this : a filet/boning knife , sometimes a good paring kife . Essentially , anything that 's not fat or muscle needs to be taken out before the meat goes into the grinder . Chicken thighs have a lot of connective tissue . Some of it is hidden inside the muscle segments on the underside of the thigh ; make sure you cut those open . Depending on the particular piece of meat you have , you may end up with what seem like extremely small bits after this process . Even a nice pork shoulder can result in 1/4 " or thinner pieces after the internal connective tissue is removed . This wo n't have any real effect on the grinding process ; the only thing to watch out for is thorough and even mixing if you end up with many different sizes and are marinating/curing the meat before grinding . You can grind without removing all the tissue ( it gets frustrating sometimes ) , but you 'll have to be prepared to stop the grinder and clean the blade and plate frequently -- the instant you notice that the meat is not coming out of the plate in clean , cohesive , and separate lines . If you see any signs of smearing or over-grinding ( the grind will start to be too fine and become pink as the fat and meat combine ) , stop and clear the blade . Otherwise , the mixture wo n't emulsify properly , the fat will melt out when you cook it , and the sausage will be dry . Does my blade need sharpening already ? It may very well , but this still wo n't help with sinew and ligaments . You should treat your grinder blade the same way you treat your kitchen knives -- maintain its edge , rather than waiting for it to become completely dull . I 'd say that I put my blade onto a sharpening stone every 50 lbs . or so . The nice thing is that it 's extremely easy -- you are grinding all the arms of the blade at the same angle : flat . The plate also needs to be maintained by grinding the surface where it meets the blade ( the edges of the holes should be sharp ) , but I 'd say that this can be done much less freqently . The blade and the plate can both be maintained quite successfully and easily with a piece of fine ( 800 grit ) wet-dry sandpaper slapped on a table .
The meaty taste is Umami . It is the flavour of monosodium glutamate , in the same way that salty is the flavour of salt . Both mushrooms and tomatoes of the right variety are quite rich in it , as is yeast extract . You can also just buy the stuff commercially . Do n't worry about the stigma attached to it , it 's not actually toxic or anything .
To start with , the red , or dark , juice from red meat is not , in fact , blood , which is a common misconception . Most blood is drained from red meat when it is butchered . It is , rather , a protein ( <URL> ) and a lot of water . It is an animal 's levels ( or lack of ) myoglobin , that determine whether it is a ' red ' meat or white . As for its safety after being frozen , this is discussed further <URL> . Beef stored in the refrigerator for more than 5 days will start to turn brown due to chemical changes in the myoglobin . This does n't necessarily mean it has gone bad , though with this length of unfrozen storage , it may have . Best to use your nose to tell for sure , not your eyes As your venison was frozen , rather than just refrigerated , as mentioned above , I would say you are more than safe to do a nose test , as recommended above .

Preheat or do not preheat an enameled cast-iron dutch oven ?
With enameled cast-iron , I do n't bother to heat the pot before adding the oil . For something that 's open-pored , like plain cast-iron or carbon steel ( like an old-school crepe pan ) , it 's better to preheat the pan . I ca n't see any chemical advantage to preheating enameled , as it 's inert and non-porous . Of course everything DOES need to be properly hot before you add the meat . I can take or leave letting my roast get to room temp when doing a braise . It 's going to be in the oven/pot long enough that it 's going to be cooked to 200 + degrees all the way through no matter what . The only possible advantage of letting it warm up on the counter is that it will take marginally less time to cook . And by marginally , I mean you probably wo n't even notice , on the scale of pot roast cooking time . For a steak or a rib roast where you want the middle warm without the outside being totally dry and charred , room temp helps a lot . The only real tip I can give on pot roast is to use the right cut of meat . You want something from the shoulder , which usually means chuck . It has an excellent mix of rich meaty flavor , collagen/connective tissue ( which makes that gelatin thats critical to the silky mouthfeel of pot roast and BBQ ) , and fat . You can also use something from the leg ( shank ) or tail , which also have loads of connective tissue , but they 're usually a little low on actual meat . If you get the right cut of meat and cook it low and long enough to get that collagen rendered , it 's pretty hard to mess up the rest of it .
Yes , you do n't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things , but it also means that you do n't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink , which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans , as they 'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly ( at least , compared to something of the same material , such as a cast iron skillet ) More importantly , in my opinion , is that without the sides , you do n't hold in moist air , so when cooking things like hash browns , you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them .
The big key is just to soak the plank before using it , that way it wo n't burn while it 's in the oven . The amount of time needed to soak seems to differ among experts , but soaking for an hour should be long enough to cook the salmon without the wood burning .
There are several things that keep frozen desserts ( ice cream and sorbet , not just sherbet ) from freezing into a block of ice . They 're essentially all the ingredients besides water . If you have too little of these things , you 'll have very hard ice cream ; if you have too much , it might never get firm enough to scoop in your freezer . Fat - ice cream is the easiest to get soft , since it contains the most dairy , but this works on sherbet too . The more cream , the softer . But even butter freezes hard , so this is n't going to keep it from setting . Sugar - this is pretty easy to vary in all frozen desserts . It 'll have a noticeable effect on softness , but reasonable quantities wo n't make it too soft . Alcohol - obviously you wo n't always want to use this , but the right alcohol often goes very nicely with sorbets . Enough alcohol would of course keep it from setting , but it takes a lot . A sorbet made from wine , sugar , and strawberries still sets , though it 's quite soft . Air - this gives the dessert a softer , fluffier texture , but of course wo n't ever stop it from freezing . Make sure to churn things long enough , though you can only ever do as well as your ice cream machine lets you . Additives - gelatin is the main one that 's common in kitchens ; guar gum , and xantham gum are next up . There are also various stabilizers for keeping ice cream smooth . I do n't think I 've ever seen a recipe for a frozen dessert that would n't set at all . It takes an awful lot of fat , sugar , or alcohol just to get it too soft . My best guess in the case of what you saw on TV is that she either went overboard with some kind of additive , or did n't manage to properly freeze it . Note that with home ice cream makers , things will be at least a bit too soft coming straight out of the machine - but they 'll set much harder in the freezer . In practice , if you 're making your own , the problem you 'll reliably have ( especially with random recipes online ) is that it 's too hard . Storebought frozen desserts if anything tend to have more sugar and fat than you 'd use at home , and often have additives to soften and stabilize on top of that . So most things you make at home will tend to be harder than what you buy in the store . Credit where it 's due : I learned some of this from the introduction to <URL> by David Lebovitz ; a lot of similar information is available in <URL> .
I too have that Jamie Oliver book ( try the roast beef then make the Rendang , amazing ) , and you are reading the recipe correctly . There is no problem leaving the skin on providing you 've washed all the soil off . In this recipe it adds to the ' zombie brain ' look , but if you cooking something a bit more refined you might want to take it off so it looks better . Also , many celeriac recipes involved mashing it , in which case taking the skin off aids that process .
You can certainly use a Dutch oven ( DO ) for cooking sauce . A good DO is probably one of the most versatile pieces of equipment in the kitchen . It cooks , it bakes , it even fries ! It will certainly make sauce and the high sides will even help prevent splatters . I would n't worry about the lack of a long handle , the weight of the DO will keep it stable . If anything , the weight is its primary fault . A good DO is also a heavy DO . It can be a bit daunting to lug out every time . Since you mentioned Le Creuset , I 'm assuming you 're talking about enameled cast iron - not ' normal ' cast iron . And hence have n't addressed that you certain sauces and such may not be well suited to ' normal ' cast iron , but enameled is fine all around . Can you use a enameled Dutch oven for sauces ? Absolutely . Should you ? There are less weighty options , but at the end of the day it will make the same sauce .
I have had great results by taking individual garlic cloves and cutting the root end off each , but leaving them in their papery skins . Then you put those dry into a small saucepan ( ideally one with a thick bottom ) over low-to-medium heat . Put a lid on it , and let it go for 20 minutes or so , shaking vigorously every couple of minutes to turn the cloves over . When the cloves are really soft , you 're done . The paper skins protect the garlic cloves from burning , but the direct contact with the hot pan cooks them nicely . When you 're done you can squeeze the soft , roasted garlic goodness out of the root end of the skins . This is a particularly nice technique when you want roasted garlic flavor but only need a few cloves , not a whole head . The first time I did a recipe that called for this process , I was sure the garlic would scorch or the skins would catch fire , but it worked great .
Ideally it should be matte to just-slightly-shiny black and very smooth . <URL> has some terrific information on the ideal oil to use ( flaxseed ) and method for seasoning , with actual scientific grounding .
By " it stays longer " do you mean that the egg stays good longer or the membrane/air pocket stays around longer ? I do n't know why you would care about the air pocket so I 'll go with the other . Orientation is not going to noticeably affect egg quality . I do n't use egg cartons . I store my eggs in plastic tubs ( carefully ) . The eggs end up in a random orientation and there is no noticeable difference between any two eggs . I have heard to people storing the eggs differently to center the yolks in preparation for boiling . This is purely a cosmetic thing .
I 'd like to refer you to my answer to the question about <URL> , from which I 'll summarize the relevant parts : Typical cast iron corrodes at a pH lower than 4.3 ; pure white vinegar ( 5 % ) has a pH of 2.4 and wine is around 3.2 to 3.8 . If you plan to use either of these in cast iron , you 'd better make sure they are heavily diluted , otherwise you may actually ruin your pot in addition to getting a pretty hefty iron supplement with your meal . Cast iron is still somewhat reactive at borderline pH ranges , i.e. tomato juice or sauce . It 'll leach out about 5 mg of iron for every 3 oz / 88 mL of liquid for typical cooking times . The typical human needs to ingest significantly more than 45 mg over a period of several days to become toxic , so it 's generally considered OK and even healthy to cook dilute tomato solutions in cast iron , but wine and vinegar are another story . Do n't fill your cast-iron cookware with wine or vinegar . A splash for sauce or deglazing is OK , but tossing a significant amount straight into the pan undiluted will ruin your cookware , and your health . P.S. Note that enameled cast iron ( Le Creuset , etc. ) is less reactive ; the specifics depend on the brand . If you have this type of cast iron , I suggest doing your homework before taking the risk .
Ca n't comment on the nutritional side of things , but the main reason I can think of for not always including it is that it has a slightly different flavour . A much more intense lemon flavour is provided by the zest while the juice has the more tart elements ( and of course water ) . If you 're just interested in avoiding waste , you can freeze the zest .
If you cook ( or bake ) using a timer , you should always use preheated equipment . Your stove top may differ from my stove top in terms of the length of time it would take to get to high heat ( hell , my stove top would n't even hit high heat in three minutes ) , and this would greatly effect the final quality . Always preheat , the instructions expect it . Otherwise , it would tell you to put a pan on the stove top , place in pan , and turn on to high heat . Leave for three minutes and remove .
I would cook the Brie at that same temperature for 30-35 minutes and it should be okay . Alternatively , you could cook the roast fully , remove it from the oven , tent it with foil and then cook the Brie . The meat can rest while the Brie is cooking and being eaten . Prior to slicing the roast , heat up the pan drippings to a sizzling temp and baste to ensure a crispy crust . But if the appetizer course happens to last for 20-30 minutes , then the roast will have been resting for 40-50 minutes and could lose too much internal heat .
The oven in a standard 20 " kitchen stove will accommodate a bird even as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) . The very detailed chart <URL> , the pertinent details of which are replicated in the chart below , establish the standard dimensions of such an oven as 18 X 16 X 14.5 inches ( 46 x 41 x 37 cm ) . In their downloadable Thanksgiving pdf , for a turkey as large as 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) Williams-Sonoma <URL> a 16 X 13 X 3 inch ( 40 x 33 x 7.5 cm ) roasting pan . A pan of this sort is available with a rack which rises just above the bottom of the pan , as <URL> and pictured below . This kind of pan keeps height requirements down to roughly the height of the bird plus 3 " ( 7.5 cm ) above the bird , plus the standard 2.5 " ( 6.5 cm ) below the bottom rack . With 14.5 " ( 37 cm ) worth of oven height to work with and about a half inch space between the bird and the pan , that still leaves room for a bird 8 " ( 20 cm ) tall . ( We wo n't expect the bird to be half as tall as the pan is long . ) Meanwhile , an 18 " ( 46 cm ) oven depth accommodates a 16 " ( 41 cm ) long pan , and a 16 " ( 41 cm ) oven width a 13 " ( 33 cm ) pan width . Also , as seen <URL> and below , the pan 's handles fold down . Now , none of this is to say that there 's anything the slightest bit convenient about roasting so large a bird in so small a space . But it can be done . It should just be done with every whit of safety in mind .
You are relying on very different forms of heat . Conduction vs Convection vs Radiation <URL> <URL> <URL> What happens when you heat something ? A number of things . Proteins Coagulate Starches Gelatinize Sugars Caramelize Water Evaporates Fats Melt Depending on how you cook it , you 're going to get different forms of each of those at different rates . On a stove , you can avoid too much moisture and fat from leaving your food by cooking it extremely quickly ( in a stir-fry ) . . You ca n't sear something in an oven and you ca n't roast something on the stove . The two are simply not the same , because fundamentally the two are not the same , you are not going to get the same results . It 's really as simple as that . You ca n't take two entirely methods and argue that you get the same results .
I trim the stem and remove the outer leaves till they snap to get to the fresh inner core and steam them the night or morning before grilling so they are cold and moist . I prefer steaming because I want all of the nutrients to remain in the artichoke . I cut them in half for the grill , remove the choke and brush them with grapeseed oil where they come into contact with the grill . First , facing down grill them till they feel hot on top then ; flip them over to keep the yummy inner side tender . fill the cavity with garlic butter and ... lemon if you wish . I prefer the brown color to the lemon flavor . I cook them till the butter melts . I like mine barely smokey because artichokes take on the smoke too easily and will taste burned . You ca n't taste the flavor of the artichoke if it gets too smokey .
A metal pan will not crack simply from cold liquid . If you heat it up to a very high temperature and submerge it in cold water , that 's not such a good idea . But deglazing is just a tiny amount of liquid . Now , aluminum is another story - if it 's hot enough and you pour cold water ( or cold anything ) on it , it can warp , even with a relatively small amount of liquid . And for Teflon and other " coated " cookware , you can ruin the coating that way . But heavier steel or cast iron - no way . If you 're really concerned , just keep the deglazing liquid at room temperature . Deglazing is usually done with vinegar and you keep that at room temperature anyway , right ? I deglaze my CI all the time with cider vinegar and have never experienced even the tiniest crack in 10 years . I 'm pretty sure it 's safe . It 's great , actually ; CI deglazes very easily , you just need a small splash of vinegar .
Sandwich or quick bread has different heat requirements than artisan breads . Artisan breads require a blast of high heat and humidity right from the beginning . They are usually baked on flat , preheated stones that store a lot of heat . With breads baked in loaf pans the bread is proofed in the pan which is obviously not preheated . The goal is not a blast of high heat but generally even heating . Stoneware and cast iron will hold a lot of heat but that is n't very useful for this type of bread . The big difference that a stoneware loaf pan will make is in the bread 's crust . Unglazed stoneware will let some moisture escape during baking . Stoneware loaf pans are often used for dishes other than bread such as meatloaf where the even heating and heat retention when serving is valuable . Bread baked in stoneware will be crustier in the area covered by the pan than bread baked in metal . This is a more compelling advantage with quickbreads . In my opinion sandwich bread does n't need to be crusty . Metal bread pans are cheaper , lighter , and less fragile . They wo n't even out any heat gradients in a sloppy oven . If you know your oven is unreliable consider getting a thermal mass ( such as a pizza stone ) to even out the temperature . I have n't used a cast iron loaf pan but my first inclination would be to use it for southern-style cornbread . This type of cornbread is normally cooked in a cast iron skillet . The pan would be preheated with hot fat and the cornbread batter would be poured in . The stored heat in the pan would fry the bread before it rose and set . I do n't know why a cast iron pan would be used for normal bread .
Can you get leached iron from cast iron ? Yes Is it consistent in the amount that you get ? No Is it dependent on the food in the pan ? Yes How much ? <URL> . More liquid , acidic foods leach more . How long its in the pan also plays a role . 3 oz of spaghetti sauce could leach as much as 5mg - that 's almost 1/3 of the <URL> . So you can cook with cast iron to get more iron , but it will vary wildly on what you cook in it . It will also likely increase/decrease based on how well the pan is or is n't seasoned .
I 'd say there are basically two material options . Plain ( seasoned ) cast iron or enameled cast iron . I prefer enameled , because you do n't have to worry about keeping them seasoned -- just wash as you would any other pot -- and the enamel surface is easy to get clean . But they 're also more expensive by a significant margin . A properly maintained plain cast iron one will be awesome too , and do everything enameled will do for less money , so do n't rule it out . What you should consider : The foremost thing you want to look for is a heavy pot . Heavy bottom AND heavy sides and lid . You want something that holds a lot of heat when you need it to , and heavier often means more even heating and better searing ( crucial for braises and pot roasts ) . Consider the lid . It should fit well , without gaps or sliding around . Some have loop handles on the side or on the top , some have a knob on the top . All are fine , but keep in mind that a metal lid handle will be more durable with all the oven time your dutch oven will likely see . They say the plastic ones are OK ( Le Creuset , a trusted brand , uses them so they ca n't be that bad ) but I 'm not 100 % convinced . Whatever handle you get , think about how easy it 'll be to grasp wearing an oven mitt . Handles on the pot itself are a potential issue . Some plain cast iron pots will have a bucket-style bail handle , which I do n't think is that great for the kitchen , especially the oven . These are really intended for campfires and camp stoves , so I 'd avoid them . Sturdy , compact but easy-to-grip handles of any type are good . It 'll be heavy , so make sure you feel secure holding on . Size is another consideration , and it 's a tough one because it 's so individual . I think between 5.5 and 6.5 quarts is pretty standard and works for most cooks . A dutch oven is n't like a stock pot , where big is always good . You want one big enough to cook the things you want , but you do n't want it to be too huge for what you have in there , or you 'll give up a lot of cooking liquid to evaporation too fast . This is less crucial for soups and stews ( I 'd do soup in a regular stock pot ) , but for a braise it 's kind of important . So I would resist going too small , but do n't go too far , especially if you 're always cooking for two people . Also , bigger = heavier , so do n't let your eyes get bigger than your muscles ! Another option is shape , as they generally come in round or oval . Oval sometimes helps people who ca n't decide how big to go . With roasts being generally oblong , an oval pan can fit a proportionally larger roast without getting really huge . With a round pot , your whole pot needs to be at least as big around as your roast is long . Ovals are a little less common , however , and generally do n't come as big as round ones . They 're often more expensive too . Finally , do n't compromise too much on size or cost . Any halfway decent dutch oven , properly looked after , will last much longer than you will . Make sure you 're getting what you want , because you 'll be living with your decision a long time .

How to make bread mould resistant ?
There are many " natural " or " clean label " ingredients that work as mold inhibitors . Most of them work by adding some acid and thereby creating a more inhospitable environment for mold . Some of the popular mold inhibitors ( at least is some U.S. bakeries ) are : cultured whey , vinegar , and raisin juice . I think vinegar and raisin juice are good options for home use . Vinegar Works by adding Acetic acid . The white vinegar you buy in the grocery store is typically 5 % acetic acid ( at least in the U.S. ) . To inhibit mold , the recommended amount is 0.5-2 .0 % of the flour weight of 5 % acetic acid vinegar . Add with your other liquids . Raisin Juice Concentrate Raisin juice concentrate has been shown to be effective at retarding mold and bacteria growth in bread . It works by adding Propionic acid and Tartaric acid . Further , it seems that a home baker should be able to purchase this in reasonable quantities and at a reasonable price . The recommended amount is 5-10 % of flour weight , by weight . Add with your other liquids . My personal experience is positive : I used to purchase a whole-wheat bread with raisin juice concentrate and it lasted forever . This study from the Journal of Food Science , <URL> , found very dramatic increase in shelf life . The mean mold-free shelf life of the bread containing 7.5 % water extract [ of raisins ] was 18.1 + / - 3.3 d at room temperature while the negative control was mold free for 9.4 + / - 2.4 d . The antifungal efficacy of the extracts in bread was equivalent to 0.24 % calcium propionate in 21 d of storage . Doubling the concentration of the extract did not improve the mold-retarding property in bread . The bread containing raisin paste , the percentage of which in dough was equivalent to 15 % raisin extract , exhibited a stronger antifungal activity than did the extracts in bread . Notes Both of these can inhibit yeast activity which you may need to compensate for by increasing yeast or proofing time . Sources : some personal experience , this really interesting article from Oklahoma State University , <URL> , and the study linked above .
I assume you mean sherbet , which is made by mixing 1 cup of powdered sugar ( also called icing or confectioner 's sugar ) with 1 tsp of baking soda ( also called bicarbonate of soda ) and 1 tsp of powdered citric acid . Altering the proportion of soda ( alkali ) to citric acid makes it more or less fizzy .
Yes , you can refrigerate after the machine has kneaded the dough . Cover the bowl tightly . In the morning , take the dough out of the fridge and let it ' wake up ' in a warm place for an hour , cut and shape , then either prove them again or bake straight away ( a second prove will give you a lighter texture ) .
One piece at a time ? Into the bag , shake to coat , out of the bag , shake to remove excess flour , put aside for subsequent egg-washing and breading once all pieces are done . Also helps to have one hand only touching dry ingredients , the other only wet .
You do n't have to use water as the liquid in your bread . Enriched breads use milk and/or eggs . We have recently had questions about breads which use orange juice . On the technical side , you have to adjust recipe a little . Pickle juice does n't have much dissolved solids , so no need to adjust for that . However , it is very salty , so you should reduce or completely leave out the salt . The acidity will help with gluten development and also with breaking down the starches in flour to make them available for chemical reactions which produce more flavour , so this is a good thing to have . However , yeast itself has some strong pH preferences . It grows best in a slightly acidic environment , but if the dough gets too basic or too sour , it will slow down or not grow at all . I think that the diluted vinegar in the pickle water wo n't oversour the dough , but it would be a good idea to make the poolish with pure water and only add pickle water for the dough itself . As for taste , I ca n't say that much without ever having tried it , but my intuition says that you will get a whiff of pickles , but not a full-blown taste . After all , bread made with orange juice does n't taste like biting into an orange . I think you will notice the difference , but you will still have to add pickles to your sandwiches for taste ( and they are needed for the crunch anyway ) . As for horrible , it depends entirely on personal taste . I am not a fan of pickles or soured breads , and would n't eat it . There are people who drink the pickle water from the jar ; I think they will enjoy the pickle-smelling bread too . If you are a pickle fan , I think it is worth a try , if it does n't work , you only throw out under a dollar 's worth of ingredients .
The fourth option is the correct one . The problem is that if you start with oil in the mortar , the pestle will slip and you will not be able to properly mash the rest . What you usually do is : Wash the basil in cold water . Put the leaves on a tea towel and leave them to dry ( you can delicately pat them with another towel ) . You do n't want extra water in the pesto , so be sure the leaves are dry before starting . Traditional pesto is made with <URL> . Start with the garlic ( traditionally <URL> ) and a few grains of rock salt in the mortar . You would generally put 1-2 pips of garlic for ~ 50g basil leaves , but obviously that is up to your taste ( if you were to make Provencal pistou you would probably go for a higher garlic to basil ratio ) . I generally remove the inner part of the garlic ( the anima ) before mashing it . Now add the basil and mash them with a circular movement . You have to be quite delicate when doing this . You 'll see a green liquid forming at the bottom of the mortar . Now add pinenuts and/or the walnuts and finally the cheese . A mix of 36 months-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino ( sardo or romano ) is perfect for pesto . Finally add the extra-virgin olive oil slowly , while mixing . Put in clean pots , let it rest for half an hour , then if necessary cover with some extra oil . Whether you do this in batches or all at once mainly depends on the size of the mortar and how much pesto you are making . If you are making a big amount or have a small mortar repeat the steps for every batch ( I would wash the mortar each time , as it will be oily . Remember to dry it throughly before restarting ) .

Malt syrups and powders come in two forms , Diastatic and Non-Diastatic . The Non-Diastatic kind is just sugar , and is only useful for adding a little sweetness and flavor . Diastatic Malt Syrups and Powders are made by taking grain ( usually barley , but others can be used , like rye ) , allowing it to sprout , then toasting it lightly to halt the sprouting process . The little roots and stuff are rubbed off , and the grain is ground into a powder , or soaked into a syrup . This is very similar to the process used to convert grains for beer-making . The syrup is rich in enzymes that are created by the sprouting grain , for the purpose of converting the seed 's starch reserves into sugar for the young plant . Non-Diastatic versions have these enzymes deactivated by heat , leaving the syrup " inert " . The enzymes and sugars do three important things Provide nutrients for yeast . Facilitate the conversion of starch into sugar , making bread more flavorful . The little shot of extra sugar also gives yeast an initial boost . Here is an article on malt syrups and powders and how to make them yourself : <URL> And King Arthur Flour sells a version of the powder , along with some recipe examples : <URL>
The proportions on everything look correct ( including the milk ! ) EXCEPT that is a very small amount of butter for 3C flour . There is also no sugar in that recipe -- and even a very small amount of sugar will change the texture of the dough . I personally would triple the amount of butter , add 2-3T sugar , and then re-try the recipe . VERY cold butter will also help with a lighter finished baked scone . As for the comment that the oven time is too hot and long -- the temperature is good -- but I would think the baking time would fall more in the range of 15-20 minutes , depending upon whether you are baking from frozen dough or freshly made scone dough . A hot oven , as opposed to a moderate oven ( 350 degrees F -- normal for cookies and cakes ) is recommended for biscuits and scones . Since all ovens bake differently , rely less on the actual time and more on how the scone looks -- it should be lightly golden on top and not doughy in appearance in the center . A cake tester can be used to be certain that the center is fully baked . good luck -- it always seems to take a little effort to find the scone recipe that you think is perfect !!
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
Dry biscuits ( American ' biscuits ' - not cookies ) , or anything other flour based quick bread that dried out - if you 're trying to replicate the bread crumbs . You may be able to get by with a modified muffin recipe as well . You 'll want to avoid fats and oils to reduce the moistness . Yeast bread develops a particular flavor and larger hole structure than quick bread though . The flavor of a quick bread breadcrumbs should be slightly different , but in many dishes the subtle difference wo n't be overwhelming unless the breading is a ' star ' of the dish . The hole structure really does n't matter luckily - as developing that is a large part of the time factor of real bread . Drying it out will be the harder part . The denser structure holds moisture better , so slice it thin and give it low , dry , long heat . Personally , anything that you 're going to make for the purpose of breadcrumbs that is n't just a substitute ( like cereal , crackers , etc in the other answer ) , sounds like it 'd be easier just to make a loaf of fast rise bread to me .
You 'll want to temper the melted chocolate . This means holding it at 88 ° F ( 31 ° C ) while it cools until it is completely hardened , then finally allowing it to return to room temperature ( or lower ) afterward . If you temper the chocolate this way , it will be much harder and last indefinitely at room temperature . The easiest way to temper chocolate is the " seed method " , which means adding a piece of solid ( never-melted ) chocolate to the fully-melted chocolate after removing it from the heat source and stirring thoroughly until the temperature reaches 88 ° F / 31 ° C , and then keeping it at that temperature until you 're ready to use it . ( Note that this is for dark chocolate ; for temperatures for other types of chocolate and for a more detailed guide to tempering , I suggest you check out the <URL> . ) The technical explanation for this is that the temperature at which melted chocolate hardens determines its final consistency as a solid . If chocolate hardens at room temperature , it ends up forming a very weak crystalline structure that begins to melt at even the slightest rise in temperature ( i.e. in your hand ) . Allowing it to solidify at the highest possible temperature below the actual melting point ensures that it forms a denser crystalline structure and will not melt at room temperature .
A roux normally is equal parts fat and flour . It should be fairly solid , not runny . However , it is an individual decision . I 've known guys who like it quite solid ( like me ) , but you have to whisk the hell out of it to get out all of the lumps . Normally , if I am making a sauce or soup that I ca n't strain , I will make it a little slack . I also add my roux after so I can control the thickness of the sauce or soup . Normally you are not instructed to do so , but you have greater control . If you do it this way , you have to vigorously whisk while adding , or the starches will congeal together in lumps . No big deal if it you are able to strain , but ...
I would say there are 2 problems here : the lack of water , and the constant stirring . Try adding 1/4 cup of water to the sugar - this should stop it catching and burning . You should avoid stirring caramelising sugar because you run the risk of flicking bits of it onto the side of the pan . These isolated bits cook faster and thus burn , then drop into the rest of the sugar . Result : bitter caramel . Stirring also promotes crystallisation , which is not what you want for a smooth sauce . If you have to stir it , do it slowly , carefully , and infrequently - only as much as necessary to distribute the water evenly through the sugar . I would also use a sugar or probe thermometer to ensure you 're not over-cooking the sugar - get it to 350ºF , then take it off heat . This will take 6-8 minutes , and it will be a dark amber colour . Let it stand for 1 minute before whisking in your cream ( I normally gently heat the cream beforehand by the way , and add a teaspoon of sea salt to it , because salted caramel is effing gorgeous ) .
Try brushing the tortilla with oil , and baking it upside down over a steel bowl .
I am going to get " unsciency " as I used to make fries for hours on end at a local mom and pop shop . How thin / thick does n't really matter , you 'll just have to adjust your frying time accordingly . 1 ) Use a starchy potato 2 ) slice your potato evenly , with a peeler if you do n't have a slicer or mandolin 3 ) soak them in water for 30 mins with a pinch of salt 4 ) let them dry a bit 5 ) blanch them with vegetable oil until they are limpy but has no visible color change ( Oil should be hot enough that when you put them in , 5 seconds later there are bubbles ) 6 ) cool them completely , I throw them into a container into the fridge 7 ) refried them by putting in enough pieces in such that it will still bubble immediately ( oil should be hot enough when you drop a spot of water or chop sticks in that it bubble immediately , but you would n't hear like a crackling or have oil splashing at you ) 8 ) Take them out one piece at a time as they change color . The key is vegetable that 's pretty much the only oil that makes things cripsy at lower frying temperature , other than bacon fat , this makes a much more golden chip , and generally a easier time to control , so you can make more at the same time . Shortening , olive oil , peanut oil , butter , lard has been tested and is n't really good . Sesame oil is good too if you like the taste of it . Also , do n't attempt to drain the oil after blanching , the oil will come out when you re-fry them . Salt or season while warm .
Adding salt and lemon should do it , or at least help a lot . What you want to do is to chop them up and rub in a little salt and a splash of lemon juice ( vinegar should work too ) . Obviously you do n't want to add so much of either that you wo n't want to eat the onion . Leave to sit in the fridge overnight and enjoy .
Preface : I 'm not a big fan of fruit-flavored stuff ( I like fresh fruit by itself , just not in stuff ... ) so I ca n't speak to these from personal experience . For fresh fruit , puree in a blender or similar . Moist fruits can probably be pureed in their own juices ; otherwise , you 'll need to add some . You 'll probably want to add some sugar , but offset this by reducing the sugar you add to the ice cream mix . ( Seeds might be an issue too - get seedless if possible . ) As Manako suggested , you can also cook it down and then puree , though this will result in a wetter mixture than with their natural juices alone . This will also present a different flavor profile from the fresh fruit , so experiment to find what you like . Another possibility would be to cook out some of the water from your puree . In any case , you 'll want to reduce the liquid ingredients of your normal recipe by roughly the same amount as the pureed fruit you 're adding . In light of the previous item , you 'll probably want to use a higher-fat cream than normal , since the fruit will add a lot of water . Unlike " chunky " additions , you do n't really care that the ice cream should be at a thick consistency before you add them . ( for suspension ) I 'd just add it directly to the mix before you start churning .
Gravity is making the petals open . If you look at the shape of the petals their center of gravity is towards the outside of the bowl , but they are being held in place by something underneath . I suspect that it 's simply one piece of chocolate melted onto another . When the custard ( warm or hot ) is poured on it melts the bonds holding the petals in place allowing them to fall .
The primary coloring agents in a traditional black Russian loaf are molasses and dark rye flour .

Though possible to obtain leaves and perform the distillation , it 's probably not practical on a small scale outside of the tea tree production regions . For completeness , <URL> is toxic ; you do n't want to eat it . What you used was conventional tea leaves . The tea beverage is made by steeping ( soaking in hot water ) leaves of the <URL> , which have been dried or otherwise prepared ( e.g. , fermented , roasted , etc. ) .

Is low sodium salt really effective ?
I 'd say that 's not strictly true , mostly because no salt substitute I 've ever seen can get the same taste anyway . " Real " salt is sodium chloride ( and maybe iodine , or minor impurities if it 's sea salt ) . Most salt substitutes are partly or mostly potassium chloride . This is technically a salt ( chemically speaking ) and does have a similar salty taste , but it does n't taste quite like sodium chloride , and can be bitter or metallic-tasting . Some salt substitutes add herbs or other things to help make the potassium chloride more palatable . Sounds like your has some " regular " salt as well , if it 's got a significant sodium content . So while you are right that there 's likely a " catch , " it 's more likely to be that your salt substitute will never taste quite right , or will be bitter , and less likely that you 'll be piling loads of extra on in an effort to get the right saltiness .
You 've got a few things to consider -- cost of the ingredients shrinkage energy costs time costs wastage So , in our decision making tree , we have to consider the real costs of each option . Say for instance that whole roasts are on sale , so the cost of a roast is 1/2 the cost of buying the deli meat . The roast is going to lose weight as it cooks ... it 's just part of the cooking process . It could be anywhere from 10 to 25 % , depending on the cut of meat and how hot you cook it . Obviously , there will be other spices and such , but we 'll assume they 're mostly negligible . There will be the cost to power your oven ... and that 'd be a function of where you live , if it 's gas or electric ( or solar ) , etc ... and if you make too much , and ca n't eat it before it spoils , then there 's waste . ... but then we get to the most important part in my opinion -- time , and slicing . Even if we assume our time costs nothing ( and when you 're throwing something in the oven and leave it for a few hours , that part 's negligible ) . Our real time comes in slicing it -- and I do n't have a professional slicing machine , just a bunch of knives , so it 's going to take me quite a long time , and I 'm not going to get it as thin as the deli can . And in my opinion , it 's the shaving of the meat that matters ; there 's a big difference between large chunks of meat vs. thick slices vs. thinly shaved . ... So , in my opinion -- is it cost effective ? maybe a little bit , if you assume your time is free . Is it worth it ? Maybe if you want to spice it special , or make it lower salt , stay away from sulfides / sulfates , or do something else special ... but as you likely ca n't slice it the same , it 's more likely to come out as an inferior product . That 's not to say that I wo n't ever do it , but I doubt I 'd do it anytime soon , and it wo n't be because I think it 's a cost savings .
Here are a few rules I follow with my own knives . Do n't put your knives in the dishwasher . Hand wash and dry immediately after use . Store knives where they wo n't be banging up against other hard things : my favorite is in a wooden knife block . If you must store your knives in a drawer , protect the edge . You can use a commercial solution <URL> , or cardboard and tape if you 're on a shoestring budget . Do n't cut on a glass cutting board . They look nice , but will dull your edge . <URL> . A steel is not for sharpening , but for maintaining a sharp edge . Honing with a steel before each use will help keep the edge straight and sharp . Do n't use dull knives . Either <URL> , or have them professionally sharpened . Slightly off topic , but if you 're a starving college student who wants to have a high-quality knife or two at a very reasonable price , take a look at <URL> . Yes , the Swiss Army Knife people . I was turned on to them by professional chefs , and have found them every bit as high-quality as my much-more-expensive Henckels and Wustof-Trident knives .
In sum : YES , sugar DOES really help to extract fruit flavors . The answer quoted in the edit does NOT imply that " absorption is slowed down " in general . It merely states that in a sugar solution , sugar will generally not move out of fruit ; it does n't say anything about what else happens . Osmosis is simply a process by which the stuff on both sides of a barrier tries to come to equilibrium . Increasing sugar content in a solution will only decrease the amount of sugar that comes out of the fruit , but it will often simultaneously increase the water that diffuses out ( along with many things dissolved in that water , like fruit flavors ) . In other words , in a plain water solution , sugar will diffuse out of fruit to raise the water 's sugar concentration . However , in most cases when a sugar solution is used , it is deliberately higher in concentration than the sugar content within the fruit cells ( as in the strawberry example mentioned in the question , where there is basically no water at first outside the fruit , so water is forced out to bring the system into better equilibrium ) . Sugar is very <URL> , which basically means it attracts water . If the sugar solution has a higher sugar content than the moisture within the fruit cells ( as is true in most recipes using this technique ) , water will diffuse out of the fruit . Anything that is water-soluble , such as various flavor components , will come along with it to some extent . Meanwhile , sugar will also be forced into the fruit , changing its texture -- when done in excess over a period of time , such a process can actually preserve the fruit by lowering the water content substantially ( driving it out into the solution ) while raising the internal sugar content of the fruit , resulting in <URL> . You may note that candied fruit generally lacks many of the flavors of fresh fruit . This is because many flavor components were extracted along with the water by the sugar solution . Regarding questions that were raised in comments , the same process occurs with alcohol in a solution . There 's almost no alcohol inside the fruit , so alcohol 's presence outside the fruit will force water out of the fruit , carrying flavors along with it . Alcohol also tends to dissolve certain flavor components that water does n't dissolve as well , so it will gather different sets of flavors than water alone . Note also that different flavor components will come out of the interaction of this osmosis process with the cell membrane compared to , say , simply crushing the fruit , again partly because some flavor molecules are more soluble in alcohol .
Salt is not necessary , it 's just a flavour thing , a common personal preference I suspect you 'll get a saltier taste by putting it in the water , than putting it in the sauce for the same volume of salt Hot water is not necessary too , you can prepare dried pasta with cold water . But it does n't taste right to me , so does salt less pasta :-)
A few general reasons : As soegaard says , the salt is often better distributed through the food if it 's added during cooking . This is especially true for foods which have been carefully assembled ; you ca n't always just stir things up ! Some foods also take a while for flavors to soak through ; think about potatoes in a chunky soup . If you add salt only at the table , the liquid will benefit , but the potatoes will generally taste bland , like they were unsalted . Then there are things where it really needs to be cooked in - I doubt many people want to sprinkle salt on a chocolate chip cookie . Sometimes the quantities need to be pretty small , so mixing a small amount into the whole recipe is doable , while if you tried to add it at the table , even a little sprinkle would be too much . Baked goods are a good example here too . Virtually everyone likes at least a little salt , so it 's usually quite safe to add at least a little . The food will end up tasting good to many people , and then some can add more . Often the groups of people that we eat with have similar enough tastes that it 's a non-issue . Sometimes salt actually affects the cooking process , not just the flavor . It can help draw moisture out of sweating vegetables , softening them faster . It 's abrasive ( before dissolving , of course ) , and can help denature proteins . But of course , if you 're eating with people who do n't like much salt at all , and salt can easily be added at the table ( a pureed soup , for example ) , then there 's nothing wrong with waiting until then .
As with all can goods , as long as the can has no physical defects ( meaning swollen or dented , ectera ) , the contents should still be good . The date on the outside is mainly a best by date , after which a company will no longer vouch for the contents contained therein .
You 're going to have to start over with new chocolate . I 'm sorry to say it but there 's no way to remove the salt from the chocolate .
What you describe are definitely symptoms of coagulating protein . Not all proteins in quark are coagulated , else it would n't be creamy but rubbery like mozzarella ( actually , more like cottage cheese , because it would still be grainy ) . My first guess is that the blueberry acid curdles the protein . Blueberries are also known to act a bit strangely due to their high pectin content , I once left blueberry-banana puree in the fridge with the intention to freeze it to sorbet when I come back from work , only to find it gelled too hard to go through the machine . But I doubt that this was the culprit in your case , if anything , hydrating pectin would have bound the water and prevented the proteins from the curdling . Setting pectin would have created a mass which is firm , but not grainy , and without a separate watery phase . As for the bitter taste , many fruits will create an unpleasant taste when exposed to dairy for a long time . Kiwis are especially bad offenders , but some melon cultivars are just as bad . I have n't noticed it in blueberries , but I do n't know if I have ever mixed them . Also , there are different plants known as " blueberry " , most of them just different cultivars , but the American and European variety are distinct species . It is possible that only some of them have this problem . If you want to prevent the curdling problem , you can add stuff which will get in the way of the proteins looking for a buddy to curdle with . Fat and sugar are very good in this respect - this is why you can make lemon tarts pretty well , you do n't curdle the custard despite the acid lemon juice just because the sugar content is so high . If you are trying to create a low-calorie snack , you can try gelling agents instead , which will not only reduce the curdling rate , but also sponge up the water when a bit of curdling occurs , leaving the final texture more pleasant . But it will also change the texture a lot , making it less creamier ( the one creamy binding , starch , ca n't be used without cooking ) and more like a jelly . Also you might get weird synergies between the natural pectin and the new binding agent , ending up with surprisingly firm food . In short , the best option is to just eat it right away . Everything else has drawbacks , and is not a complete solution in the sense that it probably wo n't stop the curdling completely .
Trying to get to the bottom of the issue , I decided to take a few pictures of a few different types of salt . The pictures shown below were taken by me and are all proportional ( the camera was the same distance away from each type of salt , so you are getting an accurate size comparison ) . The picture illustrates my suspicions , which is the difference is the surface area ( ignoring of course mineral content and different types of grinding salt ) . Standard table salt is a compact little cube , effective when it 's to be dissolved in a liquid , but not so much when it comes to direct contact with the taste buds . Place one cube on your tongue and you get 1/6th of the surface area in contact , meaning , a lot of salt without much saltiness . Sea salt , with a more rectangular shape is closer to 1/4th the surface area touching your tongue . Ground salt is more like shards of glass , so nearly half of the exposed area could be in contact making things taste that much more salty . Also with a much finer texture , you are left with many more particles in a wider area , meaning , a saltier taste with less salt . It 's a good way of finishing a dish when the salt is going to be lightly dusted on top or mixed with an oil where it will not dissolve at all . When you are dissolving it in a liquid , it really makes little difference which type you use . When it comes down to it , it 's all about how picky you want to be with it .
Depending on what the ginger is going into , lightly greasing your knife blade helps ( but , obviously , not if you 're putting them in something where a tiny bit of oil would be an issue ) . As does using a heavy carbon-steel knife like a Chinese cleaver . Freezing sounds attractive , but it does n't work because the ginger becomes impossible to chop -- too hard . Overall , you pretty much have to expect to scrub the knife and cutting board after you 're done . You can make it a bit easier on yourself , but you ca n't make chopping candied ginger not messy .
I 'm not a coffee drinker , so ca n't comment on the timing -- but it 's due to <URL> .
The classic way to compensate for saltiness ( especially in Asian cuisine ) is to add something sweet ( usually sugar ) , which tricks one 's taste-buds into thinking that the food is both less salty and less sweet . ( Ever wonder why a can of cola has 45 + mg of sodium ? It 's there partially to mask all the sweetness which gives you a sugar rush , and simultaneously make you thirstier ! ) I seem to recall reading a section on this phenomenon in <URL> , but my copy is back home . I 'll try and post an excerpt later today . Update # 2 : I ca n't seem to find any mention of saltiness inhibitors in OFaC , however , there is a section on sweetness inhibitors ( cf. page 663 ) so I must have been confusing it with that . Update # 1 : I have n't gotten a chance to look at OFaC yet , however , I did find this study : <URL> by Keast and Breslin . Journal of Food Quality and Preference , 14 ( 2 ) 111 -- 124 . March , 2003 . Elsevier . It is a survey of research on both perceived and chemical reactions between different tastes . When compounds eliciting tastes are mixed many outcomes are possible , including perceptual enhancement and suppression , unmasking of a taste not initially observed , or possibly chemical synthesis of a new taste . The survey notes ( see Sections 3.2 and 3.3 ) : At medium and high intensities/concentrations sweetness was generally suppressive of other basic tastes . and also Sweetness suppressed salty taste at moderate intensities . It goes on to note that at even higher concentrations sweetness and other tastes are symmetrically suppressive ( i.e. , their tastes cancel each other out ) .
Iodine is commonly added to table salt , hence the term " Iodized " . This is purely a public health issue , much like fluoridation of water . The human body needs small quantities of Iodine for good health , and salt was the method chosen to give it to us . Just as fluoride is added to water , and Vitamin D is added to milk . It actually has nothing to do with the product , it 's just a convenient carrier . See : <URL> for more information .
No , these are completely different products . As you indicate , so called " <URL> lt " is a mixture of sodium chloride ( regular salt ) and sodium nitrate ( or sodium nitrite ) for curing meats , tinted pink to distinguish it from regular table salt . it allows relatively accurate small batch curing , as in home sausage making . <URL> is a naturally mined rock salt , whose impurities can tint it a variety of colors , including pinkish , from iron oxide . Hawaiian pink salt is another naturally harvested salt whose red clay impurities tint it a pink color .
After extended pressure cooking ( or any liquid cooking , for that matter ) the vegetables ' cell walls ( composed primarily of flavorless <URL> ) have broken down to the point where they 're barely holding together , and are basically mush . Most of the flavor and nutrients contained within those cells has escaped into the liquid at that point . There might be a bit left in the solids to extract , but very little practical way to do so . It 's probably more accurate to say that the vegetables have given up enough that they 're unpalatable . You could eat them , but they would n't be anywhere as pleasant as fresh vegetables , and would offer little nutrition separate from the broth itself . I suppose you could puree them ( though you 'd be turning flavorless , starchy mush into smoother flavorless , starchy mush ) but they have little culinary value left . At most they would be filling , but probably unpleasant to eat . On the other hand , if you look outside of culinary applications , they make great compost .
They do n't correspond to a temperature , they correspond to a rate of heat input . The elements in your oven are connected to a thermostat with regulates their temperature , they are really constant heat/fixed temperature devices , like the heat in your home . The oven turns the elements on and off to regulate temperature , but the elements are only ever ON or OFF . The stovetop elements , by contrast , are variable heat/variable temperature . There is no thermostat , but the elements can be variably adjusted between MAX and OFF . For every setting the temperature will just keep getting hotter and hotter ( unless something is removing the heat , like cooking food ) - the higher settings will just get hotter faster . The important thing to know ( for an electric range ) is the wattage of the elements - most 8 " elements are ~ 2500W , and most 6 " elements are ~ 1500W . But there is a lot of variability . Additionally , if you are living in a home with 240V power but have recently lived in an apartment ( which likely had 208V power , but 240V elements installed in the oven , even if you did n't realize it ) , your heater elements will seem much hotter than before . It is also possible that the oven maker or previous owner installed higher wattage elements ( perhaps by installing elements intended for a 208V service in a home with 240V service , which would have the effect of " turbocharging " them a bit ) . Temperature measured with an IR thermometer may not be useful for you to determine if your oven is hotter than usual , since an empty pan on Low will still reach 400 + degrees ( it will just get there slower ) . What might be more useful is to find out what setting people do certain cooking tasks at , and see if that is different than what works on your oven . You can also remove the elements and find the voltage/wattage stamped on the bottom - let us know what those values are and we may be able to tell you if they are abnormally high . Personally , I sweat onions on 4/10 , fry an egg at 6/10 , simmer soup at 2/10 , and maintain 1 gallon water at a consistent , but not vigorous boil at 8/10 .
I 'll leave the question of food safety and mandatory canning or not with regard to ingredients to others , but frankly , if you have a large pot in your kitchen you have a canner . For small batches and only very occasional use , there is no need to buy a separate canner . Place a small metal rack ( if you have one small enough ) or a folded towel on the bottom of the pot ( I like to use my pasta pot with the insert ) , put jars on top and fill with water until almost to the top of the tallest jar . Yes , you can process jars of different sizes in one batch . Rule of thumb : cold jars go in cold water , hot jars in hot water . This setup is equivalent to a separate canner minus the extra gadgets like timer , thermometer / thermostat and other features that are for your comfort and ease of use , not essential for the physical process of heating and sealing the jars . So if you want to play it safe , put your sauce in the jars1 , add lids and screw them on with the bands " fingertip tight " . Place them in the water bath and slowly bring to a boil . Once your water is simmering , " canning time " starts . Off the cuff , ten to fifteen minutes should be fine for a cooked BBQ sauce , longer is n't a problem either . After that , lift the jars out and cool slowly in a drought-free area . If done correctly the lid will stick to the jar even without the bands , so you get an extra safety mechanism : If your sauce should spoil , the lid will come off , being a clear indication of trouble . But my main reason why I suggest canning the jars is this : If you ship your sauce , you have no control over the storage conditions of your jars during transit and - depending on the destination - constant refrigeration or similar might not be possible everywhere on this world . That alone would be reason enough to do the extra step , which is surprisingly easy once you give it a try . I suggest leaving the rings on during shipping and instructing the recipient to remove them on arrival to notice any signs of spoilage . 1 This includes the usual steps done even without canning , e.g. cleaning the jars and lids , " sterilizing " them in your oven or in boiling water , keeping the rims of the jars clean and filling the hot food immediately into the jars . In short , what you would normally do to ensure general cleanliness and food safety .
<URL> ( Food and Drugs ) of the Code of Federal Regulation states " ( d ) When foods characterized on the label as " nondairy " contain a caseinate ingredient , the caseinate ingredient shall be followed by a parenthetical statement identifying its source . For example , if the manufacturer uses the term " nondairy " on a creamer that contains sodium caseinate , it shall include a parenthetical term such as " a milk derivative " after the listing of sodium caseinate in the ingredient list " According to <URL> on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 's website , the term " non-dairy " is actually a by-product of the dairy lobby 's efforts to make sure that substitute milk and cream products could not use the term dairy rather than the FDA trying to specify that something did n't contain any dairy .
Yes , the flavor is definitely affected . First , there is the point of solubility . Salt does n't dissolve all that easily in water , and unlike many other crystals , its solubility does n't improve with heat . So you have to either stir a lot , or let the dish to sit for a longer time after the salt is added , or both . Else you end up with uneven salting in liquid dishes like soups . Thicker things like sauces are very marginal , and if you add salt to cooked dry stuff ( steaks , casseroles and whatnot ) , you 're guaranteed to end up with clumps . But even if you succeed in getting your salt evenly distributed , the flavor is different . The liquid components may be OK , but anything solid ( pasta , meat , vegetables , whatever ) will not be penetrated by the salt . So if you salt your dish to the point where the liquid tastes normal , you get bland pieces swimming in an OK sauce or broth . At that point , most people just automatically think that it is still bland , and continue to salt , resulting in oversalted broth/sauce with bland veggies , which in my opinion is even worse . Third , the salt is n't used only to add taste . A saline solution 's chemical properties are quite different from those of pure ( or tap ) water . Marinading with salt ( with or without liquid ) changes the texture of steaks ( but does so rather slowly ) . Vegetables cook firmer in salty water , instead of getting mushy . And then there are all the amazing things it does to grains ( because it affects both starches and gluten ) . In short , do n't bake a yeast dough without a pinch of salt . Sadly , all this means that there is no way for both of you to eat what you want/should . My advice is that you should definitely salt the food even for the low-sodium eater at the proper cooking time , you just should use a much smaller amount - even a gram of salt per liter of water can be useful for the chemical changes you want , and should n't add too much of a sodium load to a normal sized portion . As for bringing your portion to your own taste , you will have to put up with the worse saltening . Just take care not to oversalt as a reaction , it does n't really help .

What distinguishes pork sausage from ground pork ?
Ground pork is simply that , pork . Pork sausage is ground pork that has been seasoned . You can substitute , but you 'll have to bring your own seasoning .
YUM ! I lived in Seoul for a year , Bo Ssam is one of the best things I 've ever tasted . You 're using pork shoulder ( butt ) right ? If so , no oil is necessary . There is plenty of fat in the pork .
Here 's a picture of some raw ground beef from the Wikipedia <URL> article so that you can see for yourself . Basically it is beef that has been run through a meat grinder , great for making taco meat , hamburgers , and the like .
The bone structure is an excellent clue -- each of these three cuts have completely different bones -- and you should be able to learn to distinguish the muscle structures easily as well . ( There 's almost certainly a price difference , too -- I 'd expect a shoulder steak to be the cheapest , followed by leg , then loin and rib . ) I 've made some quick structural drawings , and I 'll try to describe them in detail . Rib and Loin <URL> The loin is a long piece of muscle running alongside the backbone and atop the ribs . It will be cut vertically , giving a oval/oblong cross-section somewhere around 4 " diameter . That oval is solid muscle , although there may be some streaks of fat . There will usually be another strip of muscle above it , and a strip of fat along the top and one side ( this was the pig 's insulating back fat ) . Opposite the fat will be a rib bone , if it has n't been removed . The bone will not be split , but it will be cut short at some point . It is convex towards the fat , and usually has some of the fat running down along its length . If the rib is there , the steak ( or " chop " ) will have a smaller oval of muscle below the loin , separated by fat , which would otherwise be served as part of the rib meat . As the cuts of the loin move backwards towards the leg , the tenderloin may begin to be incorporated , and the rib will disappear . The tenderloin is perhaps half the loin 's size , and appears on the opposite side from the loin of a slice of the backbone , which has a rib-like sideways protrusion . This cut is the " porterhouse " , also known as the " T-bone " if the steak were beef . It may also be called a " loin chop " , as opposed to the " rib chop " from futher forward . Rib/loin chop summary description : oval/oblong of solid meat with a strip of fat at one side , possibly an intact bone on the opposite side , curving towards the fat . Possibly two ovals of meat , one half the size and on the opposite side of a protrusion of split bone from the larger . Ham or Leg <URL> The part of the leg you 're getting for steaks is the upper part , i.e. the thigh , sliced horizontally . This has a single cylindrical bone -- the femur -- running through it , which will be around 1 1/2 " diameter and off-center . The thigh is basically oval in cross-section , and made up of several large muscles , with fascia ( silver skin ) and a small amout of fat between them , so you will see four to half a dozen large pieces of muscle in the steak . There may be a strip of fat along one side , and perhaps even some skin attached to that . A leg steak is the same cut as a " ham steak " , although " ham " is often used to mean that the meat has been cured , and possibly even cooked . Leg summary description : Oval-shaped steak with a circular slice of bone off-center . The steak is composed of half a dozen sections of meat , possibly separated by thin strips of fat , and may have a strip of fat on one outer side . Shoulder or Blade <URL> The shoulder is a beautiful cut of meat on a pig , made up of dozens of pockets of marbled muscle , connected and wrapped by intermuscular fat , as well as an extension of the loin . Like leg , a shoulder also has just one bone , the blade ( which connects via a socket to the arm-bone near the bottom of the shoulder ) . The shoulder blade ( scapula ) is somewhere in the center of the shoulder , and is , as you would expect , a thin , arrow-head-shaped formation , with a flat ridge running down its center ; from the top , it looks a bit like U +22 A6 : ⊦ . ( This protrusion or spur points to the outside of the pig . ) Therefore , a slice across this shoulder muscle will be made up of several pieces of white-streaked muscle , held in a web of fat , and it will either have a fully-enclosed thin segment of bone in it , or a split where the bone was removed . With the bone left in , I believe the cuts are usually made horizontally , and the muscle segments may appear larger ( they are mostly longer than they are tall ) . With it removed , the slice could be made vertically , in which case you will see more , and smaller , pieces . There may also be a strip of fat along one side of a shoulder steak ; this is the same under-skin fat that you saw in both other cuts . Shoulder summary description : Vaguely rectangular piece of meat , with a thin slice of bone in the center . The bone may have a perpendicular ridge . The meat is in many small pieces and is webbed with fat . For less diagrammatic images , this <URL> seems to have some good photos of the various cuts , grouped by the section of the pig .
After washing them , fill them with a mild bleach solution ( one tablespoon for each cup of water ) and let them out in the sun exposing the stain for a whole day . Make sure children and animals can not reach the containers with bleach . There used to be a product called Cascade Plastic Booster that you could add to your dishwasher that would remove the stains . It 's no longer sold but its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide at 5 % , which you may buy in most drugstores .
A Southerner will probably tell you that there is no type of BBQ sauce to go with this type of pulled pork because it 's not actually real pulled pork ... or real BBQ . Authentic pulled pork is smoked , and that comes with a completely different set of pairings . This is technically just braised , shredded pork . Which is not meant as a criticism , mind you - I often make a similar recipe in the winter time using a dutch oven . But terminology is important here because there 's a huge difference in flavour between pulled pork and braised pork . I 'll note for the record that any kind of slow-cooking will make a pork shoulder fall right apart ; you do not need the root beer ( which is n't that acidic anyway , and <URL> ) to tenderize the pork . The heat and moisture do that all by themselves , although root beer is as good a choice as any if you 're braising . Now onto the flavouring . Because the braise , unlike smoke , only minimally flavours the meat , you 're going to need strong flavours from elsewhere . If you 're really trying to mimic an authentic Southern-style pulled pork then you need to incorporate the smoky flavour somehow , which means using a smoky BBQ sauce ( hickory is common ) or better yet , incorporate this flavour at the very beginning of the cooking process by applying a dry rub containing smoked paprika or including a small amount of liquid smoke in the braise . If you do use a rub then the other flavours are up to you - there are plenty of recipes out there - just do n't use salt in it because pork already has plenty . As with any braise , stick to aromatics like garlic/onion powder , various chili powders/peppers , cinnamon , etc. . Once you 've successfully incorporated the smoke ( or what passes for smoke in indoor cooking ) then a little sauce goes a long way . Definitely incorporate some of the leftover braising liquid so as not to waste those delicious drippings - I use about half of it but that 's with a much milder braise . Ketchup and dijon mustard in a 50/50 to 60/40 ratio is very simple and surprisingly effective when mixed in with the juices . If you still find this to be lacking punch , you can throw in some cider vinegar , which pairs well with both the pork shoulder and your root beer braise . I actually boil off the pan ( after reserving some braising liquid ) and use cider vinegar as a deglazer for the fond , but since you 're using a crock pot ( or equivalent ) , you probably wo n't have much/any fond and this would require an extra vessel , so ... just throw a splash or two into the finished sauce , and reduce if that makes it a bit watery . Worcestershire sauce is also a good way to punch up any homemade sauce , and if it starts to get too intense or tangy from either that or the vinegar , tone it down with some brown sugar or molasses if you have any . If you 're dead-set on following the recipe to the letter , then , as above , I think I 'd choose a hickory or mesquite sauce , something smoky and not overly thick . Some of the better brands/products will actually include a small amount of alcohol , like whisky or bourbon . Almost all will contain onion , garlic , paprika , sugar , molasses , and vinegar ( often cider vinegar , as above ) - not surprisingly , exactly the same kinds of ingredients as I 'm suggesting in the dry rub and homemade sauce .
I would recommend separating the crackling from the meat and re-heating both separately . The meat can go into the oven ( or the microwave ) , the crackling can go under the grill ( aka broiler ) .
The slime is called mucilage . It is around the seeds on the inside of the pod . It is made of protein and carbohydrates including fiber . The mucilage is ( as you alluded in your question ) used for thickening gumbos and similar stews . Besides this , I 've only ever seen it referred to as an annoyance and avoided by leaving the pod whole or dry cooking like frying . I imagine there could be some creative halloween uses of mucilage but those would be off topic for this site . :) EDIT I was embarrassed that this answer was the accepted answer . I do n't like answers that are ( as mine was ) " no that is n't possible because I 've never heard of it . " I was hoping someone else would shatter my world with some amazing new use of okra slime . My curiosity piqued I used some of my copious free time while code compiled to do some more research . I was able to find a couple of non traditional okra recipes that seemed interesting - such as candied okra slices or using the seeds from pickled okra as a caviar-like dish . But none of them took advantage of the mucilage - they all avoided it . Carbohydrate based mucilage is used in ice cream and for other reasons . I found the following study about food health that did experiments with replacing milk fat with specifically okra mucilage ( they refer to it as " okra gum " ) <URL> Two pertinent quotes : " Although not currently produced by food manufacturers , previous studies produced fat-free chocolate bar cookies with acceptable sensory characteristics using okra gum as a fat ingredient substitute . " " Specifically , color and smell of frozen dairy desserts containing okra gum replacement for milk fat did not significantly differ from the control product . Texture , flavor , aftertaste , and overall acceptability ratings also averaged five or higher ( neutral to like ) for all products . " The study was about replacing milk fat where I think it would be more interesting as an enhancer as you asked in your question . It seems perfectly reasonable that okra mucilage could find a place in more modern recipes . But I could n't find anyone doing it .
By " Italian Sausage " I think you mean the seasoned pork sausage available in many supermarkets throughout the US . I 've found that a 30-70 mix of beef and turkey/chicken works reasonably well as a substitute when pork is not available . Beef is too strong a flavor and turkey too weak in its own . Flavor-wise most italian sausage has red wine , fennel , and oregano .
Sausages are pretty forgiving . As long as you do n't burn them or leave the center raw , they should come out OK . Since they 're pretty fatty ( at least the good ones are ) there 's little chance of drying them out , so when in doubt , cook them a little longer . They 'll feel firm , not squishy , when they 're done . The easiest way to cook raw sausages is in the oven ( at 350-375 ° F , 180-190 ° C or so ) . If you 're doing it on the stove , I 'd brown them first in a little ( very little ) oil , then add some water , or beer , or wine , or whatever you happen to have ( not much - just enough to cover the bottom ) , cover , reduce the heat , and simmer until done . Feel free to cook some vegetables in the pan along with the sausage .
I always just give fresh basil a chop and toss it in . You can use fresh herbs raw or cooked in any fashion you wish and find delicious . They are fairly forgiving as long as you do n't let them spoil or burn them .
The term " ground red pepper " is ambiguous in English . Things sold under that name in the US have a wide range of heats , and likely are made from multiple varieties of peppers , though I 'd say they 're more commonly hot things like cayenne , or other varieties with somewhat less heat . That said , do n't worry about it too much in these cases . Anything from mild paprika to cayenne would likely fit within what the authors meant , and you 're not going to harm a recipe by increasing or decreasing the heat , or by using a chile powder with a slightly different flavor . Just use something ( or a blend ) that provides the heat level you want , and you 'll be fine .
To expand upon baka 's comment : this would taste good without the cumin too ; it 'd just be a simpler flavor . You can then replace it with any other spice that appeals to you , since pork 's flavor is n't going to strongly clash with many spices . ElendilTheTall 's answer suggests one option ; I 'm sure you can come up with others . This gives you a chance to make your pork fit well with whatever other dishes are in your meal .
Well , I see no reason this should n't work . Although I would change the process order slightly . If you think about it you 're basically suggesting making smoked bacon and then confiting it . Brine the meat , adding moisture to the meat . ( Make bacon ) Smoke the Bacon ( Smoked Bacon ) Confit it ... Smoking wise I would advise a cold smoke as it will help stop the meat drying out before the confiting . When doing the confit part I would highly recommend a really low fat/oil temperature , around 110c again to help stop the meat drying out and getting tough . Low and slow will save your meat . When I say make bacon I do n't mean brine it for 2 days but if you brine it for 4-8 hours you 'll help start the osmosis without actually creating full on salted bacon . It might taste great , but I see no reason why it would n't taste good . Maybe not the " Ultimate Pork Chop " ...
The good thing about Cumberland sausages is that the meat is supposed to be coarsely chopped and in of itself has a very high meat content . However , all good sausages have this quality also ! So in essence look for a sausage with a high meat content ( 80 % + ) and you ca n't go too far wrong .
The original recipe calls for a total of 2 lbs of ground meat , 1/2 beef and 1/2 veal . I would suggest a close approximation to the effect can be had by using either ( in decreasing order of preference ) : 50 % ground pork , 50 % ground beef -- Some of the mild flavor of veal , with tenderness and flavor from the pork 100 % ground beef -- It wo n't be as tender or as subtle , but still will be good I would avoid trying to use as part of your substitution mixture : Ground lamb , goat , ox , and so on -- flavor is too strong Ground chicken or turkey -- these are extremely low in fat , likely to toughen your overall mixture , and likely to make it taste more poultryesque Personally , I would also switch from whole eggs to just the yolks , which will bring the binding and tenderizing qualities of the yolk , without the slightly rubber-like texture of albumin based white , to more closely approximate the qualities the veal would have brought to the dish .
OK - for my bona fides , I 'm a microbiologist and have made a career of quality control in food processing including meat processing so I know what I am talking about . There are two kinds of smoked pork chops , cold smoked and hot smoked . Cold smoked pork chops are n't heat processed , so they are n't cooked . They have the redder color and the more resilient , moister feel of raw meat . You are only apt to run into them in specialty meat markets or at small local butchers . These need to be cooked to 145F to be safe and palatable to eat . What you find in the grocery store and most meat markets is almost always hot smoked . It is heated during the smoking process and is fully cooked , just like a smoked ham . It looks and feels to the touch liked cooked meat . That sounds like what you have . If you are n't sure ask the butcher or meat department manager . They should know . If they do n't , buy your meat elsewhere . Having said all that , it is common to find the smoked pork chops in the meat case right alongside the raw pork . Being exposed to raw meat undoes the kill step the heat of cooking does to foodbourne microorganisms . Salmonella , e.coli and other organisms are easily transferred from utensils , trays and workers hands back onto the cooked meat . This could be done in the meat case , or in wrapped product it could happen in the back room where the chops are cut up and wrapped . Organisms that find their way onto the meat quickly grow and spread over the meat 's surface and may find their way into the interior of the cut through any break in its surface . Unless you are certain it has been factory wrapped , sealed and labelled rather than in the store you should treat it as raw meat and heat it to 145F before serving . At the least be sure the surface of the meat has been seared before serving . I just do n't trust the expertise and commitment to providing safe foods you are apt to find in a grocery store or butcher shop . On the other hand , if it looks like it came from a factory already sealed in plastic wrap I would feel certain it was processed on a line that only processes cooked meat and is promptly sealed . I would have no qualms about eating it cold right out of the package .
You could probably get away with pork shoulder , although you will want to consider that the texture may not be what you want -- it may either have too much fat and connective tissue , or it may fall apart too much , depending on how long you braise it for . You will probably have to alter your cooking times , I 'd imagine . Pork hocks are somewhat similar in texture to the shank , so that a possibility . Though you will probably run into the same availability problems . It may take a small amount of modification , but your best bet may be to go with country-style ribs . They are tender and flavorful when braised , and are readily available in any grocery store .
Generally it 's things that have been prepared such that there 's some sort of added preservative -- salt , sulfates , sulfides , nitrates , etc. . So this would include all hams except ' fresh ham ' , almost all deli meats , all sausages , bacon , jerky , corned beef , etc. . So yes , sausage is considered a processed meat . If you want to get all technical about what ' processed ' means it could also include any other form of curing ( eg , smoking ) , and most any form of processing ( grinding , slicing , etc ) , although this second group typically is n't refered to as ' processed meat ' ( unless it 's then glued back together , like chicken nuggets , but those tend to have additives in them already ) As for the health aspects ... like most anything , it 's fine in moderation , although there are some people who react badly to sulfates and sulfides . Some sausages have more additives in them than others , and there are plenty of sausages out there that might be considered ' healthy ' if it 's in place of other higher salt/fat foods ( eg , some brands of chicken &amp; apple sausage ) .
Brown/black mustard seed is hotter and more intense than yellow . So , powdered mustard seed that is predominantly brown/black is going to pack quite a wallop compared to powdered yellow mustard seed . In the US , recipes calling for powdered mustard are going to expect you to use yellow . See <URL> for an interesting article on the subject .

Making your own drink powders ?
From Asian supply shops you can often find small packets of powdered fruits . Check the packet but many are made from actual fruit ! I have seen Apple , Cherry , Coconut , Lime , Mango , Pomegranate , Strawberry etc. . Google for powdered fruit and you 'll find a variety of online sources My favourite is Lime powder ( 99 % Lime , made in Malaysia ) Add Aloe Vera powder to make a thickened drink Add Arrowroot or instant custard powder to make a cloudy " juice " Add Ascorbic acid powder ( Vit . C ) as a preservative ( be careful not to exceed RDI ) Add Citric acid to make it more citrus like Add sugar ( real or fake ) to bulk it out so a simple measure ( e.g. one tea spoon ) makes a glass of drink Experiment with the quantities , but you do n't need much of anything to get an effective result
Use a vegetable peeler to peel of large strips of rind . That way , it 'll be easier to remove once you 're done steeping . If you do n't mind it being mildly alcoholic , steep them in vodka and then strain the vodka into the lemonade .
I think you 're on the right track . Curds exist with many fruits , but the most common are all very strongly flavored ( citrus , raspberry , cranberry , etc ) . As long as you use a fruit that will add a lot of flavor before adding too much liquid ( or reduce the liquid out ) , you should be fine .
The recipe calls for ground almonds . This can be done in a food processor . You may wish to remove the almonds ' skins beforehand , and you also may wish to toast them . Both of those are very common , even though neither is essential . With this particular recipe , I 'd be inclined to toast them but leave the skins on . Once you 've made those decisions , measure out the sugar called for in the recipe . Set it aside . Then place the almonds in the processor and add two or three heaping tablespoons of the measured sugar . Pulse until you reach a grind that resembles a meal , or very course flour . The finer you grind the almonds , the more carefully you must watch them . Eventually , the almonds will begin to turn to a paste . The sugar is helping to prevent it , and that 's helping you to get a finer grind . However , overprocess and the almonds will turn to paste . If you 're carefully watching for it , though , you 'll see it begin to happen before it goes too far .
If you have oven safe noodle bowls ( ceramic , not plastic ) then line them , as you describe with the foil , but do not remove them from the bowls . Bake your pie in the lined bowls , then remove the finished pies , with their aluminum " pan " intact . Or just make pasties ... no pan required . As you indicate you do n't have oven safe bowls and it must be a pie , I decided to experiment , using the double foil idea . I have heavy duty foil . I used a double layer and lined a noodle bowl making sure that there was plenty of foil out past the edge . I then pressed another noodle bowl on top of the two sheets of foil to make sure all is acting as a unit . While the top bowl is still in place , crumple up the excess foil , making a rim . This is what will give you the strength you need . I would then take the top bowl out , and line the now stable foil pie tin with your pie pastry . Fill the pie and if there is a top crust , finish the pie . You can now take the pie out of the noodle bowl and bake it as usual , although I would certainly do it on a baking sheet . The double foil is much stronger than you 'd expect , but the stability comes from the rim you build with the excess foil hanging over the edge . Here 's the finished bowl with the two molding bowls .
I do n't see why not , it 's the same process Many commercial brewers make a barley and rye malt for beer ( < 10 % rye ) . A good brewers supply shop should have rye malt too Rye is around ~ 40 % carbohydrate , while barley is ~ 45 % carbohydrate , so rye is not as sweet , but has a more interesting taste ( IMHO ) The differences for making malt rye over malt barley , assuming you have hulled rye : Rye absorbs water faster , so steep for less time ( ~ 30 % less ) Do not let it go mushy or it will not germinate Rye is more fragile with no hull and a thin " skin " . So must be handled more carefully once steeped . If it is damaged it wont germinate Lower germination rate ( due to above ) , so less conversion , so less sugars and flavour Otherwise just follow the normal malt barley process , which is well documented
It depends on how long the soup cooks for and whether you soak the barley or not . If the soup is going to cook for a couple of hours , you can just add unsoaked barley with everything else . Or you can soak the barley and add it towards the end of cooking . If the soup is going to be cooked relatively quickly , you should soak the barley and add it with everything else . Soaked barley ( soaked for a couple of hours ) needs to be cooked for about 30 minutes . It also depends on how soft you like the barley to be . Some people like it to near-disintegrate , some prefer it a little al dente .
Flash-freezing equipment would n't hurt , but for the normal home cook , the main things are to chill it as quickly as reasonably possible , package it with as much air removed as possible ( vacuum sealers help here ) in individual meal-sized portions , then freeze . Thaw in the fridge if possible , or by heating your vacuum-sealed bag in a water bath . ( Microwaves are pretty bad at heating frozen blocks of food and even with a lot of attention paid will tend to overheat part while other parts remain frozen . ) Choose recipes that work for the equipment you have , and adapt your weeknight process to combine the frozen ingredients with fresh ones . Soups , many sauces , chilis , beans and rice dishes freeze well under normal home conditions , as do some meat preparations ( the texture can change , and usually , the larger the cut of meat , the more likely it is that the change from freezing will be negative ) . Without flash-freezing , foods with a high water content tend to become mushy , so that the broccoli you steamed to perfection will most likely thaw out to be limp and potatoes may be mushy .
The historical purpose of jam is to preserve fruit from a time of bounty to a time when it is less plentiful . Therefore , to be a candidate for jam making , the fruit must be reasonably plentiful in the region where it would be preserved . Technically , in order to form a jam or a jelly , there must be sufficient pectin and sufficient acid in the fruit to thicken it . In some regions , there are traditional combinations of high and low pectin fruits , in order to get a viable jam from the low pectin fruit . Some fruits need acid , in the form of vinegar or lemon juice usually , added in order to help them gel ; others need additional pectin . <URL> has lists of high , medium , and low pectin fruits . Other than this , it is down to the cultural preferences in a given region .
The way I do it is put 1-2 tbsp of oil in my pot , add 1/3 cup or so of corn , cover , and heat on medium until it starts popping , then turn down a bit and shake the pot occasionally until it is all popped . So , not oil free , but not a whole lot of oil either .
Salmon or Tuna will make a very strong flavoured stock and will have lots of oil that coat your tongue . Not what you 're looking for if you want a light brightly flavoured fish sauce . In a traditional French kitchen you want generic stocks ( fish/brown/chicken / veal ) that are able to be used for a wide range of sauces/dishes so having a salmon stock around does n't meet that criteria . That said , I worked at a restaurant that made fish stock from salmon bones all the time as it was mainly used in a house specialty , a very robust West Coast spin on Bouillabaisse . Any true Frechman would have turned his back on us in disgust for doing what we did but damn it , it tasted great and the customers loved it ! For any other fish sauces we used the traditional white fish bones . FYI ... Japanese dishes use Bonito flakes ( tuna ) liberally to make dashi ( sp ? ) which is a fish flavoured broth for miso soup as well as other items . So basically what I 'm saying is if a fatty fish stock gets the job done for you and you 're happy with it then go for it . Just remember that if you 're trying to make a classic recipe then using a non-traditional ingredient will mess it up .
Yes , and it is very easy . I do it all the time . You only need a very simple calculation . You do n't even have to be precise . If you do want precision , you will have to find out 1 ) how much of your flour protein is gluten , 2 ) how much of your " vital wheat gluten " is gluten , and 3 ) how much gluten content you need for your recipe . Then use a simple rule-of-three calculation to get the amount needed to add . I usually do n't bother , because 1 ) and 2 ) is information which is very hard to find , and due to the large difference in gluten weight and complete weight , imprecision from not using true proportions is minimal . What I do is : Look up the protein content of your flour ( usually printed on the package ) , for example 9.6 grams per 100 grams Look up the gluten content needed for your bread recipe . If it is not specified , 12.5 % is usual for bread flour . Add the difference in vital wheat gluten . In the example above , add 2.9 g of vital wheat gluten per 100 g of flour . This does n't produce exactly 12.5 % gluten content , but I think that it is within the tolerance of most recipes ; indeed , not all commercial flours are exactly 12.5 % , they vary with brand and season . I add the powder to the flour and mix it well before making the bread . If I am using a preferment , I add all the gluten to the preferment and make the non-fermenting part with AP flour only , so my gluten can benefit from longer autolysis . I have no direct comparison with " true " bread flour , as I have never used it . But my breads requiring bread flour turn out good for my standards . There is no problem with bad distribution , the dough turns out very smooth and evenly elastic . There is a pronounced difference to using AP flour only .
As others have said , the issue is the hot oil and water interacting . You need to reduce or eliminate one in order to prevent the splatter or find a way to mitigate the damage . Remember the basics - allow the meat to warm up to room temperature before cooking and pat it dry before you begin . That should allow you to use less oil without it turning into a charred lump with a raw center . You can use a lid or a screen to prevent splatter ( you might need to adjust cooking time with a lid that will trap more heat ) .
tl ; dr Either way is fine . When making ice cream - your quest is to bind up water . Water crystallizes and makes ice cream icy instead of creamy . There are a lot of ways to keep water from freezing in ice cream from reducing the volume of water in the mix , to using natural antifreezes , to binding the water up with gums or starches . Sugar loves water . The water will eagerly hook up with sugar and wo n't be able to freeze . If you macerate your cherries two things will happen - 1 - Water will be drawn out of the cherries and 2 - The water that is left in them will be saturated with sugar and slower to freeze . The result is that the cherries will be softer , sweeter ( of course ) , be slightly more concentrated , and not freeze solid . If you do n't macerate them then they will be little chunks for cherry ice . Both ways are perfectly tasty and I 've had ice creams that do it either way . It just depends what you want to make .
Are there different qualities in prepared Hoisin sauces ? Think of it like barbecue sauce or chili powder : every company has their own recipe , and it 's always hard to know the precise justification for a specific price . The high price on one may be part of their premium brand image , and have nothing to do with the quality of the ingredients . Ultimately , you just have to try a few brands and decide which flavor appeals to you , and whether you find the price reasonable . If so , would I be better served by making my own ? As far as I can tell , hoisin sauce does not need to be fermented , so it 's going to be much easier to make authentic hoisin sauce at home than something like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce . It 's more like making your own barbecue sauce . A few different websites have minor variations on this recipe : <URL> Is it worth the effort ? That 's a matter of personal opinion . It 's probably hard to justify on purely economic terms ; do you really use more than a few cents worth of hoisin sauce in any given meal , and are the ingredients that much cheaper than the product itself ? But of course , there are other reasons to cook than just to save money . I think you 've just inspired me to try making my own hoisin sauce :) If I make my own , how long will it keep for ? Each of those ingredients can last months on its own , often without any refrigeration , and together would create a highly acidic and antimicrobial environment . The worst that might happen to homemade hoisin sauce in several months of refrigerated storage is it might separate a bit and have to be remixed .
Some answers to your questions , based on my experience with wild sourdough starter in San Francisco : 70-80F is the ideal temperature range . Below that the yeast incubates very slowly ; above it , the starter will tend to ferment alcoholically . Do not leave the starter in direct sun . UV light is a powerful sterilizing agent . An organic , cold-processed ( i.e. stone milled ) flour works best , because it will retain the maximum amount of its own wild yeast on it . Cheeseboard : Collective Works likes to start with rye flour and gradually add bread flour , but they do n't give a tested reason for this . I have never heard of using fruit juice in a sourdough starter . I would be dubious about it ; you 'd be likely to end up with vinegar . Sugar is unnecessary for sourdough starters . Use purified water ; chlorine/chloramine/ozone in tap water can kill your starter . Finally , starters incorporating milk are fridge-only starters ( as opposed to flour-and-water starters , which can be kept at room temperature if split frequently ) which depend on the bacteria and lactic acid from the fermenting milk for part of their sourness . They can be effective , and actually a good choice if you live somewhere with weak/poor wild yeast . Note that you can not transform a milk sourdough into a water sourdough , and using up 2 cups of milk every 2 weeks is more expensive than 2 cups of filtered water .
Moisten your hands with a clean , damp towel . This helps the rice not stick . Look at any sushi bar ; the chef will be frequently moistening their hands on such a towel .
I did actually do two batches with the two methods within a few weeks of asking the question . Just cooking it all together , then removing the skins and seeds with a food mill , is definitely a lot faster . Removing the skins first then pureeing , so that you only remove the seeds later ... well , though it is easy to remove the skin from each individual grape , time-consuming is an understatement unless you 're making small quantities . It took me a few hours for ( if I recall correctly ) 10-15 pounds of grapes . Including the skins has a moderate effect on the texture - it 's slightly thicker and more opaque . You get the feeling there 's just more stuff in it . As long as you 're cooking it fairly long , though , there 's not a very noticeable difference in flavor . On the other hand , if you 're using a recipe with pectin instead of cooking it down until it sets , I definitely prefer having the skins in , for both flavor and texture . So there 's some personal preference involved ; I do rather like the texture with the pureed skins . But if you 're doing large quantities , and the grapes are on the small side , and you do n't have help , you might want to skip it .
A difference I see between your recipe and other alternatives is that you do n't have any other starch besides your rice . Other recipes include a good amount of tapioca or potato starch . The other difference was that other recipes used rice flour instead of rice . You might also want to consider a change in technique . You can make rice noodles like a crepe rather than in an oiled steamer pan . Simply use a non-stick or oiled crepe pan , put in batter to crepe thickness , and let it cook until it begins to pull away from the edge of the pan . Invert and release in one motion onto a cutting board and slice .
My technique : 1 tbsp Fat ( from pan , or use butter ) 1 tbsp Flour Pan Juice Stock ( total liquid about 2 cups - omit if you have enough pan juice ) Step 1 : Make Roux Melt fat in medium high saute pan Whisk in flour , getting out all the lumps . ( This is called a roux ) Continue to heat until smooth , and the roux is just starting to darken . Remove pan from heat . Step 2 : Prepare Liquids Remove solids from roasting pan . ( let meat stand ... etc. ) Whisk , scrape , deglaze the roasting pan . If it 's brown , you want it , and want it dissolved Strain juices . skim off excess fat . Step 3 : Assemble Return roux to heat , and keep whisking . While whisking , slowly pour in the pan juices . Once blended , reduce heat and let it thicken . Salt to taste .

How can I rehydrate dried chillies more efficiently ?
I had the same problem with floating chillis so I now soak mine in a cafetiere .
Brew it strong and then add ice . Alternately , freeze some coffee in ice cube trays and use those frozen coffee cubes to chill the new batch without diluting it . Agitation ( shaking ) with cubes is a good substitute for crushed ice -- both ensure that the hot coffee meets the cold surface of the ice quickly . If you sweeten your iced coffee , using chilled simple syrup will help cool the brew and avoid problems getting the sugar to dissolve ( sugar does n't dissolve well in cold liquids ) .
Most beans can be soaked and cooked together with two exceptions . The beans should obviously have similar cooking times . For example I would n't cook chickpeas with other , harder beans because the chickpeas would be mush . Most brand do have similar cooking times so this is n't often a problem . Second , black beans should n't be soaked with any other beans because they will stain the other beans a very unappealing gray color . Admittedly this is cosmetic but I soak my black beans separately
Just look out for artificial flavorings ; a lot of bacon comes with artificial " hickory " or " maple " flavors , which are disgusting and often taste like chemicals . The better bacon wo n't include such things . Nitrate-free bacon is important if you 're sensitive to nitrates . The fat content is more of a matter of taste than a hard-and-fast rule ; personally , I like a fair amount of fat because I like to cook other things in the rendered fat ! Same for the thickness . If you like very crispy bacon , you may want your bacon slightly thinner than the " thick-cut " styles that command a price premium .
In the freezer , more-or-less indefinitely , depending on how good your freezer is . Certainly months to years . In the fridge , it depends on the kind of mole . Quick moles ( like various green moles ) do n't keep very long , maybe a week at most . A long-cooked mole should keep a bit longer -- up to 2 weeks -- since all of the ingredients are completely cooked . If you 're not planning to use it within a week , though , why not freeze it ? The texture wo n't take any harm from freezing and thawing .
In a roux , the starches are not normally gelatinized during the production of the roux -- in fact , if you make your roux with oil rather than butter , there is no water present ( other than latent moisture from the flour ) to do so . Roux thickened sauces must normally be brought to the boil ; this is when the actual gelatinization takes place . ... Roux is easy to prepare in larger batches , stove top . Simple use a larger pan , such as a six quart dutch oven . Melt your butter or add your oil , then whisk in the flour . Cook for a couple of minutes ( after the bubbling subsides if using butter ) , and you are good to go . Do n't be afraid to turn the heat up as long as you are standing by , watching and stirring to prevent burning from hot spots . Butter can foam up considerably , so use a large pot in comparison to the quantity of roux . For dark roux , I would start stove top , and finish in the oven to reduce the likelihood of taking the browning too far , and reduce the labor of stirring required . The roux can be refrigerated . You can scoop it with a spoon and add it to sauce at the simmer and whisk , and it will thicken almost instantly . See also : <URL>
The standard way to cook salt cod for dishes where you want to really remove the saltiness , such as brandade , is to soak it ( for hours ) in a couple of changes of water , and then simmer it in milk for half an hour to an hour . This might work with the mackerel . Not sure what you 'd use it for after that , though .
There is no exact conversion because there are so many different varieties of chickpeas or any bean types for that matter Their water absorption rate and amount is effected by many things including how they have been stored , have they been heat treated on import , and what time of year they where grown ! My rough rule of thumb for beans in general is 2.5 ± .5 times the volume and 2 ± .5 the weight after an overnight soak With our local chickpeas it 's 2.2 times the weight after 10 hours at 20 ° C ( on the bench ) 200g should be around 440g of soaked chickpeas . 1 cup of chickpeas is around 240g , so just shy of two cups of soaked chickpeas should do it
Speaking as a Brit - we are a nation of chip lovers :) Use an oil which can cope with the high temperature such as groundnut . For that proper chip experience ( * heart attack alert * ) add some beef dripping or lard . I add a small amount to give the chips a nice flavour . Whilst heating the oil regulary dip a chip in the oil . When it starts to bubble then it 's time to cook . If the oil is too cold the chips will absorb it and they 'll go soggy . ( This is easier to achieve with a traditional chip pan or I prefer a deep saucepan ) . For the perfect chip the potato variety is important but this is personal taste . Last seasons reds will make dark delicious chips but I prefer new potatoes which make a crisper lighter coloured chip . ( The potato variety also affects the colour when cooked ) . Finally , drain on kitchen paper and a sprinkle of salt .
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
" Completely " definitely is n't a standardized term ; however , since we 're talking about making ice cream here , the correct answer is going to be " as cold as possible without freezing " . When making ice cream , it 's important to get the mixture as cold as possible before you freeze it , especially if you 're not using an ice cream machine , so that you give it as little time as possible for ice crystals to form . If large ice crystals form , then you wo n't have ice cream , you 'll have ice . So get it all the way down to refrigerator temperature and work quickly when you take it back out of the fridge . It 'll be quicker and easier if you chill the bowl or receptacle first .
Perhaps a little bit late , but ... There is a " correct way " to do it : Of course there is a <URL> :)
Ah , we consumers and our expectations : Egg yolks are yellow . But in reality , yolks come in a range from pale yellow to deep orange . The colour is determined by the food ( wheat makes lighter yolks than corn , for example ) and can be influenced by feeding " colourants " for a darker hue . Some regions allow even artificial dyes , but a pinch of paprika will do nicely . Apparently the " expected " or " preferred " yolk colour is also a cultural thing , I found a source claiming that European customers want more orange hues while US customers expect deep yellow . Organic and free-range eggs typically have a greater variation than those from large agro-industrial production . So if your scrambled eggs are sometimes lighter , sometimes darker , either accept it as " natural " or check the colour of your yolks when you crack the eggs and for pale yolks add a colourant like a small pinch of turmeric ( what makes curry powder yellow ) or paprika ( for more orange eggs ) . If you use only a very small amount , it wo n't influence the taste or only very slightly so . Stir the spice in , then proceed as usual .
What is wrong with a regular ice cube ? As you state that the tea is not yet ready , you just use slightly less water and then add the ice cube , which has a fixed temperature . I use this for large scale ice tea production . As I use 1:1 hot water : ice cubes I simply brew a double strong tea .
Rose petals are edible . If you look for rose petal recipes , you will find many creative uses of them , including rice pudding with roses - so your pudding intuition was correct . During colonial American times they were considered a treat . You can candy rose petals with egg whites and sugar - typical cautions about appropriate raw egg white useage applies . Before using your rose petals in culinary applications , make sure to remember what chemicals you used on them . If they 've been sprayed with pesticides , you do n't want to be eating them .
Dry herbs are slower to release their flavors than fresh herbs ; they will need extra cooking time to impart their full flavors , so add them to the dish sooner . Since they are less delicate and need the moisture , you may also want to add them along with a liquid , to help extract out the flavors . Crushing the larger-leaf herbs up a bit may also help . Use less dried herb than you would with fresh , because they are more concentrated . Although these will help , the sad truth is that even the best-dried herbs will not have the subtle flavors of fresher ones . Edit : One other technique you might use ( if there 's minimal cooking of other ingredients ) is to soak them in oil for a long time to extract flavors . I would suggest an overnight soak in olive oil . You can get more flavor out if you heat the olive oil before letting it sit to soak ; something like 50C/125F is a reasonable temperature to dissolve more flavor compounds , without damaging the more delicate ones .
I had the same problem with floating chillis so I now soak mine in a cafetiere .
McGee writes : " Capsaicin appears to accumulate in the fruit concurrently with the pigment during ripening " . ( On Food and Cooking , p. 212 ) So yes , chilis get hotter as they ripen ( that is , as they turn from green to red ) . Many chili varieties are picked and sold in stores while still unripe and green ( e.g. jalapeño , serrano , poblano ) , but you will occasionally see ripe , red ones in stores . All of the dried chilis I 've seen in stores have been completely ripened before drying ( e.g. chipotles , which are smoked , dried red jalapeños and anchos , which are dried , red poblano peppers ) . I 've personally observed this effect with padron peppers , which are usually picked green and mild , but can ripen to red , hot peppers if left on the plant .
" Instant " coffee typically is disolved in hot water , so I 'd think that just stirring it into a cold product would be less than ideal . You might try <URL> ( as you 're adding sugar anyway ) or try steeping the instant coffee in hot milk or water first , cool it down , then mixing that into the yoghurt .
Normal cheese melts like that . It is made of proteins , fats , and water , and these separate when they are heated . For dipping , you need processed cheese . It has additives which keep the fat , fluid and solids mixed in a smooth mass . Also , it really helps to use very slow and even heat . This is the easy option . If you want to do it " for real " , without processed cheese , you have to make a cheese fondue . It is traditionally made with Swiss cheese ( I am fond of Appenzeller fondue ) , but you can use most types of semi-hard yellow cheese . It also contains some fluid , traditionaly white wine , and is emulsified with simple starch . It is preferable to have a special pan for this , as you can serve it heated . But if you make a big portion in a pan with a high thermal capacity , and make it immediately before serving , you can do without the special gear .

What can substitute Korean malt syrup ?
Was curious myself , so I did some more searching . I found a few sites that suggested honey as a alternative , but note that honey is sweeter , so you 'll need to cut back . The majority of resources I found agree that corn syrup is your best and <URL> Traditionally the Malt Syrup ( or Mul Yut ? Mulyeot ? ) was apparently made from barley , but these days apparently mostly made from corn , hence corn syrup being a good substitute . Some <URL> even translate and sell Mulyeot directly as " Corn Syrup " .
They just use it for the lecithine . You can buy straight lecithine ( they normally sell soy-based lecithine , but maybe you should check with the producer to make sure it is vegetarian ) and dissolve some in the cream . Do n't bother replacing the fat , truffels have enough from other sources .
I found <URL> on the Discuss Cooking forum . If looking to substitute parsley for flavor do not use cilantro as " the flavors are nothing at all alike " . Instead you can use chopped chervil ( closest to parsley that you can get , i think ) , angelica , dill , lovage , savory , basil , etc
Cast iron is ideal , but any pot that can take the heat and has a tight lid will work . Like @talon8 said in his comment , it does n't even have to be metal . This article from <URL> specifically uses terracotta for sourdough , not cast iron . Just as an FYI , this related question deals with preheating ( for no-knead bread , not sourdough ) , and the differing answers are interesting . To me it just goes to show that bread-making does n't always have to follow super-strict rules . <URL>
The original recipe calls for a total of 2 lbs of ground meat , 1/2 beef and 1/2 veal . I would suggest a close approximation to the effect can be had by using either ( in decreasing order of preference ) : 50 % ground pork , 50 % ground beef -- Some of the mild flavor of veal , with tenderness and flavor from the pork 100 % ground beef -- It wo n't be as tender or as subtle , but still will be good I would avoid trying to use as part of your substitution mixture : Ground lamb , goat , ox , and so on -- flavor is too strong Ground chicken or turkey -- these are extremely low in fat , likely to toughen your overall mixture , and likely to make it taste more poultryesque Personally , I would also switch from whole eggs to just the yolks , which will bring the binding and tenderizing qualities of the yolk , without the slightly rubber-like texture of albumin based white , to more closely approximate the qualities the veal would have brought to the dish .
I would halve the amount of icing sugar and substitute in cocoa powder . As long as you sift the cocoa powder well you should still have a smooth icing at the end . Provided your chocolate is n't milk chocolate you should still have a ' proper ' chocolate flavour as well .
It has been said : Better safe than sorry . You have n't measured the absolute sugar or acidity levels . Freezing it will do no harm . -- <URL> <URL> I 'm definitely not an expert with baking , but I 've worked with fruits in other contexts . The only time I would be worried about freezing would be if I added oil , like for a marinade or such . In your context I think freezing is fine , and sounds like it would be a convenient way to make larger batches to reuse throughout the year . PS : That puree sounds awesome , I might have to try that to marinate some chicken or pork chops !
Ingredients : Potato starch , tapioca flour , leavening ( calcium lactate [ non-dairy ] , calcium carbonate , citric acid ) , cellulose gum , carbohydrate gum Ener G Egg Replacer has always worked well for me . I keep it in the house for times when I do n't have eggs on hand and want to bake something . There is also recipes like <URL> for vegan pancakes .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .
Black bean paste is also incorporated into Asian cuisine , and has a similar flavor , although earthier . Add a little sugar , maybe a little ground cashew or peanuts for nuttiness . It wo n't be the same , but it should work well enough . Since black beans are more common , this may work well enough for you .
Simple Syrup is sugar that is has been dissolved in water . Heating speeds the process , and also allows the water to " absorb " more sugar . I do n't remember the chemistry of why the sugar does n't crystallize at room temp , but it does n't . It is typically made in a 1:1 mixture . . heat a cup of water to boiling , add a cup of sugar , stir until the sugar is dissolved , remove from heat , allow to cool . It is used in cold drinks like lemonade and iced tea because granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold liquids . It requires a lot of mixing , and the saturation point is low , so people who like lots of sugar ca n't get enough to dissolve to get the taste they desire . Note # 1 : this is why Southern-style Sweet Tea is sweetened while the tea is still hot . Note # 2 : The sweetness of 1 tsp of sugar is not equivalent to the sweetness of 1 tsp of simple syrup . You will have to find your particular taste point . Note # 3 : It can be flavored with just about any flavor extract , such as lemon , orange , peppermint , vanilla , almond , and so on . As I understand it , this is typically how flavored iced teas are made .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
Yes . You can also substitute 1 cup molasses with 3/4 cup packed brown sugar + 1/4 water , or 1 cup pure maple syrup , or 1 cup dark corn syrup .
There are two main types of provolone : piccante ( sharp ) and dolce ( sweet ) . Most braciola recipes I 've seen call for the sharp version . Sharp provolone tastes very similar to cheddar , which I assume is abundant in the UK . The issue is that " real " cheddar is a hard cheese and provolone is only semi-hard . Here in the US , we have a softer version of sharp cheddar-style cheese that is made in Wisconsin . If a similar semi-hard sharp cheddar variant is available in the UK , I would recommend that . It should also be noted that the term " braciola " ( or sometimes " braciole " ) means a lot of different things to different people . <URL> , likely including the author of your book , it takes on the Sicilian meaning of an involtino . Sometimes the meat will be filled with a soft cheese mixture like mozzarella mixed with grated pecorino romano . However , if the recipe calls for a harder cheese like provolone , it is likely referring to a variant that is very popular in the US in which the provolone is cut into thin slices ( usually using a deli slicer ) and layered on the meat before the meat is rolled . Therefore , any substitute for the provolone should ideally be thinly sliced .
What are the best substitutes for arborio risotto rice ? Your best replacement would be another short grain , or in a pinch , medium grain rice . ( if it 's a variety that does n't cook up creamy enough for your liking ... you can cheat and after you remove it from the heat , quickly stir in a beaten egg ) And how about when your only choices are all the local shops have : pearl barley , or ' brown rice with barley and spelt blend ' ? I 'd probably go with the pearl barley , just because it 'll have a more consistent cooking time than a blend . ( so you do n't end up w / little uncooked nuggets in a puddle of overcooked mush . This makes me think pearl barley is the best option . It take a lot more boiling than normal rice ( 40 minutes ) , so I 'll have to half-cook it by boiling before adding it to my pan with stock as my risotto recipe calls for . Do n't pre-cook it . You want to toast your uncooked grains in the oil , just as you would with a rice-based risotto before you add any liquid . If you do n't do this step , <URL> ( I ca n't comment on the texture , as I 've never tried cooking pearl barley this way ) . If you 're reluctant to spend almost an hour in front of the stove , the period to cheat is in the middle ; toast it , do a couple of stock additions w / lots of stirring , then add lots of stock &amp; let it cook , then once it 's nearly dry go back to stirring &amp; slowly adding liquid 'til it 's done ... or <URL>
You can stuff any pepper which is large enough . Poblano are moderately spicy . You can use bell peppers , but they will not be spicy . You might want to make up for that by including some spicier small peppers in your stuffing , perhaps a serrano or a jalapeno or seventeen , depending on your personal taste .
It should be OK , especially if you are purchasing already homogenized almond milk . If you are using homemade almond milk , your glaze wo n't be perfectly smooth , which may or may not bother you . Your " glaze " is a standard ganache , and it can be , in principle , made with water or any real dairy . The only purpose of the liquid is to change the consistency of the chocolate to something thinner and softer than a chocolate bar . Cream is the standard choice because it imparts a luscioius creaminess . But you can use lower fat dairy , or cultured dairy products , or even water , if you want a slightly different taste . A nut milk is simply finely ground nuts mixed with water , frequently also sweetened . It has its own taste , but nuts and chocolate are a classic combination , and even if people notice the faint taste , they are n't likely to complain . Texturewise , there will be no problem from adding it to the chocolate .
Any recipe where the water is part of a sauce or is expected to be absorbed ( including rice , couscous , and yes , pasta too ) , you can use stock instead to increase the deliciousness . If you have an opportunity to add flavour , why waste it ? Of course , there are some caveats to consider when making the substitution : Stock is going to contain a certain amount of gelatin ( how much depends on how the stock is made ) . This is often a good thing , leading to a richer mouth-feel , but if the thickening effect would be detrimental to your recipe , then do n't use stock . Stock can clash with other flavours , although less often than you 'd expect , since it 's effectively a mega-dose of umami . In particular I 'd probably avoid using it in recipes that are either very sour ( sour meat is the taste of rancidity and highly displeasing ) or very sweet ( since the sugar will overwhelm the flavour of the stock ) . So do n't use it in your candies or in your pickling solutions , but any dish based primarily on meats , vegetables , and grains , is definitely fair game . Because it 's a meat product , it has a limited life span . I would n't recommend substituting it for water in anything that 's going to sit in the fridge for several days and/or be re-frozen , due to food safety concerns . Oh , and I probably would n't use it in baking . The effects of using homemade stock when the primarily role of the liquid is to develop gluten would be unpredictable , to say the least . And somehow the thought of turkey-flavoured cake just does n't sound very appealing to me . As for the right ratio - that depends entirely on what went into the stock , how long it was simmered for and whether or not the stock itself was reduced prior to storing/freezing . You 're definitely going to want the same total amount of liquid , but if the stock is highly gelatinous then you might want to dilute it , and conversely , if the stock is very weak then you might want to reduce it . There really is no golden ratio , but I 'd probably stick with 1:1 for a " typical " stock .
Flavor-wise Nicoise and Kalamatas are somewhat close , probably the closest most readily accesible substitute for most people .
Cocoa powder is made by baking the cocoa beans and then removing all the fat from them , then milling the rest to a powder . In fact , semisweet chocolate is a solid sol ( a colloid formed from homogenically dispersing solid particles ( cocoa dry matter ) in a solid ( cocoa fat ) ) . What you should add is not water , but fat . Before you start , you must be aware that cocoa fat has some very special properties . It melts at a very convenient temperature , so it is solid in the air and melts in the mouth . Plus , it has a very special form of crystalline structure , which allows [ tempering ] . <URL> This means that the substitution wo n't work for some very specific uses like making Belgian chocolates . For chocolate cake or brownies , the texture will be somewhat off , but not too much , so it should deliver acceptable results for the home cook . The taste will also be different ( there is a reason why pure chocolate is so expensive , it only uses real cocoa fat , bars with other fat types like Milka ca n't compare with the original ) . There is also the question of choosing the fat . It should be solid by room temperature . Butter is often used in desserts and has a really good taste , but it does n't mimic cocoa fat that well , because it is n't a pure fat , it is an emulsion of ~ 17 % water in milkfat . So texturewise , shortening is probably a better choice . You can use either , based on whether texture or aroma is more important for you , plus your camp in the this-type-of-fat-is-bad-for-you debate . " Semisweet chocolate " is a loose category . I usually count anything with 40 % to 60 % cocoa mass as " semisweet " . So on average , your mixture should contain 50 % sugar . The ratio of cocoa powder to fat is trickier . Luckily , I have a 90 % chocolate bar here and can tell you that it contains 55 grams of fat ( as given on the package ) . This means that pure chocolate mass has 60.5 % fat . Assuming that your cocoa powder has 15 % fat ( " weakly de-fatted powder " is my best attempt at literal translation ) and that you are using shortening ( 100 % fat ) , we arrive at a ratio of 54 % fat to 46 % cocoa powder . You probably do n't have to be that exact , especially considering the fact that the fat content of cocoa powder is n't exactly 15 % . I 'd just go with a 1:1 ratio - easy to measure , and it gives you a bit more cocoa taste . So the final proportions should be 1 part cocoa powder , 1 part vegetable shortening , and 2 parts sugar . If you feel very mathematically inclined , you can calculate it more exactly for butter and a specific cocoa powder fat content . It is also important to note that in baking , you ca n't just throw everything in and mix . Different mixing sequences result in a different air distribution in the batter , which has very important results on the final texture . So do n't try to imitate chocolate by mixing above ingredients somehow and then dumping them into the bowl . Your recipe already has a correct technique for combining the ingredients , e. g. by creaming the butter with sugar and then slowly adding the flour . It also describes a technique for adding tempered chocolate to the batter , and this one wo n't work for a homemade mixture of sugar , cocoa powder and shortening . To achieve best texture , stick to the recipe 's technique for the components . Whatever they say to do with the original butter in the recipe , do it with a mixture of the butter and the chocolate-substituting fat . Use the original sugar amount together with the chocolate . Treat cocoa powder like flour , best mix them in a separate bowl before adding to the rest . Your result wo n't be exactly like a recipe created with real semisweet chocolate , but only the most discerning eaters will notice it , and most cake eaters are not that discerning . A last word of caution : throughout the answer , I assume that you have actual cocoa powder ( I 'd use non-dutched for a stronger choco taste , but this is a matter of personal preference ) . Instant drink powder like Nesquick does n't contain much real cocoa and is unsuitable for this kind of substitution ( or for any baking purposes ) .

How to prevent fat splashes when I fry a burger ?
To make a perfect burger in the kitchen , a hot cast-iron skillet is your best friend . To keep from making a mess , use one of these : That 's a <URL> . It allows air to move freely , but keeps grease in the pan and off of your walls . EDIT : In comments , Cindy Askew recommended the above plus using the cheapest available aluminum foil to protect surrounding areas from the grease and noted that the aluminum foil used in that way can continue to be useful as a disposable spoon/utensil rest . In a sense , this answer being accepted encompasses that comment as a part of this answer .
The biggest thing you can do is peel it . If a cucumber 's bitter , it 's much more in the peel than in the flesh . It 's also usually more bitter at the stem end , so you might want to start from the other end , and possibly ultimately discard an inch from the stem end if it really is too bitter for you . Unless you 're unusually sensitive to the bitterness , that ought to cover it . Bitterness is also fairly variable from cucumber to cucumber , so it 's possible that you could shop for less bitter ones - maybe a different variety - or buy them only during more favorable seasons .
In the US the closest thing you could ( easily ) get would be " <URL> " though this is n't quite correct since chitterlings are the small intestine , and tripa gorda is the large intestine .
I suspect @Stephie is correct in thinking they may be over proofed . Having said that , you could try the method that is used when making crullers . Place shaped donuts on parchment paper that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray . Cut the paper into individual squares ( each donut should have enough space to raise without expanding off the paper ) . Let raise . When ready to fry , just slip the paper with donut into your oil , it should release right away and you can remove the paper from the oil with tongs . Here is a link to <URL> . You can skip the first 3 minutes that shows the mixing and piping of the crullers .
If you use the same Dr. Oetker colouring that I have used in the past , which is advertised as a ' gel ' colouring , then you have to use a lot to get a good intense colour . You may have better results ( colour and taste-wise ) getting proper concentrated gel food colourings , like those made by <URL> . You need to use much less than cheaper brands so you do n't run the risk of flavouring the food , and you can even use them in meringues without ruining the structure .
Gelatin works by creating a very fine mesh of proteins , between which the ( hidrophilic ) liquid gets trapped . A mixture of fat and water is n't a liquid . It can be either a rough two-phase mixture , with visible fat droplets swimming around in the water , or it can be an emulsion , with invisibly small fat droplets dispersed through the water . Emulsions appear smooth , e.g. milk . When you try to use gelatine on the mixture , two things can happen . In an emulsion , the fat droplets can be smaller than the protein mesh . Then they get trapped as well as the water , and the result is gelled emulsion , just like you 'd expect . But if you have big globules of fat , they ca n't be trapped between the proteins . So it looks like they got squeezed out of the mesh and bubbled up to the surface , if it had n't been there all along . On the surface , gelatine molecules could n't find each other between globules of fat to crosslink , or maybe the motion of the globules broke any nascent links in the small amount of water between them , so it could n't gel . So the conclusion is : you ca n't set soup/stew with gelatine . ( I know that concentrated stock hardens from its own gelatine , but it has the fat filtered out first ) . On the practical side , if you want to have thick stew juice , you have to use something else than gelatine . It is probably simplest to create an olive oil based roux with the stew juice . Or you can gel with xanthan . Both will result in a " juice " which is creamy , instead of solid wobbly blocks of juice , with xanthan retaining the authentic taste and a roux-based sauce being a novel variation . If it is real jelly you are after , you 'll have to emulsify first and use gelatine after that . Xanthan itself should emulsify well , or you can probably use lecithine . AFAIK , there is no problem to use lecithine and gelatine together , but somebody with more experience in gelling agents should confirm that . In any case , emulsifying will lead to your liquid getting quite opaque . This is inavoidable , as it has to do with the way the collection of individual micro fat droplets break and reflect light rays .
My mother came up with a simple solution - add a capful of oil ( she recommended corn oil ) to the rice recipe . This time around the rice scooped right out perfectly .
Ok so you said salmon fillet . So my first question is how big is the filet . Fish do n't develop protein chains to hold together the same way red meat has . So the flakes do n't really hold together if pulled too hard , so I wonder if your fillets are too big . When I cook fish , especially salmon I try cut the fillet into serving sizes portions , maybe 2 inches across ( assuming a full sized fish here ) . This helps keep the fish to a manageable size . There is also a tool that is very aptly named because it was designed for this use and it 's called a fish turner . This is a thin and springy or turner that would better with fish because when scooping up the fish it does n't force the fish to reshape itself to the more rigid spatula and therefore you get less fish breaking apart . Do not turn the fish too many times . Leave it on one side and let it do all the cooking on that side that it needs , flip it once and let it finish . This will produce a nice crusty finish . As far as getting it to cook through the center , well that takes patience . Cook on a medium low heat but cook it for longer , like 8 minutes on each side ( experiment , do n't rely on my telling you 8 minutes ) . Then when you take the fish off the pan , put it on the plate and let it rest for a few more minutes . The fish will still be cooking on the inside and will finish up if you do n't serve it too early , but of course do n't wait so long that the fish cools . You want to serve it while it 's still hot , but not scalding hot .
If you insist on using a damp cloth , you have to make it wet again and again , so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times . Much easier is plastic wrap , which does n't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl . Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously wo n't work . My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid . It does n't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of " stretch and fold " or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough .
I always go in this order : Garlic/ginger/chili / spring onion whites This is to infuse the cooking oil with these flavours . Cook for short amount of time ~ 30secs . onions/peppers/carrots / harder veg These need a little more cooking that the other bits , so I give them a bit longer . mushrooms/sugar snaps/soft veg These need less cooking , so bit less time . bean sprouts I like these to be a bit crunchy so add them right at then end and basically just warm through . If I 'm using bigger veg like broccoli/cauliflower then I do them separately to the other veg . I use a little of the chili/garlic/ginger and fry that for 30 secs , add the broccoli fry for another minute or so just to brown the florets , then add some water , turn down the heat and put on a lid , to steam the broccoli . Once its done I remove to a separate plate the add back in at the end . It basically depends on how much you like each veg cooked . If you prefer your peppers crunchy , put them in nearer the end .
If you do n't fancy cooking in aluminium foil ( kind of takes the point away ) , you need to make sure you have a super clean , extremely hot grill . Why ? Clean ( No tasty burnt fat from the burgers ) , flesh sticks like #### to a blanket . You can get away with it when cooking steaks because they are just so much stronger . So get a wire brush and clean an area for fish cooking and keep it clean :) . Hot , as hot as you can pretty much . You want the second that Salmon ( or other fish ) hits the grill for it to blacken . It 'll help make sure the flesh is no longer ' fleshy ' and again less likely to stick . Do n't try lifting it till ' you know that underside is like a pink and black Zebra on it 's underside ( 3-4 min ) . When it does come to lifting you could really do with a nice sharp fish slice , not a blunt fat ended egg slice . Good luck .
I assume you are referring to standard , grocery store , cavendish bananas - They have a ton of water and sugar and have a very delicate texture . This makes them easily disintegrate and get gummy instead of crisp . The key is to deep fry them at a fairly high heat until they are dark and crisp . It also helps to use greener bananas that will hold together better . Butter is not well suited to this because of the necessary oil depth and high heat . Not only would it take a fair bit of butter but the butter would start to burn . Even clarified butter would n't be ideal . Vegetable oil or shortening would be the way to go . Additional notes : To make frying them easier bananas are often coated in something starchy - like a tempura batter . Recipes abound and they are , in my opinion , much better than frying the bananas on their own . <URL> Plantains are more often fried because they are much more starchy than Cavendish bananas . Plaintains actually become sweeter when fried .
Friction blisters are usually the result of continuous rubbing on skin that has n't toughened up . If you are getting blisters with normal amounts of chopping , either your knife is moving in your hand more than it should , or you are exerting more force than you should need . <URL> . Are you pushing down with the whole palm , the front of the palm , or the back of the palm ? Are you guiding or forcing with your thumb and forefinger ? Is your knife sharp and heavy enough for the materials you are cutting through ? Are you using a circular motion to chop ?
Use less heat . It 's not clear if you used any fat here . If you do , you have to be aware of the <URL> of whatever oil you 're using . By turning down the heat you 'll decrease the amount of fat you are burning , and turning into smoke . If you want to still get a nice crisp exterior you can briefly sear your sausages on high heat prior to fully cooking . Although , his might be irrelevant since you do n't really get good sears with a non-stick surface .
You can save yourself the waste of making double , while preventing cross-contamination , by using one hand ( clean ) to scoop and sprinkle , and one hand ( dirty ) to direct the spice falling , pat/tamp , and rub the spices . Typically I begin by applying a " glue " ( previously I have used honey and mustard , once I was vegan I went with just mustard ; both worked well on smoker ) to the cut of meat or vegetable before smoking or bbq . I follow applying the glue by washing my hands , then proceed with whatever rub I am using after the glue has had a chance to adhere ( typically thirty minutes medium , but I have followed instructions to let set and congeal for up to eight hours ) . Then , you can apply the rub following the method above : keep one hand clean to pick up handfuls of rub and sprinkle the rub down , use the other hand to press that rub you are sprinkling down against the cut . This sequence minimizes the number of steps , the times where you need to wash your hands , and makes for great bark . Hopefully you can rotate the cut with one hand , if not it adds one hand-wash . I started doing it this way because I hated having the spice turn into clumps from the moisture . Now I not only have no clumps in the spice after , and sanitary spices for further usage , but also a clean left hand for turning on the sink to wash my right hand .
Moisture-release is not a result of the cooking process but of the quality of the chicken . Try the following experiment : Buy halal or kosher chicken breast Buy the cheapest chicken breast you can find . Now put two pans on the stove , and put the industrial chicken breast in the left pan and put the kosher/halal in the right . Ensure both pans have the same heat setting , the same amount of fat ( I prefer duck fat for frying chicken breast ) and watch the amount of moisture coming out of the left one and the fat actually being soaked up by the right one . So the easiest way to avoid this is to buy good quality chicken ...
Aromatics are at least half of taste . Its like when you go to a restaurant and have to wash your clothes when you get home because they smell just like what you ate . Potatoes do n't have any particular dominating flavor , they generally inherit whatever flavor they are exposed to ; chicken is much the same way . Tuna on the other hand has a very pungent aroma . I would n't be surprised to see the fries take on the tuna aroma and " taste " a little fishy . Try temporarily covering your fries while you cook other things . That should help .
As posted in comments by members of the community ( and adding my own ) , several tips can help you get good warm tea in your thermos at wake-up : Choose loose leaves instead of tea bags to avoid tea dust that would overinfuse your tea in the thermos . The small amount there is in tea bags , is heavy enough to sink to the bottom very quickly , so if you pour the tea slowly into your thermos , you can discard it . You can also rinse the tea before brewing with cold water to help expel any excess dust , or ( as done in many tea-drinking countries ) throw out the first cup of tea made with new tea leaves . If you 're just using tea bags , why not just keep the thermos bedside and then toss the tea bag in in the morning ? You could try heating cold-infused and strained tea in the evening and put it into the thermos ; it has a brewing time of 8 to 12 hours , so you 'd have to start this around noon . If you have a microwave close enough to your bed , you could also use cold infusion to make your tea during the night and then give it a blast in the microwave in the morning .
Many of the dried noodles that are marketed as " udon " -- at least in my experience in the USA -- are actually mislabeled , thinner noodles like <URL> or even <URL> . I would suggest buying the semi-dried variety that are usually packaged in vacuum sealed plastic . This variety is shelf stable , but it can often be found in the refrigerated section of Asian mega-marts . The noodles will already be almost full size before cooking .
You can substitute one to one . Many brands of " light sour cream " ( Which is an oxymoron . Cream without the cream ? ) have a lot of gums and starches to stabilize the liquid as the fat would have done . Brands that do n't have gums dilute the fat with skim milk and are basically just yogurt anyway . Regular yogurt is fragile . It is a delicate mesh of proteins filled with water . When it is blended the water washes out . However , greek yogurt has already had this done ! So there is less water and it stays creamy and loses relatively little extra liquid even when blended .

Storage of chocolates/candies in process ( i.e. prior to cutting , dipping , etc ) ?
The best storage depends on the particular confection : Refrigerate ( in a sealed container to not pick up orders or absorb water ) : Ganache Soft caramel Cool dry storage , again in an air-tight container to minimize changes in moisture level : Candied citrus peal Nuts - Dry storage Marzipan Raisins and other dry fruits Fondant Hard caramel or toffee Ovens without pilot lights probably qualify as cool dry storage , and will keep the pets out if you have any , but accidents happen . I would use a cabinet or pantry if you have room .
even the greatest knife masters will forget every once in a while to clean with the edge in the opposite direction No , they wo n't , not after cutting themselves a couple of times . It 's natural to cut yourself while cutting food , occasionally , but I have never cut myself while slipping food from the blade . Always keep the edge away from you , place the side of your finger against the flat of the blade keeping it absolutely rigid and straight , and run your finger down the blade . It 's that simple . Using the side of your finger reduces the chance of you curling it around the cutting edge .
To answer your last question : yes . Regarding the previous question , it 's because the temperature at which the cocoa butter in the chocolate crystallizes affects the overall consistency of the chocolate . If you 've ever eaten a chocolate bar that was left in a car on a hot day after it has cooled down again , and who has n't , you 'll know about this . Sometimes chocolate tastes fine but has a definite ' grittiness ' to it : other things being equal , that 's usually because the cocoa butter crystals are too large . Cocoa butter has a number of different crystal forms , each of which will have a slightly different effect on texture and melting point . When melted chocolate sets , the cocoa butter crystallizes , and it will generally all crystallize with the structure that it starts to crystallize with . ( This process where crystals start to grow is called nucleation . ) So you want to have control over the temperature at which crystallization starts . The optimum crystal form for nice chocolate will tend to predominate when crystallization starts somewhere between 18-25 degrees C ( around 64-77F ) . So if you think about it : when you add room temperature stuff ( like a pretzel ) to chocolate that is considerably hotter than room temperature , the resultant temperature on the surface of that pretzel will likely be way higher than 18-25 degrees . On the other hand , if you are dipping an item that is significantly below room temp , then your chances of hitting that window are much higher . The surface structure of the thing being dipped can of course make a difference to crystallization as well , but for normal purposes that is marginal . To put it another way , it does n't matter what ingredients you 're dipping - temperature is key !
Your primary defenses against cross-contamination include proper planning in the order of what you 're cutting and proper cleaning between uses . In the case of your stew , simply cut the vegetables first and then cut your meat . Doing so in this order you wo n't need to wash the board between the vegetables and meat . If you want to expedite the cooking process , then either use a separate board for the meat first so that you can start browning it while cutting the vegetables , or simply wash and re-use the board . A good scrubbing with hot soapy water is fine for your knife and board ( including wood boards ) . As mentioned previously , if you 're still concerned about bacteria you can rub the board with lemon juice or vinegar which will kill any residual bacteria . Using separate boards that are relegated to specific meat vs. vegetable duty is n't necessary as long as you 're properly cleaning your boards . A board only used for meat items is just as liable to transfer bacteria to the next item being cut on it if it is n't properly washed between uses . That being said , if you 're properly cleaning them then it 's fine to cut vegetables on a board that 's also been used previously for meat . As for cutting boards , your best bet for the care and maintenance for your knives are either wood or composite materials ( usually a laminated product of paper and resin - " Epicurean " being a prominent brand . Never use a tempered glass cutting board or other hard surface ( granite , marble , Corian , etc. ) as these are heavily damaging to the edge of your blade and unsafe for you as there is nothing for the knife to bite and grip into and it 's much more likely to slip and cut you . Plastic cutting boards and mats are n't very good on your knives and the boards in particular are either too hard and dull your blade prematurely or are soft and end up with lots of cuts and grooves which then trap food . People often have a false sense of security with plastic boards believing them to be " non-porous " . As the board is used , food material ends up crammed into the cuts and grooves and while the boards can go into the dishwasher , that only removes the surface grime , not that which is impacted and over time you increase the potential for bacterial growth to occur . Wood boards ( including bamboo ) are much better on your knives but to maintain them in good condition you need to properly maintain them . Periodically , when they look dry ( kind of like chapped skin ) you need to oil them with mineral oil . The mineral oil you buy at your local drugstore or grocery store pharmacy is fine , no need to buy fancy " block oil " in gourmet shops . Do n't use vegetable based oils as they will go rancid and transfer the flavor to your food . I like to give the cutting board a heavy coating at night , let it soak in overnight , and then buff off anything that did n't soak in . This will keep your wood fibers soft and supple so that the board wo n't split and crack , the fibers will swell back together making it more " self-healing " as you cut on it , and the oil in the wood will repel liquids that would otherwise try to soak in . When a wooden board gets marred and nicked up you just need to take it to the garage and give it a good sanding before dusting off , rinsing and re-oiling . Do n't use bleach on boards ( plastic or otherwise ) as it will typically leave a distinct smell in the board .
All of the following are generally cooked items : Shrimp , ebi , available raw in sashimi , but almost always lightly poached . The poaching brings out sweet and subtle flavors otherwise masked by a metallic tang . It also prevents the highly perishable shrimp from losing texture to spoilage . Octopus , tako , available raw in sashimi when sliced very thinly , but otherwise poached lightly . The poaching reduces toughness and brings out additional flavors in an otherwise bland meat . Eel , unagi , as you noted , is ALWAYS grilled , and steamed . This is necessary to achieve the truly transcendent flavor and texture of unagi . In fact , the cooking of eel is such a challenge that it is generally a whole separate chef profession in Japan . Most eel comes from one of the professionals , because sushi cooks know they will never be able to match the quality themselves . Improperly cooked eel becomes tough and has unpleasant flavors . Raw , the blood of eels is even toxic ! Sweet egg omelet , tamago , is by definition cooked . This is not to say that raw egg does n't have a place in Japanese food though ; tamago kake gohan is a dish of raw egg on rice , with soy sauce . Cockle is lightly poached Crab , kani is always cooked because ... well eating raw crab meat is just vile . For further reading , I highly suggest the <URL> . Food Safety : Sushi is only prepared from the very freshest and highest quality seafood , and sushi chefs are trained to identify parasites and signs of spoilage . In addition , some areas ( including the EU ) require sushi to be frozen for 24 hours to kill parasites . If that was n't enough to help settle your stomach , the pickled ginger and wasabi served along with sushi are more than garnish or simple condiments ! Both ginger and wasabi have potent and documented anti-microbial and anti-parasite properties . Ginger is also well-known for combatting nausea . Source : the CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices , <URL> for wasabi and <URL> for ginger . ( links are to Google Books copy ) .
It will produce the same effect , however it might alter the taste ( depending on the type of beer ) , and will almost certainly alter the color of the final product , as beer contains sugars that will increase browning .
The care of bamboo cutting boards is extremely similar to that of traditional wood cutting boards : Prime them with mineral oil , and refresh it every month or so . ( Wipe with oil , let sit for a while , perhaps 15-20 minutes , wipe off ) . Wash only with mild soap , and rinse and dry immediately . ( Wipe off and let air dry . ) Do n't put in a dishwasher . If using for raw meat , you can sanitize with a very dilute bleach solution ( about a teaspoon of liquid bleach per quart of water , 5 mL per liter ) . Rinse thoroughly afterwards .

There are two things to keep in mind while melting chocolate : Keep a low uniform heat I start off the melting process with low to medium heat . Once the chocolate fully melts , I reduce the heat to low and keep gently stirring all the while . If you allow the chocolate to cool , it separates out into non-uniform areas of heat , and the cooler pockets start crystallizing . This causes lumps or spikes to form . However , if you go too high , the chocolate may burn . Keep the chocolate absolutely dry This also includes steam and condensation from the boiler . The water in the boiler should not splash over or steam into the chocolate . Also make sure that the dipped materials ( truffles in your case ) are totally dry . Presence of water causes rapid cooling of parts of the chocolate , which again causes lumps to form . It also causes sugar to crystallize out of the fine chocolate mix . This is called " seizing " , and such chocolate is very brittle and difficult to melt . EDIT : Here 's a nicely written article on the different methods of melting chocolate : <URL>
Sugar has a few effects in bread : It helps make it soft and tender by absorbing some of the water and slowing down the formation of gluten strands . It feeds the yeast , resulting in a faster rise . Via caramelisation , it aids in the browning of the crust . It acts as a preservative , keeping the bread fresher for longer ( though 1tbsp probably does n't make a lot of difference ) . It does have some effect on the flavour .
Yes , if you have access to sous vide equipment you can make them in less than a day . Here is the process I followed and it worked perfectly . <URL>
Commercial kitchens use a few methods that are hidden from the camera during kitchen shows . First , there are cutting boards for meats , and separate cutting boards for vegetables . These are often color coded so they are n't mixed up . If there is room , raw meats use an entirely different table . Any possibly contaminated board is sanitized before reuse . Second , the cloths you see are stored in a bucket of sanitizing fluid which kills microbes on contact . When a surface is wiped down , or hands are cleaned , they are being sanitized by the liquid on the cloth . Finally , there is usually more than one person working behind the scenes and labor is divided so the raw meat people are not the same as the green salad people . At home , planning is the key . Try to do all of your non-meat prep first . Then you can contaminate your cutting board without having to wash it again . Then try to take care of all of your meat prep , so you only have to wash your hands once . And remember that if you drop a vegetable on your raw chicken , it 's not a big deal if it 's all going to be cooked .
Yes , it makes a difference . In a conventional oven ( even one with a convectiono fan ) , anything placed on the bottom rack is going to absorb less radiation heat from the oven element . That means longer cooking times and possibly the need for a higher temperature setting . If you 're following a recipe then it 's best to use whichever rack the recipe says . If the recipe does n't specify , it 's usually designed for the center rack . Now , using a different rack is completely different from actually baking one thing on top of another thing , on a higher rack . That will have a significant effect on whatever is underneath , and if it is particularly sensitive to the time and temperature ( many baked goods are ) then it is very likely to fail entirely . I once tried to bake two layers of cream puffs and the ones on the bottom were still practically raw by the time the top was done . I doubt you 'd find much better success with cakes . A convection fan may help in this case , but I still do n't think it 's enough to compensate for the temperature gradient you 'd create by " eclipsing " one dish underneath another in the same oven . You are literally blocking the heat from reaching the bottom dish .
The best storage depends on the particular confection : Refrigerate ( in a sealed container to not pick up orders or absorb water ) : Ganache Soft caramel Cool dry storage , again in an air-tight container to minimize changes in moisture level : Candied citrus peal Nuts - Dry storage Marzipan Raisins and other dry fruits Fondant Hard caramel or toffee Ovens without pilot lights probably qualify as cool dry storage , and will keep the pets out if you have any , but accidents happen . I would use a cabinet or pantry if you have room .
I suspect it depends what kind of cheese the whey came from . Whey has all of the water soluble components of the milk . It loses the casein and fat . How much of the albumin and lactose it loses depends on the cheese . If the milk was heated enough ( 190F I believe ) then the albumin will denature and not be in the whey . If the cheese was acidified with a bacterial inoculation then the bacteria will have converted some of the lactose into lactic acid which will both be in the whey . Riboflavin is water soluble and is what gives the whey that greenish tint . Either way - most of the nutrients that bacteria like are not in the whey and it is always highly acidic . I have personally kept whey for a couple weeks with no ill effect . I usually use my whey soon by making ricotta . If the cheese it came from did n't denature the albumin in the milk then you can gently heat the whey until the the albumin precipitates out . A gallon of whole milk makes almost a pound of mozzarella and then a little less than a cup of ricotta . That 's a lasagna right there .
High fructose corn syrup is a preservative . While sugaring your ketchup is good for flavor , HFCS is great for shelf stability , as is the vinegar . The reasons you typically see HFCS in American Ketchups is that it is ( 1 ) heavily subsidized and domestic and cheap , ( 2 ) farmed by the same companies making the tomatoes , and ( 3 ) a preservative . Also , it helps to improve flow while maintaining viscosity . Sugar generally can be used to cut the acidity in a tomato dish without inhibiting the taste or outshining the tomato . My stepfather had digestion issues with high acidity meals and swore by a teaspoon or two of sugar to help aid the stomach issues . Likewise , the acidity of ketchup may well be mitigated by all the sugar .
Many chefs and restaurants follow <URL> obsessively , at least in part because they 're required to . Using ingredients that have been stored longer than considered safe can result in customers getting sick , in which case they probably wo n't return , they 'll tell their friends or use social media to spread the word , and they may take legal action if they got really sick . If a health inspector catches such violations , they wo n't be happy either , and they have a number of potential penalties to impose . Food cost is on par with labor as being one of the <URL> of running a food service business . I 've always heard the " rule of thirds " as a guideline for operating costs in a restaurant setting : 1/3 food cost , 1/3 labor cost , and 1/3 profit ( which is not always pure profit and may involve reinvesting back to the business ) . <URL> bear this out as well . My point with all of this is that chefs have two strong , competing incentives : Do not waste food , because it 's expensive in the short term ! Do not serve bad or spoiled food , because it 's expensive in the long term ! Obviously there are bad chefs out there who simply do n't care . They may not be invested in the business , poorly trained , or just checked out . And many of us have seen reality TV exposes that show how awful some kitchens are . But , the good chefs that I 've worked for and with have a couple different approaches to using up prepped ingredients and avoid throwing things out : Good labeling and storage . This is really fundamental anyway if you want to ensure that you know how old everything is . Some ingredients ( blanched or hearty vegetables ) will easily keep for a day or two after being prepped if they 're kept cold . All you need do is store them correctly ( which depends on the exact food ) and use some <URL> to keep things straight in the fridge . Recycle them into a different dish tomorrow . Lots of restaurants have specials or rotating items . If I shelled a bunch of beautiful fresh peas for a risotto on the dinner menu and I simply do n't sell many , I can turn the extra peas into a delicious soup tomorrow . If I 'm smart , I 'll also use up some of the ham that I diced for a different dish , and the vegetable stock that I use everywhere and have to make more of anyway . On which note : Turn them into basic or pantry ingredients . Some chefs are really good at this . There are certain things that you can use everywhere : stocks , breadcrumbs , etc. . And they are n't necessarily picky about their base ingredients being in prime quality . I might make vegetable stock every couple of days using whatever pre-prepped vegetables I 've got on hand , supplemented as needed with fresh ( also an excellent way to use up odds and ends that ca n't be served on their own , like celery stalk bottoms ) . I might take a surplus of julienned carrots that would have been garnish and pickle them for later use . I could take fresh herbs that are starting to wilt and use those in a marinade for meat . This is a really defining quality for a great chef for me : cleverness with a broad range of ingredients and preparations , and a willingness to experiment . After all , if those pickled carrots do n't work out , I would have had to throw them anyway . Compost them . Not feasible for everybody , but growing their own food is something of a trend and obsession for certain chefs . Rather than having things go to waste I can do what a smart home gardener would , and turn my sad wilted vegetables into healthy compost for my rooftop herb garden . Most chefs who do these sort of things are also very good about monitoring how much they sell and doing their best not to order or prep more than they need , so they do n't have tons of waste in the first place . Chefs who are n't as passionate simply wind up throwing more out . This leads to the curious assertion ( but I 've seen it quoted from Gordon Ramsay as well ) that you can learn a lot about a chef by going out back and checking the dumpster . Oh , and since your question asks specifically about line and prep cooks : ideally , they are doing exactly what the head chef tells them to . That 's basic kitchen discipline . If they go off on their own and prep three times more potatoes than they were told to , they wo n't be prepping potatoes or anything else for too much longer .
If you think the wood was treated or fumigated , I would n't trust sanding to make the wood food-safe . As another answer notes , wood is porous and could very well have absorbed the chemicals deeper than you 'll sand out . I would definitely err on the side of caution here and only use wood that you know is safe to begin with . There is no finish that you can use on a cutting board that will keep the base wood completely out of contact with the food , due to knives being used on it . I would recommend starting with hard maple . It makes durable , great-looking cutting boards , and is completely food-safe .
The purpose mixing the butter and sugar until creamy is to distribute air through the batter that will help leaven the cake in the oven . Skipping this step can create a denser cake . You want to add the air into the batter before adding the flour in order to prevent over mixing , which creates gluten ; causing a tougher texture . Beating the eggs until foamy and folding them into the batter or adding the eggs to the butter/sugar and beating until fluffy will also create a lighter texture . The sugar does not need to dissolve in the butter , but it should be evenly distributed . <URL> gives a good visual on how creamed butter &amp; sugar should look .
The exact number of cutting boards is n't critical , the important piece is minimizing cross contamination . You can use one cutting board safely as long as you 're using it in a food-safe order ( cut vegetables , then proteins ) , and follow good sanitation practices ( wash &amp; sanitize the board between ingredients ) . A quick scrub with soap and water and a spritz with a bleach , alcohol , or quat solution between ingredients will minimize your need for different boards .

Does a 15,000 BTU Burner require a larger gas line ?
I 've got a 6 burner cooktop with a 16k , 3 12k BTU burners , and two smaller burners . My standard household gas line can supply at least 5 of the 6 concurrently without problem ( have n't had occasion to use all 6 at once yet ) . The gas line feeding it is the same size as the rest of the gas lines in my house . Also , according to the installation instructions , the input gas line must be the same diameter or larger than inlet line of the appliance . Inferring from that , I 'd say it is going to be dependent on the inlet size of the stove you select . I do n't believe line pressure will be a problem .
Electric stove elements have a different KW rating depending on construction and size A typical spiral element of 200 mm ( 8 " ) diameter will be 2 KW , a 150 mm ( 6 " ) diameter element will be 1.3 KW Different stove makes and models have different ratings . But not many go above 2 KW , except in USA where they go up to 3 KW Stove makers usually publish exact specifications on their web sites 1 W is approximately 3.4 BTU
It 's really no different from cooking something on a stove : if you have no liquid at all , things are probably going to start getting too hot , sticking on the bottom , and maybe burning . As long as there 's some liquid , you 'll be fine . The important thing is to add enough ; if you keep having to open it to add more , it wo n't stay hot . This is basically the minimum level : enough that it wo n't boil dry in an hour or so . If you 're cooking something really simple like a piece of meat , using too much water just provides more water for the flavor to get diluted into . This is precisely what the first page you linked to says : if it 's not full enough , it might all boil off . The writer is just way off about quantities . I suspect his cooker 's lid does n't fit well , or he 's unnecessarily cooking on high . I do n't think my slow cooker would boil dry from half full in 8 hours on low , and there 's no reason to put it on high if I 'm cooking that long . The recipe at the second link is n't exactly empty - a can of cranberry sauce will provide a good amount of liquid . It also might not be a great recipe . On that note , I might suggest you look for more authoritative recipes . Perhaps check out a slow cooker cookbook from your library ( these tend to be pretty common ) to get an idea of the kinds of things you can do . ( Of course , if all you want is a plain piece of meat , I guess you do n't need much . )
Yes , you can use ghee or oil for sauteing instead of lard . NOTE : You will not get the same " lardy " aroma from butter , ghee or oil , but if you use other stronger aromas / spices in your recipe it might not really matter .
The pot will have more caffeine . You are right that the concentration of the final solution is determined not only by steeping time , temperature , etc. , but also by the amount of water available to dilute the stuff coming out of the tea , including caffeine . It will reach balance earlier with less water . So more water will get more of the different compounds in tea dissolved . For an empirical observation by somebody surprised by the result , see also <URL> .
The cream whipper relies on gas expansion to work . When you make whipped cream by beating , you beat fine air bubbles into the cream . The cream traps air and becomes essentially a matrix that holds those bubbles -- a foam . Your gas-charged whipper does the same thing in a totally different way . When you charge the whipper with gas , there 's high gas pressure inside with the cream . The cream will actually absorb the nitrous oxide you put in . Because of the pressure , the gas absorbed can be thought of as really really really small bubbles within the cream . So you have a matrix of gas and cream , but because the bubbles are so small , it 's essentially just cream . Chilled liquids more easily absorb gases at high pressure , which is why it 's good to use cold cream and keep the whole unit in the fridge . A limited amount of agitation ( shaking ) exposes more cream to the gas , improving absorption . When you release the cream from the device , the absorbed gas expands rapidly . The bubbles get bigger , and your cream to bubble ratio becomes more like the foam that we know as whipped cream . It 's really exactly the same thing , only with nitrous oxide instead of plain ol' boring air inside the bubbles . Why nitrous oxide ? As I understand it , it 's because it 's the cheapest non-toxic , odorless and tasteless gas you can get . Carbon dioxide would almost be a good choice , but unfortunately it 's bitter . Not a good match for cream . Finally , why is shaking too much a bad thing ? That one I do n't know for sure , but I know what happens when you over-whip cream with the mixer . You make butter . Perhaps the gas or high pressure encourages this conversion , or maybe you 're just churning it that much when you over-shake . Either way , I 'm sure you 've essentially made butter when you shook it too much .
Microwave ovens have a turntable because the microwaves themselves form what are known as ' standing waves ' . This means there are essentially static columns of microwave energy inside the cabinet itself . You can see this for yourself - spread a tray or plate with grated cheese , take the turntable out ( or press that button ) , and zap it for a couple of minutes . You should see bands of melted cheese interleaved with unmelted cheese . Thus , the food is rotated to ensure even heating .
The actual action of soaking is what does most of the work . Most legumes have complex oligosaccharides , a type of complex sugar . Digestion of this complex sugar is what causes flatulence . By soaking your beans will help remove some of this excess sugar . Be sure you discard the soaking water . Though it is often said that adding baking soda helps I 've yet to see any verifiable evidence that it would help . Also , do n't forget that baking soda is n't tasteless , it could easily add a salty or soapy flavor to your once pristine beans .
In Scotland we make a kind of fudge that is deliberatly hard and crystallised known as <URL> . This was a popular treat when I was growing up . Essencially the recipe for tablet , soft fudge , toffee and caramel are quite similar . The difference is made by how you cook and treat the mix as it cools . Essentially you need to know about <URL> . There are two important levels used : soft boil , and hard boil . My cook books suggest using a sugar thermometer to get the perfect boil but I 've never found a sugar thermometer in the shops . Instead I rely on a great deal of practice , the colour , the texture and the drip of the mix to gage how hot the sugar is . In a soft boil ( 234 -- 240 ° F or 112 -- 115 ° C ) , if you drip the mix onto a very cold surface or into cold water , then touch the drip with your finger , it will be soft like caramel . Additionally the colour will change from cream to yellow/tan . In a hard boil ( 250 -- 266 ° F or 121 -- 130 ° C ) , dripping again onto a cold surface or into cold water , then touching the drip with your finger , it will be firmer or even hard . The colour will darken slightly to a dark yellow or light brown . For caramel and fudge you go to a soft boil then cool . For tablet and toffee you go to a hard boil . The next part is the cooling . This is equally important as the boiling . The faster you cool the mix the smaller the crystals become . The slower , the larger . If you want a caramel or a toffee , you must avoid agitating the mix as it cools . For fudge you should stir the gently as it cools slightly before pouring onto the try . For tablet , the mix should be vigorously stirred until stiff then poured onto a try .
Seems this is very common in Britain , where I come from , so google.co.uk did the business ! The recipe here allows storing in a cool , dark cupboard for up to six months , and it recommends leaving the eggs at least a month : <URL> This one looks good , and I like the instructions for eating ! <URL>
That depends on the rice . I have done my own measurements in the past ( I hate volumetric measurements , ) and found : 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Brown rice ( medium grain ? ) weighed 142g . 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Calrose rice ( medium grain ) weighed 150g . Both were Australian grown rice . The rice cooker cup 's top measurement is 160ml , but I always fill to the brim because ... I 'm too lazy to look at the notch . Why is the weight different ? Because different grains of rice can wedge together more efficiently ( less air pockets . ) The weight measurement for a long grain rice like Basmati would be different again . TL ; DR : buy a scale to be accurate .
The usual reason given is that Aluminum will react with the alkalis in dishwasher detergent and discolour . <URL>
Hmm I suppose they add starch to keep it from turning back into one block of cheese . Thing to do is if the sauce looks to thick just add more milk .
The fridge itself does storing , cooling , and dehydrating . But the last part is rather slow , you do n't see the effect all that much . It is more prominent at low temperatures ( manifests as freezer burn ) . But try leaving unwrapped bacon slices in the regular fridge and you 'll see what I mean . But anyway , it is n't all that interesting what the fridge does , because we only use it for cooling . The interesting things happen in whatever you put into the fridge . The explanation will be somewhat long even without details . The dishes you described have different reasons to need cooling , so I have to deal with them separately . First , egg whites . Stiffly beaten egg whites tend to weep . Cooling them slows the process . You know , less Brownian motion , etc. . Still , overbeating them is never a good idea :) In this case , there are no fat particles responsible for the foam stability ; in fact , the smallest amount of fat can disrupt the building of egg white foam . The second class are the dishes which contain lots of saturated fat . They are made with ( raw ) cream , chocolate , butter , or other such stuff . Saturated fat is an amorphous solid , it has no sharp melting point . It gets very soft before it melts , butter is a good example . So these things are kept at fridge temperatures . If they are left to warm again to room temperature , they become much softer than in the fridge . ( The exception which gets softer than in the fridge , but not all the way to the state before cooling , is ganache . This is because cocoa contains starch , which thickens . See the part about gelling below ) . Third , we have custards . Panna cotta is a good example . They set by way of denaturing egg proteins . This happens at around 85 ° C , on the stove . They are put into the fridge to get colder , because they taste better that way . They do n't get firmer in there , and they wo n't melt if taken out of the fridge . Then we have the hydrocolloids , or gelling agents . While technically starch gels in a different way than gums , I 'll put them together here . The important point is to know if they are thermoreversible . Starch is n't thermoreversible . If you create a blanchmange thick enough to stay on its own out of the mold , it will need to be cooled before it is set completely . But once set , it wo n't go fluid again at high temperatures . Gelatin , on the other hand , is thermoreversible . It needs to be heated before it will dissolve at all , but then it must be cooled to set again . If you make jello and keep it outside of the fridge , it wo n't be much softer than in the fridge . But if you heat it up all the way to 50 ° C , it will melt to liquid again . Then there are the even funnier ones which will harden at high temperatures and soften at low temperatures , etc. . But mainly , you do n't have to keep hydrocolloid gels cooled once they are set . In fact , they do n't even need fridge temperatures to set . Gelatine is perfectly happy to gel at summer room temperatures . But the cooling takes much longer because of the smaller heat difference between liquid and air . So it sets quick in the fridge , but has to be left overnight in order to work at room temp . As for the practical meaning of all this : you can keep most stuff outside without a texture problem . The exception of this rule is anything made with saturated fat : cream , chocolate , pastry dough , buttercream frosting . But it is common knowledge that these should be kept cool anyway .
The key factor in syrup 's shelf life is the water activity in the syrup , rather than the ingredients used to make it . Generally , the water is all ' bound up ' with dissolved sugar so microorganisms ca n't use it to grow , but the lighter the syrup , the more available water it will have . In my experience , simple syrup is usually kept refrigerated except for small portions that will be used within a day or two . For a chart of water activity ( aW ) of related foods , check here : <URL>
The <URL> clearly recommends not leaving cooking appliances unattended when no one is home : Based on 2006-2010 annual averages : Unattended cooking was by far the leading contributing factor in home cooking fires . [ ... ] Ranges accounted for the largest share ( 58 % ) of home cooking fire incidents . Ovens accounted for 16 % . At the time this <URL> was written , the Fire Administration said ( they have since updated the page ) : The leading cause of fires in the kitchen is unattended cooking . Stay in the kitchen when you are frying , grilling , or broiling food . If you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time , turn off the stove . If you are simmering , baking , roasting , or boiling food , check it regularly , remain in the home while food is cooking , and use a timer to remind you that you 're cooking . Stay alert ! To prevent cooking fires , you have to be alert . You wo n't be if you are sleepy , have been drinking alcohol , or have taken medicine that makes you drowsy .
I actually measured and weighed a cup of Nutella and I got 290g . Of course we have to take into consideration my 1 cup measurement ( I 'm pretty sure they are not exactly the same ) and my scale . But it just shows that the 300g mark is not far off .
That great taste comes from the compounds produced by the <URL> . It not one reaction but many that occur when the building blocks of proteins and sugars react as food is heated . Many new compounds are produced giving the cooked food a richer range of flavors . The <URL> produced by the Maillard reaction give roasted peanuts their characteristic aroma , in particular <URL> . To produce pyrazines , you need to heat your peanuts above 70C , with 110C to 170C ( 230F - 340F ) suggested by most cookbooks . For unshelled peanuts at 110C it can take up to ten minutes for the amount of pyrazines produced to reach its peak . If the peanuts are not dry , you may need to add up to 20 minutes of oven time ( longer on a tawa ) at a lower temperature to dry them . Color will be your guide . The flavor of the pyrazines will be masked by oxidizing oils in the peanuts , so keeping them in an airtight container helps preserve that nutty-cracker-peanut flavor .
You 've already given the name for this process in your question . Reduction is the cooking term used for thickening and intensifying the flavor of a food by simmering or boiling away some of the liquid .
I strongly advise against doing it . I tried stovetop seasoning at home and got terrible results . A stove gives you hot spots - on gas , this will be the ring where the flame touches the metal . The temperature of the metal in this hot spot is way too high , and the oil burns instead of polymerizing . You get some oil-charcoal in this place , which does n't have non-stick properties , and flakes off after a few uses . Outside of the hot spots , the temperature is not high enough . The oil does n't polymerize thoroughly , and forms a sticky paste instead of a smooth one . Your food will stick to these parts of the pan even worse than to the charcoaled parts . Conclusion : use an oven . If your oven is too small for a pan ( I only have a toaster oven , 30x30 cm , and my pan + handle is way too long even for the diagonal ) , leave the door cracked and seal the crack with alu foil . This is not very energy efficient , but you only do it once per pan . It worked for me , and I got a real , non-stick seasoning after multiple failures on stovetop .

What vegetable for sauteed zucchini could I use instead of tomatoes ?
Cottage cheese will keep it consistent and match very well with the zucchini &amp; spices .
It depends how you like your rice . Personally I like my fried rice to have a few sticky lumps through it to add texture . Others may like it completely ' separated ' . It 's really up to you . I usually use a combination of long grain and Basmati . Another point is to make sure your rice is safe - it needs to be cooled relatively quickly , and kept cool , to prevent the growth of Bacillus cereus , which can cause serious ( no pun intended ) food poisoning . As it happens , fried rice is much better when cooked with cold rice and very hot oil anyway , so it 's a good idea to keep it cool in any case .
Yes , you do n't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things , but it also means that you do n't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink , which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans , as they 'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly ( at least , compared to something of the same material , such as a cast iron skillet ) More importantly , in my opinion , is that without the sides , you do n't hold in moist air , so when cooking things like hash browns , you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them .
I would likely work the cream cheese first , then try adding the liquids from most to least viscous ( condensed milk , evaporated milk , eggs , vanilla ) If you try to use a mixer with cream cheese and lots of liguid , it 's harder to combine -- you end up getting floating bits of cheese in the liquid ( likely what you mentioned as a ' curdled mess ' ) , rather than it fully encorporating . Having the cream cheese at room temp helps , but is still problematic . It 's possible that you might also want to strain the mixture when you 're done , as the mixer might leave the eggs ' chalaza intact . ( if it 's too thick to easily strain when done , you can either whip the eggs first and strain them before adding them , or just skip this step )
You can avoid the tray altogether and bake them on a steel rack . Lye does n't react with stainless steel ( or with carbon steel , for that matter ) . It will stick lightly to the rack , just like anything else on stainless , but due to the small surface , you should be able to separate them . The second way would be to just use enough rock salt on a steel tray so that they are too high to stick . But it might mean that you 'll get too much salt embedded in them . And as a final word , you might just be using too much lye , or too strong a solution . Pretzel were baked long before there were silpats , and they did n't strip the seasoning off the tray . Avoid any coated trays ( teflon , enamel ) , and , most of all , aluminium .
The kind of oil you use in baking is mostly a matter of personal preference . Any neutral oil ( no strong flavor ) will do . I suggest you use an oil that you keep around for another purpose , which is not too expensive . Some good candidates include : Canola oil Peanut oil ( refined , except for those with peanut allergies ) Generic " vegetable " oil Grapeseed oil is also excellent but tends to expensive . Oils you would want to avoid due to the fact that they bring more flavor which may not be what you want in baked goods include : Olive oil Sesame oil Unrefined oils of all sorts
Since the original recipe does not say explicitly that the scallops should be cooked from a frozen state , you should thaw them in the refrigerator before making the dish . Do not precook them -- just thaw them , and cook them as per the recipe . You will also want to pat them dry with a paper towel or lint free towel , so that they are as dry as reasonably possible .
You can use small amounts of cheddar mixed with the other cheeses . But you 'd be disappointed in the results if you tried to use it as the main or only cheese on the pizza . Cheddar cheese does n't tolerate sustained , high heat as well as some other cheeses . It can scorch , which tastes and smells bad , and/or the fats can separate from the solids as a yellowish oil . The sharper the cheese is , the less well it will tolerate heat .
When I freeze tomatoes , the main thing I worry about is getting the skin off . To do this , score the bottom with an X , then blanch . After cooling in ice water , pull the skin off . I have n't ever worried about the details you mention , or about cutting them up , and I have had great success .
In general you need to consider the purpose of the ingredient , and what would happen to it during the cooking that it 's missed . For example , there 's no point stirring a spoonful of flour into a sauce after cooking , since the flour needs heat in order to thicken the sauce . In the case of the tomato paste , not much will happen to that particular ingredient during cooking . It may have caramelised a little , depending on the cooking method . It would have infused more deeply into some of the other ingredients . But these are subtle things . Taste your finished product . If you feel it would benefit from an extra boost of tomato flavour , by all means stir in some tomato paste .
The problem with using the non-ground pearls is that they do n't always fully dissolve . <URL> they can be pulverized or ground in a grinder or by mortar and pestle and used similarly to the starch . However , there are pearls which are instant and those that are not . With instant tapioca you can substitute 1:1 , with regular tapioca pearls , pulverized , it would be 2:1 . As for , they are good as a thickening agent assuming that you are okay with little gelatinous balls in whatever you are making . Rice and tapioca puddings spring to mind ; there are uses of it in curries and stews for its thickening prowess ; also it can be used as a gluten free thickening agent in place of flour . If you run out of corn starch or arrow root you can also turn to the pulverized stuff . Same rules apply ; <URL> . However , do not bring to a boil or you will end up over-cooking the starch .
A really well-sharpened santoku-style chef 's knife is usually my choice . But , it does depend on the type of slicing ... such as thick/thin discs , wedges , or dicing . While I understand that a serrated blade can help with slicing a super-ripe tomato , when I want really thin disc-shaped slices , something very sharp and preferably a thinner spine . The favorite in my kitchen is definitely a Henckel santoku chef blade . Some versions can have a very thick spine , and would n't work as well , though . This type of choice is also more utilitarian if you 're cutting any other veggies at the same time , or making additional cuts in the tomatoes , such as when you 're also going to be halving the discs or full-on dicing . Things I like the thinnest slices on are a ham and cheese melt , roast beef sammy , a sub for the road , and sometimes for a garnish . ( hors d'œuvre , anyone ? ) Also , when I 'm cutting tomatoes into wedges , I also like to use this same type of sharp , non-serrated blade . Otherwise , I find it harder than necessary to do the smaller divisions after the 1/4-of-a - tomato size . I nearly always do 1/8 or 1/12 sized wedges for salad , so it is n't terribly often I use a " real " tomato knife . When I do , is when it 's for a lunch and I do n't want to sully a larger blade , or when doing large batches . Getting the core out is certainly easiest with a smaller , serrated blade .
The closest thing is to combine equal parts of ground cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , and black pepper .
I have never heard of Tofu being called " vegetable meat " . There are some fake meat types based on different types of soya products ( or also other plant proteins ) , like " fake duck " . But the only product I have seen bearing the generic label " vegetable meat " is <URL> . It is made from soya beans whose fat has been extracted to be used for oil production . As for " non artificial " , I have no idea what your personal definition of " artificial " is . It does n't grow on trees , but then neither does butter , and I have never heard people condemn butter as " artificial " . It is a processed product , and it is not a traditional process , but I ca n't tell you if it is more or less processed than traditional heavily processed foods such as sugar . Also , the amount of chemicals involved is probably dependent on the manufacturer . I guess you have to trust the regulatory organs of your country to not allow the production of food containing something harmful . Organic ? This depends on the manufacturer too . If he adhers to organic production guidelines , then it is organic . And hygienic ? This is even harder to answer , it depends on not only the manufacturer 's decisions about the process , but also on the day-to-day process quality measures his employees take . There is no reason to say that " vegetarian meat " is the same as vegetarian Chinese food . A cup of rice served in a Chinese restaurant is vegetarian and Chinese , but does not include any kind of meat substitute . If I cook a French recipe and use textured soy protein as meat replacement , this makes it vegetarian , but not Chinese . There can be some overlap between the two , but I doubt that it is big . China has had social conditions leading to vegetarian lifestyles ( poverty , religious restrictions ) for long before production of such protein began . I doubt that any restaurants in the world are famous for it , mainly because it is a poor meat analogue . Yes , it offers a high amount of protein . But it does not taste really like meat . World-famous restaurants are world-famous because they offer high-quality food , and no food using inferior substitutions is high-quality . Yes , there are good vegetarian restaurants , but they do n't make poor imitations of meat dishes using fake meats , they offer vegetarian dishes made from good ingredients . Some of them can feature some of the more popular soy products like tofu , but they are probably not famous for their tofu , because the tofu is not the main star of all dishes . This all assumes that what you refer to is actually the textured vegetable protein I linked , but that is far from clear from your question . Other possibilities exist , because people have long tried to find a suitable meat substitute for vegetarians and for people who ca n't afford real meat . Most are soy-based , like the mentioned tofu and tempeh , but there are also wheat-based ones like seitan , and I think that there was some kind of beans product used sometimes instead of meat . Without you giving us more information , we ca n't conclude for sure which one you mean . But the answers to the other questions is about the same , with the exception that some processing methods are older than others and so can be considered more traditional ( in case this plays a role for your understanding of " artificial " ) .
Look at : <URL> Conversion Measurements for Using Different Yeasts in Recipes :
Thinking about this from first principles , a banana is about : 75 % water 20 % carbohydrates ( mostly sugar and a small amount of starch ) Less than 5 % combined fiber and protein Trace amount of fat ( generally considered to be zero ) . The anti-crystallization effect of guar gum works on the water component , so adding a small amount of guar gum actually should be of some benefit . The hard part is getting it all dispersed ; you do n't want to over-process the banana ( you 'd lose the creaminess ) but you also need to hydrate the guar gum in order for it to work its magic . You also need to avoid over-thickening , which might be difficult even with the very small starch content in a typical banana . Bananas convert more starch to sugar as they ripen , so I suspect you 'd have more success trying this on very ripe bananas that are , essentially , little more than sugar and water to begin with . Incorporating and maintaining air is something that I just do n't think you 're going to be able to do . Proteins and fats can both participate in foaming ( egg whites being an example of the former , and heavy cream being the canonical example of the latter ) , but bananas have neither of those . There 's simply nothing to whip , and thus nothing to stabilize , so neither xanthan gum nor any other emulsifier/stabilizer is going to do you much good here . If you really want to incorporate air then you 're going to need more than one ingredient . My instinct would be to say coconut milk , which has relatively high fat and pairs well with banana ( and obviously is also vegan / non-dairy ) , but I can say from experience now that coconut milk just does n't have enough fat . You could try cooking it down first to get the fat ratio up , or using coconut oil , but I 'm not sure how it would taste . Traditional ice cream is about 60 % water , which means the amount of guar gum that most people seem to get the best results with ( about 1 tsp/qt ) is about 0.87 % of the total water . For a small ( 100 g ) banana , that 's about 75 mL of water corresponding to very close to 1/8 tsp of guar gum . So , I 'd give this a try with 1/8 tsp of guar gum , forget the xanthan gum . Try adding it after you 've frozen the banana for the first time , when you first pop it into the blender . No guarantees , but , you can probably afford to waste one banana in the attempt . Update : I thought I 'd give this a try myself since ( a ) it seemed pretty easy and ( b ) I can always use more non-dairy dessert recipes . Here 's how it came out with 1/4 tsp of guar gum for 2 bananas , after being frozen for two days : You can see that ice crystal formation is pretty minimal , and although some parts did harden a bit ( much like ordinary homemade ice cream with low overrun ) , they returned to normal consistency within just a few minutes . Of course it still tastes like frozen bananas , so if I were to do this again I think I 'd probably try adding a few other flavours . Also note that even though the texture is decent , the colour is getting dark , and I have no doubt that this would eventually turn black after enough time in the freezer - and the lemon juice trick does n't really work so well when the whole thing has been blended up .
The cooking snobs will say that butter is better , and even my fading taste buds can sometimes detect the difference . But much of the time you can make the substitute . BTW the reason for the 7/8 figure is that butter runs about 1/8 water . So you may have to use 7/8 cup of oil and 1-2 tablespoons of water . The biggest difference between solid fat and oil will occur when you see lines like , " Blend together with a pastry blender until you have crumbs the size of a pea . A pie crust made with oil will not be a tender flaky crust . However for bannock making in the bush , corn oil works fine as a substitute for lard . and it 's a heck of a lot easier to keep . A comment below mentions cookie recipes . For this to be successful , the flour to fat ratio has to be fairly high . Bannock is 1 cup of flour to 1-2 tbs of fat . This is small enough that the flour absorbs all the oil . Another signal : If the directions call for chilling the dough then there is enough fat in the mix that using oil would make the recipe way too liquid . I suspect this is the case with many cookies . Cake recipes usually do n't have as high a fat : flour ratio as many cookies , but cakes are often very fussy about ingredient ratios . So : Test before counting on it . It does work for bannock . 1 cup flour 1 to 3 tbs fat or oil 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder Tiny amount of water . If you are going to fry the bannock , go light on the oil . Mix flour and salt and baking powder . Mix in fat . Mix in just enough water to make a stiff dough that holds together . It is very easy to overdo . Knead only long enough to mix . Cooking : 1 . Shape into long strips about 3/8 " thick , wrap around smooth pole and bake over a 10 second fire for 15 minutes rotating slowly . ( A 10 second fire : YOu can hold your hand where the cooking happens for 10 seconds ) Pat out into 3/8 to half inch slabs . Cook in a frying pan over a 20 second fire for 5-10 minutes on a side . Pat out to 1/8 " thick . Drop into a bucket with 2 inches of smoking hot lard in the bottom . Lift out with tongs after 30 seconds . Method 1 will keep campers busy for a long time . Method 2 makes bannock you can use for a meal later . Method 3 is the fastest method , but it is dangerous .
The key to this is really high heat and pan-fry in a single layer , very quickly . The goal is to get that nice brown caramelized surface and barely cook the interior and then get it out of the pan before it starts to seep water . Also , wait to season with salt until it comes out of the pan so it does n't draw out the water prematurely .
Absolutely , go ahead and use it . I always ignore the " white and light green parts " instruction anyway , and use the leek up until the point where it feels dried out instead of firm and fleshy -- well into the dark green parts -- and it 's always delicious , even when cooked for significantly less than several hours .
Your best bet for this is xanthan gum , which is an excellent stabiliser . Whilst the distinction between ' natural ' and ' unnatural ' is fraught with difficulties , insofar as xanthan gum is a product of microbial fermentation then it is no more ' unnatural ' than alcohol or vinegar . Be careful not to use too much though ( unless , of course , you want your drink to have the texture of mucus ) , you really only want to use about 0.4 % of the volume of the liquid you 're trying to stabilise : so if you have 500ml of milk then you would use 2g of gum . Add it to your liquid and use a blender or an immersion stick to incorporate , a few pulses should do , any more than that and you 'll just incorporate air and you could just end up with an annoyingly stable foam !

During my younger days working in restaurants I have grated many pounds of cheese using a ' meat grinder ' ( or rather the meat grinder attachment for a hobart stand mixer ) ... I have also used my home Kitchen Aid meat grinder for cheeses ( cheddar , jack and mozzarella mostly ) . So , it depends on the grinder and the attachments you have but yes it can be done . You want a fine grinder plate and cold cheese ( so it stays together better ) . You probably also want to be doing a " serious quantity " as the set up/tear down/clean up will be an endeavor . If your having friends and family over for a Mexican Fiesta , perfect . If you are making a quick plate of nachos ... OVERKILL . . For a few burgers , do it once and decide for yourself if you want to do it again . It wo n't be bad for the grinder It wo n't be bad for the cheese Expect Leftovers ... ( note : IMHO near frozen mozzarella for lasagna is a perfect place to use a grinder for cheese ... )
Possible reasons : Horrible temperature control - this is simply a problem of cheap construction . One could theoretically build an excellent toaster oven with precise temperature control , but why would you ? Low thermal mass - If you get an oven to 400F and open it for long enough to put in food , the result is an oven at very slightly less than 400F , and which will quickly return to 400F . Do that with a toaster oven , and who knows what temperature you 'll get , or how quickly it will get to your desired temperature ( if ever , see # 1 ) . This is not a slam at toaster ovens , this is just due to them being approximately 2 % of the volume of a standard oven . Closeness to elements . It 's easy for toaster ovens interiors to vary by nearly 50F from middle to edge , simply based on distance to elements Now do n't get me wrong , I once made some kickin ' Oysters Rockefeller in a toaster oven , when I thought that they would be the difference between serving an appetizer and being allowed to serve breakfast the next morning ( wink , wink ) . If you know what you 're doing , and watch carefully and continually , a toaster oven can be an excellent source of high ( ish ) direct heat . But they are extremely difficult to control , and extremely unforgiving of errors . I ca n't think of a circumstance where a toaster oven would be my first choice of cooking tool ( and that includes microwave , campfire , plumber 's blowtorch ) .
I freeze cheese all the time , mostly mozzarella . It keeps longer . ( If I keep mozzarella or similar cheeses too long in the fridge it gets moldy , often even before its expiration date . ) However , I usually use frozen cheese only for cooking - i.e. if it 's going to be melted . Freezing cheese does change the texture . Parmesan , though , being a hard , aged cheese would probably be less affected by freezing . However , on the same token , aged cheeses keep very nicely in the fridge , so I would n't see much benefit in freezing it .
You <URL> . Once it 's opened it 's good for a month or so with no appreciable change . After that the flavour and colour starts to degrade , but it 's still safe to eat . Worcestershire sauce is fermented for more than a year before it 's bottled , so it will change at a much slower rate than an acidic , but unfermented sauce like ketchup . Still , it 's only good for a few years after it 's opened .
Shellfish is usually somewhat sweet in flavour . Acidity is the natural balance to sweetness .
Soy sauce , sake or mirin and sugar are the usual ingredients in a teriyaki sauce . The rice wines in particular are vital for an authentic teriyaki flavour . So the question is somewhat moot : onions are n't usually found in teriyaki sauce anyway . The onions naturally add flavour to your marinade : if you like it , leave them in , if you do n't , take them out . The onions wo n't have any major chemical effect on the marination process . Personally I would ditch the olive oil , replace it with toasted sesame oil and add garlic and ginger for a more rounded and authentically flavoured East Asian marinade .
Compound butter is a very nice accompaniment for fish . " Compound butter is a mixture of softened butter and at least one other ingredient . Some ideas for compound butter are : herbs , spices , citrus zest/juice , honey , fresh mint , soft cheeses ( like goat ) , fresh or dried peppers , and nuts ... you get the idea -- this list could be endless ! " You can cook the fish on its own and then put the compound butter on top to melt over it . While soft the butter can be put into a piping bag and piped as rosettes and refrigerated until ready to use . Makes for a nice presentation . Another common accompaniment to fish is mango salso or a combination of tropical fruits ( mango pineapple for example ) . This seemed like a good link for ideas for sauces for Haddock : <URL>
Quite simply , it 's the fat content . Whole milk or " full-fat " milk is 3.25 % fat by weight . Heavy cream is 36-40 % fat by weight . These two products are at opposite ends of the fat spectrum , and there 's very little difference between 1 % and 3 % when it comes to an item such as caramel sauce , for which the optimal ratio is about 50 % fat . ( A little butter can boost the fat content from 40 % to 50 % ) . You might be able to substitute standard/single cream ( 18-20 % ) or maybe even coffee cream/half-and-half ( 10 % ) , but any lower than that and you 're just making sugary milk . Other alternatives to ( possibly ) get it thicker : Use ( much ) less milk ; I 'd advise not attempting a direct substitution , just find a recipe based on milk . Even the best milk-based caramel sauce will still be substantially runnier and/or grittier than a cream-based sauce . Considering that butter is 80 % fat and homo milk is 3.25 % , you could use a mixture of ( approximately ) half milk and half butter that would emulate the fat content of heavy cream . I 've never tried this personally , and I suspect that the flavour might be a little off , but at least it would be closer to the expected texture . Try a reduction ( simmer off the water in the milk ) . You 'll be simmering a long time , and you 'll have to watch it very carefully to make sure it does n't burn , and you 'll probably have a nasty stuck-on mess to clean up in the pan afterward , but it will thicken .
To quote On Food and Cooking ( Harold McGee ) , page 63 , about crystals in Cheddar : In aged Cheddar , there are often crystals of calcium lactate , formed when ripening bacteria convert the usual form of lactic acid into its less soluble mirror ( " D " ) image . In blue cheeses : The white crystals often visible against the blue mold of a Roquefort , or detectable in the rind of a Camembert , are calcium phosphate , deposited because the Penicillium molds have made the cheese less acid , and calcium salts less soluble . And , in other aged cheeses : In Parmesan , Gruyere , and aged Gouda , the crystals may be calcium lactate or else tyrosine , an amino acid produced by protein breakdown that has limited solubility in these low-moisture cheeses . So , basically there are a variety of salts present in the milk , and formed from milk by the action of bacteria and molds . As the cheese dries , and ripening micro-organisms act on the cheese , these salts fall out of the solution and crystallize . Personally , I love the slight crystalline texture present in aged cheeses , as it almost always comes with a robust and mature flavor .
In either case store the cheese in the liquid it came in , transferring it to a clean container and covering well . Feta lasts reasonably well , but mozzarella only keeps well for a couple of days .

Thickening with starch or flour instead of roux can be quite acceptable if some other rich flavors are added . Here is where the calories can be traded in : Good low-fat broth for part of the liquid . celery root or coriander root are particularly good ing . for veggie broth Puree , in small amounts add body and flavor . soft cooked onion is particularly silky and surprisingly mild Flavorsome oils , few drops instead of copious butter . Macadamia punches above its weight . Sesame toasted ( tiny amount ) or if feeling adventurous , pricklyash from Asian market . lower-fat ' milks ' can add luscious body instead of cream or 3 % dairy milk . Unsweetened Almond or coconut does n't overwhelm most sauces .
Minerals , naturally found in salt whether it 's mined or evaporated ; and believe it or not , water . <URL> In the US , the FDA requires that salt must not contain more than 2.5 % minerals other than NaCl and still call itself salt . That 2.5 % does not include water . <URL> Your numbers for sodium content seem a bit low , but not extremely so , especially for a very unrefined , wet salt . The more refined the salt , the less trace minerals it will contain . Outside the US , it 's possible that your salt also contains added iodine , fluoride , folic acid and/or anti-caking agents , but in the US those would be listed among the ingredients , and would be included in that 2.5 % . Only iodine and anti-caking agents are common in the US . Plus , nutritional information labels have legal margins of error . If and when they can , they 'll be slick . Lower sodium looks good on a nutritional label .
Tomatoes relax the lower esophageal sphincter , a muscle at the top of the stomach that contracts to keep stomach contents from going back up the esophagus . The more concentrated the sauce the more the relaxing effect . Alcohol does this as well , and over-eating can lead to the LES muscle being unable to overcome the pressure . So if you had a big portion of pizza with extra strong tomato sauce and a few beers or glasses of wine it 's a triple-whammy .
There are <URL> ( usually of Italian origin ) specifically made with olive oil . In breads , you can certainly use it , although there often is not enough olive oil for its flavor to truly be appreciated . New York style pizza dough , for example , is traditionally made with some olive oil .
Kosher salt is the same thing ( though I 'm pretty sure it 's not iodized ) , but the crystals are less dense and larger . There 's more air in each piece , and they do n't pack together as tightly . That means you have to put a larger volume of kosher to get the same amount of actual sodium chloride ( salt ) . Think of it as the difference between ice cubes ( regular salt ) and snow ( kosher ) . Both are water , but ice cubes are way denser than a scoop of snow . When melting it , you 'll need more volume of snow to come out to the same amount of water as you 'd get from a few ice cubes . So no , it 's not worse for you .
Most of the popular ingredients for BBQ sauce ( vinegar/ketchup/sugar etc. ) tend not to mix very well together . I know whenever I 've made BBQ sauce , placing all of the ingredients into a pan together they tend to separate and are difficult to combine . Heating up the ingredients , however , causes them to combine better , and after a short time cooking they will bind together and give a more consistent texture/taste . Otherwise the different ingredients may continue to separate even when mixed , and you may find clumps of sugar that have not dissolved into the liquid etc. . It 's quite possible your BBQ sauce recipe does n't need cooking , so long as things are substituted ( like sugar for sugar syrup or honey ) in order to combine better , but this may well give an incorrect texture because of the change in ingredients . Therefore if the ingredients you use can be combined without being heated , it 's likely that it does n't need cooking , however you may end up with an uneven flavor . As pointed out in a comment by @ToddWilcox , there may also be constituent ingredients that do require cooking , such as garlic or onion , in order to achieve the correct flavor so that they do not taste raw . Some sauces may also specify being cooked simply to make them thicker or more concentrated , as adding thickening agents such as flour may affect the taste , particularly if it is uncooked . So whilst there are some BBQ sauce recipes that may get away with being uncooked based on their ingredients , there are others that will definitely require cooking .
Short answer : tomato sauce is a <URL> . Another interesting link can be found <URL> . Tomato sauce in an interesting creature . Think about ketchup . You try you shake some out and nothing . So you tap the bottle a little bit , still nothing . Tap it a little harder , and a little harder , and suddenly boom : a flood of ketchup . The " jumpiness " of tomato sauce is caused by the same physics . Basically , tomato sauce has two things in it that contribute to this characteristic : water and tomato pulp . At first , the tomato pulp is just lying around every which way , which makes the sauce act a lot thicker . But when the strands of pulp are aligned , it makes the sauce act a lot more like water . Heating up the sauce increases the pressure on the sauce , allowing areas of the sauce to become much more fluid , resulting in bubbling , popping , and the flinging of tomato sauce all over your clean white shirt . The same effect is what makes ketchup come flying out of the bottle - when you whack it hard enough , the pressure changes the state of the ketchup , and the ketchup literally flows like water . Edit : updated with relevant information Unfortunately , when I managed to get a hold of Mr. Steingarten 's lovely book , <URL> , * I discovered that the passage regarding tomato sauce as a non-Newtonian fluid was exclusively regarding ketchup , and not general tomato sauce as I thought I remembered . However , this description is still a valuable one , and it does help explain this particular characteristic of tomato-based sauces ( after all , ketchup is a tomato based sauce ) [ p 96 ] : It was only after I had send a stream of ketchup streaking across my wife 's favorite tablecloth , a lovely hand-printed Indian cotton from a shop on the rue Jacob , that I telephoned Professor Malcolm Bourne at Cornell for a lesson in non-Newtonian fluids . Sir Isaac Newton wrote the laws governing liquids that flow like water : the more force you exert on them , the faster they flow . But ketchup is different . Composed of tangled red tomato fibers suspended in a sweet and acidic colorless serum , ketchup behaves like a solid both at rest and under low levels of pressure : but then , at some higher threshold , it suddenly begins flowing like an ordinary fluid . That 's why the frustrated ketchup lover who loses patience with gentle taps on the bottle 's bottom and prematurely shifts to a powerful wallop ends up with a gush of ketchup over everything . Ketchup and mayonnaise are known as Bingham fluids , named after the scientist who characterized them early [ last ] century . * Personally , I think that The Man Who Ate Everything is a must-read for anyone interested in culinary science , and a should-read for anyone interested in food . Second Edit : Due to a handful of downvotes that I received while I slept last night , I guess some clarification is needed : I just want to be absolutely clear here , I am in no way implying that . I offer this information as an example of how tomato pulp suspended in liquid acts . The fact that " tomato sauce is thick " does n't really hold up . The question even clearly states : " Of all the sauces and creams I prepare in a hot pot , tomato sauce is the most jumpy " , which presumably includes thick ones . If thickness was the only factor ( and I 'm not saying that it is n't a factor ) , we would see similar actions from cheese sauces , bechamels , gravies , and a variety of soups . While these sauces/soups do splatter , tomato sauce is significantly more " splattery . " Put a pot of tomato sauce next to any other sauce/soup , take your pick , and heat them to the same temperature . I can pretty much guarantee that given similar conditions , you 're going to be wiping up a lot more tomato sauce than the other one . One last edit : <URL> on Slate indicates that it 's a combination of the above ( being a " plastic liquid " ) , the viscosity , and pectin , as pointed out by Brendan in a comment below .
I think you 've answered your own question . It adds an elusive flavor that most people feel enhances the creamy flavors .

Is bacon fat supposed to congeal at room temperature ?
To answer what I think is the question ( you put all of the grease into a container and there 's a residue at the top ) , bacon drippings are not 100 % fat . There are also solid pieces of bacon in there and other " impurities " from the curing process . When rendering bacon fat , you should line the container with a paper towel first ( or cheesecloth if you have it ) . Pour the bacon drippings onto the paper towel and the fat will drain out the bottom ; the solids will be left behind and you can dispose of them . You 'll be left with ( mostly ) pure fat . The rendered fat will most definitely congeal ; the vessel , once cooled , should contain only a solid , off-white substance .
Time for a safety lesson . When you are dealing with food products that can spoil , what you are concerned about is the <URL> , which is the temperature range at which bacteria multiplies fastest . While specific numbers will vary , a decent rule of thumb is 4-60 degrees Celsius . What that means is any food prone to spoilage must be kept out of that temperature range , and if it is going to be within that temperature range , it must be for less than four hours , aggregated across the product 's lifetime . What this also means is that when you are chilling hot food you need to do so as fast as possible , in order to minimize the time spent in the Danger Zone . Foods that are dangerous are the ones you would expect : anything which requires refrigeration . Potatoes , for example , are perfectly safe to keep at room temperature when raw , but must be refrigerated once cooked . ( Perhaps a poor example , as potatoes fare better when kept below room temp but above fridge temp , but you catch my drift I hope ) . So we 're talking about raw meats , most dairy ( very hard cheeses may be kept at room temp with no ill effects other than possible softening ) , many vegetables and fruits , that sort of thing . Eggs and butter can be considered a somewhat special case ; eggs can be kept at room temp with few problems ( and in fact eggs used to be kept right out on kitchen counters , in the shell of course , not after they have been cracked ) , while butter can generally be kept at room temperature for a few days before the fats will start to become rancid ( anecdata : we never kept butter in the fridge when I was a kid , except for butter my mother needed for baking , where the temperature is a matter of physics in the recipe , and not health . Never had any problems . ) Harder vegetables -- potatoes , carrots , parsnips -- can generally be kept at room temp without problems , as can many fruits -- apples , oranges ( all thick-rind citrus really ) , bananas , and so on . So . According to the food safety experts , you absolutely should not leave even cooked poultry out overnight , as any bacterial contamination will be severe after a few hours . In real terms , unless you are very young/old or immunocompromised in some way ( e.g. leukemia , chemotherapy , HIV/AIDS , etc ) you 're probably going to be okay . I am a professional chef , and at home I 'm pretty lackadaisical about expiry dates , how long most things have been sitting out , etc. . In the context of work , however , I am extremely anal about rapid chilling/heating and keeping food safe , and I will always advise other people to be cautious with their food ; what I choose to do with my own body is my concern . When In Doubt , Throw It Out is always good advice ; there 's a reason it was stencilled across the inside of the walk-in refrigerator door at one restaurant I worked at . You should also bear in mind that much of the time bacterial contamination is not detectable by the eye , nose , or tongue until it has become severe . Even when contamination is not detectable with our senses , serious illness can occur ( see , for example , recent outbreaks of E. coli , listeria , and salmonella , none of which can be detected with eyes/nose/tongue ) . So the ' smell test , ' while in use by almost everyone who cooks food , is really not all that reliable as a gauge for spoilage ; taste and smell can definitively say that a given product has gone bad , but it can not say that a given product is definitively okay to eat . ( As a side note on food safety , if cheese has gone mouldy , do n't trim off the mouldy bits . Just throw it out . While much of the time any such mould will be entirely harmless , it 's not worth taking the chance over , especially given that if mold has bloomed on the surface of the cheese , spores will be present on the entire surface , with penetration into the cheese itself . Seriously , just toss it , and re-examine how you store your cheese and/or how much you 're buying at a time ) . Even easier to remember : keep hot food hot ( above 60C ) and cold food cold ( below 4C ) . Make things hot as fast as possible , and cold as fast as possible . ( Note that I am a cooking professional , not a medical professional , and nothing here should be construed as medical advice . Always err on the side of caution . )
<URL> answered this question . Here are some quotes from the webpage . According to the USDA : Round chicken/turkey : 165 ° F / 74 ° C Whole chicken/turkey : 180 ° F / 82 ° C Poultry breasts , roasts : 170 ° F / 77 ° C Additionally , the USDA says the thighs and wings of poultry should be cooked " until the juices run clear . " Although the following temperatures will make the meat safe to eat , you might want to drop the temperature by 3-5 ° C for more flavor .
No , you 're not crazy . You have good taste . The reason for drinking darker beer like stouts and porters is for the flavor . If they are over-chilled , you lose most of that flavor . Do n't obsess over it , but in general a lot of people serve dark beer too cold . That said , you should drink your beer at whatever temperature makes you happy . There is nothing wrong with a nice cold pilsner or Hefe-wizen on a hot day .
There are a variety of ways to make yogurt . One that might be " easy " would to use a thermal cooker ( giant thermos flask ) if you happen to already have one , which would be under the " maintain temperature " ( actually temperature will fall , but slowly ) classification - but if you already have one , it 's no extra cost or equipment needed . Others have a thermostat and heater , but it 's rarely an adjustable thermostat . I am currently using a dehydrator which is adjustable as my temperature control device ; I have in the past used an oven with a standing pilot light ( not adjustable , but a good temperature . ) Regardless of which type you use , you need to cool the milk ( after scalding ) to 35-40c before adding the yogurt culture ( a small amount of any yogurt with live culture ) or you will kill the culture - so you ca n't just dump 80C milk into " whatever " and expect yogurt , regardless of temperature controls or lack of temperature controls . My research and personal testing W.R.T. the tradeoffs of time and temperature has lead me closer to 35C ( for up to 24 hours ) than 40C as a default setting . On the other hand , some go as high as 45C .
In my experience , you 'll get the best bacon if you start with a cold pan . Throwing it onto a hot pan sounds impressive ( it sizzles right away ) , but it will also make the bacon shrink/curl up much more and faster . I cook bacon half by look , and half by sound . After you cook it a couple times you 'll see ( hear ) what I mean - the sizzle changes significantly as the fat renders off . I usually flip it as soon as the sound starts to change , and I flip more than once to reduce curling ( unless you have a bacon press , see below ) . If you do n't have one , I recommend a <URL> , especially if you like crispy bacon . It also helps it cook faster . In a pinch , you can use the bottom of a smaller pan - I cook bacon in a 12 " cast iron pan , and use an 8 " pan as the bacon press . If you do n't have a <URL> , you 're going to want one ... ... unless you wanted to cook your bacon in the oven . This is great for large batches , reducing splatter , and unattended bacon cooking . Steps to oven bacon : preheat oven to 400 cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil put bacon on foil , leaving a little space between cook for 12-18 minutes depending on desired crispiness . I lean towards crispier bacon so I usually start watching at 12 , pull it out at 15 . One other note , no matter which method you use , you 're going to want to take the bacon off the heat a minute or so before it 's at the desired crispiness - it will continue to cook slightly after you take it off . There have been a few times I 've made it to my desired doneness , tasted it out of the pan , been very happy with it , moved it to paper towels to drain , tried it a minute later , and it was too crispy . So be aware of that possibility .
With a pork tenderloin : Season the meat , sear all sides in a very hot pan , and then finish in the oven at 350 ° F ( 175 ° C ) degrees until the internal temp . hits 145 ° F ( 63 ° C ) . Then let it sit for 10 minutes , and cut ' er up . If you need it done faster , a higher oven temp will accomplish this , but may compromise quality . But like I said , for a tenderloin , you do n't want too low , or too high . Just watch the internal temperature , that is the key .
Many of the dried noodles that are marketed as " udon " -- at least in my experience in the USA -- are actually mislabeled , thinner noodles like <URL> or even <URL> . I would suggest buying the semi-dried variety that are usually packaged in vacuum sealed plastic . This variety is shelf stable , but it can often be found in the refrigerated section of Asian mega-marts . The noodles will already be almost full size before cooking .
Martha 's Vinyard Magazine suggests that the diamater of the stalks is not directly related to their age as one might suspect : Some might assume thinner spears are younger and therefore more tender . The diameter , however , has more to do with the age of the plant itself and the particular asparagus variety . They go on to cite Cook 's Illustrated , saying : [ T ] hin and thick spears as equally sweet , nutty , and grassy , but ... thicker spears have a slightly better , more tender texture . The reason is that the fiber is somewhat more concentrated in thinner spears . You can peel asparagus if you choose to . Personally , I peel the base of thicker stalks . Mark Bittman recommends peeling from just under the flowers to the base of the stalk on the thicker stalks . Thinner stalks may be easier to saute or grill , and thicker ones more suited to steaming , poaching , and so on , but this is more related to the time it takes them to cook through .

Jolenealaska 's answer provides the basics -- internal temperatures over boiling inside baked goods just do n't tend to happen under normal conditions . The reason is because most doughs and batters contain a lot of water . The final baked goods generally still retain a lot of that water , too . When the dough is hot and in the oven , however , that water will be heated and will gradually evaporate from the dough . Assuming you get to close to 212F/100C , at normal atmospheric pressure , water will actually be " boiling " out of the dough . For the external surface of baked goods , that moisture can leave rapidly enough that the surface rises to higher temperatures ( forming a crust ) . But internally , the moisture keeps boiling out , maintaining a temperature below or at boiling . Unless you have a weird situation where you are somehow cooking your baked goods under pressure , water will continue evaporating out of the batter/dough at 212F/100C until the dough/batter has pretty much turned into a dry cracker internally . That 's the only way you 'll ever achieve an internal temperature much over 212F/100C : to bake things until they are basically dried out inside ( which is not a desirable feature in most baked goods ) . As for the maximum useful temperature , that depends on the baked good and the ingredients . I have to disagree with Jolene slightly here and say I have a number of bread recipes that recommend an internal temperature of 205F or so . Temperatures over 200F are only generally for lean crusty bread doughs ( like baguettes or something ) , which often start with a fairly moist dough . The high internal temperature means that more moisture has been removed , which will keep the crust more firm and , well , " crustier . " The more enriched your bread dough , generally the lower the desired final temperature . Basically , above 175F or so , the gluten coagulation is complete and the dough structure is formed . So , bread can be " done " anywhere from 175F to about 210F . If you have a very rich sandwich loaf or brioche or something , you might find that a temp of 180-190F is sufficient . Large loaves may also need different temperature handling than small buns , for example , since residual heat will continue the baking process outside the oven longer in larger loaves , but it also takes longer for moisture to migrate out of the center of a large loaf . As for other baked goods , similar advice applies . Cakes and quickbreads are generally done once you get to around 190-195F , though the ingredients will really affect this . A " drier " style cake without lots of " stuff " in the batter ( e.g. , pound cake ) might go to 205F or even 210F before it 's " done " according to normal criteria , while a quickbread made with loads of fruit might " get stuck " in the range around 190-195F for a long time because there 's just so much moisture . ( And it 's basically done there anyway . ) For cakes or other baked goods which are meant to be excessively moist ( with a fudge interior or something ) , 175F might be sufficient , since again that 's roughly the temperature when baked goods get a final " set " structure . ( Of course , there are also things like " lava " cakes where the interior is not actually fully cooked ; in that case , internal temp should be determined by food safety criteria sufficient to cook the eggs , which might be a little lower . ) And again , shape and size are often important for these numbers , because residual heat will lead to further stabilizing of the structure in large things after they come out of the oven . So , a particular cake might be " done " at 195F , but making cupcakes with the same batter might require 200 or 205F to get the same texture . It 's hard to specify a generic all-purpose desirable maximum temperature , because various changes continue to happen to baked goods after the structure gets set at 175F or so . Between 175F and 195F , the starches continue to gelatinize and some enzyme activity will continue . Above 195F , it 's mostly about drying things out to the desired final texture .
The smoke produced from a heated oil is n't all too different from the smoke produced by a fire . You are essentially burning that oil and causing rapid , incomplete oxidation ( or rather <URL> ) . In actual fact , the peroxidation will start to occur long before you hit the smoke point ; however , smoking is an indicator that this is happening very rapidly . The net effect is very similar to that of rancidity , in that it will produce many <URL> and <URL> , and while this is n't the place to be debating whether or not that 's bad for you , I will simply point to the aforementioned link on free radicals and say that at the present time , the prevailing belief is that these free radicals have deleterious effects . It 's up to you decide what level of risk is acceptable to you . The effect may in fact be identical to that of rancidity , although I ca n't confirm that with a source at this time ; all I know is that heating an oil up to its smoke point will increase the oxidation rate ( make it go rancid faster ) , and rancidity in turn lowers the smoke point , so the two are definitely related . So what I 'd say is , if you do n't mind the idea of occasionally eating rancid fat , then go ahead and smoke it all you want ; otherwise , you might want to be more careful . <URL> , even if the actual ingestion is n't . So again , be careful . Avoid overheating oil if you can . By the way , saturated fats like coconut oil , animal fat or ( clarified ! ) butter tend to have the most immunity to this particular chemical breakdown , as evidenced by their naturally higher ( unrefined ) smoke points . Lipid peroxidation works on the double bonds , which do n't exist in saturated fats ( polyunsaturated fats have the most ) .
Bacon cooks to safe very quickly . Once it 's opaque it is safe to eat . Raw bacon is itself pretty low risk , provided it has been properly cured . Even if it was n't cooked through , you are unlikely to come to harm .
In the US the closest thing you could ( easily ) get would be " <URL> " though this is n't quite correct since chitterlings are the small intestine , and tripa gorda is the large intestine .
To answer what I think is the question ( you put all of the grease into a container and there 's a residue at the top ) , bacon drippings are not 100 % fat . There are also solid pieces of bacon in there and other " impurities " from the curing process . When rendering bacon fat , you should line the container with a paper towel first ( or cheesecloth if you have it ) . Pour the bacon drippings onto the paper towel and the fat will drain out the bottom ; the solids will be left behind and you can dispose of them . You 'll be left with ( mostly ) pure fat . The rendered fat will most definitely congeal ; the vessel , once cooled , should contain only a solid , off-white substance .
<URL> 160 ° F ( 71 ° C ) for dishes containing eggs . If you 're scrambling eggs or making an omelette , as long as they 're coagulated/solidified , they 'll be safe . The easiest way to confirm this is with sous vide eggs . For example , this <URL> has 155 ° F , 160 ° F , and 165 ° F eggs : <URL> <URL> <URL> which clearly show that the white wo n't be totally solidified until 160 ° F or even 165 ° F , even when cooked for an extended period of time . ( To be clear , those lower-temperature eggs are actually safe if cooked for sufficient time . The point here is just to show coagulation versus temperature , to demonstrate that when eggs cooking in a pan , you can use the solidity as a temperature indicator . )
According to reviewers on <URL> and this <URL> , you should bake the waffles in an oven preheated to 220C ( 430F ) for about 9 minutes . If the outside gets done before the inside , drop the temperature so you can bake longer . Other , more obscure sites and blogs say the same thing . Did your box not include a recipe book ?
Keep the fats as cold as possible before you start . Done right , it will more than compensate for the warmth of hands , blender/processor parts , and ambient temperature . Having somewhat chilled your choice of fats , separate them into small , 1 inch sized pieces , working with copious flour to keep them from sticking to one another . Place this in the freezer overnight . This allows the blade to chew up even near-frozen bits . I have n't noticed much degradation with this method , though I would n't the leave fats in for much longer than that . Mix your dry ingredients together . Put the thoroughly chilled fats in a blender/mixer , leaving some room . Then , using only as much dry ingredients as necessary , pulse the fats until you have pearls slightly smaller than fish gravel . This works especially good for blenders where the ingredients tend to get stuck at the bottom . If you get the chance , stow the blended stuff in the freezer while you work with the next batch . Once you have completed the blending en masse , you can add the rest of the dry ingredients . You should have a uniform texture to the whole mixture . Add water until the dough comes together with limited kneading . Wrap and return to fridge as soon as possible .
If you 're cooking low and slow , with enough liquid , you 'll end up with a style of stew called ragoût . The trick is to not add the vegetables during the cooking , unless they 're either something that you want to break down , or you 've added enough acid to the cooking liquid to prevent onions and potatoes from fully disintegrating . Personally , I prefer to take pot-roast to this stage , as it 's what I grew up with . You might not get the ' cooked to rags ' quality of the meat , as you may not have agitated the meat before cooling . In the Good Eats episode ' Stew Romanace ' , <URL> . It 's possible that this might happen in your case ( although in his , he drains the liquid before cooling ) .
Just look out for artificial flavorings ; a lot of bacon comes with artificial " hickory " or " maple " flavors , which are disgusting and often taste like chemicals . The better bacon wo n't include such things . Nitrate-free bacon is important if you 're sensitive to nitrates . The fat content is more of a matter of taste than a hard-and-fast rule ; personally , I like a fair amount of fat because I like to cook other things in the rendered fat ! Same for the thickness . If you like very crispy bacon , you may want your bacon slightly thinner than the " thick-cut " styles that command a price premium .
The official position of the USDA is that all fish must be heated to 145 ° F ( 63 ° C ) , else it is considered undercooked . In practice , most people do n't do it , because fish is terribly overcooked at this temperature , and they seem to mostly live through it without ill effects . With salted fish , there is even less actual risk of foodborne illness . Still , I do n't think that anybody will assume the responsibility to tell you that it is " safe " when the responsible officials say it is n't . You are taking a risk , but none of us can quantify it or tell you if it is justifiable . Food science books often recommend preparing fish at temperatures lower than 63 ° C , but include a disclaimer that this is against food safety guidelines . A lower oven temperature can definitely produce a better result for your problem , because slower , more gradual heating means that you have a lesser heat gradient within the piece of fish . This means that the thin parts will overheat less in the time the center of the thick parts reaches 40 ° . However , this will only alleviate the problem , not eliminate it completely , unless you go for a very low temp cooking method like sous vide . If the lower oven temperature is n't enough for you , you might try other tricks to eliminate the problem , like changing the shape ( e.g. by creating rolls of fish ) .

Does chocolate syrup need to be refrigerated ?
It is likely that prior to use there is minimal likelihood of the ingredients separating as the transport and shelf storage of the item is likely considered controlled . Once in a home kitchen , the problem is not with spoilage ( there are plenty of preservatives in it ) , but that storage fluctuations and use may throw the emulsifiers . Although I am inclined to dismiss the need for refrigerating it , the is likely that across a few million units , a less stable batch may make its way into a hot and then cold and hot and then cold kitchen and the contents would separate . For big brands , a major focus is to ensure consistency among products in spite of quality or diverse ingredients ; hence watery domestic beer ( U.S. ) , Lay 's potato chips , and refrigerated chocolate syrup that is harder to use than when stored at room temp .
I generally find that basting while grilling is less about keeping the internal meat moist and more about preventing outside from scorching . If you 've brined and injected the turkey breast , I 'd say you are fine as long as the exterior is n't browning too quickly .
Thank you to everyone for your great advice . I ended up using a combination of everyone 's answers . I prepared the meatballs the night before and cooked them in the oven as per usual . I stored them overnight in the fridge in a large ice cream tub , rather than refrigerating the crock . ( Thanks for that tip Joe and MargeGunderson . ) In the morning , I combined everything in the crock pot and brought it to work . I started the crock pot on low at 8am . Everything was already cooked , so no need to worry there . The meatballs were heated through by noon . ( Thanks everyone for the tip on starting early . Thanks nico for the assurance on " mush " . ) Now , time for lunch !
It has been said : Better safe than sorry . You have n't measured the absolute sugar or acidity levels . Freezing it will do no harm . -- <URL> <URL> I 'm definitely not an expert with baking , but I 've worked with fruits in other contexts . The only time I would be worried about freezing would be if I added oil , like for a marinade or such . In your context I think freezing is fine , and sounds like it would be a convenient way to make larger batches to reuse throughout the year . PS : That puree sounds awesome , I might have to try that to marinate some chicken or pork chops !
Cocoa butter crystallizes into various types of crystals depending on the temperature at which it cools . If the butter cools into an ad hoc assortment of crystal types then they do n't arrange themselves uniformly and the chocolate will be dull and sticky . The process of melting chocolate to encourage proper crystal growth is called tempering . You will find <URL> a <URL> <URL> on the subject here . You can use any chocolate that contains cocoa butter . However , if you are going to be putting that much work into tempering your chocolate you might spring for the nicer quality chocolate and not just plain Hershey 's . Alternatively , if it meets your needs , you can either serve your chocolate still melted or make a thick syrup/fudge dip that stays soft and does n't need to be tempered .
You could thin a little syrup or honey with water and brush it on the top of the brownies so that it soaks in a sweetens them a little . Try it on one first .
Fondant must be kneaded like dough , until it 's soft and smooth , before you roll it out . If you roll it out straight from the pack it will be too cold and stiff .
You ca n't really substitute marshmallows in that recipe . I have had some luck with the following procedure : Get a good quality chocolate of the flavour you would like to use . Do not try chocolates with 70 % cocoa solids or more . They are good for some things , but not for this . Melt it in a double boiler . Do not make the chocolate boil or heat it directly ( some can do that but most people end up with burned chocolate ) . Remove it from the heat . Fold in 2 spoons of glycose syrup ( for regular nonmilky chocolate ) and mix fast . Let it cool and when it gets close to room temperature , put it in the fridge . For darker chocolates , use a bit more glucose and less for lighter chocolates .
When cooking in a slow cooker , you do not have to precook the leeks . I made a potato leek soup not too long ago that called for throwing everything in the pot and it came out great . The only thing I cooked before hand was the bacon , rendering out much of the fat and giving the nice golden brown and crispy bits to sprinkle on top . You CAN precook anything to help reduce the cook time and I always sear meat , but unless you are going to caramelize the leeks , you will not notice any difference in flavor or texture . As for the pureeing part , you want to be careful pureeing potatoes as they can turn into a nasty gluey mess . Just keep it to a minimum or use a food mill and you should be fine . I typically just use a potato masher and leave my soup a little on the chunky side .
What you need , my good man , is a candy fork . Basically it 's a two-tined fork with incredibly thin tines . Dip , lift , allow excess to drip off , place on parchment ( you will get a tiny ' foot ' but this is normal ) . unless you 're talking about absolutely perfect spheres ? to my knowledge this is not doable by hand , you will need industrial machinery . and the two hemispheres method will leave you with a seam . i have heard one solution for the tiny hole left by a thin skewer is another tiny dab of chocolate and a quick blast with a hair dryer to smooth out any imperfections , but i have never tried it myself .
Pure glucose is significantly thicker than a sugar syrup you would make on your own . It 's even thicker than honey . At the previous restaurant I was at , we would use glucose in some limited applications when making certain kinds of caramel sauces ( sorry , I did n't steal any recipes before I left ) , as ( if I recall correctly ) it has a higher tolerance for heat , and provides sweetness without caramelizing at the same temperatures as table sugar .
It is a common misconception that the shelf life of a cooked food ( = mix of ingredients ) is the same as the shelf life of the shortest-lived ingredient . I can not stress enough how wrong this assumption is . As with any cooked food , the shelf life of hot chocolate should be about 3 to 5 days in the fridge , with a cumulative stay in the danger zone of no longer than 2 hours . An explanation of why the assumption is wrong : Food spoils when bacteria ( or sometimes other organisms like mold ) create a colony in it . For this to happen , the food has to offer all the conditions an organism needs for survival . Most cooked foods are nutritious enough to ensure the survival of simple organisms . There are single ingredients which hold for longer . Bar chocolate is a good example . The reason for that is that they are not a complete medium . Chocolate does not have enough moisture for bacteria to grow in it . But as soon as you mix any ingredient with something else , you can not know if the other ingredients have not added the factor the bacteria have been missing . So , if you mix for example water ( practically indefinite shelf life because it has no calories ) and flour ( practically indefinite shelf life because it has no moisture ) , you get dough , which will have large bacterial colonies within 3 days . Exceptions in the other direction ( food that spoils sooner than 3 days ) are foods which decompose on their own . For example fish - it goes bad quickly even at fridge temperature , but the reason is the fish 's own enzymes , not bacteria . That 's why it is normally held on ice , if not frozen outright . As a side note , you can not rely on the expiration date of milk anyway . It is OK for traditionally pasteurized milk . But the expiration date of ESL and UHT milk is only valid as long as the packaging has not been broken . Once you open it , it is again good for about 5 days . Conclusion : For anything cooked , up to 5 days in the fridge is a good assumption . Make it less for food which is known for high risk of contamination ( e.g. food containing raw eggs ) , but never longer , even if the expiration date of the ingredients is longer than that .
My opinion - I have n't done rigorous testing : Canning softens the interior of the peach but when I have ( in my laziness ) left the skins on they stay tough and quite unpleasant tasting . I doubt it has any effect on the longevity of the product but it would make it a little less pleasant and versatile .
There are two things to keep in mind while melting chocolate : Keep a low uniform heat I start off the melting process with low to medium heat . Once the chocolate fully melts , I reduce the heat to low and keep gently stirring all the while . If you allow the chocolate to cool , it separates out into non-uniform areas of heat , and the cooler pockets start crystallizing . This causes lumps or spikes to form . However , if you go too high , the chocolate may burn . Keep the chocolate absolutely dry This also includes steam and condensation from the boiler . The water in the boiler should not splash over or steam into the chocolate . Also make sure that the dipped materials ( truffles in your case ) are totally dry . Presence of water causes rapid cooling of parts of the chocolate , which again causes lumps to form . It also causes sugar to crystallize out of the fine chocolate mix . This is called " seizing " , and such chocolate is very brittle and difficult to melt . EDIT : Here 's a nicely written article on the different methods of melting chocolate : <URL>
A Baker 's ( now owned by kraft foods ) employee named Sam German developed a chocolate recipe that was sweeter than semi-sweet chocolate , as well as containing a blend of chocolate liquor , sugar , cocoa butter , flavorings , and lecithin . Baker 's honored Sam by naming the chocolate that he created Baker 's German 's Chocolate . In 1957 the recipe was published in a Dallas newspaper , although nobody is sure exactly when the recipe was originally created . Generally Foods - who had bought the brand - noticed that alot of people liked the recipe and started a PR campaign for German 's Chocolate using the recipe . They started sending it to newspapers all over - and people liked it . At some point the " 's " got dropped from the name , introducing all of the confusion we have about the origin of the cake today . References : <URL> <URL> <URL>
The most common methods to create chocolate coated ice cream bars , with or without a stick are to : Use truly tempered chocolate , which may be more trouble than it is worth Use a mixture of chocolate thinned with vegetable oil . See for example , this recipe from <URL> .
The key factor in syrup 's shelf life is the water activity in the syrup , rather than the ingredients used to make it . Generally , the water is all ' bound up ' with dissolved sugar so microorganisms ca n't use it to grow , but the lighter the syrup , the more available water it will have . In my experience , simple syrup is usually kept refrigerated except for small portions that will be used within a day or two . For a chart of water activity ( aW ) of related foods , check here : <URL>
As a general principle , any ingredients which do not require refrigeration on their own will not require refrigeration when mixed . A notable exception is raw garlic in olive oil ; raw garlic carries botulinum spores , which propagate in anaerobic environments . Cold helps to prevent the spores from multiplying and producing toxin , but does n't prevent it entirely . In addition , you will find texture effects ; olive oil is fairly unique among unprocessed ( as in , unhydrogenated ) vegetable fats in that it solidifies at refrigeration temperatures .
Flaxseed oil goes rancid quickly , and refrigeration slows down this process . So , yes , you should do as the label says ( usually a good idea anyway ) and keep it in the fridge .
The reason for doing delayed fermentation in the fridge is that the yeast development is slowed down , while still allowing the enzymes that naturally occur in the flour to do their work ( converting starches to sugars , making a more flavorful dough ) . The risk of doing it on the counter instead of the fridge is that the enzymes are working AND the yeast is working , which can over-leaven the bread , and they 'll eat up the sugars you are trying to create with enzymes . Over-leavened bread is n't ideal , but it is n't the end of the world either . There is a lot to learn about bread baking if you want to really excel at it , but " just bake it , it 'll be fine " is always present as you experiment - glad the loaf turned out well ! " No-Knead " bread is a great introduction to " rustic " doughs ( very high water content ) , and to cold fermentation . Cold fermentation is about the best thing you can do for your bread as a home baker , whether or not you are using the no-knead recipe - I cold ferment nearly everything I bake . If you want to learn more about the process and jump off the deep end , Peter Reinhart 's book " The Bread Baker 's Apprentice " is a great place to start . It is detailed without being pedantic , simple without being over-simplified , and oriented for the home baker without forgetting the reasons that professionals do things the way they do .

What methods make tomato chopping less messy ?

Very high fat , thoroughly marbled ribeye is a good start , but there 's a fair amount of variation . The extremely thin slices are also not something that every butcher is accustomed to producing , but that should get you to the right beginning .
Caffeine is water soluble , but it takes a bit of time to be absorbed by water . What determines the caffeine content of a coffee process is how much time it spends with/in water . For example , a bodum French press will pick up more caffeine from the coffee since the grounds stay soaked for a while . Drip coffee will have more than a single espresso ( common misconception is to think the opposite ) . It 's likely that the instant coffee process passes the water through the coffee under pressure and faster than drip . This will naturally prevent the caffeine to be absorbed in water as much . Besides using decaf roast , what you may wish to do is get an americano coffee made with one or two Ristretto shots of espresso . A Ristretto shot is usually pull away after 10 seconds . Take a look at this analysis from the <URL> for the actual Caffeine values .
There are four methods for thawing frozen foods which are recognized as safe : In a refrigerator In the microwave Under cool running water As part of the cooking process These four methods all meet the criteria that they minimize the amount of time the food spends in the danger zone ( 40-140 F , 4-60 C ) where bacteria can grow . The pros and cons of the following often-recommended methods are also reviewed : Leaving food on the counter overnight Thawing in a bowl ( or sink ) of water On a metal pan or with a " miracle thaw " device In the refrigerator Thawing food in the refrigerator is slow ; it can take a day to thaw several pounds ( a kilogram or two ) , and even more time for larger foods like a whole frozen turkey . The advantage is that the refrigerator is at a safe temperature , and bacterial growth is already inhibited , so there is little risk . This is probably the preferred method for many foods , if you have the time . In the microwave Thawing in the microwave is fast , but it has several disadvantages : It requires a lot of attention , turning or rotating the food to get even coverage from the microwaves ; for items like ground beef , you might even need to scrape off the thawed portions and continue defrosting the frozen portion . It is easy to accidently go to far and start cooking the food , especially if it has an odd shape or small pointier parts sticking out ( like wings on a chicken ) . For this reason , microwave thawing is best done only for foods like soup or stew , where you can stir them and if one part boils a small amount while another part is frozen , no harm is done . Under cool running water This one is most surprising , but it is true : the fastest way to thaw food safely is under cool running water ( at or below 70 F / 21 C ) , like the cold water from your tap . The reason is that that water has an extremely high capacity for carrying heat , and the forced convection from running water ensures that it transfers heat from the food item as rapidly as possible . In the Good Eats episode <URL> , Alton Brown thawed several frozen ice duck sculptures by various methods . The one under cool running water was almost completely melted , even when the one in the oven at 200 F was still fairly recognizably bird shaped . It is important that the water be running , to ensure strong convection . You can do this by setting the food in the sink under a very small stream of water . If the food should not get wet , you can put it in a zip-type bag or similar to keep it dry . Try to remove as much air as possible , to get the best contact between the water and the food ( through the bag ) . This is the best method for forced , rapid thawing ( at least when microwaving is not appropriate or inconvenient ) , but it is probably less convenient that the refrigerator method . You also have to monitor the food , and remove it when it is thawed , or it will come to the ambient temperature of the water , which is probably in the danger zone . As part of the cooking process Some foods can be cooked starting from the frozen state , thawing and then cooking in one operation . Among the ones most suitable for this are are smaller or thinner items , such as : Cookie dough lumps Hamburgers Chicken parts Pizza Stew meat Frozen , chopped vegetables Frozen stock ( at least in smaller quantities ) Bad idea : on the Counter overnight This is a bad idea , especially for meats and other highly perishable items . You have no control over the temperature the surface of the food will reach , and it may begin to spoil at the surface before the center is thawed . Bad idea : In a bowl ( or sink ) of cold water Again , a bad idea . Without the convection , the thawing speed is reduced . There is also no source of newer , cooler water , so the temperature of the water itself will rise . Some parts of the food may reach dangerous temperatures before it is fully thawed . Also , if you do n't check the food frequently , the temperature can get into dangerous territories , facilitating spoilage . Risky : On a cast iron , stainless steel or other metal pan , or a " miracle thaw " device This method is most often used with thin foods like steaks or frozen hamburgers . Physics are with you , as the specific heat capacity and conductivity of the metal are very high ( higher even than water ) . The large surface area of the metal acts like a radiator or heat sink in reverse , conducting heat away from the food more rapidly than air alone would . This method is not approved by health codes for commercial use , and carries some risks . You need to monitor the food closely , and cook it or move it into the refrigerator as soon as it is thawed . Failure to do so will allow the food to spoil , and the conductivity of your metal will become your enemy , more quickly bringing the food to ambient temperature . While this method is not officially sanctioned , you may choose to assess its risks for yourself . See also : <URL> <URL>
By your description I would say it 's taro or 芋头 ( yu tao ) in chinese <URL> It can be bought in most chinese supermarkets For more info <URL>
I have no trouble making lovely light lemon cake gluten free , and many other gluten free cakes too , I make them for a living . There is a substitute for gluten and it 's called Xanthan Gum . You can buy this separately to add to your flour ( about a teaspoonful for every 250g ) , or in a ready mixed flour blend , at least you can in the UK . A mixture of flours such as rice , potato starch , tapioca and maize/cornstarch works much better than a single flour when substituting for wheat flour . Each flour has its own unique characteristics and brings different properties to the cake . The combination of these , if got right , makes a light , moist and tasty cake , often better than wheat flour ones - this is feedback from my customers who are not coeliac ! There are recipes to be found on the web for making one 's own flour blends if needed , but look for a recipe that contains Xanthan Gum and it will not turn out like a brick . And there 's no need to cream the fat with the sugar and whisk the eggs separately etc. . I just use an all-in-one everything in the mixer bowl and mix .
Jamie Oliver has previously recommened the use of a simple granite slab as a Pizza stone so provided there are no coatings etc. it is feasible . You will need to be careful to start with though . Granite could shatter under thermal stress or due to trapped water and when it does so , it could do so in an explosive way damaging your cooker . You need to be sure that the board is granite as other stones may not be strong enough under thermal stress . You need to be careful of reconstituted stone as well because this will not necesserily perform the same as natural stone . Make sure that there are no signs of weakness in the board such as cracks or natural weaknesses . Make sure that the stone is thick enough to avoid issues with stress changes as the stone heats up . If you are going to go for it , I would recommend initially do it slowly , start out with the over cold and heat it up to a lowish temperature a leave it for a while , then turn the over off and let it cool . Inspect the stone , check it for cracks or other signs of distress and give it a few light taps . It should ' ring ' . Dull sounds are indiciative of cracks . Then go to a higher temperatures .
What I would suggest is rather than adding a syrup , to take some of your cooked beans , cook them a bit more , then liquify them in a blender . This should give you a thick sauce that tastes like the beans , therefore compliments them perfectly . You can then thicken them very slightly if the consistency is still too runny , be sparing with the flour though . In fact , you could probably make something satisfactory by simply using less thickener . If you have a pasty , sticky sauce it 's a classic symptom of too much thickener . Try making a roux with some butter and flour , cook it awhile for a dark roux which gives deeper color and more flavor . You can then add the roux in small amounts to your cooking liquid until you get the right consistency . If you are pressed for time and have some available a couple big spoons of refried beans may just do the trick too .
The US Code of Federal Regulations ( 21 CFR 101.4 ) states that ingredients must be listed in descending order of predominance based on weight . The following exception is made in 21 CFR 101.4 ( 2 ) : The descending order of predominance requirements of paragraph ( a ) ( 1 ) of this section do not apply to ingredients present in amounts of 2 percent or less by weight when a listing of these ingredients is placed at the end of the ingredient statement following an appropriate quantifying statement , e.g. , " Contains __ percent or less of _ " or " Less than _ percent of __ . " The blank percentage within the quantifying statement shall be filled in with a threshold level of 2 percent , or , if desired , 1.5 percent , 1.0 percent , or 0.5 percent , as appropriate . No ingredient to which the quantifying phrase applies may be present in an amount greater than the stated threshold . Thus , each ingredient is 2 % or less of the total weight . They are also exempt from the order by weight requirement . The manufacturer is free to order the subset of < 2 % ingredients however they please . Source : <URL>
It sounds like you rendered too much gelatin into the soup , a couple easy fixes are to either : prepare another batch of the soup omitting the ham and bone and then marry the two over a medium/high heat thin with a low fat/nonfat liquid like milk or water ( unfortunately a side effect will be of increased separation in the soup as it cools ) the lower the fat content of what you add the more it will separate . ie adding 2 % milk will cause less separating than skim milk
I enjoy the fruity herbal teas as iced tea . I brew a cup and then pour it in a cup of ice . It is a sugar-free cool drink that tastes and smells great .
Not too surprisingly given where you found it , it 's called an <URL> in most parts of the world . In Israel , it 's just called a chopped salad or ( according to the wiki article - I never personally encountered this ) an Arab salad .
I have made refried beans out of pinto , small red , black , and even navy beans . I almost tried using kidney beans once but it seemed wasteful . They were all different in texture but they were all good . Black beans , for example , have a much more fibrous skin so the refried beans are not as smooth - I actually prefer it to the homogeneous pinto mash . Obviously their color is also more interesting . There are a lot of different bean varieties and I do n't know what is available to you . In general I would say to just try whatever you have - it will probably taste good even if it is n't exactly like pintos .
Mint likes oil . And it likes water . And it likes alcohol . Like most complex flavors , mint is complicated . The greener , vegetal notes are going to be from compounds like chlorophyll , and will be alcohol and very weakly water soluble . The astringent , sharper notes are going to from compounds like menthol , which are oil soluble . In general , the faster flavors , the ones that hit fast and fade faster , are water soluble , while the ones that linger are oil soluble . Mint flavor is sold both as an extract , in a base of water or alcohol , and as an essential oil , in a base of ... oil . As for cooking , I would skip the tomatoes entirely , and do a mint and parsley pesto with walnuts and olive oil . Why ? I like mint .
In general you need to consider the purpose of the ingredient , and what would happen to it during the cooking that it 's missed . For example , there 's no point stirring a spoonful of flour into a sauce after cooking , since the flour needs heat in order to thicken the sauce . In the case of the tomato paste , not much will happen to that particular ingredient during cooking . It may have caramelised a little , depending on the cooking method . It would have infused more deeply into some of the other ingredients . But these are subtle things . Taste your finished product . If you feel it would benefit from an extra boost of tomato flavour , by all means stir in some tomato paste .
The simple answer to your question is the kind of starch they use . Most use cornstarch or tapioca starch , neither of which contain gluten , so most powdered sugar should n't contain gluten . If the type of starch is n't listed , do n't buy that product . For absolutely no gluten , it gets a bit more complicated . A Google search for " Gluten Free Powdered Sugar " only yielded a few brands that make a " gluten-free " claim . Since most brands of powdered sugar do n't contain any ingredients that would normally contain gluten , look for the line " This product is processed in a facility that also processes wheat " . Choose a powdered sugar that lists the starch used as cornstarch , tapioca starch or other non-gluten starch and that does n't have that line on the label . Of course I can only speak to US labeling , other countries may be different . One brand , Domino Sugar , stood out to really stand by their claim of gluten free . <URL> ( C&amp;H is Domino , BTW ) . I happen to have some C&amp;H powdered sugar , so I looked at the label . There is no " Gluten-Free " claim on the label , but the ingredients listed are only sugar and corntarch , and there is no " this product is processed in a facility ... " warning . Walmart brand also pops up on the " Gluten Free Powdered Sugar " search , they say " Naturally gluten-free food " . The FDA requires that claim not be misleading , so if they do use equipment to process the sugar that also processes gluten-containing ingredients , the sugar can not contain more that 20 ppm gluten . There is one way to know for sure about any ingredient you use , or to even to check your final dish . Elisa Technologies , a very well respected name in medical laboratory testing , has put out home test strips sensitive to 10 ppm , that 's half the concentration of gluten the FDA allows for a product to be certified " gluten-free " . If a product tested contains less than 20 ppm gluten the US , Canada and the European Union allow that product to use " Gluten Free " on the label . <URL> At over $ 10 a strip , you 'd want to use them judiciously , but if I or someone I loved had serious health issues that did not allow gluten , I 'd get these strips . <URL>
Oil and butter do n't have the same capacity to hold the sugar/sweetener used in the mix . Whatever is n't dissolved fully in the shortening will still be bound up in the final product ( or maybe end up mostly in the outer crust ) , and you 'll likely perceive the difference as more/less sweet . The main cause is that butter has quite a lot of water bound up in it , which you would n't find at all in oil . You might get a closer similarity by comparing melted , evaporated butter to oil ( 1-to-1 proportion ) , since solid &amp; melted butter have different volumes depending on how much water you 've evaporated ( 1 cup solid / = 1 cup melted ) . I 've got an answer in another question that applies more generally to different phases of shortenings and perceived/actual sweetness - <URL>
You have a few options to lower their explosiveness : Pierce the skin , like you do <URL> . Lower your frying temperature can help a bit , but you 'll probably always need to use a temperature higher than the boiling point to get any kind of crisping action . Dehydrate the liver a bit before frying . You could use a dehydrator , a low-and-slow oven bake or a low temperature , low oil sauté to get them to release their juices ( like you do for browning some mushrooms ) . I do n't know which of these will work best for liver , but naturally you 'll lose a little bit of the final juiciness . You mention the splash guard , which I ca n't recommend enough . These numbers are cheap and easy to find . <URL> But you can also protect your hands directly . I recommend something articulated , like this pair of silicon mold Storm Trooper styled oven mitts from Think Geek : <URL> <URL>
I think in general it is much safer to transport food cold ( frozen , even ) than hot . You can buy soft-sided insulated bags with straps - I see them in the grocery store - that should be ok for a trip of that length . I buy frozen food and then drive home for an hour with it , put it straight in the freezer , and would laugh at the thought of there being food-safety issues with that . So one approach is to make a lasagna , casserole , or the like in a disposable container , freeze it at home , take it to your relative 's and put it in her freezer . Now she has a semi-quick ( but at least easy ) meal waiting for her . ( A side note from remembering my days with an infant : something that heats up FAST and can be eaten with one hand will be more useful than a serves-12-needs-a-fork-heats-for-an-hour option . In other words burritos ( 2 min in microwave , can eat while holding the baby ) beat lasagna ( 60 + min in oven , you can forget and dry it out or burn it , then you need a plate and a knife and fork to eat it . ) Samosas are good one-handers , too . ) If you want to take something that is ready-to-eat , you could use the same bag to keep hot food hot , but I would probably suggest heating it up again on arrival .
I 'll weigh in on this one , having extensive cooking experience on both sides of the pond . The terminology is indeed confusing when it comes to tomato products . By tomato sauce they do n't mean canned tomato sauce like you get in the states , they actually mean ketchup ! As for puree there 's two types , one is just what it means , pureed tomatoes in a can , and the other is super-concentrated like what in the US is called tomato paste and comes in a tube . Given it 's this recipe is asking for 250ml of puree they must mean the canned stuff , as adding that much concentrate would be hideous . To replicate UK/AU style tomato puree I 'd use a can of tomato sauce with a half mini-can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit . That still sounds like a bit too much liquid for my taste . Alternatively you can use my mom 's technique and add a can of concentrated tomato soup to the mix , it makes a great meat-loaf !

Should I use olive oil in in baking ?
There are <URL> ( usually of Italian origin ) specifically made with olive oil . In breads , you can certainly use it , although there often is not enough olive oil for its flavor to truly be appreciated . New York style pizza dough , for example , is traditionally made with some olive oil .
When I add a bit of baking powder to the flour breading I use for eggplant , the fried result is a little puffier than without . Frying forces water out of the eggplant into the breading . That along w heat sets off the production of CO2 . The same should happen with your chicken breading .
There 's nothing magical about garlic that causes it to be especially prone to botulism - it 's just commonly found as an example because it 's commonly used to prepare flavoured oils . All low-acid foods must be acidified or pressure-canned before long-term storage . Storage in oil creates an anaerobic environment which further promotes botulism , and room-temperature storage is even more risky . Chili peppers are low acid , like all peppers , so yes , they 're a risk .
You 're heating the oil past its <URL> . There is no trick or technique that will prevent oil from smoking and oxidizing ( " burning " ) at temperatures above the smoke point . It is literally being slowly destroyed at that temperature . I honestly do n't know why TV chefs are so attached to the idea of cooking with olive oil when most <URL> to compare it to other oils ( for frying purposes ) strongly indicate that it loses all or almost all of its unique taste by the end . Some cite dubious health benefits , but the low smoke point of virgin/extra virgin olive oil may also make it worse for you health-wise due to exactly what you 've witnessed - smoke and oxidation . EVOO is great as a dressing but it 's a terrible choice as a cooking oil . If you absolutely must imitate these confused TV chefs , you can either fry at very low temperatures ( as in , just barely a sizzle ) , which will take considerably more time , or used a refined ( not virgin ) olive oil which has a much higher smoke point . These would typically be the " cheap " olive oils you find in large plastic or metal containers .
Both messes up the ratio , as you said , so you should n't use anything during kneading . You only need to use a little bit of something during shaping . With some pastries , the shaping is extensive and you get lots of the smoother worked into the dough ; this is expected and desired ( e.g. in strudel sheets ) . Properly kneaded bread dough does not stick to anything , even if it started out very wet . So , if it sticks at the beginning , just continue kneading until it stops ( I knead it between my hands then , not on a surface ) . When it is ready , it will not only stop sticking to your hands , but also pull the smear of the hand surfaces into itself , coming clean off them so you can work with it . ( You will still have to clean your hands afterwards from gunk between the fingers and on the back of your hands ) . When your dough is kneaded through , you want to form a good surface for the rising period . You can use flour , oil or water ; you 'll use so little that it does n't really matter much . Just spread a thin film on your surface , shape the boule and put it into the rising bowl . For the final rise , you want it to keep its shape when it 's put into the oven . So , when you are giving it its final shape , you can use either flour or a starch to prevent it from sticking to whatever it is rising on . I knew somebody who swore by rice flour as producing the least stickiness , but use plain wheat flour myself . You can even lay it on a bed of flour ; it is not getting pressed into it , so it wo n't absorb it and get hard . But you will have a layer of either raw or burned flour on the prepared bread . An exception would be very oil-rich breads ( at least half as much butter as flour ) . They do better when the final shaping is done in oil too . For pastries and cookies , it depends on the type of dough . If it is supposed to be a hard dough , use flour . The strudel mentioned above is made in flour . If it is supposed to be a soft or tender dough , you can try shaping without any smoothening ( for example many cookies will flow into a smooth shape during baking even if put onto the sheet as an unsightly pinched ball ) . Ugly sticky pastry doughs like pie crust can be rolled into submission if you roll them between two smooth silicone mats , but you ca n't get them very thin that way . If you need them at less than 4 mm , use flour , best in combination with the silicone . Plastic wraps also works , but you might have to use two pieces per surface when the crust gets wide . If you have a dough which really feels half-liquid in your hands , shape with flour . Corriher 's very light southern biscuits from Cookwise are a good example for such a dough .
I feel your pain . If only I liked summer squash better ... You definitely can freeze squash -- thick slice it , blanch it in salty water briefly until almost tender , transfer to an ice bath until it 's chilled , bag it , and put in the freezer . Later , thaw and use with recipes that do n't require ultra-crisp squash .
The problem is that there are different types of olive oil that are used for dramatically different purposes . A high quality ' cold pressed extra virgin ' oil often has fruity notes that are destroyed when you heat it , but is great for drizzling over things at the last minute , or cold applications such as salad dressings ... but note that the US labeling laws are lax , so something labeled as ' extra virgin ' in the US may not qualify as such in Europe . For most cooking , I use a good grade olive oil ( ' virgin ' , but not ' extra virgin ' ) for cooking with , not the extremely expensive stuff . For frying , there 's ' extra light ' olive oil which has a higher smoke point but little to no flavor on its own . It 's refined to such a point that you might be better off just going with any neutral flavored oil ( canola/rape , soy , corn , etc. ) Price depends on a lot of things , and a lot of it 's marketing and worthless -- if you can , I 'd look for other signs of quality ... like if there 's a packing date . Older oil is more likely to have deteriorated , and in a worst case , have gone rancid . ( more likely if it 's in a clear glass bottle ... if you 're buying large amounts of oil , keep it out of sunlight , or even better , buy it in a can ) Note that packing dates can also be cheated -- they might press the oil , then hold it for months before it 's actually bottled for sale . Also beware of ' blended oils ' . This is when they cut olive oil with something less expensive , but still try to pass it off as ' olive oil ' . ' Imported from Italy ' is another suspect label , as it might be foreign olives that were sent to Italy before being imported . ( but there 's nothing wrong with non-Italian olives ... the Greeks and Spanish make some great olive oils , and we 're starting to see more <URL> ) . ... Also note that olive oil can be classified like wines -- some companies might press a single variety of olive ( eg , Kalamata , Castelvetrano ) , which can have dramatically different flavors . They might be fruity , grassy , buttery , or even peppery . Regions can also have an impact , as some areas press olives while green , and others wait until they 're black . I wo n't get into these , as that 's more a matter of personal taste .
1 . Chemical leaveners There are two " oldfashioned " chemical leaveners , both still used today in traditional German and Scandinavian gingerbread recipes : Potassium carbonate ( potash or pearl ash ) and Ammonium bicarbonate ( salt of heartshorn ) They do have their own quirks and pitfalls , but if nothing else is available ... If you can get baking soda , mix with cream of tartar to make baking powder . If your store does not stock it , you pharmacy most likely will carry " sodium hydrogen carbonate " ( which is another name for baking soda ) either as treatment for heartburn , it 's an antacid ( because it reacts with acid , neutralzing it and making these nice bubbles , as we know from baking ... ) or as topical treatment for allergic reactions of the skin ( poison ivy and others ) . 2 . Biological leaveners This boils down to Saccharomyces cerevisiae , aka . baker 's yeast or brewer 's yeast . Of course you get very different results and have to follow a different procedure . But here are some recipes where they are used somewhat interchangeably , e.g. some types of pancakes or waffles and , obviously , bread ( vs. sodabread ) . The charming thing about yeast is , that if your are really , really far from a store , you can still get your hands on yeast : Start a sourdough using the yeasts naturally occuring on fruits or the air around you . Probably not the kind of substitution you had in mind , though . 3 . No leaveners With good technique , you can incorporate a lot of air ( because that 's what all leaveners are supposed to do ) in your baking goods by whipping your eggs well . There are various approaches : You can whip the whole eggs . Whip the yolks ( with hot water or over a water bath to stabilize them ) to Zabaione-like consistency . Whip the whites and fold into your batter . You will want to bake these batters right away before the bubbles get a chance to burst . The air will expand during baking and the hardening egg/flour-mixture will trap them in the baked goods . Contrary to many recipes out there there is no real need to bake a pound cake or even sponge cake with baking powder if it 's done right . Other recipes without leavener ( or rather with the egg trapping steam generated by a rather high water content ) are the members of the popover family ( Yorkshire pudding in the UK , Pfitzauf in Swabia , some dutch pancakes ) and pâté a choux . Puff pastry relies on thin layers of butter separating the layers of floury dough and trapping steam between them .
The closest thing is to combine equal parts of ground cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , and black pepper .
Yes , you can save it and add it to soups such as Minestrone for additional flavor . Once the soup is done , remove and discard the rind . For extended storage , keep it in a bag in the freezer until you have need for it .
Go for 145 . 2 hours . Salmonella dies even at " low " temperatures ( from 135 ) as long as you cook it for longer . 135 for at least 87 minutes , will kill salmonella . However , I like it best when cooked at 145 for 2 hours .
Do you like your noodles swimming in water ? If not , drain them .
As a child , I used to hate the feel and taste when I conciously bit on a piece of onion ( strongest offender : medium-sized chunks , sautéed glassy but still firm ) . Sometimes that still happens . However , I use onion a lot myself now in cooking . Lots of dishes really need the kind of taste onions can supply ; even though that taste may by itself be a bit gross , it 's really useful in the mix . ( This is true for many other ingredients as well ! ) I can only speak for myself , but very likely , there are some dishes where you do n't even notice that onions are in , but they are -- and you would n't like it if they were n't ! Do use onions , just do it consciously . There are broadly three ways of preparing them that I consider effective , each suited to different cases : Disperse them throughout the dish . Either chop them really fine and saut&eacute;e ( with the right technique and a decent knife you can get the chunks down to only a few millimetres ) , or boil with other vegetables and then pur&eacute;e . You 'll get all the good taste , but nowhere too strong and without any unpleasant mouth-feel . Ideal for light/creamy sauces or soups . Caramelise them boldly . Frying changes the taste of onions a lot , it makes them much sweeter , gets rid of the pungency in exchange for a really concentrated savouriness , and almost completely tames the consistency . Browned onions play great together with strong seasonings like garlic and pepper , as flavouring for chewy mushrooms or meats . Or the opposite : keep them mostly raw ! The freshness and crunch of raw onions can also be very useful without evoking what I call the bad onion effect -- albeit in a completely different way . Thinly sliced in salads , or very quickly stir-fried in rice dishes , you keep the raw pungency in check while staying clear of the uncanny softness . Again , it 's a good idea to define the taste heading with other sharp flavours : vinegar or chilies work well . Perhaps you wo n't be able to befriend yourself with all of these preparation methods , but you should give them a try .
How liquid was it when you say liquid ? Our kitchen is very cold in winter and may very well get to fridge temperature at night time and the olive oil gets white balls of solidified oil in it , and then goes very sludgy , making it difficult to pour , if not impossible . But it does n't exactly solidify . So it depends on whether you mean it is completely liquid like normal or not . This website implies that most oils should be unpourable by 35F ( 1.7 C ) , which is the lowest temperature for a fridge ( i.e. any particular fridge or part of a fridge may be slightly warmer than this ) : <URL> ( This same information is found on a multitude of sites , so I do not believe this is the original source ) However , it also says that olive oils may be " winterized " which means they do not clump or cloud , even at 32F/0C . This is so they can be used in salad dressings , etc , that are stored in the fridge . So you would need to find out if your olive oil had been so treated . I am not sure if this process is just used for oil sold for commercial use or not .
It depends on how they are dried . Though if they 're properly dehydrated or freeze-dried then you 're just rehydrating them in the tea and they 'll taste ok . Ginger : I prefer fresh ginger and find that there are some taste notes that are n't present in the dried tea , it makes more pleasant with fresh ginger , but it 's more work . Chili : While I have n't tried fresh chili in tea , I 'd imagine dried would work better and you would n't get interference from oils in the chili . Also maybe easier to control the amount .
For this dish , you 'll probably want to use a low-end extra-light oil ( since it 's being heated quite a bit ) , and then drizzle in nicer extra virgin oil to finish the flavor after the pasta has been tossed into the cheese , oil , and spices . The rule of thumb is to have two kinds of olive oil : High-grade , richly flavored extra virgin olive oil ( for finishing ) Extra light , not extra-virgin olive oil for use as a cooking oil . You can use a cheaper oil for this -- many people choose to use a later pressing , crudo or " pure olive oil " ( in the US ) kind . The high-end oil is for adding it to sauces and drizzling on mostly-finished dishes to add that rich flavor . You 're looking for something with a lot of taste , and it 's a good idea to get small amounts of pricier oil . Getting small bottles means you 'll be using fresher , more flavorful oil because it has n't been open for long . Plus , you wo n't need much to finish dishes . Note that for this use , you want to add the oil near the end of cooking , as heat will alter and weaken the flavor . The low-end light olive oil should be of neutral or light flavor , and will be more tolerant of heating than extra-virgin . Because it has a much higher smoke point than extra-virgin grade oil , use this in recipes calling for heating up olive oil . If necessary for flavor , add some of the good stuff near the end of cooking .
Smell . Really , this is the most reliable criterion for practically any fruit . Flavor contains both taste and smell . For a strawberry , you want a fragrant smell together with enough sweetness . For both , the berry has to be ripe enough . If it was picked underripe , it wo n't smell good enough yet , and it will also be hard and sour . If it was picked long ago and is not fresh any more , it will have lost the more volatile components of its fragrance . So ripe , fresh strawberries smell great . I have had occasions when I entered a supermarket to quickly buy one thing , aimed at the correct aisle , but when the smell of good strawberries reached me near the produce , I turned and added a pack of them . I have never been disappointed with such strawberries . Also , if you smell the slightest hint of mold , fermentation , or foulness , you know they may not keep even one night . Another sign is that a ripe strawberry will be red through and through . A strawberry picked underripe will be white or even slightly greenish at the top . It does n't taste good then . But this is a negative sign , because not all red strawberries taste good . Do n't ever go by shape . The tastiest sort of strawberries my grandparents grew produced ugly , lumpy strawberries of a light , slightly orange color . They also had a few rows of a sort which produced perfectly conical , deep red strawberries , they looked like an advertisement - but they were hard and dry , and did n't have much aroma . Probably , there are some strawberries which both look and taste good - just do n't think that looks or color predict a good strawberry , because they are independent . And of course , any strawberries which have visible mold or fouled spots are not good any more . You can usually also recognize overripened strawberries in their appearance , but I do n't know how to describe it well . They just look old .
<URL> , using olive oil to fry is basically a waste of money . " After I 'd heated them , none of the olive oils had much olive flavor left . In fact , they did n't taste much different from the seed oils . " According to a <URL> I have access to , you could use high oleic sunflower oil for frying as it degrades better .
Considering that you 're using Soybean Oil - which has a smoke point of 450 ° F , you might be using far too much heat for your eggs . Even if you were making an omelette , which typical recipes demand a higher temperature of ~ 400 ° F - you 'd still be far too high if you 're smoking soybean oil . In any case , I would recommend frying between 350 ° F and 390 ° F . As for you hearing that in olive oil , bad chemicals emerge when the oil reaches the smoke point - this is true of any oil . Heating any oil or fat past its smoke point causes rapid oxidation ( peroxidation ) and more-or-less mimics the effects of rancidity . Think about whether you want to be cooking using burnt , rancid oil . At that , you should n't be using olive oil ( which has a lower smoke point than most fats ) for high-heat cooking . As for the bad chemicals , any oil or fat that is taken past its smoke point will oxidize , and as a result , different chemical reactions will occur which may or may not release/create carcinogens . This is a topic that you should explore more with your dietician/physician than on this board . Ideally , you should monitor your oil temperature - either visually by looking for a slight shimmer/sheen , or physically by using a cooking thermometer or a wooden spoon ( look for air bubbles ) .
Water freezes at 0 ° C ( or 32 ° F ) , but ethanol freezes at -114 ° C , so you can guess your vermouth with freeze somewhere in between those two temperatures . Noilly Prat is 18 % ABV , or 15 % alcohol by weight , which means it would freeze at around -6 ° C to -7 ° C , or 19-21 ° F. Your freezer may or may not be tuned to be that cold , but if not , you should be able to crank it a bit and get your Noilly Prat just frozen . That said , I would not really recommend leaving an ice cube tray full of vermouth hanging out in your freezer . You may notice that old ice tastes funny . Even though you may not notice your freezer smelling , that 's partly because the cold blocks smells . Just because you do n't notice them does n't mean the odors are n't there to ruin your Noilly Prat . I would recommend leaving them for a day until just frozen ( covered if you like ) , and then moving them to a Ziploc for long term storage . All that said , freezing will not halt oxidation altogether , but it will help , as only the exposed surfaces areas should be able to be oxidized . Since ice cubes by design have a relatively high surface area , you may consider minimizing the exposure to oxygen by other means . If you have a vacuum sealer , using that would be a fairly simple means to limit that exposure , but a similar effect can be done with a simple Ziploc bag , as described <URL> ( note this link is focused on using this technique for cooking , but it is translatable to your scenario ) . Drop your ice cubes in a bag , and then slowly lower the bag into a container of cold water ( the colder the better , here , to minimize melting ) , leaving the seal exposed . I sometimes <URL> things onto the bag to weigh it down as well . Then begin closing the seal , and lower the bag further into the water as you continue sealing , so that only the unsealed portion is exposed . Finally complete the seal and you should have a reasonably low-oxygen environment to mitigate further degradation of your vermouth .

How to substitute chicken broth in a vegetarian soup ?
Your question seems to have two parts : With what do I replace chicken stock to make the dish vegetarian and How can I add some zing to the dish for added interest ? To answer 1 , I 'd make a hearty vegetable stock from scratch . Recipies abound . Alternatively you could rely on a bought stock but I find that these can be overpowering and of course you have less control over the flavour . To answer 2 , consider adding a dollop of pistou to each bowl of soup when serving . Freshly made pistou is easy and adds interest and flavour . See , e.g. <URL> .
I think you 're misunderstanding the claim slightly . You do not heat an already pureed soup , you puree and heat in one step . You can indeed make a hot soup from cold ingredients using certain high end blenders . The only one I 've verified this with is the vita-mix . To do this , you put your ingredients in to the blender , turn it on , and let it run about 5 minutes . The friction from the blades heats the soup while chopping the ingredients . The soup will get piping hot . Why would you do it ? It 's easy . It takes about 2 mins to get the soup really smooth , so it 's 3 more minutes to get it hot . That 's faster than you would be able to do with a stove , although maybe slower than a microwave . Is it more efficient ? I do n't know , but I doubt the difference in electrical efficiency is really sufficient to drive a choice one way or the other . In terms of cleaning , you already need to clean the blender because you pureed the soup . There 's no additional cleaning to do if you cook it there too , versus additional cleaning for stove or microwave . And the blender is easy to clean as it 's one piece ; you just add soap and water and turn it on for 30 seconds , then rinse . Personally , I do not think this is " one of the main selling points " . It 's a neat trick , and it 's useful . However , I think that it 's more interesting as an indication of the blenders power . You can use these blenders to make exceptionally smooth soup , make peanut butter , properly crush ice for frozen drinks , etc. . They do this much better than a ' normal ' home blender , but just saying ' better ' probably would n't sell a lot of these things at 4x the price , so they focus on something that the standard home blender most certainly can not do .
Add the water incrementally . It 's probably enough to add just a bit , stir , then add the rest , but you can break it up a bit more if that does n't work . A clump of powder or a lump of paste wo n't dissolve easily into water , but it 's easy enough to add a little water to it and thin it out . So the idea is to work your way up from powder to paste to thinner paste to liquid . This is a good idea for all kinds of things where you start with a powder or a thick paste , not just instant soup .
The most accurate substitution would simply be <URL> . It is concentrated rum with a huge kick of flavor , and much less alcohol . A little goes a long way . If you 're going to stick with a strong liquor my first choice would be a <URL> , it 's a similarly " sweet " liquor that tastes good in baking . Another good option would be <URL> . If you 're avoiding liquor , then you may be able to use vanilla extract . Non-alcoholic varieties are available . According to <URL> you can also use molasses thinned with pineapple juice . The rum is used simply for flavor .
I 'm looking for the online reference , but I remember reading in Cook 's Illustrated that they were able to substitute a bit of gelatin to mimic the mouth-feel of homemade stock . I did find a <URL> recipe that used gelatin . Based on how you described your recipe , I would say that the long cooking of chicken bones is indeed what 's missing . You might get a better result if you roast your chicken breasts and vegetables before cooking them in the broth .
You may be able to find vegetarian Grana Padano style cheese , but I do n't think you will find the real thing in vegetarian form . This is because the making of Grana Padano is still a traditional process and true GP cheese is only produced in certain regions of Italy . It in fact has P.D.O. ( Protected Designation of Origin ) status , which means that only those cheeses produced in certain regions and using certain methods can legally be called Grana Padano . I imagine one of those methods is using animal rennet . I would be surprised that there is n't some form of substitute available in Italy , as they have the highest proportion of vegetarians in Europe at 10 % . I get the feeling , however , that they are perhaps less zealous about it than others if it means giving up good cheese . The only suggestion I have found as an alternative to GP as something to sprinkle on pasta etc is nutritional yeast powder , which apparently has a similar nutty , creamy taste . Not ideal , but if you make the choice to be veggie you have to take the rough with the smooth ! I see from your profile that you live in the UK ; we are lucky in that we have a lot of fantastic small local producers , so it may be worth looking up some local dairies or cheesemakers and seeing if they can offer an alternative .
The fourth option is the correct one . The problem is that if you start with oil in the mortar , the pestle will slip and you will not be able to properly mash the rest . What you usually do is : Wash the basil in cold water . Put the leaves on a tea towel and leave them to dry ( you can delicately pat them with another towel ) . You do n't want extra water in the pesto , so be sure the leaves are dry before starting . Traditional pesto is made with <URL> . Start with the garlic ( traditionally <URL> ) and a few grains of rock salt in the mortar . You would generally put 1-2 pips of garlic for ~ 50g basil leaves , but obviously that is up to your taste ( if you were to make Provencal pistou you would probably go for a higher garlic to basil ratio ) . I generally remove the inner part of the garlic ( the anima ) before mashing it . Now add the basil and mash them with a circular movement . You have to be quite delicate when doing this . You 'll see a green liquid forming at the bottom of the mortar . Now add pinenuts and/or the walnuts and finally the cheese . A mix of 36 months-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino ( sardo or romano ) is perfect for pesto . Finally add the extra-virgin olive oil slowly , while mixing . Put in clean pots , let it rest for half an hour , then if necessary cover with some extra oil . Whether you do this in batches or all at once mainly depends on the size of the mortar and how much pesto you are making . If you are making a big amount or have a small mortar repeat the steps for every batch ( I would wash the mortar each time , as it will be oily . Remember to dry it throughly before restarting ) . Most informations taken from : <URL> ( in Italian )
While yes it can be done , I would n't choose to do it over another technique unless that was my only option or I just needed some chicken cooked quickly for a recipe where it is used in the cooked form and will have a lot of other flavors added ( chicken salad ) . Remember that a lot of flavor is due to browning and cooking in the microwave eliminates those flavors . At least with poaching , if the liquid is REALLY well seasoned you 'll still impart flavor . Any cooking technique can lead to tough and dry meat , including poaching where it 's being cooked submerged in hot liquid . Regardless of the technique , if the proteins heat too hot and too quickly they will constrict quickly and squeeze out the juices . The result will be tough , dry , saw-dusty chicken or other protein . This is the same thing that happens when scrambled eggs are rubbery ... cooked too long over too high of heat . The proteins act like sponges that are being wrung out . Personally I think you have much less control over meat cooked in a microwave because the cooking occurs from the inside outward and the residual heat continues to build more intensely than if it was cooked in a saute pan or on a grill . Is this something that professionals do ? No . Microwaves in a professional kitchen are mainly used for melting butter , chocolate , reheating things quickly ... much the same as I recommend people do at home . We do not use them for " cooking " . Although I do use it for sweating onions if that 's the only thing I 'd be dirtying a pan for ... put the onions in a bowl with a little butter , cover and nuke for about a minute until tender .
I can imagine a few ways of doing it based on the texture you 're looking for , and what you have to work with . Remove the meat from the casing and fry the meat in a pan . You 'll basically be cooking ground meat which will allow you to easily seasons it and also integrate it into other foods . This method also allows you to season the actual meat if you want to . Cut the sausages into disks and fry them in a pan . This will leave you with more body than the first method , and also allow you to really get some good color on the flat parts of the cut sausage . Leave them whole , poke holes in them , and cook them on anything . I would n't do this for the application you 're looking for . You will eventually be cutting them up , and if you cut them after cooking , you wo n't have the browning that you could have had .
As with all raw-meat or sushi dishes , this will never be 100 % safe to eat ; at best we are talking about a calculated food safety risk , with steps taken to mitigate that risk when possible . For this reason , it is CRUCIAL that the chicken be kept at fridge temperature as much as possible . When cutting , use a pre-chilled cutting board if possible , and serve immediately . For extra safety , blanch the chicken to kill surface pathogens , and slice off the cooked exterior . Given the slimy , gelatinous texture of raw chicken , I believe the best results would come from finely dicing the chicken ( small cubes ) or very thinly slicing it . These approaches seem to work well for sushi and tuna tartare , which have similar textures . As with sushi , you need a shaving-sharp knife to get clean cuts . For flavorings , your goals are twofold : add flavor and kill pathogens . An acidic sauce or marinade is obligatory , to reduce the pH below 4 and render it hostile to pathogens . The acidity should also reduce the slight sulfurous notes in raw chicken , by reacting with the sulfur in the molecules and making them less volatile . Taken to an extreme , this could produce a result much like ceviche , where the acid denatures the proteins and produces a texture akin to cooking . Fresh cut , finely-minced garlic is delicious and also hostile to pathogens . Many aromatic herbs also have antimicrobial properties , with fenugreek being a notable standout in this area . There are a couple ways you could develop this into a full dish from there : Do it up like a ceviche : fresh lemon/lime juice , garlic , chili flakes , onions , salt , and maybe a little cilantro or coriander . Go European : white wine vinegar , thyme , rosemary , parsley flakes , garlic , black pepper , salt , and maybe a little olive oil Go sushi ! Marinate it in rice wine vinegar , soy sauce , and spices , and serve it in sushi rolls , accompanied with a LOT of wasabi and pickled ginger . Those condiments help mitigate the food safety risk with their antimicrobial/antiparasite properties . Go sushi part 2 : marinate it as above , but serve alone with a horseradish-based sauce containing lemon . EDIT : Apparently there is a real recipe along these lines . Toriwasa , or chicken sashimi . I found several recipes using wasabi ( horseradish ) , soy sauce , parsley , and sake . The chicken 's exterior is cooked , but the interior remains raw . I should add a couple caveats to this : I have serious doubts about raw chicken as an ingredient , even with the best cooking possible . At best I think it will be edible but not delicious . The problem is that raw chicken is incredibly bland , and where it is n't bland , it has an unpleasant , slightly sulfurous flavor . The texture is somewhat off-putting too . I might be wrong , of course , but I think this is better handled as a theoretical exercise and not an actual dish . If you try any of these ideas and get food poisoning , it 's your own dang fault for eating raw chicken ... you boob .
You can use Crisco All-Vegetable Shortening : its is on PETA 's ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) shopping list of baking goods , but can work just as well for frying as lard .
What you are describing is often worst when the vegetables are thrown together without care as to what vegetables will do well stewed for a while , and which vegetables only need to be heated through and will suffer if they are cooked longer . A great example of that is in the case of typical " frozen mixed vegetables " . Carrots are never nicely tender in mixtures like that . Lima beans are downright chalky and peas are total mush . If you want to use frozen vegetables , avoid mixtures . Pick the vegetables that you actually enjoy , and add them to your soup at a time appropriately distant from the time that you actually want to serve the soup . So bring lima beans to a hard simmer before you add corn , bring that to a hard simmer before you add frozen potatoes , add frozen carrots , bring that to a hard simmer before you finally add peas just before you serve - your soup will be better than emptying a bag of mixed vegetables into broth .
Boil the broth down more before adding the cornstarch . The broth will continue to thicken as it cools , so aim for a little thin/runny in the pan so it 's the right consistency on the table . Do n't be afraid to mix in the cornstarch in multiple , smaller batches . Edit : For gravy , I prefer the taste of flour to corn starch .
Is it safe ? That depends on a lot of factors . Generally , no . It is n't . A blog post from the Healthy Home Economist has the opinion of a firefighter : One gal mentioned that her husband was a firefighter and that leaving a stockpot simmering overnight or while they were out of the house was completely out of the question . <URL> <URL> Since you can not get a crock pot my only other suggestion is to simmer your bone broth in the oven . If your pot is oven safe and you trust your oven 's ability to keep a steady low temperature , then try it in there . If you plan on making bone broth more often , a crock pot is a great investment and if you check out your local Goodwill or Salvation Army store you might find an older but still perfectly usable model for an excellent price . It would also allow you to slow cook your broth overnight safely ( and uses less electricity to do it ) .
It 's probably OK but there are a lot of variables here so from where I sit , it 's difficult to be certain . Cooking will kill most bacteria . If the soup went from the pot , hot , to the container and capped immediately , the risk of airborne bacteria getting in is reduced . It takes more than a couple bacteria to get you sick but when conditions are right , bacteria multiply exponentially in a short period of time . If the container was at 72F , that 's better than if it was at 90F ... as if it was outside in the sun . You can give it a sniff to check if it smells OK . Reheating to a boil will kill most bacteria , but depending on the specific bacteria , not all . What 's more , certain bacteria leave behind toxins that are not easily destroyed . If you have a pressure cooker , that 's the best way to kill whatever bacteria might be in there . You would need to keep it in the cooker for a period of time ... 30 minutes perhaps . Seems like a lot of trouble to go to . Dry bouillon cubes should not have any bacteria ... assuming a clean manufacturing plant . Same goes if you used dehydrated chicken . It 's more likely bacteria got in if fresh uncooked chicken was used . Unwashed hands , contaminated utensils , used hand towels , unclean work area ... all that stuff comes into play . You probably already know about cross contamination . But here 's the thing ? Why risk it ? Salmonella will not likely kill you but your stomach will be churning and you 'll be spending some time in the bathroom . There are other bad actors out there and they are worse than Mr. Sal Minella ... Staphlococcus , E. Coli , Botulinum . My answer is , to be safe , toss it .
Use a meat thermometer . If you overcook the chicken , it will dry out . The standard temperature for chicken breast is 160 degrees Fahrenheit .
They can be as young as 8 weeks , and up to a year or more . The preferred cooking method changes with age . <URL> of the ages/weights/options .
It will double in size when it is cooked , however the longer it is kept in the liquid the bigger it will grow until ultimately all liquid has been absorbed . A trick is to cook it separately , drain it , and toss with olive oil so it does n't clump . Then , add it to the rest of the soup , stirring well just before serving .
I recently published a guide for pressure cooking frozen meat - so here 's how to do your chicken breasts : Cover your chicken with water , salt and any other aromatics that you 'd like to use . Pressure cook for 5 minutes at high pressure ( the cooker will take MUCH LONGER to reach pressure , this is ok but some electric pressure cookers may time-out and need to be re-set ) . Open with Natural Pressure Release . General rules for pressure cooking frozen meat plus my tips : <URL> Frozen meat pressure cooking times : <URL>
I would shred one or both leaves ( depending on size ) and garnish the soup right before eating it .

What does meringue powder do in butter cream icing ?
The crusting is important so that any flowers or other intricate decorations will fix their shape and not slump when left out in warmer temperatures . ( you do n't want to refrigerate iced cakes , as when you remove them from the fridge , you 'll get condensation ) . An icing that crusts quickly means that you can use an icing that 's not quite as stiff for your decorations , and after a few hours of decorating , you 'll come to appreciate that minor difference . The crust is also a benefit when trying to get a <URL> . Some other recipes will crust over time , and <URL> uses more powdered sugar and cream of tartar , but no merangue powder . I suspect it 's the starch in the powdered sugar that ensures that it still crusts up . As for shelf life ... I 'm not 100 % sure . I believe that the eggwhites have been pasteurized , and I 've made flowers , let them dry out , then kept them stored for months at a time ... but I ca n't remember if those were made with merengue powder or not . I suspect that some batches were .
I went into some detail with this in my answer to <URL> To summarize my points there and add some more ( simplified ) detail on the chemistry : Gluten is responsible for <URL> of dough , which is perceived as chewiness . The difference between bread , quickbread ( muffins/scones ) , and cake is largely due to the difference in gluten formation , with cake having the lowest amount and bread having the highest . It does not directly cause rising - the leavening agent ( yeast , baking powder , etc. ) is responsible for that . What it does do is form a protein network by <URL> , which not only results in the elasticity above but also traps gas and prevents it from escaping during the baking process . The " rising " in baked goods is essentially just stretching of the gluten network . This is why <URL> such as xanthan and guar gum can mimic some of the effects in gluten-free recipes ; although the mechanism is completely different - in essence , they 're creating a very thin gel . Gluten is also exceptionally good at both absorbing and retaining moisture ; it can absorb up to 150 % ( 1.5 times its own weight ) in water . One thing you 'll notice about typical wheat products vs. their gluten-free equivalents is that latter do n't last too long and have to be frozen or consumed quickly . Part of this is due to preservatives in commercial baked goods , but much of it is also simply due to the gluten retarding moisture loss . You can think of it as a kind of natural preservative . It 's activated by water and heat and is ( relatively ) slow-acting , which gives it a high tolerance with respect to time and temperature . This is why many people will tell you that bread is " forgiving " while cake and other low-gluten/gluten-free products are not . When baking without gluten , you will have to be very precise about all of your measurements . Its coagulation action is actually very similar to that of egg whites , and pure gluten ( AKA vital wheat gluten ) is sometimes actually used as a replacement for egg whites . A meringue is just heavily aerated egg whites and specifically protein ; gluten is basically doing the same thing inside of whatever you 're baking . Finally , it provides nutritive protein when eaten . Wheat gluten is about 75 % protein and all-purpose flour is about 10 % gluten . That means 7.5 % of the flour you consume is actually protein . Of course that 's nowhere near what you get from meat , but it 's still a significant contribution to one 's diet . In short : Gluten does a lot of things . Keep in mind when doing gluten-free baking that a lot of the substitutes only replicate one or two of the effects .
As someone who uses liquid nitrogen as part of their daily routine ( in a lab ) and who has made liquid nitrogen ice cream on several occasions , my advice would be to not use a plastic container to hold liquid nitrogen unless it 's designed to . Yes , the plastic vessel may become brittle and may fracture . I have seen some materials shatter with extreme violence when frozen with liquid nitrogen ; do not attempt this . Vessels for handling cryogenic liquids are designed especially for the job , and made from materials such as stainless steel , styrofoam , teflon , HDPE or silvered borosilicate glass . Unless you know with certainty that your container is designed to withstand temperatures of -196 & deg ; C ( -321 & deg ; F ) , do not attempt this procedure .
All that is meant here by " turn out " is to take the mass that you have begun to mix in the bowl , and dump it all onto your ( floured ) counter to begin kneading . Turn out just means to dump . To move .
To expand on Jolene 's box idea , I 'd recommend : shirt boxes ( talk to a local department store if you 're not planning on buying a bunch of shirts ) pizza boxes ( again , talk to a local store about getting some ... likely get the smallest ones you can , such as if they have ones for a few leftover slices as opposed to for a whole pie ) restaurant takeout containers ( depending on the size of the cookies ... talk to a local chinese carryout or similar ) Some cake and candy supply stores will sell a variety of box sizes as well . I 'd also agree with irwinners in recommending a fan -- I ca n't quantify the exact speedup , as it 's affected by ambient humidity , temperature , airspeed and such , but a box fan near the cookies ( I use it to suck air over the cookies , not blow , as I do n't have a good way to dust the inside of the fan without disassembling it each time ) will help to crust up the icing to make it a little more sturdy .
A little bit less than 1tbsp , maybe 4/5ths of a tablespoon .
<URL> has about 80 % fat , 15 % water and 5 % solids . Depending on where you are located <URL> has 48 % fat ( UK ) , 40 % ( Canada ) and the remaining fraction is obviously water and little solids . Supposed , you need 100g butter in your receipe . This means that the dough will have 80g fat and 15g water ( for a simple calculation I omit the content of the milk solids ) . If you want to substitute butter with double cream , you will need about 165g double cream to have the same fat content in the dough as if you used butter . The problem is the water that you will have in the dough : You will have 83g water in the dough which is 5,5 times more . Since there is very likely little water in a biscuit receipe and it is not possible to adjust the amount of other liquids ( because there are no other liquids ) I doubt that this substitution will work with a biscuit receipe . With a cake receipe you might have more luck ( e.g. leave 83g - 15g = 68g milk out ) . Making a simple buttercream ( as known as American buttercream ) with double cream is not possible because it has almost no liquid . You could try other fillings like <URL> . I am certain that there are plenty <URL> for cake fillings with double cream .
It aerates the sugar ( <URL> ) - adding tiny bubbles in the final product . It makes the finished product lighter and chewier instead of denser and hard .
Fondant is nearly solid -- it 's rolled out , and placed onto the cake ( with a buttercream underneath as an adhesive ) . The advantage is that it goes on really quickly and smoothly over large items . It can also be cut into shapes with rather clean edges ( modeling chocolate gives sharper edges , but it 's not flexible enough to cover a round cake ) . You often see it on professional non-traditional cakes ( more novelties , when they need a solid color or something that 's strangely shaped . Fondant can also be used to give a solid background can then be piped into ( with buttercream icing , generally ) or painted . As it 's nearly solid , it can also be worked like you would clay to make decorations . Royal icing dries hard as it has no fat in it . It 's generally only used on cakes as a drizzle where you 're not attempting to cover the entire cake . You 'll often see it used on bundt cakes , but you more frequently see it used for cookies when you 're doing a flood-fill . Buttercream icings ( commonly called ' frosting ' in the US ) is likely the most standard for non-professional stacked cakes . It 's spread on , so it takes a little more work to get a clean smooth surface . ( the trick is to wait 'til the surface has hardened , put down some waxed paper , then smooth out all of the spatula marks ... you need to wait 'til the waxed paper does n't stick , but not so long that it has n't set up completely ) . You can also use buttercream in pastry bags to create flowers , ropes , basketweave and other decorations . ... And then there 's other frostings/icings , too , but they 're not as general purpose . They generally go with specific types of cakes -- caramel and other cooked frostings ( eg , used in ' German Chocolate Cake ' ) , cream cheese frosting ( for carrot and other spice cakes ) , whipped cream ( used in black forest cake &amp; strawberry shortcake )
I have never added butter to sponge sheets when making swiss rolls , jelly rolls , or anything similar in the past . It 's just straight up bread flour , sugar , and eggs . I can only think of three possible reasons why butter might be added : To improve the flavour ; To keep the sheets moist and help prevent overbaking , as any fat would be used in cake batter ; however , this is generally not a major concern in cake rolls ; or To help prevent it from sticking to the sheet ( do n't bother ; if you have this problem , use a silicone mat ) . Reasons # 2 and # 3 are n't very convincing to me , so I would only bother adding butter if you prefer the taste of swiss rolls with butter added . I do n't think butter would help with rolling at all , in fact it might make rolling more difficult on account of making the sheets more crumbly and less able to hold together under pressure .
First , double check that your oven temps are accurate with a thermometer that you can place in the oven . After that , two things I would try . . Rack Positioning I 've baked meringues at similar temps without browning . It could be the position of the rack within the oven ? If it was mainly the top that browned , move lower . If it was mainly the bottom that browned , move higher . Turn Off the Oven The other thing you could try is turning the oven off for the second stage of baking . I 've baked meringues at 200 degrees F for an hour before , then I turn off the oven , prop the door open for about 5 minutes to cool , then close the door for a few hours . Hope one of these give you the results you 're looking for .
Typically that would be whatever was used for dusting the loaves or the bannetons , either flour , starch or sometimes <URL> . It is done to prevent sticking and for decorative purposes - often both : <URL> ( <URL> )
I 've done it before without problems . Even if they 're peanut butter &amp; jelly ( something that 's typically stored in the fridge ) , it has so much sugar in it that it 's inhospitable to microbes . If you want to play it extra safe , and the sandiwiches wo n't be easten shortly after you leave , you could place them in the freezer and then let them thaw in your bag . ... all that being said , if you 're in the US , the TSA considers peanut butter to be a gel , so wo n't let you fly with a container of it . I have no idea what their rules are in sandwich form . ( I 've never tried it , as I typically fly w / cold cut sandwiches , and just take them straight from the fridge before I go ) .
That 's your meringue weeping . You could either make a very unstable meringue , which will weep uncontrollably , or you can replicate the effect with caramelised sugar - the latter is probably better for consistency and not-having-a-sloppy-mess-on-top-of-your-cheesecakeness .
The crisper provides a somewhat enclosed environment , which prevents moisture from escaping as rapidly . Vegetables keep best at a certain humidity , higher than that typically found in the rest of the fridge , but not so high that condensation starts accumulating on them . Vegetables kept in too-dry air in the rest of the fridge will tend to dry out and shrivel up faster ; those kept in the crisper will retain their water and texture better , keeping them crisp . Leafy vegetables are also much more prone to drying out , since they have much more surface area , while hardier vegetables with a decent skin on them ( like bell peppers ) do n't dry out nearly as quickly . Fruits benefit somewhat from this as well , but do n't generally need as high a humidity as vegetables . Some crisper drawers have little sliders on them which vary the size of the opening to the rest of the fridge , letting you vary the amount of circulation and therefore the humidity ; you can adjust this to suit what you tend to store in the drawer . If you have two crisper drawers , both adjustable , then it might be a good idea to put fruit and hardier vegetables in one , and more vulnerable vegetables in the other .
I 've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses . Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer . You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1 , but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness . Increasing the amount of instant coffee , however , would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want . Also , instant coffee takes longer to dissolve , so it needs to be added straight to a liquid . There 's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes , such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes , because the recipe has no water in it in the first place . In the rare recipes where there is water , you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water + espresso powder , and this would likely work fairly well . So , summing up : there 's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I 've found with some significant experimentation . Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me .
I suggest you use royal icing instead of butter icing . Basically made from icing sugar ( powder sugar ) and egg white , it will cost very little and can still be coloured if necessary . Once you have tried out all the simple styles you scrape it off the board or work surface , mix it well and practice again . Store in a sealed air-tight container in the fridge for 1-2 days . This will give you time to make more intricate flowers , trellis , run out collars , nests , baskets , etc. on small squares of greaseproof paper , nails , etc. . Dry in an airy place and once completely set and hard , you can keep the results in a sealed container in a cool dry place for weeks to use as cake or cookie decorations . If you are really serious about becoming a sugar artist , it will be important to master royal icing , so you might as well start out with using it for " basic training " , so to speak .
It means the butter is made from cream that has n't been fermented . Butter made from fermented cream is known as " cultured cream butter " , and it has distinct sour , lactic acid notes . Sweet cream butter tastes , well , sweet , and if it is from really good fresh milk you may be able to taste grassy notes . Both are good in their own way .
I do n't know that there are studies on using different kinds of kelp with beans , but I have used both kombu strips and kelp granules interchangeably when cooking beans . The results seem to be the same either way .
The difference is that they 're two completely different ingredients and serve different purposes . Butter is 81 grams fat per 100 grams - or about 80 % fat . Sour cream is only 20 grams fat per 100 grams - about 20 % . In a quick bread like banana bread , recipes often call for fat in the form of oil , not butter , which is almost pure fat . Either way , these recipes need to add moisture ( much like a cake batter ) and sour cream has lots of moisture and , additionally , adds a slight tang . So , recipes usually call for a combination of butter or oil and some sort of wet ingredient like sour cream , milk , yogurt or buttermilk . The more appropriate substitution comparisons would be either : <URL> ? Why sour cream vs yogurt vs milk vs buttermilk ? From Baking Illustrated Banana Bread , page 23 : We still wanted more moisture in the bread , so we tried mixing in milk , buttermilk , sour cream , and plain yogurt . Sour cream added richness to our bread , but it also made for a heavy texture and an unattractive , pebbly crust . Milk added little flavor and created a slick crust . Buttermilk added a delightful tang , but yogurt let the banana flavor stand out . And because yogurt has more solids than buttermilk , it made for a somewhat more solid loaf , which we preferred . As a note , their final recipe uses both melted butter and yogurt .

Is it incorrect when someones says you can lower acidity with sweetness ?
Yes , it is incorrect . The correct thing to say is that it reduces sourness . Sourness is a taste , and sweetness indeed reduces it , and vice versa . Coca Cola classic has the same pH as vinegar , 2.5 , but the cola is sweet and the vinegar is sour , because the sugar in cola is enough to compensate the acidity and push the taste into the sweet range . Acidity is a chemical quality of a solution , and is given by the amount of hydrogen ions freely available . It is not changed by the amount of sugar ( except for very strong acids like sulfuric acid , which would react with the sugar and bind some protons in the reaction ) . Acidity " creates " sourness in the sense that we taste acidic food as sour , but as you can see in the sweetness example , our tongues are n't a perfect sensor and can be fooled by the presence of sweet substances , or also other things like miracle berries . Note that sweetness really reduces sourness , and does n't just " mask " it the way it masks bitterness or saltiness for some people .
I 've successfully frozen yuzu ( a Japanese citrus fruit slightly similar to lemon or grapefruit ) zest for two or three months without much damage ; the flavor is n't perfect , but it 's usable as long as you do n't get serious freezer burn . I 've kept it in a small Rubbermaid container . There is a potential problem because citrus oils can damage certain types of plastic over time , but this did n't affect me ; however , plastic bags wo n't work so well .
I use beer a LOT for my cooking . As the others have said , you need to watch out for the bitterness , which can intensify when you cook and reduce it down . As such , I often cook with different beers than I drink . You can use the IBU ( International Bitterness Unit ) rating for a beer to get an idea of whether your favorite beer will be a problem . Personally , I use Guinness and other dark beers when red wine is called for in a recipe . The flavors are definitely different than the red wine version , but it usually comes out good . I also cook quite a bit with wheat beers and the kind of beers that people describe as " nutty " , like porters . America 's Test Kitchen looked at beers for cooking at one point and a " non-alcoholic " beer actually did really well : O'Doul 's Amber . I agree with them and tend to keep it on hand for cooking , even though I never drink it . It stays mellow and away from the bitter flavors when used for cooking . So , what do I cook with it ? Like most of the others , cooking bratwurst before grilling and cheese fondue , but I also use it for lots of other stuff . I have a baked bean version that uses 4 cans of beer and a couple of shots of whiskey and sits in a crock pot on low for 24 hours . I 've made this with all different kinds of beer and each brings something different to the results . ( <URL> ) I also like using beer in most of my stews . Throw beef chunks , veggies and beer in the crock pot in the morning and it 's a tasty stew when you get home . It works well as the liquid for braising pork or beef . In the winter , I 'll often throw a pork shoulder roast into the crock pot with a bottle of beer and let it slow cook all day . When it 's completely falling apart , I pull it out , shred it and add back as much of the beer as the shredded mess will hold ( which turns out to be far more than you thought ) . What results is a juicy sandwich option , which is really good , topped with mustard or bbq sauce . It comforts me when it 's too cold to deal with slow smoking pork ( I live in MN ) . I 'll also often take some of that shredded " drunk " pork to my baked beans and give the beans some extra dimension . We do a version of " bangers and mash " that I use beer in the gravy/sauce that I like . Beer and self-rising flour make for a really quick quickbread that has an interesting flavor profile . I particularly like using wheat beers like Leinenkugel 's Sunset Wheat , as the wheat flavors work well in a bread . Beers ( and hard ciders , which I actually REALLY like ) work well for marinades . Beyond that , I tend to find myself just tossing a few ounces of it into a lot of other liquids/sauces to add some flavor .
Keep in mind that tap water is tested to ensure it 's safe for human consumption . Rainwater has no such requirement . While rainwater seems to be a happy-fuzzy natural resource , I 'd like to stress that this could be a serious safety issue . Yes , it seems unlikely , but you need an authority who knows their water . I suggest seeking out a professional opinion on how to properly filter rainwater . Possibly from the people who handle your municipal water supply .
You 're heating the oil past its <URL> . There is no trick or technique that will prevent oil from smoking and oxidizing ( " burning " ) at temperatures above the smoke point . It is literally being slowly destroyed at that temperature . I honestly do n't know why TV chefs are so attached to the idea of cooking with olive oil when most <URL> to compare it to other oils ( for frying purposes ) strongly indicate that it loses all or almost all of its unique taste by the end . Some cite dubious health benefits , but the low smoke point of virgin/extra virgin olive oil may also make it worse for you health-wise due to exactly what you 've witnessed - smoke and oxidation . EVOO is great as a dressing but it 's a terrible choice as a cooking oil . If you absolutely must imitate these confused TV chefs , you can either fry at very low temperatures ( as in , just barely a sizzle ) , which will take considerably more time , or used a refined ( not virgin ) olive oil which has a much higher smoke point . These would typically be the " cheap " olive oils you find in large plastic or metal containers .
Kneading dough has a few functions . First , it distributes the ingredients together evenly and allows the flour to become hydrated . As the flour starts to absorb water , enzymatic reactions occur and some proteins begin to mesh together . The two most important in this process are glutenin and gliadin . When these proteins start to get tangled up together , they form gluten , which is the protein that allows bread dough to stretch and trap gas bubbles produced by yeast . These reactions will occur on their own to an extent , as in no-knead recipes , but kneading accelerates the process . Kneading also allows you to control the texture of the bread . A vigorous knead can help to produce a bread with a fine crumb as the kneading an tighten the gluten , keeping the air bubbles more uniform . Doing short kneading periods ( or folds ) spaced by time for the dough to relax and rise can give you more extensible dough which can help give you a more open crumb structure . Finally , kneading is sometimes used to add inclusions to the dough that would disrupt it 's activity if added to early . This can be things like seeds , which would cut gluten strands if included too early in the process , or things like butter in a brioche , which would shorten the dough if included before the gluten had already developed .
Ground beef cooks quite fast . It does n't need more than 5 minutes ( depending on the base of your pan and the amount of meat of course ) . Just take a piece and rip/cut it open . If it 's brown inside , and not red or pink , it 's fully cooked .
Cultured milk products rarely become unsafe . Yogurt in particular is so acidic and teeming with bacteria already that it ca n't really go bad per se . It will get moldy as others have said . I culture my own buttermilk , yogurt , kefir , cheese , etc. . Many times they stay on the counter for days at a time . They get more and more sour ( if they are the kind that incubate at room temperature ) but they ca n't really go bad . Even sour cream does n't become dangerous - the mold just tastes bad . To second what kajaco said : if I do have cultured dairy get too sour or moldy I will wipe off the mold and bake something with it . It should be noted that non-cultured milk is completely different . Of course it goes bad fast but after even a short time it is too bad to bake with . And never ever EVER use old milk to culture your own yogurt or cheese . The bad bacteria will overwhelm the good and you will end up with liquid that will haunt you in your nightmares ! -- Edit -- <URL> I did some research and it seems that they can eventually go bad . It does n't fit my experience but I 'll defer to the scientists . Trust your nose .
I 've never heard of it being done and I ca n't imagine why you 'd want to try . An avocado is 70-80 % water and 15 % fat . That means you would basically be making pickled fat . Compare to cucumbers and peppers which are both in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 % fat , and much firmer than even an unripe avocado when raw . I 'm sure that it would be safe as long as it 's done properly and the pH is under 4.6 , and the acidity would kill or slow down the enzymes enough to prevent it from turning black . But I do n't think it would be edible , even if you added oil to the mix . We are biologically hardwired to perceive sour fat as being rancid , and unlike certain pickled meats , there 's no umami in there to compete with that sensation . If you feel you must try this , at least start with an unripe avocado and see what it 's like after a few days . A ripe avocado would almost certainly disintegrate in a pickling brine .
Soup freezes great in my experience . To freeze it for long term storage , you 'll probably want it to be vacuum sealed . In order to do this I freeze individual sized portions in Tupperware-style containers ( make sure to leave enough room for expansion ) , and as soon as they 're solid , vacuum seal those large " cubes " . They generally stack pretty nicely in our garage freezer . In general soups should thaw and taste very good , some flavors even seem become stronger or seem to enhance and meld better with the freezing . If you vacuum seal them as above you can throw them ( still sealed ) into a pot of boiling water for hot soup relatively fast ! As an aside , another great option with a leftover turkey frame would be to save it with previous odds and ends ( carrot/celery ends , onion pieces , etc ) in the freezer , and when you have enough make a simple stock . You can then freeze the stock into cubes ( in ice cube trays ) for soup-making later , sauteeing veggies , in place of water for more flavorful rice , and a ton of other things .
The FDA does not currently have a legal definition of stone ground . Companies like Hodgson 's Mill , Bob 's Red Mill , and Arrowhead Mills have petitioned the FDA to set a definition in the past under the concept of truth in labeling , to no avail . <URL>
Technically , your idea seems sound . But I would n't do it . What you are proposing to do in your electric kettle is very close to the standards for flash pasteurization . According to wikipedia , the standard procedure for flash pasteurization is to heat and circulate the liquid at 71.5 ° C ( 160 ° F ) to 74 ° C ( 165 ° F ) , for about 15 to 30 seconds , which results in a five log ( 99.999 % ) or greater reduction in bacteria . Other journal articles seem to indicate that some protozoa like cryptosporidium are killed by flash pasteurization , but others , like giardia , might survive in small numbers . I suspect the guideline for boiling water in issues of safety and in recipes is used because steam and bubbles are such convenient guarantors of temperature . Psychologically , though , this makes me a little nervous . Personally , I would boil the water - if you have time for tea , you have time to boil water . It is possible , though , that you are a more adventurous tea drinker than I am .
That bit of the Wikipedia article is unsourced , but <URL> and says that spores may be present even in pasteurized honey . ( I never would have thought that . ) I would n't expect the cooking of the crackers to damage the spores significantly more than the pasteurization . I ca n't say for sure that there will be live spores in the crackers , but it 's a definite possibility and if you 're concerned about this then you should not risk it .
Freezing affects the texture of avocados rather poorly . Freezing a whole one or chunks will result in a mushy avocado on refreezing . Its not recommended apparently . <URL> , it should be washed , pureed ( not just mashed ) and frozen with a bit of lemon juice ( or other applicable acid ) to prevent browning .
The basic idea is that you want to reduce the ice crystals formed while freezing the food . Here is what I would suggest . Put a metal pan in your freezer for 30 minutes to cool . Prep your zucchini , trying to get the most surface area possible . Spread out , trying to not overlap on your pan and place back in the freezer for about an hour . Place in your freezer bag and seal with as much air out of it as possible . A completely ideal way to freeze almost all veggies or fruits is to get a cooler and some dry ice , place your cut pieces in a metal bowl inside your cooler and leave it while the dry ice does its magic . You will have minimal ice crystals while giving you the closest taste from the original .
Simple Syrup is sugar that is has been dissolved in water . Heating speeds the process , and also allows the water to " absorb " more sugar . I do n't remember the chemistry of why the sugar does n't crystallize at room temp , but it does n't . It is typically made in a 1:1 mixture . . heat a cup of water to boiling , add a cup of sugar , stir until the sugar is dissolved , remove from heat , allow to cool . It is used in cold drinks like lemonade and iced tea because granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold liquids . It requires a lot of mixing , and the saturation point is low , so people who like lots of sugar ca n't get enough to dissolve to get the taste they desire . Note # 1 : this is why Southern-style Sweet Tea is sweetened while the tea is still hot . Note # 2 : The sweetness of 1 tsp of sugar is not equivalent to the sweetness of 1 tsp of simple syrup . You will have to find your particular taste point . Note # 3 : It can be flavored with just about any flavor extract , such as lemon , orange , peppermint , vanilla , almond , and so on . As I understand it , this is typically how flavored iced teas are made .
You 've got to understand what the purpose of the ingredients is . In a crumble or streusel topping ( my go-to in the category is an apple crisp ) , the ( gluten/wheat ) flour , butter , and sugar are actually all binders/structural components . Taste/flavor is part of it , but as in your experiments in the other answer , you really ca n't vary one element wildly ( separate from the others ) without significantly changing the results . With that in mind , the butter in a crumble/streusel topping will affect the tenderness of the crumb ( similar to cake/pastry ) . Tenderness will also be affected by whether you used cold , melted , or softened butter ( or a non-butter shortening , like margarine or lard/Crisco ) . The tenderness goes to mouth-feel , which will affect how/when your tongue picks up on the diff flavors . Similarly , the temp/state of the butter/shortening affects how &amp; how much the sugar will dissolve/interact with it . Depending on what type of sugar you 're using ( granulated/white , dark/light brown , raw/demerara , liquid sweeteners like honey , corn syrup , molasses , or agave ) , cold/melted/soft butter will just have a different holding capacity for sugar , which cooks can take advantage of to " super-sweeten " or " under-sweeten " given fundamentally the same amount of sugar . And of course in a crumble , your perception of the sweetness of the finished topping will be impacted by the filling , since there 's ( delicious ! ) flavor interaction during cooking . So it comes down to ingredient preparation &amp; choice and cooking techniques - not just raw proportions . Cooking is a sort of applied chemistry - sometimes how you put things together is as/more important than what you put together .
Onion tastes good , especially when caramelized , and since both it and the chicken go on to to be cooked for an extended time in the chili , there 's really no food safety concern with cooking them together . Both contribute to the finished flavor of the dish , and cooking them together saves time . There 's no magical interaction between chicken and onion - if there were you 'd see the same step in many different types of recipes .
From your description and re-reading the instructions for your version : yes , what you had on top was still clotted cream . They liquid on the bottom should be whey , which gets separated from the rest during the clotting-process . Re-heating did start the same process you used originally , and left-over whey separated again .
The change in flavor is mainly affected by packaging and how long before it gets frozen . Packaging : If you have vacuum sealed chicken it will last quite a while . It wo n't get freezer burnt , dry out or pick up flavors from other freezer occupants . I would say properly packaged will last months to a year range depending on your taste buds . Time before freezing : I have a habit of buying meat to cook right away , but end up freezing it raw several days after the fact . I then see it a week or two later and pull it out to cook . It never tastes as good as when I freeze it immediately .
