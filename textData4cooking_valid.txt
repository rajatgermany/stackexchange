When reducing , why do you simmer instead of boil ?
There 's another reason for not boiling liquids , besides the possibility of making a mess ( boiling over ) or ruining it ( scorching , etc. ) . You actually reduce the amount of flavor by boiling . As <URL> : But here 's the deal : when simmering , water is not the only thing escaping . Ever notice how when you come home to a pot of sauce simmering on the stovetop or perhaps a beautiful pot roast braising in the oven , your entire home smells of it ? Guess what : if those flavorful aromatic compounds are reaching your nose , it means they are leaving the pot . So ... if the only goal was to make there be less liquid , boiling 's fine . But if you actually want to concentrate the flavors , you want a slow simmer . The article also goes into more details about reducing alcohol , and some problems with boiling tomato sauce ( which I believe applies to most pectin &amp; other hydrocolloid thickened sauces ) .
Personally , I 've never made a dish that required greasing of the crockpot - even if it called for it , I 've ignored that step and had no problems . I can only imagine the step is added to ensure nothing sticks - but my crockpot ( and all others I 've seen ) are glazed porcelain or ceramic , and the recipes always include a liquid of some kind , so I do n't think that 's going to be a problem . If I were going to grease it , however , I 'd do it in the method you described , and use a very light touch .
I went to the farmers ' market last week and bought a variety of apples . After cooking , here 's the order from softest to firmest : McIntosh , Cortland , Winesap , Yellow Delicious . The McIntosh of course practically dissolve . If you want to make quick apple sauce , or if you like really squishy pie , they 're the best . I typically prefer Cortlands for pie , b/c they do n't totally dissolve but neither do they keep their shape . I think I 'm going to try Winesap , though ; I think they 'd work great for pie . The Winesap apples I used got very soft , but they still held their shape . Think of it like a ripe banana or pear - it has shape , but you can squish it really easily . After 30 minutes in the oven ( making apple crisp ) , they got soft enough that lightly pressing with a fork would squish them down . They did not stay as firm as the Yellow Delicious did and definitely not as firm as Granny Smith would .
The green shoot in the middle of a clove of garlic is said to have a somewhat bitter flavor .
I do n't think it is close to either cous-cous or rice . It is less starchy than both . Also , it has a unique mouthfeel when you chew on it , because the tiny grains ( 1 mm or less ) pop under your teeth . I would try getting the real thing in a whole food store or an organic store , or also online . If you ca n't find it , in these stores , but can get other exotic grains , you can try quinoa or millet . If you really ca n't get anything uncommon , I would use durum semolina . Wash it before cooking and cook it with fat to reduce the starch . Also , I would maybe cook it in more water than needed and remove excess water after it has been cooked and cooled , so your semolina grains do n't form a creamy pudding . Maybe tapioca pearls of the extra-small variety can work too , I am not sure because I have n't tried using them and do n't know what their final texture is . You will notice that , when suggesting replacements , I am most worried about texture . The reason is that the flavor of amaranth is very faint and bland . It is best used as a base for other , strong flavors . So you can use anything with the right texture , the flavor in the dish should come from spices and other components .
You can use definitely use polenta/cornmeal for breading , but it 'll tend to be noticeably more crunchy than breadcrumbs are . An obvious comparison is cornmeal fried fish . People make it multiple ways : <URL> so it 'll add a definite crunch , while <URL> which will soften it up . The moisture from whatever you 've coated matters too . I 'm guessing pork loin is n't going to release a whole lot of water , but if you 're marinating it perhaps you 'd get some from there . Since polenta is coarser , I 'm guessing you might want to err on the side of caution , to avoid crunchy turning into gritty .
In cooking rice or many other grains ( and even some grain based products such as pasta ) , two things actually happen : The starches absorb water ; they are hydrated . Cooking . The boiling phase does both at the same time , very efficiently , but sufficient hydration happens before the rice is fully cooked through . So steaming to finish allows the rice to be fully cooked . If you just simmer , things would simply take longer . The reason to turn the heat down is to not burn the rice at the bottom during the steaming phase .
This is a recipe that we used for the concierge lounge when I was a chef in the main kitchen of the Disney 's Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa : Paneer 5 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons lemon juice Bring the milk to a boil , add the lemon juice so that the milk separates into the curds and whey . Add a bit more lemon juice if necessary . Let set for approx . 5 mins . Line a strainer with a cheesecloth and strain the milk . Reserve the whey to use in curries instead of water . Squeeze the excess whey out of the curd and fold the cloth around the paneer to form a 4-inch square . Place the paneer on a plate and place a heavy weight on top to squeeze out excess whey . Leave for about 4 hours to set .
The white , pithy part is a source of the bitterness . Either peel more thoroughly , or trim off with a knife . The pulp of some oranges ( of the navel variety ) , can turn bitter when exposed to air . <URL>
Yes , you can . The problem is that the potatoes start absorbing water , and you end up with a really runny mash that 's difficult to flavor ( as most people flavor their mash by the addition of flavorful liquids ) . update : There 's a few things that you can do to hold them . The first is to drain the water , and leave the potato bits ( unmashed ) in the pot . If you leave them uncovered , they 'll cool off , but it 'll also let moisture evaporate , which can help to fix some of the problems I mentioned earlier . You do n't want to let them cool off too far , or they 'll not mash up smoothly ; if you 're going to need to hold them for more than 5-10 minutes , put a lid on them . Once it comes time to mash , refresh them with whatever liquid you 're going to add to the mash , warmed . If you 're going to need to hold them a really long time , you have two options ... one is to mash them but intentionally reduce the liquid , and then refresh them with more hot liquid a few minutes before serving . The other is to transfer them to a baking dish after mashing , and put it in a low oven . ( if you rough up the surface , and put it under the broiler right before serving , you can get a crust on it for a bit of variety ) .
Recipes for preserving tend to be very specific . They 're calibrated to balance factors like pH and sugar content in the final recipes , and of course to minimize the risk of spoilage . In general , you should always follow the steps as written in your recipe . What I 've generally observed is that jam-type recipes do n't always include the final boiling step because the jam is already cooked ( edit : and because <URL> , the sugar content is generally high enough to be inhospitable to bacteria ) . That differs from canning fresh fruits and vegetables which are largely raw . The purpose of the boiling step here is to kill off pathogens before they get a chance to settle in and spoil the contents , as no matter how well you clean them , there are likely to be some spores , bacteria , etc. remaining . Even a tiny initial population can grow and spoil your preserves over the length of time they 'll be put away . So , initial sterilization is always required to clean the jars themselves . The second boil <URL> the contents . If you 've already done this as part of your preparation , as with a jam , then it most likely is n't required . It probably wo n't hurt , especially if you plan to put up your jams for an extended period of time ( i.e. months or years ) but you 'll have to weigh the convenience of skipping that step against the potential risk of spoilage . That said , let me state again for the record that if your specific recipe says to include the final boil , then there 's likely a very good reason , and you should follow that instruction .
I am afraid that gloves make things worse . Even with proper training , people who wear gloves seem to be more complacent that those who do not wear gloves . I have seen people handle dollar bills then turn around and touch my food with the same gloves on . Disgusting , and I refuse the food , and when I tell them why , they say the gloves are to protect me ... what the F ever . Then I ask them how that glove protects me From The germs on those dollars you just touched ? I find its better to enforce good hand washing habits than it is to allow gloves to be used at all . When you are wearing gloves , you do n't even wipe your hand on a towel , without gloves your hands kinda start to tell you they need to be washed if you 've been lax .
The only difference between the two is that puree has a little more liquid . You should add more puree than the recipe calls for paste to compensate for it being more dilute . In some recipes , the extra liquid could be a problem , however , I do n't think it will make any difference in pad thai in the quantities that it is used .
Kneading dough has a few functions . First , it distributes the ingredients together evenly and allows the flour to become hydrated . As the flour starts to absorb water , enzymatic reactions occur and some proteins begin to mesh together . The two most important in this process are glutenin and gliadin . When these proteins start to get tangled up together , they form gluten , which is the protein that allows bread dough to stretch and trap gas bubbles produced by yeast . These reactions will occur on their own to an extent , as in no-knead recipes , but kneading accelerates the process . Kneading also allows you to control the texture of the bread . A vigorous knead can help to produce a bread with a fine crumb as the kneading an tighten the gluten , keeping the air bubbles more uniform . Doing short kneading periods ( or folds ) spaced by time for the dough to relax and rise can give you more extensible dough which can help give you a more open crumb structure . Finally , kneading is sometimes used to add inclusions to the dough that would disrupt it 's activity if added to early . This can be things like seeds , which would cut gluten strands if included too early in the process , or things like butter in a brioche , which would shorten the dough if included before the gluten had already developed .
Technique is the key here . If she is using oil expect she is adding the eggs before the oil is hot , she is probably also rushing her attempt to turn/flip/scramble / move them . One of the hardest things to learn when frying eggs is to walk away immediately after adding the eggs to the hot pan . I notice you are in Germany , I do n't know what your access to the USA 's " Food Network " is but this episode of a Alton Brown 's " <URL> " can <URL> . ( pardon the pun , could n't resist ... )

There are two things you care about when you are making a cake . First , ratio . Second , sequence . The ratio is a weight ratio . For example , a muffin batter has 2 parts flour , 2 pars liquid , 1 part egg , and 1 part fat . You can use different types of liquid to make different kinds of muffins . You can make any amount of batter you want , provided you use the same ratio . * The second point is the sequence of combining the ingredients . Look at pound cake and sponge cake : they are made with the same ingredients , using exactly the same ratio . But you combine the ingredients in a different order , producing two different types of cake layer . If you decide to change a recipe for avocado baking , you must keep both ratio and sequence in mind . An avocado contains , on average , <URL> . It also has 7 % fiber , but as I assume that you 'll puree the avocado first , it shoudl n't roughen the cake too much , it will be nowhere like whole wheat cake . We can ignore the sugars ( 1 % ) and proteins ( 2 % ) , as the amount is insignificant . As for the ratio , you can try using avocado , and then removing some fat and liquid from the cake recipe . As fresh avocado has 5 times more water than butter , it is n't possible to substitute all the butter from the original recipe - I do n't know any cake recipes with such high water : butter ratios . You should rather replace the liquid , calculate how much butter is being replaced by avocado fat , and then add the remaining butter needed . It will still need fine tuning , because some of the avocado water is already trapped in the fiber , and wo n't hydrate the cake flour . I 'd try out using maybe 140-160 g avocado puree for each 100 g liquid in the recipe . This will result in 115-120 g. avocado water . It will also deliver 20 g fat . So for aforementioned cupcakes , we 'll only need 5 g additional fat ( they use 25 g fat per 100 g liquid ) . Of course , layers for sponge cake or sachertorte are out of the question , because they do n't use liquid in the first place . The second problem is the sequence . Some recipes expect you to cream the butter and sugar . These ca n't be made with avocado , as it is impossible to separate the fat and liquid in this case . Similarly , you ca n't use it to make a roux for a souffle ( OK , that 's not technically a cake ) . Other recipes do n't require such careful mixing methods , and they should be fine with avocado puree . You can try practically anything where you are supposed to dump all liquid ingredients together , mix , and add the dry ones at once . Of course , you want also to consider the taste . Avocado has a somewhat earthy taste , and you 'll probably notice it in a baked product . So fine cakes ( like chiffon cake ) are better off with butter . But most of those are made without liquid anyway . You can try to hide the taste in cakes which have a very strong taste of their own . Chocolate batters will be very good for this , but some flourless cake bases with a significant share of ground nuts should work too . Another option is to use avocado in some more hearty , heavy cakes , where the taste is n't a problem . It should function in sweet cakes , and will probably be perfect in savory cakes ( think zucchini &amp; bacon cupcakes ) . It would be interesting to see what happens to a flaky crust where avocado puree is used instead of water ( with butter accordingly reduced ) . If the texture remains OK , it should give a very nice note to quiches . If you replace a sour liquid with avocado ( e.g. yogurt or buttermilk ) , do n't use baking soda . If the recipe calls for it , use baking powder instead , because baking soda needs acidic ingredients for its leavening action . * But part of it waits too long for the previous patch to free the oven , the baking powder will bubble away and the muffins wo n't rise .
If you cut it with a knife , you 'll tend to get a very smooth surface . If you tear it open , whether by hand or with the aid of a fork , it 'll tend to break on more natural places in the crumb , giving a bit rougher surface . When toasted , that tends to result in more contrast of texture - the bits sticking up will brown more and get crunchier .
It 's meant to be munched on between sips , and permits a " reset " - the cocktail will be fresh upon the tongue the sip after the bite , permitting you to enjoy its flavor and consistency without being oppressed by the cumulative effect of unctuous , spice and salt that is the hallmark of the beverage . Celery is an astringent and an aromatic - it will cut through the palate-coating tomato juice can leave behind , cool the intensity of the salt and heat , and will interrupt the soup-like consistency with a firm crunch . It 's often included in tuna and chicken salad and served with hot wings for the same reason . Other vegetables that tickle our sense of " bitter " in a pleasing way may be similarly substituted - but celery also acts as a handy swizzle stick .
Yes , it is to do with freshness - the fresher and younger the aubergine , the less bitter it will be . If you have an old aubergine , you could try peeling it , as the bitter compounds are concentrated just under the skin .

Why is mixing good whiskey with cola/ginger ale frowned upon ?
It is about the same thing as putting A-1 on prime rib . Mixers , like cola or ginger ale , tend to mask the flavors of the whiskey , something which is understandable for an ' inferior ' brand but is thought of as ' taboo ' for a ' fine ' blend . The drink that results from mixing your fine whiskey with the mixers is ( roughly ) ' the same ' as if you had mixed a cheaper blend , having concealed the subtleties that aging and craftsmanship have worked to create . That said ... if you like it , it is your drink .
It is to cool it down without dilluting it - ice cubes would melt . And yes , you could simply cool the entire bottle , but it would n't look that fancy . Note that some purists would wrinkle their noses and insist that whisky1 is best enjoyed at room temperature and perhaps with a small dash of spring water . 1 And I 'm soooo not going into a whisky vs. whiskey debate here .
For an astringent/bitter twist to the flavour , for a scent , and the visual gloss effect ** Mediterranean people have been doing this for centuries For best effect they are probably using a first cold press oil ( Extra-virgin ) from young olive trees ( less than 50 years old ) . It is often quite green in colour and has a pungent and astringent odour These are often only available from boutique olive farmers , in expensive small quantities e.g. . <URL> or <URL> . Expect prices around NZ$ 50 to NZ$ 100 per litre It is sort of similar in concept to squeezing a fresh lemon over a dish It 's a bit over fashionable at the moment , but in some dishes it really works ** the three s 's - sap ( or ) , scent , shine
I can give you the traditional aproach my <URL> uses : Harvest season is just a few weeks per year . The mill will during that time buy the amount of grain they need for one year - from harvest to harvest . The grain gets sorted , tested , dried and cleaned if necessary , and is then put into storage . During the year , it gets milled . The two factors here are capacity and demand . A mill works year-round , it makes no sense to let the machines stand idle for a long time . So there is a maximum capacity they can process per year - and a good management wo n't buy more . Also , there are times of higher demand ( think holiday baking ) which need more flour to be milled in advance . The grain should rest for a few weeks after harvest for better quality . I 'm no scientist , but I trust my miller on this . A good mill will strive to sell the flour as soon as possible after it is milled , partly for economic , but mostly for quality reasons . While especially white flour wo n't spoil for months ( recommended : one year ) , darker or especially whole grain flours get rancid quickly and quality decreases . ( E.g. changes in taste and moisture content and enzymatic degradation which influence the baking process and results . ) The whole grains on the other hand can easily be stored for well over a year , multiple years in fact . Big industrial mills work in a similar way , just on a way larger scale and the flour has a longer time from mill via stores to the customer .
The original recipe calls for a total of 2 lbs of ground meat , 1/2 beef and 1/2 veal . I would suggest a close approximation to the effect can be had by using either ( in decreasing order of preference ) : 50 % ground pork , 50 % ground beef -- Some of the mild flavor of veal , with tenderness and flavor from the pork 100 % ground beef -- It wo n't be as tender or as subtle , but still will be good I would avoid trying to use as part of your substitution mixture : Ground lamb , goat , ox , and so on -- flavor is too strong Ground chicken or turkey -- these are extremely low in fat , likely to toughen your overall mixture , and likely to make it taste more poultryesque Personally , I would also switch from whole eggs to just the yolks , which will bring the binding and tenderizing qualities of the yolk , without the slightly rubber-like texture of albumin based white , to more closely approximate the qualities the veal would have brought to the dish .
Toughness is usually the result of either too much gluten ( which in turn comes from using a flour too high in protein ) , or not enough fat ( or possibly adding the fat at the wrong time ) . Poor volume on the other hand is usually the result of using low-protein flour , and thus not having enough gluten formation . Therefore it is logical to assume that the most likely cause of your bread troubles is the fat . Try adding some more fat .
I 've come across two great , and very different , types of steak . The first is typical in Argentina and is not aged at all , but from a young calf ( 6-10 months old ) , free ranging and grass fed ( hence not like classic veal ) . This is really juicy , tender , and with a very " bright " taste . Good high-end Argentine restaurants usually serve meat like this , and in the UK you can order it from pampasplains.com , which I think is great . The second is from an older cow and dry aged to tenderize , but the aging also gives it a deeper , more bone marrow-like flavour . The best I 've had of this type was a cow from Limousin in France , served in Paris at a small restaurant called Le Sèvero ( 8 rue des Plantes , 14th Arrondissment , reviewed in the NY Times a while ago ) . It was amazing ! In London , 32 Great Queen St 's " Hereford beef " is a similar style and also excellent . They get it from a Hereford farmer called Tom Jones ( seriously ) , who serves several restaurants . Good steak should never be marinated in anything - all it needs before cooking is salt , maybe pepper if you like ( though I sometimes eat it with Coleman 's English mustard ) . I 'm fairly sure that grass-only feed is important to good meat , i.e. no cereal-based fattening-up , though it 's hard to separately test this one variable . Breed also clearly matters ( all Argentine beef seems to be Aberdeen Angus or Hereford ) . I love a nicely marbled , fatty steak like the ribeye , but my ( Argentine ) wife prefers leaner cuts like sirloin and filet - clearly a matter of taste .
Keep in mind that tap water is tested to ensure it 's safe for human consumption . Rainwater has no such requirement . While rainwater seems to be a happy-fuzzy natural resource , I 'd like to stress that this could be a serious safety issue . Yes , it seems unlikely , but you need an authority who knows their water . I suggest seeking out a professional opinion on how to properly filter rainwater . Possibly from the people who handle your municipal water supply .

Venison is , generally , an extremely lean meat . This means it responds well to two cooking methods : very very fast and very very hot ( grilling , perhaps roasting with a lot of basting , or lard the meat first ) , or very very slow and moist ( braising ) . This is of course dependent on the cut ; loin is best grilled , shoulder is best braised ( due to the connective tissue ) , leg is best roasted . I would n't use plain water as a braising liquid . 50/50 water and red wine , or stock and wine , or just stock ... cider would be lovely , so would various juices .
By grinding it , you are also increasing the surface are of the herb when it reaches the tongue , and you are exposing the raw/inner ( bitter ) flavors of the herb to the mouth . When cooking with it " un-ground " , the cooking process extracts just the oils from the herb , and leaves the leaf in tact which does not taste unpleasant to the senses . I would certainly use less of a ground herb , but my preference would be to leave it in it 's natural dried state , and if you want more taste just increase the quantity . The only exception I have for this is when making rubs , where the fat of the meat ( or oil for a bread dip ) typically complements the bitter flavor of the ground herb .
I 'll try to break this down into components to make it simpler . If a <URL> starts by combining sugar and a solid fat ( creaming ) , this incorporates small air bubbles into the batter which will be seed bubbles for the carbon dioxide produced by chemical leavening . Occasionally , this creaming is used alone for leavening ( as in traditional poundcakes ) . If the flour is added straight to this , it can help prevent the batter from curdling later if a colder ingredient is added . This also coats the flour with fat , preventing gluten development and making a very fine , tender crumb since the flour is " waterproofed " before other liquids are added . If eggs are added to the fat and sugar , you can make an emulsified cake but the presence of water when the flour is added can make it slightly tougher . Some <URL> ( usually with oil ) require all the liquids to be mixed together , and then added to all the dry ingredients which have already been mixed . Again , this can sometimes lead to a tougher cake since the flour is exposed to water . <URL> is to mix all the dry ingredients , then incorporate the solid fat into that , then add liquids . This will usually lead to tender cakes as the flour has been coated with fat before liquids are added . If a <URL> is leavened with whipped egg whites ( or whole eggs ) , those will be added last to prevent the bubbles from being knocked out by excess stirring . You pretty much always want the fat to be present when the flour is added though . As you saw in your recipe , adding liquid to the flour without the fat will allow too much gluten development and make your cake tough and dense .
The purpose for cleaning with salt is that it is an abrasive , and helps remove anything sticking to the pan , without being harsh enough to remove the seasoning . Its not a stop-gap measure for poor seasoning ; it is intended to preserve the seasoning . The main issue is avoiding soaps and detergents which would tend to remove the seasoning that makes cast iron fairly non-stick .
The flip answer is that sauteed food will taste good , and the microwaved version you 're describing will not . A more useful answer , however , would consider physics and chemistry . Microwaving excites molecules , resulting in heat , presuming an adequate supply of water molecules to excite . Sauteeing conducts heat from the heat source to the food by way of the pan . Microwaving falls somewhere between radiant heating ( like an oven ) and steaming , though the results from conventional methods are generally superior . Sauteeing can transfer enough heat quickly enough that desirable effects like caramelization and similar effects like browning are effected with the help of fats and sugars ( often referred to as a <URL> ) , which produces volatile compounds that are very aromatic and contribute a lot to our perception of flavor . It 's exceptionally hard to create the same effects with a microwave .
Steam a head of cauliflower , puree it . Add it to the soup . You might also consider some squash or sweet potato puree .
I 've seen bread recipes like the one that you described . When bread is baked in an oven with steam - the starch in the crust is able to gelatinize before it all dries out and becomes crispy . This is what makes the crust crisp , shiny , and delicious - characteristic of " artisan " breads . Most people do n't have steam enhanced ovens ( or the ability to hack their oven to add steam : <URL> ) The recipe you linked has water added for steam but then takes out extra insurance ( they cheat ) by adding the cornstarch glaze to mimic the effect . By adding extra , pure , starch on the surface of the loaf more gelatinization occurs . Additionally , cornstarch gelatinizes at a lower temperature that wheat starch . Conceivably , you should be able to use any starch and see similar results but , in the US at least , cornstarch is by far the most common . It should n't be necessary if you are able to produce enough steam in your oven .
Putting strong spirits in the freezer should not harm them . The solubility of air gases increases at low temperature , which is why you see bubbles as it warms up . Drinks with a lower alcohol content will be affected in the freezer . There is potential to freeze water out of anything with an alcohol content of 28 % or lower . Many people use the freezer to increase the alcohol content of their home brew in UK , by freezing water out of it - the alcohol stays in the liquid portion .
The steam should only be used for the first part of baking . Recipes vary in opinion on how long it 's best to have this steam , but the range I 've seen is usually 10-30 minutes . The moist baking environment allows the outer layer of dough to remain stretchy so that you maximize " oven spring " in the first part of baking . Steaming the dough also causes the starches on this outer layer to gelatinize , which is what leads to the crispy and nicely browned crust . If you continue to steam through the whole baking process , this layer will not have a chance to dry out , which is what 's required for it to brown and crisp up . This <URL> has lots of information on how to achieve a good crust .
Depending on what the ginger is going into , lightly greasing your knife blade helps ( but , obviously , not if you 're putting them in something where a tiny bit of oil would be an issue ) . As does using a heavy carbon-steel knife like a Chinese cleaver . Freezing sounds attractive , but it does n't work because the ginger becomes impossible to chop -- too hard . Overall , you pretty much have to expect to scrub the knife and cutting board after you 're done . You can make it a bit easier on yourself , but you ca n't make chopping candied ginger not messy .
Gravy is supposed to be opaque and is a result of using flour as the thickener . If you want clear gravy , like what you would get in a Chinese restaurant , then you need to use corn starch or arrowroot as your thickener . But the opacity is considered to be a good thing . It 's the canned stuff you buy in the store that is clear .

Can I replace honey with maple syrup in recipes that require honey ?
Generally speaking , maple syrup will work fine in any recipe that calls for honey . They may have slightly different viscosities and water content , but that could be true between two honeys as well , so I would n't worry about it a lot . The only thing I think you really have to consider is whether the flavor of maple syrup is appealing in the dish you would substitute it in . In most cases , I think it will be fine , especially if the dish would have worked well with a dark , fully flavored honey . You might also like to try sorghum syrup , molasses , or agave nectar as other possible replacements .
So , there 's no method to get sugar out of milk , as far as I know . You can look for milk products where some of the sugar is used up ( fermented , like Chris H mentioned ) , but this will significantly change taste and texture - sugar is a major part of what milk is , fats and sugars and proteins , and you 're removing most of the actual substance . You 're likely to do better with an unsweetened nut milk or rice milk , especially if you make your own so you can tweak to taste . These may have more fats , depending on your choice of recipe , but will likely have sugar closer to your desired range One thing you might try , if you 're really determined , is to dilute your milk ( maybe up to half ) and add artificial sweeteners . You 'll still get some of the flavor components from the added milk , and some sweetening to make up the difference in taste , but there will be less sugar because the actual amount of milk is less . Hopefully the added artificial sweetener might make it taste less watery , but maybe add just a half a pinch of salt if it still tastes too thin . in the end , ~ 6g sugar per cup , I guess ? Another possibility is to use unflavored whey powder to flavor the diluting water ( again , probably no more than half of your " milk " ) , then adding artificial sweetener to taste . The whey should have some of the flavors from the proteins in milk , and at least from the powder I checked it does n't have much of the sugar or fat you 're objecting to . It might help the diluted milk taste less watery . ~ 7g sugar , because I think the whey powder has a gram and a half per serving . Final possibility I thought of - you can maybe grab some creamer powder and use that to flavor your diluted milk ( again , not more than half and sweeten to taste ) . Or even use it on its own , if the flavor works for you . The amount of sugar is n't stated , but it has to be under 1g because that 's all the carbs there are per serving - though it does add a half gram of fat back in .
You can neutralize the acidity of your drink by adding a half teaspoon of baking soda , but do n't do this . Apart from fizzing up like a volcano , your lemon drink , or what is left of it , will taste pretty awful . What you want to do is reduce the perceived acidity . This can be done simply by adding more honey . I suggest adding a teaspoon at a time until it tastes about right . I like about double the amount of honey you specified if we 're talking teaspoons .
I have used diced turnips in dishes as a replacement for potatoes . That may work if you enjoy eating turnips . Of course the taste will be much different than potatoes . According to Wikipedia ( eep , I know ... but just for a rough idea ) : 100 grams of . . Turnips 7g carbs Potatoes 17g carbs

The key factor in syrup 's shelf life is the water activity in the syrup , rather than the ingredients used to make it . Generally , the water is all ' bound up ' with dissolved sugar so microorganisms ca n't use it to grow , but the lighter the syrup , the more available water it will have . In my experience , simple syrup is usually kept refrigerated except for small portions that will be used within a day or two . For a chart of water activity ( aW ) of related foods , check here : <URL>
Dude you said you have cast iron . Cast iron rules . And it performs very well in the oven . No contest against glass and you can make pan sauce on the stove-top after the roasting is finished . My favorite pan to make roast chicken with is my 12 " Lodge cast iron skillet . Glass is probably better at roasting than cheap cookie style sheets , because it keeps the heat distribution fairly smooth . But glass will not hold up well to heavy roasting use and will eventually ruin your dinner when it cracks or shatters . All Clad makes a great roasting pan with wire rack . But for most roasting a simple cast iron skillet works well and is indestructible .
The cheeses that just plain wo n't work in the fridge are those that make use of bacteria or mold with " special needs " . Swiss , camembert , and any blue cheese come to mind . The bacteria that produce the holes in Swiss need specific , relatively warm , temps for specific times . Likewise the molds on the rinds or through blue cheeses need warmer but still cooler than room temperature . Most semi-firm to firm cheeses can be aged just fine in a fridge . Many generic cheese recipes such as : <URL> or <URL> either say to age in the fridge or do n't give a temperature at all and just say " age in a cool place " . In particular cheddar or gouda like cheeses age just fine in the fridge . Parmesan should also work but I personally have n't had the patience to wait the year necessary to try it . Of course if generic-cheddar-like cheese is n't good enough and you want to recreate some particular cheddar that will be harder . Those recipes usually call for something like " Age for 6 months in this particular cave in France " . As for room temperature . I do n't know . Room temperature at my house is 80F and no cheese will work with that .
It depends on what the bees had for lunch :) . Acacia honey is extremely sweet , with no bitter aftertaste . Chestnut honey ( easy to find in Italy , do n't know about elsewhere ) is dark and has a strong bitter note . I personally love how the bittersweet goes with butter and bread , but some people hate it . Generic polyflower honey usually does not have a bitter note .
First , I 'm assuming by " pesto " you mean " Pesto alla Genovese " , given your question about pine nuts . Basil , pine nuts , garlic , olive oil , and cheese is a delicious combination , but it 's only one of many " pestos " ( peste , actually ) , since pesto refers in general to any sauce which is made from crushed or pureed ingredients . Mix and match to your heart 's content . Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese ; pine nuts have always been scarce , even in early-20th-century Italy . As a caution , though , you need to get good , fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts , or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid . Almonds could also work , although I 'd think they 'd be rather bland . The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper . Again , freshness and getting the skin off is important . I 'd think sunflower seeds would be kind of odd and oily , but you do n't know until you try . If you do , post a comment to let us know !
You could probably get away with pork shoulder , although you will want to consider that the texture may not be what you want -- it may either have too much fat and connective tissue , or it may fall apart too much , depending on how long you braise it for . You will probably have to alter your cooking times , I 'd imagine . Pork hocks are somewhat similar in texture to the shank , so that a possibility . Though you will probably run into the same availability problems . It may take a small amount of modification , but your best bet may be to go with country-style ribs . They are tender and flavorful when braised , and are readily available in any grocery store .
Yeah , syrup can ferment + convert sugar to alcohol . It has more of a tendency to do so if the sugar content is lower -- I tend to err on the side of overconcentrating my syrup . You can try boiling it for a while to see if the alcohol boils off + if the flavor is OK then use it ... but I 'd boil down a bit more first , to make sure the sugar content is back up to standards . Either boil until the boiling point is 7 degrees F higher than the boiling point of water at your altitude , or boil until the syrup " aprons " ( e.g. starts to drip in a sheet rather than discrete drops ; a flat edge of a metal spatula works well ) , with the former being more accurate if you have a good thermometer . If the flavor remains after boiling , then try using in recipes -- perhaps in brownies/blondies or with ice cream .
I 've heard of adding sugar to stir-fries , to make a caramel flavoured sauce/glaze in Vietnamese cooking , as in <URL> . Although I 've usually seen sugar used , I see no reason why a similar effect could not be obtained by using honey .
Here are a few options : Make a salt barrier around the jar . Keep jar in a bowl full of water . Use air-tight container ( does n't need to be a jar ) . Any of the above should keep ants away from your honey .
You could use them , together with the core , to make apple-glaze ( for your pie ) . Cover everything with water , simmer about 30 min , strain , simmer until you reach the desired density .
Yes , I think you can . The page you link does list the oil as " food grade " , and specifies no added solvents ... so there 's probably nothing dangerous in the jar and it can be safely used for cooking . In general , though , you usually should n't equate cosmetic treatments and edible substances , even if some of the ingredients are the same ( soaps often do this , list all food sounding ingredients until a second glance reveals it , well , soap ) , or even if the base substance is the same but may have undergone different processes ( like coconut oil or cocoa butter ) . If the coconut oil had been processed with some non-food grade solvents or processes , it might be perfectly safe for topical application , and still be quite dangerous to consume . If you are questioning whether a substance might be an ingredient as well as a cosmetic treatment , look up the information , and I mean brand-specific product page , and see if it mentions " food grade " - that means exactly the bit of information you 're looking for , that it is of a high enough quality that it passes the tests they use for product meant to be eaten .
Golden Syrup improves with age according to Heston Blumenthal 's " In Search of Perfection " . Here he analyses a 70 year old glass jar of Tate and Lyle Gold in the lab finding that the " older treacle contained the same flavour compounds as the normal stuff , but each was intensified " . In his recipe he fakes the ageing process by baking the tin at 70ºC ( 158ºF ) for 24 hours noting that the flavour will continue to improve up to 100 hours .
Simple Syrup is sugar that is has been dissolved in water . Heating speeds the process , and also allows the water to " absorb " more sugar . I do n't remember the chemistry of why the sugar does n't crystallize at room temp , but it does n't . It is typically made in a 1:1 mixture . . heat a cup of water to boiling , add a cup of sugar , stir until the sugar is dissolved , remove from heat , allow to cool . It is used in cold drinks like lemonade and iced tea because granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold liquids . It requires a lot of mixing , and the saturation point is low , so people who like lots of sugar ca n't get enough to dissolve to get the taste they desire . Note # 1 : this is why Southern-style Sweet Tea is sweetened while the tea is still hot . Note # 2 : The sweetness of 1 tsp of sugar is not equivalent to the sweetness of 1 tsp of simple syrup . You will have to find your particular taste point . Note # 3 : It can be flavored with just about any flavor extract , such as lemon , orange , peppermint , vanilla , almond , and so on . As I understand it , this is typically how flavored iced teas are made .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .

How to grill potatoes ?
I have a " Grill Wok " that I received as a gift that looks like this : It is great for grilling potatoes . Peel and cube to about 1 " pieces . Par boiling or microwaving works equally well for blanching the cubes . Toss in a large bowl with olive oil and melted butter Add seasoning : salt , pepper , chili powder , oregano , etc. ( to taste ) Allow Grill Wok to preheat on the grill , when hot add potatoes . Cook till golden brown ( I believe mine was obtained at Bass Pro Shop , but they are available elsewhere )
Vodka by definition is a flavorless distilled alcohol , retaining any of the organoleptic properties of the grain or potato could be considered as ruining the end product . Potatoes are a good source of starch , but brewers yeast has a limited ability to break down starch into usable fuel ; its preferred fuel sources are relatively simple sugars like mono and disaccharides . In order to efficiently convert the starch in potatoes to sugar the potatoes must first be boiled so that the starches gelate . Once gelated , the potatoes are then Mashed-in with malted barley or wheat at a temperature around 150 ˚F so that the diastatic enzymes can break those starches into the sugars that yeast likes to eat . These same steps are used when making vodka from non-malted grains such as corn ( maize ) . Boiling the potatoes also helps reduce the number of surface microbes that could end up influencing the final product . Bacteria and wild yeast strains can lead to moldy , grassy , sour , and other unpleasant flavors that may necessitate multiple distillations to remove . Making a mash of raw , peeled potato would likely yield something closer to a sourdough starter with a mix a naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria producing a small amount of alcohol along with acetic and lactic acids , as well as other compounds .
Mike , I also have a pellet grill and we keep pellets in ours after we are done cooking but we also keep it covered and out of the weather . I think the wood pellets could absorb moisture and expand if they get wet and possibly plug your auger . :)
One thing we have found that helps in adding flavor during the steaming process is to slice garlic thinly , and line the bottom of the steamer basket with the garlic . Then afterwards , toss the garlic in with the potatoes and add salt/pepper/etc . ( I 'd probably add paprika , onion powder , and a pinch of cayenne . ) I would imagine orange or lemon peel might work the same as garlic when steamed , although you might get better results tossing the steamed veggies with some zest . You can also toss the steamed potatoes with vinegar or lemon juice ( whether or not it 's combined with oil is up to you ) along with the spices . Another option would be to bake your potatoes rather than steam them . Just wash , poke , and bake at 350F for 1 hour . There 's no more fat , but the flavor and texture are VERY different . Just make sure not to wrap them in foil , since you wo n't get the same results . ( Wrapping potatoes in foil is essentially steaming them , and the crust wo n't get crisp . )
Cast iron is great for bacon , but not a grill pan . The bacon really needs to be floating on its own grease for nice even heating . The best bacon is cooked slowly . Preheat the pan so it is an evenly heated cooking surface , then slide you bacon on to the hot pan . By slide , I mean move it around on the pan before you drop it so the pan gets a coat of grease before dropping the bacon and getting it stuck on the hot pan . Let it cook at medium low heat , it will take longer but you 'll get less splatter , the bacon wo n't burn , and it wo n't dry out either , you also have a larger window of opportunity to pick up the bacon while it 's " just right " whatever that is for you .
I trim the stem and remove the outer leaves till they snap to get to the fresh inner core and steam them the night or morning before grilling so they are cold and moist . I prefer steaming because I want all of the nutrients to remain in the artichoke . I cut them in half for the grill , remove the choke and brush them with grapeseed oil where they come into contact with the grill . First , facing down grill them till they feel hot on top then ; flip them over to keep the yummy inner side tender . fill the cavity with garlic butter and ... lemon if you wish . I prefer the brown color to the lemon flavor . I cook them till the butter melts . I like mine barely smokey because artichokes take on the smoke too easily and will taste burned . You ca n't taste the flavor of the artichoke if it gets too smokey .
Let the butcher do it This is roughly the bone structure of a mammal tail : As you can see , it has very many small bones , with of course all the connective tissue . Unless you have solid knife skill , a very sharp boning knife ( with the needle-like blade ) , a protective chain mail glove , and lots of patience , I would say something like this is better left for a professional butcher . Especially if you have not done much boning , this could easily end up in an injury . For reference Boning knives : Chainmain butcher glove :
I think the toffee potatoes in the article must be Brune kartofler ; the literal translation is " brown potatoes " . They are simply small potatoes covered in caramelized sugar . The photo Ocaasi links to are potatoes gone terribly wrong . I think the photo caption is ironic . They are a traditional side dish for any christmas meal with pork roast or duck . Here is a video that shows how they are made : <URL> . The recipe is as follows : Boil small potatoes . Peel them . Distribute sugar evenly in the pan . Warm until the sugar caramelizes . Add butter in small pieces ( amount of butter and sugar are equal ) . When the butter is incorporated add the potatoes . Distribute the caramel over the potates . After 10 minutes the potatoes are done . They should now have a nice layer of caramel around them .
The first thing I have to say is kebabs and overcooked are synonymous . If you want all your meats and/or veggies to be cooked right , I would advise you to put each item on it 's own skewer so you can take them off as they are finished . As for a broiler and broiler plate functioning as a substitute for a grill , I would say that it wo n't be an exact substitute , but you will at least get the high temperature cooking and caramelization you would expect from a grill ( you will just be missing the smoke flavor ) .
Full-size octopus are tough and rubbery when cooked , so the purpose of pre-cooking is to tenderize . According to <URL> , this can be done by hanging the octopus out to dry and then beating the crap out of it , but that sounds like more trouble than simply poaching . If your octopus is already cleaned ( i.e. ink sac , stomach , and beak removed ) then all you need to do is pop it into a covered pot on high heat - after a few minutes , it will give up a lot of its liquid . Turn the heat down to low , keep covered , and let it braise for at least an hour ( or more - a restaurant I used to work in that served octopus cooked it sous vide for a good 10 hours ) . If the pot starts to run dry , add a bit of water . You can also add flavoring agents like garlic , wine , herbs , etc. to the braise if you like or just let the octopus hang out in its own juices . After braising , you could either break down your octopus right away or bring it whole to the BBQ ( somewhat diminished in size , but still impressive ! ) and cut it up there . You will want to separate the tentacles from the body and cut the head sac into strips either way . If you leave it whole , it will cook unevenly because of the varying thickness of the flesh . Cook over the hottest part of the grill to finish , just to bring the flesh up to temperature and add a little char . Skewering the tentacles with a little olive oil and salt will work just fine , but the flavor is fairly mild if you did n't add anything to the braise so a sauce or glaze is a fine idea . That same restaurant got rave reviews with a simple sauce of olive oil , garlic , paprika , and a touch of sherry vinegar .
There are a couple of fluff pieces on the web that appear to indicate the George Forman Grills remove fat from foods , due to the tiled bed allowing draining : <URL> <URL> In my opinion , both have the feel of echoing press releases from the manufacturer . Neither compares the effectiveness of the tilted bed grill to a more traditional grilling method . Consider griddling a hamburger on a flat griddle or in a flat style panini press , with or without raised grooves . Even without the grooves , as the hamburger cooks , it expresses fat and other liquid as the proteins in the meat tighten . With a fatty hamburger , this can be a considerable amount , even though it is not draining away . The issue in expressed fat is not the tilt , but rather the squeezing effect the cooked proteins have , forcing the fat out of the food . This happens regardless of the angle of the bed . Consider also that it is the contraction of the meat that is important in expressing the fat . If the fat were simply liquefied but the proteins not fully tightened , less or no fat is expressed . This can be seen in low temperature sous-vide cooking . Adhesion and capillary action would keep the fat in the meat otherwise . The logical conclusion is that the tilt of the bed is irreverent in expressing the fat , but does help clear it away and collect it . This may have some minor effect on the amount of fat adhering to the outside of the food item , but is not the major effect . You can argue whether the clearing of the fat away during cooking is a positive or negative for culinary quality , but it does n't affect the amount of fat .
Depends on the type of cabbage , but I 've had success with prepping as if I was about to boil , and then freeze on a dry cloth ; Once frozen , transfer to an air tight freezer bag , and use as fast as is practical .
This is perfectly normal for waxy potatoes ; their skins are soft and easily scraped off , especially if freshly harvested and handled roughly . I saw it just the other day with a batch of new potatoes fresh from the CSA . The potatoes were just fine . If you see this with thick-skinned , starchy potatoes it may be a sign of fungus , especially if accompanied by dried out or roughened patches . Green colors in the peel are also a problem , because they indicate exposure to light and an elevated level of the toxin solanine . Solanine can cause upset digestion and headaches if consumed in quantity . Do n't eat potatoes that are very green .
I find that brushes and even paper towels are too rough on mushrooms . I use cold running water and gentle rubbing by hand .
Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate . I 've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste , but because frankly , I like to play with fire . But lets assume that there is a taste difference , identify where the differences comes from , and how to address them : The smoke from charcoal . This is ( if you 've been using natural lump charcoal ) pretty much just wood smoke . If you 've been using briquettes you 'll also get the smoke of the filler and such , but generally this is n't desirable and we do n't want to replicate it . For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like <URL> . Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner , it should start smoking . Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals , and rising back up to flavor the food . This used to be a big advantage to charcoal , but its largely minimized by new gas grills with ' vapor bars ' . As long as your grill has one of these , you 're in luck . Otherwise , there 's not a good , safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it . Its a long bar usually running the length of burners . Lighter fluid taste . Another undesirable flavor if you 're doing a particular ( and not good IMO ) kind of charcoal grilling . Frankly , its not one you 're likely to miss . Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them . Nowadays the biggest is definitely # 1 , but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially ' porous ' . If you 're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts , I would n't bother if smoke . If you 're doing burgers - maybe/probably . If you 're doing thick steaks , thick pork chops , a whole chicken , or anything that 's going on awhile , then creating some smoke is definitely worth it . ( " Liquid smoke " definitely does n't taste like the real thing . )
Kenji Alt has devoted one of his <URL> columns to carnitas . The key to his method is he cooks the pork in a manner akin to confit , under fat in the oven . This low and slow method makes it tender and flavorful . Then , he broils it before service to crisp up .
Potatoes and the plants foliage are a feast for a lot of insects , some good some not so good , but as far as I 'm aware none that will do you any harm . As bmargulies said , do n't worry overly about it . If you 're ' really ' interested , you can take a look at this site , see if you can spot your ' badguy ' :) <URL>
The reason popcorn can be popped is that they have a water-impermeable hull , which contains the pressure of the steam created inside the kernel as it is heated , until it passes a critical point . When that happens , the steam explodes out , breaking the hull , and creating the popcorn . Some of the other puffed products are more complex , as the link you have already found shows . Potatoes do not have a water impermeable skin , and so can not be puffed in the same manner as popcorn . There is a dish -- sometimes called puffed potatoes -- where the steam inside fried potato pieces is used to puff them up , but it will not be similar in texture to puffed grain . See <URL> , for example . They will be more akin to fluffy french fries ( or chips , as they say in Britain ) . There is another dish called puffed potatoes , which are essentially a choux paste with potatoes that are baked or deep fried . They are a great dish , but are a different type of thing entirely . See <URL> from the great Jacques Pepin .
Yes , it 's oxidation , so yes , oil will stop it happening . However , broiling the potatoes straight from the oil will not yield very good results . You are much better off par-boiling them for 3 or 4 minutes , draining them , leaving them to steam and dry out for a few minutes , then coating them in oil and seasoning , and baking them for 30-45 mins . This will yield a nice , crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside result . So , if you 're boiling them you might as well put them straight in the water you 're going to use to do that .
Clean your potatoes . Peel if desired . Slice in half , lengthways . Place flat sides down on your cutting board . Cut again in half , lengthways . This would be for very large wedges . For slightly smaller , cut in thirds , lengthways , on a 60 degree angle , from the outside of the potato to the centre line where it hits the cutting board . For even smaller , slice in half again after the second half cut .

Is it okay to keep flour in the freezer ?
Yes , of course you can keep flour in the freezer . For whole wheat flour , which is susceptible to rancidity due to the fat from the whole grain being included , it is even recommended . For white flour , according to the <URL> ( emphasis added ) : For longer storage , keep white flours in the refrigerator in an airtight container . All-purpose and bread flour will keep up to two years at 40 F in your refrigerator , according to the Wheat Foods Council . They can be stored indefinitely in the freezer .
Use a meat thermometer . If you overcook the chicken , it will dry out . The standard temperature for chicken breast is 160 degrees Fahrenheit .
You can refrigerate all kinds of yeast-bread dough . Right after kneading , before the dough has had a chance to rise , oil the dough lightly , cover with plastic wrap or use a ziplock , and place in the refrigerator . As the dough cools in the refrigerator the action of the yeast will slow down until the dough has reached refrigeration temperature . At that point the yeast is still working , but at a snail 's pace . So , during the first few hours in the fridge it may require a punch down or two , as there may still be enough warmth in the dough for the yeast to show active signs of life . After the dough is completely cool , it may not need anything from you , but still check it at least every 12 hours or so - it may need another punch down . If at any point it grows to close to double it 's original size , go ahead and punch it down . Most doughs will be fine if babysat like this for up to 3 or 4 days . When you 're ready to bake , punch down the dough again ( if necessary ) , shape , and allow to rise as if it had never taken its little nap in the refrigerator . Of course this rise is going to take longer than non-refrigerated dough as it reaches room temperature , but it should be ready to bake when it looks like a non-refrigerated dough of the same type would look when it 's ready to bake . Bake as usual . I 'm sure there are exceptions to the basic rules I 've set out , but I 've never had a problem doing this with any yeast-bread dough .
It does n't go into the meat , it soaks up water and becomes a slurry . The slurry is transparent , so you do n't see it . If you fry it as it is , you wo n't prevent spraying and sticking the same way it would have been possible with a dry flour layer . If you roll it again , you will have these effects again , plus slightly more heat buffering because of the double amount of crust . The crust will be more noticeable in taste , towards schnitzel style . In general , you do n't want it to happen at all . If you miss your timing and it happens , re-roll . But the proper way to do it is to roll each piece separately , directly before dropping it in the pan . This gives you the optimal effects from the flour with minimal change in taste . If you want the benefits and taste of a thick crust , make a real schnitzel , including pounding the meat thin and making several alternating layers of egg and flour in the crust . Double dipping in flour is not a good approximation , it is a middle thing which does n't approach the good parts of either technique .
@niemiro , in your post does " go bad " mean food quality or food safety ? As for safety , you were no where near the " danger zone " either temperature-wise or time-wise . Initially safe , properly stored , frozen food that warms to -6 C ( or 22 F ) for 30 minutes will not render it unsafe to eat . In terms of food quality , freezers ( most of which these days are self-defrosting ) , go through temperature cycles regularly . The problem with this is not food safety , but the accumulation of ice crystals in foods , which degrades quality . Freezer burn is the extreme example . Of course , attention to packaging ( vacuum sealing , for example ) helps .
No , it is not a good idea at all . It will be worse , not better . What you are missing here is that cocoa powder does not dissolve at all , never , it just disperses in water ( or milk ) . So there is no reason why methods for dissolving stuff would work with cocoa powder . You will need to use a method created for colloid-producing powders like cocoa powder , which is mostly starch with fat . This is why the answers to the other question recommend the slurry method . When you are dispersing an absorptive powder like starch , you always run a risk of clumping , and the slurry is designed to work around that problem . But starch also thickens much more under heat , so if you were to not just forego the slurry , but simply drop the cocoa powder into hot water , this would be the worst choice possible , leading to instant unbreakable clumps . The slurry method would n't work with hot water either , you 'll get clumps before you have created the slurry . So , the short answer is : if you try it , it wo n't " dissolve automatically " , it will produce an ugly undrinkable mixture of clumps .
Most of the <URL> . So unopened , you should have no problem storing at room temp . Once you open the bottle , microorganism 's can get in . With a sugary liquid like Apple juice , wild yeasts will find a happy home , and ferment up a bubbly alcoholic apple beverage for you . This can take a week or two to happen , and the result is usually tasty rather than deadly . Sometimes you 'll end up with vinegar rather than an alcoholic ferment . There 's some small chance of picking up a nasty microbe in your apple juice over a three day period , but it was never enough to stop people from drinking unrefrigerated cider in the days before Pasteurization or refrigeration .
-- Hair is a protein mostly <URL> Keratin refers to a family of fibrous structural proteins . Keratin is the key of structural material making up the outer layer of human skin . It is also the key structural component of hair and nails . There 's nothing special about it as a protein , so as long as it does n't wrap around your tonsils and get stuck in your throat , or contain dyes , hairspray etc. it 's safe to eat . However , the long stringy nature of the stuff can cause problems if you eat too much of it .
The summary would be that there is a larger variety of flour ( measured by gluten content ) in the US than in Europe . SAJ14SAJ described the gluten categories of American flour , although exact figures for the category limits are hard to pin down . Peter Reinhart says cake flour has 6 to 7 percent gluten , pastry flour has 7.5 to 9.5 percent gluten , all-purpose flour has 9.5 to 11.5 percent gluten , and high-gluten flour has 13.5 to ( rare but possible ) 16 percent gluten . ( From The bread baker 's apprentice , section Types of flour ) . I measure exactly my gluten percentages and can confirm that these are good for recipes of the respective categories . These flours are all made from the same flour grade , with about 50 % of the grain removed and only the soft center used for fine bread . The difference comes from the grain type used , hard spring wheat ( high in gluten ) or soft winter wheat ( low in gluten ) . In Europe , where only soft winter wheat is grown , all the flour is in the 9-11 % range . But mills will sometimes enrich certain types of flour with added gluten , or by blending with imported flour , or by milling more of the bran ( wholer flour always has more protein ) in order to make some specialized high-gluten flours , e.g. Italian pizza flour . These flours are , aside from whole wheat flour , not widely available to home bakers . I can well imagine that a European trying to bake a European recipe with American bread flour will get bad results . But if they get the AP flour , there will be no problem in the gluten . There are many other properties of flour which differ , beyond the gluten content . But recipes are never so sensitive to them that they 'd fail . If you ca n't tell the difference between two brands of flour in your home country , then you wo n't be able to tell the difference between flour with the same gluten content from the other continent either , if both are unbleached and of the same grade ( = amount of bran included and particle size ) . All in all , this claim sounds like an unfounded emotionally-loaded attack . It is possible that the person who made it indeed failed because of gluten content , because they did n't know that they should be buying AP and not bread flour . Or that it failed for another reason and they were looking for a scapegoat , and garbled some half-remembered knowledge ( by the way , while the American wheat is genetically different , the gluten level difference was achieved centuries ago by selective breeding ) to excuse their failure .
Generally , yes , you can leave a brisket in a marinade for 48 hours or even longer . The exception would be a marinade that is very highly acidic , but not that 's not likely to be a problem with a commercial marinade .
It 's not safe to assume that food wo n't cause a blockage if there are other processes at work . I 've known multiple people who have had tree roots manage to break into their sewer pipes . ( odds are , there was a leak of water , the roots went towards it , and then opened the pipe up further ) . If the drain is already restricted , larger particles can make the situation problematic . In my case , when the state highway was installing sidewalks and curbs on my street , their contractors ended up crushing sewer lines along our side of the street . I know that at least four of us were affected , as we started having issues with blockages and basements getting flooded by sewage ... but it took a couple of weeks for other matter to start filling in the crevices until we reached a complete blockage . Even in the case where you do n't already have an obstruction in your pipes , garbage disposals are quite inefficient as a way of disposal ; you 're wasting clean water in the process , and you 're putting extra work on the sewage treatment plants . Sewage treatment plant are designed to handle a specific volume of water and waste , and in cases of periods above their capacity , they may have to divert untreated water and hope that dilution will be sufficient . This means increased nutrient loads in your waterways , which can cause algae blooms and kill fish populations . ( although the unprocessed food is n't as bad as the other stuff that 's typically in wastewater ) . Most carbon digestion is an aerobic process , with the result of the breakdown of food in the wastewater using up the oxygen in the water . Discharging this low-ox water can also lead to deadzones . You also have to look at what a treatment facilities does with their extracted solids . In some newer facilities , there is biogas extraction , and the decomposition of the materials is used to power the facility . ( sometimes , with excess capacity sold off ) . In others , they have to truck it away ... sometimes it 's spread on fields as ferilizer . Other times it goes through a ' de-watering ' process ... either pumped to the bottom of a lagoon to digest or spread out into troughs to air-dry , then hauled to a landfill for disposal . Garbage disposals are convenient , and they 're useful for the occassional scraps ... but if you can , compost your food scraps . As for normal garbage vs. garbage disposal , there too many local factors -- if you 're in a water restricted area that does n't have a biogas system or sufficient capacity at the water treatment facility , normal trash is likely your best yet . If you 're in an area with lots of water , sufficient treatment capactiy and a biogas system , garbage disposal may be better . For more reading on some of the hidden costs of garbage disposals , see : <URL> <URL> <URL>
The general prescription for water bottles is to recycle them , not reuse them . According to a <URL> : Reuse of polycarbonate plastic bottles is generally not recommended by commercial bottled water manufacturers , as it may pose a health risk from two perspectives . First , everyday wear and tear from repeated washings and reuse can lead to physical breakdown of the plastic , such as visible thinning or cracks . Bacteria can harbor in the cracks , posing a health risk . Secondly , reuse of plastic water bottles can lead to bacterial contamination unless washed regularly . If a consumer wishes to reuse a plastic water bottle , it should be washed after each use in mild detergent only and rinsed well ( 9 ) . The plastic should not be subjected to extreme , hot temperatures or harsh detergents , and should be carefully inspected for physical breakdown prior to reuse . Additionally , the narrow opening can make it difficult to clean and dry properly .
The answer to your first question is basically the answer to your second question with associated risk analysis ( i.e. , if yes , is it worth it ? ) . So to answer your second question , yes it does seem likely that most plastic containers <URL> under some conditions . Furthermore , many of the compounds that are released from plastics have not been fully tested , so the absence of specific information on their risk is not evidence of an absence of risk . Since it does appear that these plastics can release harmful compounds under certain conditions then the answer to your first question of is it safe , boils down to " are you replicating an environment where enough endocrine mimics are released to cause harm ? " Given the lack of research on all of the ways in which plastics leach and the fact that there is <URL> , I personally would conclude that the risk exceeds the inconvenience of having to find a non-plastic container to transport your tea .
I happen to have watched a TV show the other day about this very problem and they suggested making a big batch of whatever filling or fillings you are thinking of using ( presently or in the future ) and go ahead and make them all up and freeze them ready to cook . They were making several kinds of ravioli that day . They made them all up and placed them on cookie sheets to freeze and then placed them in ZipLock bags and they had a nice supply to pull out of the freezer whenever they were ready to cook them . They did n't have a problem with brittle wontons once they were filled . They used beaten egg to seal the edges so the filling would n't ooze out . You can use this same method for any shape or filling ... does n't have to be ravioli , of course .
My italian grandma does it , but says to really make sure they dry out . You can dry them out and then freeze them , if it makes you feel any less hesitant .
One kitchen I used to work in had a dry store that was basically a shed and in winter when the flour would be particularly cold we would always warm the flour before making bread . It always worked beautifully . The thing is you 're looking for the overall best temperature for your dough for the yeast to be active . So it 's no good mixing warmish water with cold flour - your dough temp will keep the yeast sluggish . That was our theory anyway .
No more than 72 hours , maximum . You do n't know how long they 've been out of the water . I would freeze or cook them no later than tomorrow evening .
Yes , it 's safe . It 's not acidic , and thus wo n't corrode the foil or cause it to leach in . Personally , my favorite was to store celery is in the crisper , in a vented tupperware container , lightly moistened . This extends lifetime somewhat .
Chickpea flour ( <URL> , besan ) is very useful in Indian cookery . The most common use in the West is probably for making bhajis and pakora . The most popular of which are <URL> , very popular in the UK . They are essentially an spiced onion fritter , shaped in either discs or balls . Any vegetables can be used to make pakora ( which is essentially the same thing ) or bhajis , but spinach ( sag pakora ) , aubergine ( us eggplant , brinjal bhaji ) , potato ( aloo pakora ) or cauliflower ( gobi pakora ) are the most common , sometimes in combination . Gram flour is also used for making <URL> ( also papad , papadum , a crisp fried pancake , served as an accompaniment to meals with chutney . One of the more commonly seen uses is in chevda ( sometimes chivda ) , or as we call it in the UK usually <URL> ( I believe it is called Punjabi Mix in the US ) . A mixture of dried savoury snacks , coated in spice . One of the primary ingredients is sev , a dried noodle made from gram flour . Mixtures predominantly composed of sev are called sev mamra . There are also a number of Indian sweets made with besan . <URL> ( barfi is something akin to fudge , made with condensed milk ) : <URL> ( little sweet balls ) : NB . You can use it as an egg substitute in vegan cookery , but soya flour works better for the same purpose and , in my opinion , has less associated flavour .
Frozen pistachio nuts should be good for about one year ; as nuts ( roasted or not roasted ) are low in water , mostly the benefit of freezing is to protect the fat content from rancidity . You will want to make sure they are in an airtight container . For convenience , I would shell them first , so you can use them directly when you take them out , and to save space in your freezer . Of course , if you make them into ice cream , then you are unlikely to have any issues with them lasting very long .

What are the four cheeses generally used in " four-cheese " pizzas ?
They all seem to use different cheeses depending on the brand . The most consistent cheese is definitely mozzarella , which makes sense as it 's the default cheese on most pizzas . Second to that is some sort of hard grating cheese like Parmesan or Asiago ... which also makes sense as it 's a traditional pizza condiment . Other Italian cheeses also seem popular like fontina and provolone But non-Italian cheeses like cheddar certainly show up . Below are some examples . I do n't recommend any of these products , they just came up in web searches and specifically describe which four cheeses they use . Amy 's uses : Fontina , provolone , Parmesan , mozzarella : <URL> Frontera uses : Mozzarella , white cheddar , smoked provolone , asiago . <URL> California Pizza Kitchen uses : Mozzarella ( apparently more than one kind ) , fontina , gouda <URL> Lean Cuisine uses : low fat mozzarella , Parmesan , asiago , romano <URL>
You ca n't add too much chocolate into a cake , as you 'll end up adding too much fat , which will change how the cake sets up . They likely wanted more chocolate flavor than what they felt they could get from chocolate alone , and so opted to add cocoa powder as well .
There are substitutes , but eggs have very important effects on the texture of dough and are therefore hard to substitute . You will need to experiment a great deal until you hit on the correct texture , because you 'll need to tweak all other ingredients and maybe include new ones , e.g. substitute part of the butter and use cream instead to account for moisture loss from egg substitutes . Mien 's link already includes some substitute ideas , like applesauce and commercial imitations . I ca n't give you more suggestions , because I always put eggs in my cakes ;) . But when tweaking , keep following in mind : Egg whites provide a resilient mesh which traps small air bubbles , so they make a cake more airy . You may need to adjust the baking powder upwards a bit . If it is a soda recipe , you 'll need to raise the acidity too . But the whole effect ca n't be approximated just with baking powder , because its bubbles are too big . For that , you need better emulsification ( covered below ) . Egg whites also have a binding quality . This should n't need compensation in a cake , as you need a dough without too much binding ( as opposed to bread ) , but if your cake starts falling apart , consider using a flour with higher gluten content ( all purpose flour instead of cake flour ) . Gluten binds too . If , on the other hand , your cake is too bread-like , then you may need less binding . The egg yolks are a source of fat , which prevents the dough gluten from forming a strong mesh by covering the particles . You will miss this with egg substitutes , especially if they are pectin-based ( like applesauce ) because pectin enhances binding . Use the lower gluten dough ( it it does n't cause the cake to fall apart ) or add more fat . Then there is the importance of emulsifiers . Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lecithin in the kitchen . An emulsifier helps your wet ingredients bind in an emulsion , instead of staying in two separate phases with the watery phase soaking the flour through and the fatty phase making the whole thing greasy . It also helps the trapping of very tiny air bubbles in the wet part of the dough ( this is what happens when you beat eggs with sugar on high speed until the colour lightens ) which provides a very fine leavening . Maybe commercial egg imitates contain emulsifiers - check the list - but if they do n't , you must buy pure lecithin . It is usually soy derived , but maybe you need to check with the manufacturer that your brand is suitable for vegetarians . Also , consider including cream , the fat in it is already emulsified in water , unlike butter ( which is water emulsified in fat ) . You must calculate precisely and tweak other ingredients to ensure that the total amount of fat and moisture do n't change ( except if you are compensating for the changes caused by the egg substitute ) . If it is a chocolate cake , consider reducing the fat and the flour and adding some cocoa powder ( the regular-fat variety ) . Cocoa has binding and thickening properties , and will help with the more even fat distribution . Melted chocolate tastes good in cakes , but makes them very dense , so do n't use it . The easiest way would be to find a recipe published by someone who has already done all the work . But just from paging through a cookbook , you ca n't tell if they did it right , or just slapped a spoon of applesauce instead of an egg and called it a vegan cake . Edit : I just had an idea when I saw Mien 's gelatine question and yours together in the list . I have n't heard of anybody using it , and do n't know if it will work , but it does , it will be great . So try it . I already said that using cream would help . As you need a foam full of very tiny bubbles for the perfect leavening , you could try whipped cream instead of whipped eggs . The trouble is that the air will get out of the batter very quickly while and after folding the cream . So you 'll need to stabilize it . Gelatine in unusually small quantities will make for a very nice experiment , but obviously not one you 'll want to do . But plant-derived gelling agents could help . Carrageenan is commonly used with dairy products , and you can buy it online . So try folding stabilized whipped cream into the batter .
White fish are , as a rule , more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish . Add farm-raised to that equation and you have the makings for a very bland meal , which is why you almost always see farm-raised white-fleshed fish served with heavy herb treatments and powerful sauces , or ( in cod 's case ) fry batter . Tilapia and cod are two of the most common farm-raised fish on the market , so I 'm leaning heavily on my suspicion that you 're trying to make sushi out of the farm-raised varieties and not wild game . If it 's white fish you desire for sushi , talk to your fishmonger . Tell him what you 're doing and ask for his recommendation . He 'll direct you toward game fish that that are either very new and very fresh or that of the flash-frozen variety .
In the classic recipe the onions are chopped , personally , I like mine very thinly sliced . The cheese typically used is the French Comté but a good substitute is Swiss gruyère or even Swiss Emmenthal .
Sumac is commonly used a tart flavoring element in the eastern Mediterranen region . Historians believe that it was the common sour element in cooking for that area prior to domestication of lemons . It is a characteristic seasoning element in Fatoush , a Syrian bread salad . It 's not usually available in the mainstream spice section of most grocery stores . The best place to locate it is in mid-eastern markets , delis , upscale stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca or online through P <URL> or the <URL> .

Ah , you missed the obvious : pumpkin ! This is biologically a fruit , actually , as is the zucchini . Pumpkin loves same spices as carrot . Maybe even rum or butterscotch too . Now , beetroot is a veg and colors cakes delectably ; perhaps why it was originally added when going stingy on the cocoa . How about parsnip next ? Sweet and nutty , I think pistachios would complement it well in a recipe borrowed from zucchini bread . more veg here : <URL> p.s. if you have n't guessed Rabarber is rhubarb
If you boiled the eggs but left them in the pot of water , you may be in luck . The shell should keep the rotten egg safe from cracking and exposing the apartment to the truly rancid smell of spoilt eggs , assuming they have n't cracked during boiling . You will know a spoiled egg when you crack open the shell . Whether raw or cooked , a spoiled egg will have an unpleasant odor . No question about it : throw it out . - <URL> What you will probably find when you get home are unmolested eggs in a stagnant pot of water . Throw the eggs out if they have n't cracked . They WILL be spoilt . <URL> describes why . <URL> ( similar information can be found from other food agencies ) : Why do hard-cooked eggs spoil faster than fresh eggs ? When shell eggs are hard cooked , the protective coating is washed away , leaving bare the pores in the shell for bacteria to enter and contaminate it . Hard-cooked eggs should be refrigerated within 2 hours of cooking and used within a week . Simply put , you 're damaging the shell , and that expedites spoilage . If you 're unlucky and the eggs did crack ... well , the water might absorb some of the scent , but after four weeks , you 're still likely going to have some odor . Throw the eggs out , pour the water out , throughly clean the pot , and try to air your apartment out as best you can .
I do n't see anything in the question that is peculiar to pizza dough . Anything I answer will apply to any kind of yeast-risen , glutenous dough . The goal with any such dough is a well hydrated protein matrix that has been arranged in sheets that will trap the gas produced by yeast . If the yeast is dead it wo n't be able to produce gas and your bread will be somewhere between a cracker and shoe leather - depending on how thick you roll it out . Using too little yeast is not the same as dead yeast . If you use too little yeast ( within reason ) they will take a long time to reproduce , eat , and blow up your stretchy proteins . They will be producing a lot of flavor during this period . This will generally taste good . If you use too much yeast ( within reason ) the yeast will act very quickly . This is nice for speed but it will result in a much less developed flavor . Neither is a problem so you can choose for yourself . Using too little water will result in not enough gluten development and a dry , or crumbly dough . The dough wo n't hold gases and there will also not be enough steam when baking so the dough will be more dense . Too much water and you have a batter that ca n't be worked with . Over working a dough is n't so much of a concern . It is possible to over knead but it is hard to do . See : <URL> . Under working the dough will result in less gluten development and very similar results as using too little water - basically you will have unleavened biscuit dough . The exception is if you are following a " no-knead " recipe . In this case the dough is allowed to rest for days which lets the protein sheets form on their own . Resting the dough is necessary both to relax the protein mesh that you created as well as to allow the yeast a chance to blow it up with some CO2 . Not long enough and you wo n't be able to roll out the dough because it will be too tight and it wo n't be risen because the yeast have n't eaten . Too long and the bubbles will coalesce into large open cavities . A good rule of thumb is " doubled in volume " . Usually about an hour but this is highly dependent on how much yeast you use , how much water , and the ambient temperature . The end result is that you do n't need to worry about most of these things . The biggest mistakes I see people make is making a dough too dry or simply not kneading enough . It is easier to add flour than water so put in less than the full amount of flour , knead for a while , if the dough stays too sticky then add a bit more flour and knead in . As answers to other questions have said - you want a dough that is " smooth and elastic " it is n't sticky and looks homogeneous . After just a couple tries you will get a feel for how wet that means and you 'll be an expert . For pizza dough in particular - almost as important as the dough construction is the baking temperature . You want to cook it as hot as you can . 500F in an oven or on a grill . It will only take 5-10 minutes . The fast hot cooking will do a lot for your crust texture . It makes the difference between a crispy , chewy pizza crust and a soft , bready ( and soggy under the toppings ) crust .
Potatoes are very popular in some parts of Mexico . When I lived in Guadalajara , potato tacos were common , usually deep-fried . Diced ( and possibly pre-cooked ) potatoes with some seasoning added to a soft taco shell , then the entire thing fried together until crispy . After frying , such tacos ( whether with potatoes or other filling ) were cracked open to add lettuce or salsa or whatever other toppings/fillings might be desired , or salsa might be poured over the top , and eaten with a fork . One of my favorite local dishes was gorditas , which are basically a double-thick tortilla split at the middle ( like pita bread ) and stuffed with a filling of choice , and grilled . Diced and cooked potatoes were a common choice , often with beans or cheese as well . Potatoes are also common in Mexico prepared much the same as they are in the U.S. : Baked , or as french fries , or the ever-popular potato chip . Always with a Mexican flair , usually in the form of extra spicy seasoning or sauces added . I also had a " Breakfast taco " in Austin , Texas a couple months ago , which had potatoes . So there is some tex-mex food with potatoes , but I think this is probably not as common as it is in true Mexican cuisine . But then , Tex-Mex has never been a very close substitute for true Mexican food :) My best guess as for why potatoes are not common in Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in the U.S. is that potatoes are not considered an exotic/exciting enough food/flavor to be considered " special " by most people who frequent such places .
Historically , these grades were established before white cane sugar became inexpensive and common , so the " best " maple syrup was the least strong , or Grade A . Now we seek out that maple flavor on corn flapjacks or waffles , so the " best " maple syrup is Grade B. I find that the best pancakes are made with 2/3 cornmeal to 1/3 whole wheat or buckwheat flour ( or any wheat flour , really ) rather than just pancake mix . The cornmeal makes them crisp . And Grade B maple syrup , of course .
What I look for in a good mixer are : A comfortable grip ( I 'm sure we 've all have painful wrists after whisking up eggs whites or similar ) Well made , sturdy parts . ( some whisks are strong others are just thin wire . ) Variable speed control The Watt rating . To answer your No. 2 question , watts are important . They measure how much power the machine uses . Higher watts will mean the machine does more of the work and your wrist does less of the work . The cheapest machines on the market are only good for whipping light foods like cream and mayonnaise . If you plan on mixing up heavy fruit cakes or bread doughs , you should choose a higher wattage machine . Paying for a good quality machine , if you can afford it , will save you money in the end . My mother has had the same hand mixer for over 35 years . She paid for a good one and it lasted . I however , like you , opted for a low price machine because I was on a budget , I am now on my third and this time I bought a sturdier model and I am much more satisfied with it . If I 'd bought the better machine at first , I 'd have saved myself # 50 or so over the time .
Yes , it differs by cheese . As a very general and vague rule , the softer the cheese , the less time it will last . Large chunks may last longer than small or grated pieces . A ripe Camembert is at its peak for hours . A nice chunk of Parmesan may last for weeks . <URL> summarizes as follows : Fresh cheese : a few days to 2 weeks Soft cheese : 1 week Semi-soft cheese : 2 to 3 weeks Firm cheese : 5 weeks Hard cheese : 10 months Note : my opinion on the above is that the firm and hard times are a little long for opened cheese . <URL> is more conservative , suggesting only up to a couple of months for opened hard cheeses . You can also freeze cheese with minimal loss of quality , which will substantially increase its shelf life .
Cream sherry is very sweet - likely too sweet for most recipes that do n't explicitly mention it . If a recipe simply calls for " sherry " , it usually means dry sherry , as that 's the most common kind of available . In fact , I do n't think I 've ever even seen " very dry " around here . So I would definitely stick with the dry . As for brand , I believe that sherry is the brand ( somebody correct me if I 'm wrong ) . If you see several different bottles all labeled sherry , I do n't think it matters too much which one you pick - at least if you 're using it for cooking and not drinking . P.S. . If you 're using this as a substitute for rice wine , the commonly-accepted substitute is indeed dry sherry .
OK , this is dangerously close to a recipe request , but far enough away that I feel OK to answer . Use the rule of two . 2 cups of sugar 2 two oranges 2 limes 2 lemons Juice and zest the whole fruit . Strain and and fill to 1 gallon with water . Filter if you want it to be clear . Carbonate using whatever technique you normally use whether that 's a Cornelius keg or soda stream .
When I go to the Korean supermarkets in LA , I usually see half an aisle just dedicated to 고추가루 in all kinds of forms ( mild to spicy , fine to coarse grind ) and colors . I do n't know that there 's any specific pepper than it is all about how sweet and mildly spicy 고추가루 is supposed to be . You could start from there to make your own by sun drying and crushing whatever peppers are available to you . If you are looking for a substitute that you can buy at a western store , try crushed red pepper flakes ( the kind you see in the shakers at pizza places ) . You 're going to be adjusting for taste/spiciness anyway , so not much of a dealbreaker .
If we 're going to define " cheese dip " as " some substance made from cheese for the purpose of dipping other food in " - which seems like the only rational definition given no other context - then I 'd have to pinpoint its origin as being fondue . <URL> , the earliest known recipe for fondue comes from the Swiss cookbook , <URL> , first published in 1699 . That predates the Arkansas claim of 1935 by at least a few centuries , if we assume that Wikipedia does indeed list the earliest source . There 's also <URL> which was supposedly brought to Mexico by the Mennonites , which would place its origin in Mexico sometime in the 1920s - assuming that the Mennonites themselves did not simply adapt the recipe from something known even earlier . I 'd have to say that the Arkansas tourism board seems to be trying to pull a fast one on us , laying claim to this " invention " . Maybe they 're defining cheese dip as the specific kind of cheese dip they came up with , which would of course be a tautology .
<URL> ( a spice co. ) makes theirs from : salt , black pepper , paprika , Turkish oregano , cayenne pepper , garlic , celery , Mexican oregano , basil , nutmeg , cumin , marjoram , thyme and rosemary . No numbers are given , and you probably do n't need two kinds of oregano , but I 've made it before with a similar list , and it is generally insensitive to precise ratios . I 'd start with 2x black pepper , paprika , oregano , cayenne , garlic , 1x basil , cumin , marjoram 1/2x nutmeg , thyme , rosemary bulk up with salt ( store-bought stuff is mostly salt ) , and experiment from there . You can probably find more on google . Add hotter things or anything you find interesting :)
If cooled and stored properly ( minimize air space in the container ) , most soups will should last in the refrigerator up to 5 days . Do you really want to be eating the same soup that long ? I would suggest dividing your soups into smaller sized containers and freezing it so you have a wide selection available at any given time . Depending on the ingredients most soups can be succesfully frozen for long term storage . Dairy based items are more likely to curdle/separate after thawing so you 'd be better to add the cream/milk when you 're reheating it . Chunks of potato or pasta are likely to break up a bit and have a more mealy consistency so it would also be better to leave the potato out and add to it and cook when reheating .

Why are there no recipes combining both yeast and baking powder ?
The existing answers already explain why yeast and baking powder wo n't work together . But even if they did , you would n't have a reason to use them . You seem to think that fluffiness depends on the amount of gas produced by the leaveners . In fact , it depends on both the gas and the ability of the dough to trap that gas . If you produce too much gas ( no matter whether through yeast or through baking powder ) , then the fluffiness will be less than when using the optimal amount of leavener . This happens because your dough can not hold the gas and the bubbles break , resulting in the dough deflating like a punctured tire . So even if combining two leaveners would have resulted in more " blowing big " action ( which it does n't , see the other answers ) , you would not end up with a fluffier end product . If you want fluffy muffins , you have to use a recipe and a technique which is best capable of retaining the gas produced by the baking powder . The amount of gas production is not a bottleneck .
The pretzel originates in Germany , where it is called Laugenbrezel . It was originally prepared in a alkali solution , which is where the " Laugen " part of the word comes from ; typically , lye was used , but baking soda gets you most of the way there without a trip to the pharmacy ( a Mexican or Asian market may do the trick if you want culinary lye ) . The alkali solution is what causes the crust to brown so deeply , and it 's most of the difference between a pretzel and a bagel . A bagel would typically be boiled in a malted sugar solution instead . The flavor is also affected , but I do n't know how to describe the difference ; there 's a very pronounced aroma difference if you skip this step . To me , you end up with nothing more than a pretty breadstick unless the dough gets that alkali bath . If you do use culinary lye , use gloves and do n't rush anything . Traditional Laugen are n't boiled , so you just need a cool 3 % lye solution ; no boiling step . In Germany , the pretzel shape is n't the only option for Laugen . Little rolls calls Laugenbrötchen and longer , roughly baguette-width sticks called Laugenstangen are also popular . On my most recent trip last year , the Laugenstangen were frequently sold in the form of sandwiches , though I do n't remember seeing many of those when I was first living there in the mid-90s . ETA : Having done this a few more times since originally posting , I 'd also add that the utensils you use in lye-based pretzels need to be wood , glass or plastic . Eye protection is important too . Metal will likely corrode or oxidize when it contacts food put in contact with lye , even if it 's after the wash . I 'd recommend setting the washed pretzels on a wooden surface after dipping if you want to minimize damage/discoloration on your baking sheet .
There are two parts to this question , the stated part , and the unstated " are you really frying an egg if there is no oil ? " For the first part , most manufacturers of non-stick pans claim that their product makes oil unnecessary , and generally I 've found that to be true . A little oil helps , but " necessary " might be a stretch . To maximize your non-stickyness of a non-stick pan , you should always preheat the pan before adding the food , at least to 250F or so . Preheating causes the teflon to expand a bit , closing up pores and micro-scratches in the surface . It is also common for oils from the past to form a polymerized layer on top of the teflon , making the pan more sticky . This is actually worse when you use aerosol spray oils , because the tiny droplets hit the pan and very quickly polymerize to form a slightly sticky layer . This layer is similar to the one you intentionally create when seasoning a cast iron pan , but in this case it is not helpful . All-Clad recommends periodically cleaning teflon pans with a light scrub of baking soda and water to remove that coating of oil . It should bring back the maximum slippery of your teflon . When cooking protein-rich foods , you can also minimize sticking by letting the food cook a bit before attempting to move it . The loose , floppy denatured proteins in an egg are extremely sticky , but when they coagulate ( set ) from cooking , they become less sticky . It may seem impossibly sticky at first , but may release on it 's own after a minute of cooking . As to the second , unstated part , oil provides flavor , and is also a heat-transfer vehicle . When the food is on the pan , if you looked at it with a microscope only a small portion of the food is actually in contact with the pan . Those areas will get heated more , and other areas will get heated less . A little oil fills those gaps , causing more even thermal contact , which allows fried food to fry , rather than just get burned in some areas . It is really a matter of taste whether the flavor of the oil and the way that it changes the texture of the food is appealing to your boyfriend . I would n't like it without any oil , but if he does , well , so be it . If he does n't really like the taste , but is concerned about health , I 'd suggest using a little olive oil - it has no cholesterol , is low in saturated fats , and has a good flavor . Different than butter , but still very enjoyable .
If you pinch off the basil flowers as they start to grow , the plant will produce more leaves . ( Yes , this is a horticultural answer , but it will help you make more yummy dishes with the leaves . )
<URL> seeds in rye bread is - in some parts of the world - a tradition . Generally speaking , certain flavour profiles are traditional in different cuisines , not ubiquitous ( see your baguette counter example ) , for many types of food . For rye bread , taking European areas into account where there is a " rye bread tradition " , Northern Europe ( Scandinavia , Northern Germany ) uses caraway , Central Europe is undecided and Southern Tyrol ( the German-speaking parts of Italy ) would use <URL> instead , other regional cuisines leave their rye breads plain . The reason why particularly rye breads tend to be " spiced " - as opposed to wheat-dominant breads - is that rye breads can be harder to digest and needs a sourdough step to be baked into proper bread . And seeds like caraway , <URL> or the blue fenugreek mentioned above have traditionally been used to aid digestion . If you are buying rye bread in other parts of the world , especially the US , the predominant group of immigrants from Europe may as well have brought their specific " rye bread flavour profile " with them .
Salt is perhaps the most basic and effective flavour enhancer , and so it 's fairly obvious why we have it on our dinner tables . The popularity of pepper is down to the Romans , who were crazy about it . Thanks to the longevity of the Roman Empire , pepper was imported for hundreds of years , helping to establish it as the most popular spice , and keeping the price high . Bill Bryson reports in At Home that : When the Goths threatened to sack Rome in 408 , the Romans bought them off with three thousand pounds of pepper .
Yes . You can also substitute 1 cup molasses with 3/4 cup packed brown sugar + 1/4 water , or 1 cup pure maple syrup , or 1 cup dark corn syrup .
Good question @mfg . I hope I can help a little bit . The basics behind the egg wash are to provide for a couple different thing . These being shine , crispness , and color . Shine The shine is primarily provided by the egg yolk . The higher concentration of yolk the more shine . Crispness This come from the egg whites . The whites make things a little crispy and sometimes can crackle a little bit ( mainly when usually by themselves ) . Color This comes from the fat and protein . Leaving the yoke in along with the shine will add color . You can add water to lighten the color a bit . I find that using the white also dilutes the color a bit but not as much ( but the white also makes it crisp ) . Add cream or milk to get it a little bit darker . Salt I often find people adding salt to an egg wash . I does provide some flavor to the crust , but I have noticed that for some reason ( when using a whole egg ) it does allow it to get a little darker than it would normally . Sugar Like salt it adds flavor ( sweetness ) to the crust . And it will also add some color . Especially if baking at a higher temp and using a raw or brown type sugar . Alcohol I have seen the use of alcohol quite a number of times . From the results I have seen it behaves like water . Although not the the same degree . My guess is that it has to do with how fast the alcohol evaporates . As far as flavor , I ca n't say that it added much at the levels used . I did once definitely get a hint of a bourbon being used in the wash on a pretty plain white loaf . But they did mix in quite a good amount of bourbon to just an egg yolk . That is all I have really used myself or seen . I am sure that you can use other liquids although I do n't know what vinegar would do . Just keep in mind if they are high in fat , protein , or sugar they will add color . Otherwise they will lighten the color . I have also seen melted butter just used as a wash . It adds a nice color and buttery flavor . I have n't seen it added to egg wash but I would assume you could add to egg yolk to get a shine and probably darker color than cream/milk . Another important thing to remember is to beat your wash well when using for a bread coating . Unlike if your just using the was was to seal say a ravioli . If your egg was is spotty not one nice fully incorporated mixture your crust can also be spotty .
Baking powder , especially if too great a quantity is used , adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good . Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly does n't do anything to enhance the flavor . Many baked goods traditionally do n't use a chemical leavener at all , but instead rely on technique . Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created . Yeast , on the other hand , creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread . Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes ( <URL> , for example , although many " knock off " recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness ) . Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network ( usually something you absolutely do n't want in a quick bread or quick cake ) -- you do n't get a crumb with big , airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid . Also , in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge . The shelf life is not so different . If yeast scares you , you may want to check out some of the proponents of the <URL> technique . For a lot more information on this subject , there is a recent publication that covers all sorts of <URL> .
The baking powder undergoes a chemical reaction which produces small gas bubbles in the batter . The bubbles break up the batter coating ( sort of like the geometry inside a sponge ) so you wind up with a mass of little holes each surrounded by a thin layer of bready material , and it all fries up airy , light and crispy ; instead of one thick , dense , hard shell of cooked paste around your cauliflower bits .
I 'd say yes , honey is a bit healthier than sugar , but this really depends on the type of sugar or honey . Raw honey is better than pasteurized honey . Highly refined sugar is less healthy than some less refined sugar . Assuming you are talking about table sugar and raw honey , in general : Sugar is sucrose . You need some enzymes to split it into fructose and glucose , your body has to make these enzymes and can digest those mono-sacharides . When you eat honey , there is no need for such body-made enzymes , because the fructose and glucose are n't combined , but they appear there as mono-sacharides . So honey is less demanding for your body . Honey is better for your blood-glucose level ( this level raises more if you eat sugar than if you eat the same amount of honey ) . Honey contains some vitamins and minerals , which sugar lacks . As a consequence of all these points : If you use sugar , you have a higher risk of high cholesterol and obesity than if you use honey . I did n't mention anything about the taste , since that is not health-related . Source and more info : <URL>
From what I can find , it contains ' dough relaxers ' so you can shape the dough without it springing back . It also claims you do n't need to let it rise , but it then tells you to bake your pizza for 30 minutes ! So it essentially rises in the oven . Compare this to ' proper ' dough which you let rise for a couple of hours , pull into shape and then bake in a screaming hot oven for 5 minutes tops . It strikes me that using pizza yeast is ' pizza for dummies ' ; claiming ' it stops it rising too much ' is nonsense because if the amount of yeast is correct in your recipe you control the rise anyway . So it depends on whether you like doing things easy or doing things right . You can bet your pepperoni slices they do n't use ' pizza yeast ' in Naples . Personally I cheat just a little and use dried fast-action yeast as it has a longer shelf-life and you do n't fuss around proving it , and my pizzas come out great .
The existing answers already explain why yeast and baking powder wo n't work together . But even if they did , you would n't have a reason to use them . You seem to think that fluffiness depends on the amount of gas produced by the leaveners . In fact , it depends on both the gas and the ability of the dough to trap that gas . If you produce too much gas ( no matter whether through yeast or through baking powder ) , then the fluffiness will be less than when using the optimal amount of leavener . This happens because your dough can not hold the gas and the bubbles break , resulting in the dough deflating like a punctured tire . So even if combining two leaveners would have resulted in more " blowing big " action ( which it does n't , see the other answers ) , you would not end up with a fluffier end product . If you want fluffy muffins , you have to use a recipe and a technique which is best capable of retaining the gas produced by the baking powder . The amount of gas production is not a bottleneck .
Convenience : It 's more convenient and easier to monitor the temperature inside the home . The oven has a thermostat , where the grill temperature needs to be monitored and adjusted manually . No smoke left : Is could be assumed that the smoke has been exhausted . Too much smoke : The smoke flavor could become too strong if finished on the grill .
Basically , when recipies call for softened butter , they use the creaming method ; the sugar and butter are mixed together in such a way that the sugar cuts little air bubbles into the butter . These little bubbles can add some extra puff to the cookies . If you melt the butter first , not only do you not have those air bubbles , but there 's water in butter , so you 'll end up getting some gluten development when you mix in the flour and make a chewy cookie ... but more importatly , without the fat being ( near ) solid , the cookie will slump a lot more , and spread out before it cooks ( assuming you have n't otherwise adjusted the recipe to compensate ) . There are cookie recipes that call for melted butter ; <URL> ; the " chewy " cookie uses melted butter .
1 . Chemical leaveners There are two " oldfashioned " chemical leaveners , both still used today in traditional German and Scandinavian gingerbread recipes : Potassium carbonate ( potash or pearl ash ) and Ammonium bicarbonate ( salt of heartshorn ) They do have their own quirks and pitfalls , but if nothing else is available ... If you can get baking soda , mix with cream of tartar to make baking powder . If your store does not stock it , you pharmacy most likely will carry " sodium hydrogen carbonate " ( which is another name for baking soda ) either as treatment for heartburn , it 's an antacid ( because it reacts with acid , neutralzing it and making these nice bubbles , as we know from baking ... ) or as topical treatment for allergic reactions of the skin ( poison ivy and others ) . 2 . Biological leaveners This boils down to Saccharomyces cerevisiae , aka . baker 's yeast or brewer 's yeast . Of course you get very different results and have to follow a different procedure . But here are some recipes where they are used somewhat interchangeably , e.g. some types of pancakes or waffles and , obviously , bread ( vs. sodabread ) . The charming thing about yeast is , that if your are really , really far from a store , you can still get your hands on yeast : Start a sourdough using the yeasts naturally occuring on fruits or the air around you . Probably not the kind of substitution you had in mind , though . 3 . No leaveners With good technique , you can incorporate a lot of air ( because that 's what all leaveners are supposed to do ) in your baking goods by whipping your eggs well . There are various approaches : You can whip the whole eggs . Whip the yolks ( with hot water or over a water bath to stabilize them ) to Zabaione-like consistency . Whip the whites and fold into your batter . You will want to bake these batters right away before the bubbles get a chance to burst . The air will expand during baking and the hardening egg/flour-mixture will trap them in the baked goods . Contrary to many recipes out there there is no real need to bake a pound cake or even sponge cake with baking powder if it 's done right . Other recipes without leavener ( or rather with the egg trapping steam generated by a rather high water content ) are the members of the popover family ( Yorkshire pudding in the UK , Pfitzauf in Swabia , some dutch pancakes ) and pâté a choux . Puff pastry relies on thin layers of butter separating the layers of floury dough and trapping steam between them .
The author of this recipe probably happens to keep in his pantry ( or more professionally speaking , dry store ) just those two types of flour , and so has specified a mix to get a mid-level flour with moderate protein levels , tailored to his preferences . Given that the author is Jacques Torres , this is almost certainly a scaled down translation of a professional recipe , where that is not an uncommon practice ( the very odd measurements support the idea of scaling and rounding ; the weird flour measurements are probably the closest volume equivalent to a weight based scaled recipe ) . Two commercial varieties ( all purpose , and the less common pastry flour ) also have protein levels in between cake flour and bread flour , with pastry flour being somewhere between cake flour and all purpose , typically . If you happen to have all purpose ( and you almost certainly do ) I would suggest using it in the recipe for the total of both specialty flours . Very few cookie recipes are so fussy that it will actually matter very much .
It 's not quite as effective as xanthan gum but I find arrowroot flour works wonders . You can also try locust bean gum or psyllium husk ( soak it in water before mixing so that it can dissolve ) Those are more starchey than the gums and are meant to be mixed with amaranth , rice , quinoa , or other more coarse flours it gives you that same " slimey " start that hold the bubbles as the bread cooks . That 's generally gone by the time it 's cooked . When you 're using guar gum , try to keep the quantity down to about 1 % by weight of the dry ingredients . Also give it time to fully hydrate before adding the rest of the ingredients . I normally mix mine in dry with the flour and then add milk or water to get things wet and then leave it for a couple minutes before continuing . If the gum ( or even the arrowroot flour ) is properly hydrated it will be more effective in baking . Plus you can use less liquid overall which is good because it 's easy to overdo the liquid in GF bread .
Meringue powder is a pasteurized egg product - <URL> . It is used to stiffen recipes and I think there are two main reasons for using it ( as opposed to egg whites ) : 1 ) Reduced risk of salmonella 2 ) Less time/labour/effort used - you do n't have to beat the egg whites for a long time to stiffen them I would guess as well that it would have more consistent results . When making meringues with egg whites you have to be careful not to get any yolk or other fat into the mixture or it wo n't stiffen properly . There is no real risk of this with meringue powder .
In order to store yeast for that period of time it has to be make inactive , and the process to do that yourself is challenging , time consuming , and you 'd need specialist equipment . It would be prohibitive in both time and cost , far above just buying yeast . You can of course make a starter by mixing equal amounts of flour and water plus some yeast , this will keep the yeast alive by feeding it , and you can keep it alive indefinitely by feeding it once per week . You add some of the starter to your bread and it supplies active yeast .

Is there evidence that adding salt to water prior to boiling can damage a stainless steel pan ?
There is empirical support for the effect of temperature on pitting corrosion , although from what little I 'm able to understand of the very complicated metallurgy , the common explanation given is far too simplistic and the actual behaviour is not nearly as clear-cut as " colder = more salt crystals = more pitting " , but rather due to something called transpassive dissolution ( searching for this will give you lots of scholarly results on stainless steel corrosion ) . I 'll get straight to the point by referencing this <URL> from the Metals Handbook ( textbook ) which has the following convenient graph : More pitting happens at lower temperatures . As the link explains : At low temperatures , extremely high breakdown potentials are observed , corresponding to transpassive dissolution , not localized corrosion . Just above the critical pitting temperature ( CPT ) , pitting corrosion occurs at a potential that is far below the transpassive breakdown potential . But you can see from the graph that that 's not the whole story , either . Excluding what happens at very high temperatures ( above the CPT ) , the impact of temperature looks to be maybe 20-30 % , but there are much more significant variations based on other factors , the most notable kitchen-applicable examples being the material ( described as the <URL> - Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number ) , surface condition ( grit ) , and inhibitor elements in the solution ( traces of which may or may not be found in tap water ) . While this does certainly support the conclusion , it 's also obvious , if you read the explanation of pitting or look at the lovely reaction diagram on page 2 of the textbook link , that it has literally nothing to do with undissolved salt . In fact , pitting is caused by the Cl - ions specifically , and so can only happen after it is dissolved in the water . If you just poured salt on a dry pan in a dry environment , it should n't corrode . Moreover , pitting is a <URL> - it 's quite literally random even when you know all the other parameters , so while one can certainly average it out over many experiments and thus quantify the correlation with temperature , that ends up having little meaning in a kitchen setting because you are cooking with one pan/pot and the random variation seems to be a lot more profound than the effect of the temperature variable . Anyway , in case anyone was thinking that it sounds pretty simple so far - it 's not . The experiment that produced the graph above was performed under one set of conditions - using just salt , water , and stainless steel . While that 's certainly comparable to cooking , it 's interesting to see what <URL> ( Inﬂuence of the electrolyte composition and temperature on the transpassive dissolution of austenitic stainless steels in simulated bleaching solutions - PDF warning ) says about oxalic acid : The addition of oxalic acid has accordingly a much bigger impact on the transpassive corrosion rate at 70 ° C than at room temperature [ ... ] In the solutions containing organic additives at 70 ° C , transpassive oxidation starts at significantly lower potentials than at room temperature . In case you 're not familiar with oxalic acid - or wondering why you should care - it 's the primary ingredient in <URL> , which many " premium " stainless steel cookware brands such as All Clad recommend using to clean your cookware - and nearly every cleaning guide recommends warm , but not hot , water . Admittedly , I just looked at the label and BKF does n't specify a temperature , so the warm-water recommendation is entirely anecdotal - but looking at the above , it makes sense ; you want to use warm water in order for it to be more effective , but using hot water ( or even warm water for more than a minute or so ) increases the risk of corrosion , especially if what you 're trying to clean is caked-on salt or charred food . The effect of pH is more generally supported by <URL> , where neutral is better ( i.e. less corrosion ) , not to mention that strong acids cause the other type of corrosion ( called intergranular ) , and <URL> , although the effect is very slow , but still appreciable over time if you like to deglaze with boiling vinegar , for example . Even of the type of salt makes a big difference , if you scroll further down on that same previous link . Ammonium chloride is , for example , often found in sea salt , and it would appear to cause pitting corrosion much faster than the sodium chloride in table salt or kosher salt . Here 's what really does matter in a practical sense : Pitting is a reduction reaction , it 's caused by a lack of oxygen available to the metal surface - unlike , for example , rust , which is caused by oxygen . Quoting the last link : If debris of any kind is allowed to accumulate on the surfaces of stainless steel equipment , it will reduce the accessibility of oxygen to the covered areas and pits may develop in such locations because of the reduced oxygen concentration . [ ... ] ... carbon deposits from heated organic compounds are typical examples of t
Unfortunately , even if you press it , it will tend to crumble . The way the curds form in small curd cottage cheese forms a skin that makes them tend to fall apart . The same thing can happen in making Indian style paneer if you let the curds boil . ( At least , I think it is why it happened ! ) Probably your best bet is to drain it then make something like vada or kofte ( for malai kofte ) out of it , mixing in some maida or cooked potato or besan and kneading it into a dough , then forming it into balls or patties . I think it will still be tasty , even though it is n't what you planned for .
The advantage of using stainless steel is the fond ( tasty brown bits ) that form in the pan . It both flavors whatever you are sauteing and is often used as the base for a pan sauce .
If your caramel rolls are the kind with a sticky , gooey mass in the bottom of the pan that is flipped upside down out of the pan , then I would say that the rolls wo n't really get good and caramely in a stoneware pan . You 'd be better off baking one pan of rolls at a time in the metal pan . While one pan is rising and baking , just chill the other part of the dough ... either plain in a bowl , or prepared into a log that only needs to be cut . If the caramel rolls are more like a cinnamon bun , then the stoneware dishes should do fine in a pinch . This is assuming they are glazed stoneware and not terra cotta . Cooking time will increase a bit as the stoneware will take longer to heat up ( it will also retain the heat longer when removed from the oven ) . You could always just go out and buy some foil pans . I do that when I make rolls ( caramel , cinnamon , and sticky ) for the local fire company 's carnival . They go through 17 = 20 dozen rolls each year . I know baking rolls can be a lot of work , so what I have found to be very helpful , is to make the dough the night before baking . Cover with cling film , and let it have a slow rise in the fridge all night . ( you will get improved flavor too . ) The next day , divide the cold dough up and prepare as usual . They will take a little longer for the rise in the pan after shaping , but it sure is a lot easier on you .
The excellent <URL> to the question <URL> points out that one of the key reasons for using applesauce in quick bread type recipes such as pancakes is the pectin . Pumpkin <URL> contains pectin . Therefore pumpkin should provide a similar effect on your recipe as the applesauce . What the pumpkin puree wo n't provide is the sugar that applesauce provides . You will likely want to up the sugar provided by your recipe to account for this , unless you routinely use unsweetened applesauce . The water content between pumpkin puree and applesauce will also be different , as will the exact proteins . I would suggest starting with a one to one replacement of pumpkin for applesauce for a very pumpkin-y taste , but you will have to experiment . You will also want to add sugar to taste . If you want a more subtle flavor , consider substituting only part of the applesauce with pumpkin .
Yes that 's exactly what it means , apply salt to the steak . You should n't coat it , but you should apply salt very liberally . It 's actually hard to over-salt a steak ; many inexperienced cooks actually underseason the steak . I suggest about 1 tsp per side for a good ribeye . Salt it about 10-15 minutes prior .
Dilute heavily by using a very small portion of peppers per dish Allow cooking time for the pepper flavor to permeate the dish before adding more . It 's not like black pepper where the taste spreads instantly . Remove the seeds and membranes holding them , as this reduces spiciness considerably Cut peppers very finely or puree so there are n't any large pieces to deliver a shocker in the final dish Wear gloves when handling the peppers If you do n't use gloves , wash your hands well before touching your eyes , mouth , or other " sensitive regions . " AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY , DO NOT FRY OR SAUTE THE PEPPERS . No , seriously . The last one is a mistake you only make once , and should be on a warning label with all store-bought chilis . The capsaicin somehow becomes volatile when heated enough , and the result is like filling your entire domicile with pepper spray . I am ashamed to say that the last two cautions are drawn purely from personal experience . It 's not the kind of " hot date " you want to share with an ( un ) lucky person , believe me .
No . The amount of salt you would have to add to water to make an appreciable difference is enormous . Salt is added to water for various reasons : to season whatever is being cooked in it ; to maintain colour ; to maintain structural integrity .
Technically , your idea seems sound . But I would n't do it . What you are proposing to do in your electric kettle is very close to the standards for flash pasteurization . According to wikipedia , the standard procedure for flash pasteurization is to heat and circulate the liquid at 71.5 ° C ( 160 ° F ) to 74 ° C ( 165 ° F ) , for about 15 to 30 seconds , which results in a five log ( 99.999 % ) or greater reduction in bacteria . Other journal articles seem to indicate that some protozoa like cryptosporidium are killed by flash pasteurization , but others , like giardia , might survive in small numbers . I suspect the guideline for boiling water in issues of safety and in recipes is used because steam and bubbles are such convenient guarantors of temperature . Psychologically , though , this makes me a little nervous . Personally , I would boil the water - if you have time for tea , you have time to boil water . It is possible , though , that you are a more adventurous tea drinker than I am .
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
You 're basing this question on an incorrect answer . Like you said , the boiling temperature of water is lower at higher altitudes , which means it takes longer to cook things in boiling water , due to the lower temperature . There 's no benefit that I 'm aware of in intentionally lowering the boiling point of water ( which a pinch of salt does not do , anyway ) . If you wanted to cook something in water at a lower temperature , you can always just use less heat to keep it below the boiling point . Put another way , water that is boiling at 190 & deg ; F does not cook food at the same rate that water boiling at 212 & deg ; F does , even though they are both boiling .
You certainly can . There are a few things to consider before popping down to the beach and grabbing a bucket . Some areas of the sea are highly contaminated with toxins . Look for some sort of signage to give you a hint , OR look for fishermen . If they feel safe with the fish they are catching I 'd be inclined to think the water was also fine . Sea water is , as you know , very VERY salty . On average around 35g per Liter . So you may benefit from using half tap and half sea water . Be sure to boil the water for a few minutes before adding any food , just to be sure any harmful " biological organisms that might contaminate the water " . Another consideration , you may be interested in , would be harvesting your own salt from the sea water . That way you have more control over the amount penetrating your food/blood stream .
I would actually recommend the opposite of what was said above . Since the meat is so thin you may have much better results pan searing it in an extremely hot pan from slightly frozen . This way the outermost layer will start to undergo the maillard reaction long before the inside of the steak reaches a medium-rare temp and will give you a better chance of preventing it from overcooking . This link provides an overview of the process for a much larger piece of meat then your using but the searing process is what your concerned most with since your steaks are so thin . You will likely have to play with the timing a little bit with regards to how frozen the steak needs to start out but I figure erring on the side of too frozen is best since you can then heat them in the oven to the internal temp your looking for . <URL>
The proteins in a fresh egg are too viscous , even when thoroughly beaten , to wash a baked good . The water thins the proteins so you get a nice glaze instead of a layer of scrambled egg . Older eggs have sometimes degraded enough that they do n't need the water but it is easier to always add water than to make a subjective judgement on the state of your egg proteins .
Kosher salt is the same thing ( though I 'm pretty sure it 's not iodized ) , but the crystals are less dense and larger . There 's more air in each piece , and they do n't pack together as tightly . That means you have to put a larger volume of kosher to get the same amount of actual sodium chloride ( salt ) . Think of it as the difference between ice cubes ( regular salt ) and snow ( kosher ) . Both are water , but ice cubes are way denser than a scoop of snow . When melting it , you 'll need more volume of snow to come out to the same amount of water as you 'd get from a few ice cubes . So no , it 's not worse for you .
If you cool a pan too quickly it could deform , especially if your using a cheap pan . A cast iron pan could crack . This is most likely to happen if you dip a hot pan in cold water . If you want to get a jump-start on cleaning , de-glaze the pan with a cup of water as you would when making gravy . Pour off this liquid and set the pan aside to cool completely .
The USDA does regulate a notion of " organic " in the US . Here 's their <URL> . Many of the links there are quite relevant . The best one for you is probably the <URL> , though many others would be informative for you . The <URL> contains more details about labeling restrictions , and the <URL> page contains further links including the actual regulations . In terms of labeling , as described in the linked page on labeling , yes , the USDA regulates the usage of the USDA organic seal : Look at the label . If you see the USDA organic seal , the product is certified organic and has 95 percent or more organic content . For multi-ingredient products such as bread or soup , if the label claims that it is made with specified organic ingredients , you can be confident that those specific ingredients have been certified organic . Unfortunately many other people do have their own notions of what organic means , and if you see the term used without the seal , then you ca n't really tell what standards it was held to .
What about using mochi , an Asian pounded rice paste ? It 's a similar -- though not identical -- texture , it 's available in sweet and savory forms , and it 's held together by the starch in rice rather than anything gelatin , so it 's vegetarian . You can get plain unflavored mochi at many Asian food stores ; it may take some looking , as it 's more often sold sweet and filled with bean paste in the US . I 've had it in savory Korean dishes and I believe it 's used in savory Korean dishes as well .
Invert the bottom layer , top down , on a plate . Add the ice cream , but do not spread it to the outside edge of the cake . Top with the second cake layer , pressing gently . Then , using a sharp knife , slice vertically completely around the edge , removing the sloped edges of the cake . Surround the outside edge with a wrap of parchment paper or foil . Chill . After the cake is firm , you can slice horizontally to level the mound at the top of the cake , if you wish , before removing the paper/foil cuff .

Ammonium chloride is , for example , often found in sea salt , and it would appear to cause pitting corrosion much faster than the sodium chloride in table salt or kosher salt . Here 's what really does matter in a practical sense : Pitting is a reduction reaction , it 's caused by a lack of oxygen available to the metal surface - unlike , for example , rust , which is caused by oxygen . Quoting the last link : If debris of any kind is allowed to accumulate on the surfaces of stainless steel equipment , it will reduce the accessibility of oxygen to the covered areas and pits may develop in such locations because of the reduced oxygen concentration . [ ... ] ... carbon deposits from heated organic compounds are typical examples of t

Difference between cooking vegetable curries in a pressure cooker and a wok ?
What gives spices their flavors are the oils that they contain , along with any water soluble flavors that they might have . In a pressure cooker , your food will cook hot . What that means to your spices will vary as certain spices could grow more bitter or sweeter depending on the compounds inside them . Conventional wisdom says that pressure cooking concentrates the flavors , although that would seem to fly in the face of physics as you are n't reducing while pressure cooking , you are just heating steam at a higher atmosphere to transfer more heat to the food faster . As for texture , use the one that you like .
From <URL> magret refers to a specific breed ( the <URL> , not to be confused with the Mallard ) : Magret refers specifically to the breast of a mulard or Barbary duck that has been force fed to produce foie gras . From <URL> : Sometimes called " duck steak , " the magret ( breast ) of the Moulard duck is known for its rich flavor and dark red meat . Try it pan seared and find out why the French swear by the duck .
In today 's modern culture and cooking style , the difference is likely unobserved . I would consider a stew less constructed than a casserole , however . While the stew would start with generally uncooked ingredients ( perhaps except for browning the meat , and likely be mixed together while cooking to give a single-dish of meat , vegetables and sauce . A casserole might include some cooked ingredients , often be more properly layered and probably not mixed while cooking .
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
What 's the difference between gravy , jus , sauce and coulis ? Will says ... • ' Gravy is made from the juices of oven roast meat , thickend with a starch such as corn flour . • Jus is made from the same juices that has been refined and condensed to get a clear liquid naturally thickened . • Sauce could be made from the same juices with other ingredients added such as wines or spirits to compliment the food . Sauces can be served hot or cold . • Coulis is a thin fruit or vegetable purée , used as a sauce . If the purée is too thick , you can add some water and sometimes sugar ' . Source : <URL> My personal feeling for sauces is they can be made from anything . Parsnips , Mushrooms , Celeriac etc when ' Gravy ' and ' Jus ' must have Meat juices as their base . On menu 's you 'll often see ' Gravy ' on pub menu 's where they are n't trying to sound to posh , probably using some sort of packet mix . Jus ' on French style menu 's OR people trying too hard . Finally you 'll see something like " Beef and Juniper Sauce " on my menu and many others because ... Gravy sounds too common and Jus sounds too poncy .
If I recall correctly the differences are slight , but significant . Both have a subtle , delicate flavour with an exceptionally light texture . The Victorian is usually regarded as the healthier , lighter of the two , but I believe this is mostly due to the Génoise usually being rendered as a layer cake with a lavish buttercream filling , though if I remember right it can also be used as a base for madeleines and ladyfingers . The Victorian can be baked thin and carefully rolled with cream for Swiss rolls . The main difference is the Victorian slices disorderly and ' crumby ' while the Génoise retains its form neatly . Both are accompanied well by , and are traditionally served with hot beverages namely tea and coffee . The Italian creation is undecidedly the more complex one to prepare . You 're right about separating the egg whites and beating them separately aerating the mixture further , but I 'm not certain if it would make a noticeable difference in case of sponge cakes but I 'd love it if someone could comment on this .
Sounds like sliced water chestnuts to me , especially with the name similarity .
What you need for the conversion of collagen is a certain amount of energy . It is a complicated process - the melting point is around 70 ° C for the type of collagen contained in beef , but the melting does not happen instantly once the meat reaches 70 ° C . In a pressure cooking , you can apply the same amount of energy in a shorter amount of time . This is not bad , as opposed to slow roasting of collagen-poor meat . In collagen-poor meat , you have two types of protein , which are soft and wet . Under heat , they curdle , becoming tough and dry . The perfect meat is when the first type has curdled ( so the meat is not raw ) but the second has n't , so it still holds juices inside . If you curdle both , your meat gets tough and you ca n't take it apart with your teeth . In collagen-rich meat , you curdle both proteins - the collagen itself is tough and you want to melt it , but this happens long after the meat has curdled . But because the muscle fibers are not clinging to each other , but separated by collagen , you still get tasty meat . For that , you melt the collagen into gelatin , and serve the meat warm , so that the dry fibers are separated by the smooth , juicy melted gelatin . Unlike slow-roasted meat , you do n't have to tear the juiceless fibers apart , and the gelatin makes up for the missing meat juices which were expelled from the cells during curdling . So , in slow-roasted meat you do n't want to cross the temperature limit for curdling a certain protein , this is why you have to apply heat slowly until the center of the meat has cooked , without the outside getting overcooked . In collagen-rich meat , there is no upper limit at which the meat gets non-tasty , so you can push the energy needed for the collagen-to-gelatin conversion quickly into your meat . The pressure cooker can do this better than the normal boiling process .
In the U.S. biscuits are made with chemical leavening , they use baking powder to cause them to rise . Rolls ( or dinner rolls ) are yeast bread . There are obviously other differences in the recipe ( s ) but baking powder vs. yeast is the essential difference .
Pan frying means letting the food sit in the pan and occasionally stirring or flipping . It tends to be done with larger pieces of food , and at a medium to medium-high heat . Sautéing means shaking the pan back and forth - making the food " jump " , if you 're translating directly . It 's done at a high heat , for a short time , usually with thinly-sliced or finely-chopped ingredients . Shallow frying , according to some references , refers to the food being partially ( halfway ) submerged in hot oil and flipped once , as opposed to deep-frying where the food is fully-submerged the whole time .
I find it amusing that your range warns you the cooking ring will work as intended . It 's supposed to be heat trap , and focus heat on the bottom of the wok . That said , they are also correct that it may discolor the burner grate . I ca n't really say what your grates are made from , and many cooking materials discolor at high temperatures . I think the main idea behind this paragraph in your manual is to save them from warranty replacements for discolored grates . I also find it highly suspect that a wok could damage the burner itself . They are usually ceramic , in direct contact with open flame , and any pan traps heat to some degree . Burners get HOT and have to be able to take it . Although the little decorative cap on the burner might discolor as well .
As stated by <URL> ; The crisper provides a somewhat enclosed environment , which prevents moisture from escaping as rapidly . Vegetables keep best at a certain humidity , higher than that typically found in the rest of the fridge , but not so high that condensation starts accumulating on them . Vegetables kept in too-dry air in the rest of the fridge will tend to dry out and shrivel up faster ; those kept in the crisper will retain their water and texture better , keeping them crisp . Leafy vegetables are also much more prone to drying out , since they have much more surface area , while hardier vegetables with a decent skin on them ( like bell peppers ) do n't dry out nearly as quickly . Fruits benefit somewhat from this as well , but do n't generally need as high a humidity as vegetables . Some crisper drawers have little sliders on them which vary the size of the opening to the rest of the fridge , letting you vary the amount of circulation and therefore the humidity ; you can adjust this to suit what you tend to store in the drawer . If you have two crisper drawers , both adjustable , then it might be a good idea to put fruit and hardier vegetables in one , and more vulnerable vegetables in the other . Also , by always putting vegetables in the crisper drawer , you can prevent potential cross contamination between foods i.e. , the vegetables can never come in contact with raw meat , because they 're all in their own separate drawer .
The difference in their name is - not surprisingly - because of their form . Cherry tomatoes are round , while grape tomatoes are more oblong . <URL> mentions that grape tomatoes are ' sweet as cherry tomatoes ' , so not much difference in flavour according to this . Perhaps grape tomatoes are more similar to small plum tomatoes . <URL> claims grape tomatoes to be sweeter , having a thicker skin and a lower water content than cherry tomatoes . Interestingly , it also says that grape tomatoes are a cross between cherry tomatoes and other tomatoes . The claims of the second site are in agreement with <URL> site ( " grape tomatoes have thicker skin , lower water content and intense sweetness " ) . It also states " a grape tomato is half the size of a cherry tomato " , so perhaps they are smaller . Due to the lower water content , grape tomatoes have less chance of ' squirting ' when being bitten into .
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
There 's a difference between the title ( is a sausiccon a type of salami ) , and the body ( is there a difference ) . The first is a question of classification , and no , a saucisson is type of cured sausage , but you 'd want " saucisson sec " ( dry sausage ) for a dried , cured sausage with good storage characteristics like salami . So the relation is the other way around -- a salami is a type of saucisson . " Differences " when you 're dealing with general classifications such as this tend to be a question of if there are items that might fit into one category , but not the other . It 's pretty obvious that salami is a narrower term than sausiccon , but I 'm not sure if salami and sausiccon sec are just different names for the same concept , or if there might be items in one class that would n't fall into the other . update : would <URL> be considered a saucisson sec ? It 's only semi-dried , so I would n't classify it as a salami due to storage characteristics .
On first blush , you will probably want a fat or oil with similar qualities as the " vegetable " oil you 're replacing , such as olive oil . Butter has a much lower a smoke point , however , cornbread recipes exist that use butter or lard . I 'd be willing to experiment , particularly if you 're used to cooking with butter . ( Just be careful with heat . ) As far as quantity , I 'd use a bit less than 1/3 of a cup , but that 's me being defensive as I do n't know the recipe you 're using .
My mother came up with a simple solution - add a capful of oil ( she recommended corn oil ) to the rice recipe . This time around the rice scooped right out perfectly .
Enchiladas are normally shredded meat and/or cheese rolled in corn tortillas , covered in red ( or green ) enchilada sauce and cheese , and then baked . Fajitas are normally strips of meat either grilled or sauteed ( often with onions and peppers ) . They can be used in tacos , burritos , or served on their own or with tortillas on the side ( corn or flour depending on preference ) . Tacos can be either hard or soft shelled and are usually meat ( shredded , ground , grilled etc ) with some sort of cold veggies ( like lettuce , raw onions , pico de gallo , etc ) and perhaps cheese etc. .
I 've only heard of massaging kale . If you rub the greens together they get softer , darker and more tender and useable in a salad . Never done it with anything else . Wilted is steamed or blanched greens . Wilting definitely changes the texture and can make the greens more palatable and less bitter . I wo n't eat raw collards . I also always salt and squeeze my cooked spinach before using as it knocks out the bitterness .
The difference for green onions will be most noticable if you do n't cook them . Instead , slice them up and use them for a garnish over the dish . The white portion of the green onion will still be oniony , but not quite as strong as a raw red onion . Slice them thinly and use for garnish if you really want to bring out the onion qualities of them . If you do n't want it too strong , then add them when you 're cooking . ( and you might not want to slice them as thin ) . The green portion gives a more mild onion taste but also some of the grassy quality that you might get from chives . I treat them like a fresh herb , chop them up , and add in them in the last minute of cooking or I do n't cook them at all . As for substitution ... I 'd only plan to do it if you were cooking for someone who did n't like onions , as they 're milder and come in smaller portions than bulb onions , so it 's easier to control amounts without any waste . ... and I 'd do it if I had them on hand but did n't have bulb onions around . If you 're just looking for a good way to feature the green onions -- grill them . Trim the ends off , clean off any dirt , give them a coat of oil , then toss them on a hot pan or grill . They make a great side dish . Other good uses are to add them into scrambled eggs , green onion pancakes , or press them into naan before cooking it . ... For the white onions , the opposite is true -- they 're generally stronger than red onions . Most people do n't serve it as a raw garnish unless it 's very thinly sliced and used in small amounts . It 's still used raw , but it tends to be blended into other things such as pico de gallo , or guacamole , where the pungency of the onion helps to balance out the sweetness of the tomatoes or richness of the avocado . I 'm having difficulty thinking of a dish where the qualities of the white onion would stand out , though . My only idea is french onion soup , because it just comes out lacking if you make it with sweeter red or yellow onions ... but unless you made them side by side and compared them , I do n't know that you 'd see the difference . You might try cooking them slowly over medium heat until they caramelize ... it 'd let you feature the onions without them being overwhelming , and it brings out some of their more interesting qualities .

Should you wrap chicken in foil when you steam it ?
Do n't wrap the chicken in foil . Instead you can use a steamer basket inserted in a pot with the lid on ( making sure your liquid does not touch the chicken ) and steam it that way . If you do n't have a steamer basket and what you are trying to do is replace one , instead of wrapping the chicken roll that foil into balls or strips and use it to elevate the chicken above the cooking liquid in your pot . If you wrap in foil , the chicken will be cooking via the heat transfer from the foil rather than from the steam .
First off , the blender should not be damaged by the shells ; if it is , it should have been replaced anyway . The mass of the shells is simply not enough to damage the blender in any significant way . I would not , however , recommend eating the product , for a few reasons : You can not be confident that the egg shell has been completely pulverised . At some point , the blades stop chopping the shell , and simply spins it around Whenever using egg shells for presentation , they should be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized , because you do n't know what is coating it . You may very conceivably contract diseases from bacteria on the shell .
This is absolutely fine , especially if the eggs are pasteurised . I 've seen plenty of recipes that have raw egg in them that say it ; s fine to freeze them . You can even freeze eggs ( that have been mixed up a little ) for up to three months . So yes , I 'd say freeze it as soon as possible . Also , if you were concerned about freezing the quinoa that will fine as well ( a lot of people do n't know you can store grains in the freezer ) . Enjoy !
If you have 18 inch wide heavy duty foil , pull a square that is 18X18 , place your pan in the center of the foil and lift the edges of the foil up around the outside of the pan , effectively making a pan within a pan ( spring form inside the aluminum foil pan . If you only have 12 inch foil , pull two pieces of foil about 18 inches long and put them on top of each other . Along one if the long edges , fold both pieces over about 1/2 inch a few times , crimping each time . Open up the sheets which will create one large piece with a seam down the middle . Put the spring form pan in the middle like above . If your seam is tight it should work as well as the single piece of 18 inch foil .
There are two main base recipes for ice cream . French style ice cream contains egg yolks , which help make it soft , rich , smooth , creamy , custardy . Philadelphia style ice cream ( sometimes called American style ) has no eggs , and relies on the fat in the cream to keep it soft , but will still never be as rich and smooth as French style , and will still tend to freeze harder . You can make pretty much any ice cream in either style , including the pistachio-almond you want to make . You can look around for recipes without eggs ; I would n't be surprised if you manage to find one one . Or you can simply use a Philadelphia style base , and look at one of the recipes you found to see how to add the pistachio and almond . Depending on how rich you want it , you 'll want 2-3 cups of heavy cream for each 1 cup of milk ; about 3/4 cup of sugar should work , depending on how sweet you want it . If that 's not rich enough for you , you can even replace the milk with cream . ( You could also just go find a recipe for Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream and use that as a base - it does n't get much simpler than that . ) ( P.S. . You could also try gelato , something like <URL> - it uses corn starch as a stabilizer instead . )
You should throw them out . Mussels that do n't open were quite possibly dead and decomposing for an unknown period of time prior to cooking . You do n't want to take a chance here . Just in case future readers do n't know , mussels , clams , and other in-shell shellfish are still alive when you buy them , and they should be still alive when you cook them .
The wrap used in most grocery stores is n't the same as your household wrap . Most of the consumer brands of plastic " cling " wrap are now formulated from low-density polyethylene . It 's rolled very thin to give you the best price per unit of length , and has reasonable stickyness . Most stores use a product called " meat film " which is most commonly made from PVC . It 's a little thicker , more wrinkle-resistant to give the product contained inside a better appearance , and it 's stickier . The other thing that grocery stores do to make the seal better is they use a heat sealer on the plastic . These are heated pads where they 'll place a wrapped piece of plastic for a few seconds . It 's not enough heat to melt the plastic , so in most cases you can still pull it apart , but it is just enough to shrink the joint together , and pull it taut across the front of the packaging .
Soup freezes great in my experience . To freeze it for long term storage , you 'll probably want it to be vacuum sealed . In order to do this I freeze individual sized portions in Tupperware-style containers ( make sure to leave enough room for expansion ) , and as soon as they 're solid , vacuum seal those large " cubes " . They generally stack pretty nicely in our garage freezer . In general soups should thaw and taste very good , some flavors even seem become stronger or seem to enhance and meld better with the freezing . If you vacuum seal them as above you can throw them ( still sealed ) into a pot of boiling water for hot soup relatively fast ! As an aside , another great option with a leftover turkey frame would be to save it with previous odds and ends ( carrot/celery ends , onion pieces , etc ) in the freezer , and when you have enough make a simple stock . You can then freeze the stock into cubes ( in ice cube trays ) for soup-making later , sauteeing veggies , in place of water for more flavorful rice , and a ton of other things .
Alright . I did it . I took photos , but it might be only later before I can upload them . The Equipment . Small macchinetta , enough for two small tea glasses . The Process . I put about half the height of the holding chamber . In retrospect , I could have gone even 2/3rd of the height . Edit : I just opened up the pot , to clean it up , it seems that my amount was right on the money . After the second pot the leaves expanded even more . I think that a third pot could have been made with them as well . End edit . I poured water to the appropriate height ( or a bit less ) , and put it on the stove on a low heat until there was some noise that indicated that more or less the tea is ready . The first serving was weak . But that was expected , my dad remarked that it 's normal for the first washing to be weak . So we did a second run . The result was pretty good . It would have been better if I padded up the tea leaves , but it was pretty nice . The Consequences . I would n't recommend this method over pouring hot water through the tea leaves ( not steeping ) . But the experiment was fun ! Thanks for the two answerers that reassured me that this is doable .
Whole wheat flour goes rancid . There is a lot of fat in wheat germ and when it oxidizes the flour becomes very bitter and has a very noticeable , unpleasant scent . First of all - if you use bleached white flour there is little to worry about . Bleached flour has had much of the wheat removed to give it a longer shelf life . At the expense of flavor and nutrition of course . Keeping whole wheat flour out of light , sealed from oxygen , and cold will keep it from going rancid . Any one of those will extend the life of the flour - putting it in the freezer sealed from air will keep it good indefinitely . In the cupboard I will start noticing off flavors in my fresh ground flour in a couple weeks . In the freezer I have gone as much as a year with no discernible degradation . You will notice if it has gone bad because it will smell and taste bad . This rancidity is n't dangerous so if the flour smells and tastes fine then it is .
By hunting chicken in a game preserve ? ;-) <URL> The essence of poaching chicken is a gentle boil in water , stock or other flavorful liquid . I really like poaching chunks of chicken in a thin sweet-and-sour sauce , then thickening the sauce , adding pineapple chunks , and serving over rice .
I think it 's because freezing tend to dry things out . At lukewarm temperature , it 's still ' steaming ' a bit , which means evaporating liquid , so losing moist . If you can stop the drying out process at that point , the pastry wo n't be as dry as when you let it cool completely . Of course , a too high temperature can do harm to already frozen things , or would cause condensation in the package , so that there would be ice formed . This could be the reason , and therefore , the statement can be true .
Tomatoes are mostly water anyway . They 're not going to get above boiling point whether or not you add water ( or at least not by more than a very few degrees even with salt added - less than the effect of altitude ) . On the other hand the browned bits from the bottom of the pan ( often called fond in the US though I 've never heard this in the UK and the usage in France is a bit different ) do give a nice flavour to the sauce so long as they do n't catch . If you do add water , you 'll need to simmer it down anyway , making that the stirring step still happens , just later . But adding some water fairly early can give you some flexibility . A good time to do this is when it 's starting to meet constant stirring but you need to get on with the rest of the meal . A low heat and a heavy pan help too .
Yes , but the trick is not to have the dough in the microwave when it 's on : place the dough into a wide , shallow bowl , and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap . Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water , and float a toothpick or a grain of rice in it . Microwave the water 'til it 's boiling . Place the bowl with the dough above the boiling water ; the water level should not touch the upper bowl . Close the microwave and wait . ( the plastic wrap is n't absolutely necessary ... but it prevents you from steaming the outside of the dough , changing its moisture content ) The toothpick ( or similar ) is necessary , as it prevents the water from heating above its boiling point and spontaneously boiling when you nudge it . .
Most reliable sources will warn you strongly against reusing marinades because they can continue to harbor bacteria . Even though the second batch of meat will be cooked , there 'll be lots of time for the bacteria to multiply in the meantime . ( And given the symptoms caused by foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria like salmonella , the risk is n't worth the few cents you 'll save on marinade . )
The main reason why you want to cut the duck in half and roast them with the skin side pointing upwards is so the skin of the duck is nice and crispy . Unlike most roasted poultry where you do n't eat the skin , the duck 's skin is considered a huge delicacy if it is crispy .
There are no real doneness rules on mirepoix per se ( even raw is used in some dishes ) . However , the recipe designer may say sweat versus sauté to give an indication of colour and flavour depth to match the ' headliner ' of the dish ( usually the meat ) . Although not a rule , you may generally see sweat used more for lighter meats like fish and fowl and sauté for darker and gamier meat like beef and lamb . That way a darker and more browned mirepoix will not overwhelm say a delicate fish ( both in colour and taste ) .
Frying the chicken tends to set the muscle fibers by drawing moisture out . An example of this would be taking a thin ( 1cm ) cutlet and frying it until both sides start to turn golden . It will be pretty dry and hard . Pressure cooking it on the other hand tends to soften the muscle fibers without drawing moisture in ( if anything , its putting moisture in ) . So , ideally , you should boil/pressure cook your chicken prior to frying in oil ( though do make sure to drain the chicken first to prevent splatters ! ) . Additionally , you should undercook the chicken slightly in the pressure cooker since you 'll be finishing it in the fryer . If you are broasting the chicken , then you are going about the recipe incorrectly by frying then pressure cooking it . When broasting , you should pressure fry - if that makes sense .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
In <URL> , Lorenzo notes that steaks may end up raw in the center if you only leave 'em out for 10-15 minutes to come up to temperature . I recommend 30 mins , but it will probably vary on what room temperature actually is for you . From Weber 's Way To Grill , which recommends salting right when you take them out of the fridge , here 's Mr. Purviance 's take on why you should consider salting early : It 's true that salt draws moisture toward itself , but over the course of 20 to 30 minutes that 's a good thing , because the salt begins to dissolve into that little bit of moisture . When the steak hits the hot grate ... [ you ] create a delicious crust . Any moisture you might lose is well worth the flavor of that crust .

How to shell macadamias without a special tool ?
I 've used C-clamps before . You set the macademia in it , then tighten it down 'til it cracks . You can keep a gloved hand around the nut while turning the screw with the other hand to avoid the risk of flying shell bits . ( but you should be turning slow enough that it does n't crack explosively ) It does take some time , but it 's less than a minute per nut . It goes faster when they 're all similarly sized , so you 're not adjusting the clamp signicantly to fit the next one .
I wo n't claim that this is universal , and I probably would n't try it with scotch bonnets or ghost peppers , but this is what I do with poblanos , seranos , jalapenos , and the like : Treat them like any other vegetable when you prep , using good knife skills , and a well sharpened knife -- good skills minimize how much you touch the product anyway . Do n't touch your eyes or face or anything you do n't have to . When you are done , wash your hands in soapy water . Here is how I would dice a jalapeno ( I like the red ones the best ) or similar small pepper . For this , I would use a paring knife . For a larger pepper , like a poblano , I would use chef knife or a santuko : Cut off the stem end so only the fleshy part of the pepper remains . It will be a little cone . Optionally , cut a tiny part of the tip , to make it easier to separate the flesh , but it is not absolutely required . Cut a a slit into the side of the pepper through the flesh and into the cavity ... then ... continuing the same motion ... ... turn your knife parallel to the flesh , and run the edge of the blade around the inside of the pod so that you are essentially peeling the skin from the core of seeds and membranes . This is much easier to do than to describe in text . Discard the seeds and membranes . Unroll the pepper , skin side up , and flatten the flesh of the pepper out , so it is like a piece of paper . It may split a little when you do this , that is fine . It is easiest to flatten with the outside facing up , but easiest to cut with the outside of the skin facing the cutting board . Turn the pepper sheet over , so it is skin side down . Cut it into long , thin strips -- juliennes . Cross-cut the juliennes into dice . If you want a hotter product , and a more rustic one , with a small pepper , you can simply : Cut of the stem end . Slice the remaining pepper into circles or coins , thinly . If you want very hot dice , you can then : Pile up the coins , and chop through them several times in the standard rocking motion with a chef 's knife .
Dry biscuits ( American ' biscuits ' - not cookies ) , or anything other flour based quick bread that dried out - if you 're trying to replicate the bread crumbs . You may be able to get by with a modified muffin recipe as well . You 'll want to avoid fats and oils to reduce the moistness . Yeast bread develops a particular flavor and larger hole structure than quick bread though . The flavor of a quick bread breadcrumbs should be slightly different , but in many dishes the subtle difference wo n't be overwhelming unless the breading is a ' star ' of the dish . The hole structure really does n't matter luckily - as developing that is a large part of the time factor of real bread . Drying it out will be the harder part . The denser structure holds moisture better , so slice it thin and give it low , dry , long heat . Personally , anything that you 're going to make for the purpose of breadcrumbs that is n't just a substitute ( like cereal , crackers , etc in the other answer ) , sounds like it 'd be easier just to make a loaf of fast rise bread to me .
You can put a cup/bowl of water ( you can also add some vinegar if you do n't mind the smell ) in there , heat it up to boiling , let the steam out . Then you should let it sit in the microwave without opening the door . Wait for a few minutes , open the microwave , and wipe off the inside . All that steam should have soften any stains or food pieces left in there . You may spray some natural cleaners or lemon/vinegar mixtures to wipe off the inside more .
If I understand you correctly , you 're putting frozen chicken thighs in a glassware dish that 's been sprayed with Pam and then putting that into a 350F oven . Since the chicken will take quite a while to thaw and begin emitting juices that will cool the dish , that dish is going to rise to 350F fairly quickly . 350F is hot enough to begin smoking with many oils . Not sure about Pam 's smoke point , but I would bet that if you looked in the oven when the smoke alarm is going off , you 'll see smoke rising from the pan itself , not the chicken or the oven . Solution : Thaw the chicken before cooking or apply oil to the chicken but not the pan .
Frietsaus is just a special mayonnaise Commercially it is lower in fat than plain mayonnaise It has oil , starch ( replaces extra oil ) , whole egg yolk , whole mustard seed , sugar , distiled vinegar , and lemon juice So the kick is just the extra acid ( vinegar and lemon juice ) , the bite from the whole seed mustard , mixed into a lite sauce , not a heavy greasy mayo BTW : VleminckX Sausmeesters is just a touristy thing , there are plenty of shops in Holland that serve great fries Personally I think that potatoes from Europe are a bit plain compared to many other continents/countries . the best I have had are from Fiji , the warm humid conditions make excellent deep frying potatoes , and I suspect they lace the cooking oil with a little coconut oil too :-)
If I think an egg is cracked before I boil it , I make sure to add it to boiling water rather than letting it warm up with the water as it 's heating . I give it a quick roll in the water with a spoon to make sure it is heated all round . This cooks the outside of the egg rapidly , sealing the crack immediately . no leakage . When you add a cracked egg to cool water , it has plenty of time to seep out uncooked .
Worcestershire sauce is fairly sweet , it 's the sugar that 's blackening . There 's nothing you can do about it - if you add it to your pan it 's going to char . The solution is not to put it in the pan , but put it on afterwards or mix it in with the meat before making patties . You 'll get a better result that way as well , you 're destroying the flavor of the worcestershire sauce by charring it in the pan like that .
You are missing the tiny detail that metal is not the only material which can provide sharp , cutting edges . The reason the Stone Age got its name was the use of stone for tools . Both <URL> stone and <URL> , a volcanic glass can splinter with razor-sharp edges . Both the raw material and the tools made from them were highly prized goods and mined and traded in prehistoric times . Even today , <URL> are still used for some surgical procedures , especially in cosmetic surgery . What works for a face lift in Hollywood should easily be good enough for pemikan - not that I 'm comparing the two tasks . Failing to obtain the stones , bone knifes from long leg bones would also have been able to handle the task of cutting thin meat strips quite smoothly . Not for the squeamish : This <URL> shows the butchering of a deer with a simple , hand made obsidian " knife " . This <URL> compares a flint and a bone knife .
In the normal cooking time of a quiche ( 20 to 30 minutes ) , the crust does n't really get soggy from the filling , even if it is quite liquid , as is expected for quiche Lorraine . So , you can without problem cook your quiche without first blind-baking the crust . The difference will be in the crispness of the crust : if you try to get it crispy , you should prebake , if you do n't mind it being rather , well , " plain " , you do n't . The only real reason for me to blind-bake a crust is when you put something on it that wo n't be cooked ( tartelettes ) , that will only get grilled or that will be baked less that it would require to bake the crust ( meringue tart ) . Most of these examples are fruit tarts , however .
Lemon is used as a flavoring , not as a cooking liquid , it 's not going to keep the fish moist . The secret of having moist fish is the same as having moist beef , chicken or any meat or poultry : do n't overcook it . Cooking releases moisture from the flesh , so cooking it well is all about timing - getting it cooked enough to have the internal temperature and consistency you want and no more as every extra second means more moisture lost . Fish is especially sensitive to timing , but with a bit of practice anyone can cook fish well . Fish , meat or poultry will have a juicy mouth feel when there is enough moisture stored in the flesh after cooking . Overcooked fish in a pool of sauce will still have a dry mouth feel , whereas perfectly cooked fish with no sauce at all will have a moist mouth feel . As for what to cook cod with as a replacement for lemon the answer is nothing . Fish has enough moisture to begin with , and when baking you do n't need to assist heat transfer . Lemon is simply a flavoring , so replace it with flavoring you like . This could be browned butter ( or just a bit of butter ) if you want richness , or herbs if you like , or you could just season it with salt and pepper . If you want to get more fancy you could seal it up in parchment paper or foil ( oil the foil so it does n't stick ) with a tiny bit of water or butter and some herbs and bake it that way , it seals in the moisture and creates a sauce - delicious !
While the above suggestions would get rid of the oil splatter problem , they would also result in overcooked meat with a soggy exterior , as all the water created during frying ( for example , chicken releases a lot of juice ) would remain in the pan and steam the meat instead of frying it . Your best bet is to get something called a splatter screen . I 've seen one at <URL> , and at walmart , and I would assume kitchen supply stores would carry it too . A splatter screen is basically a fine metal mesh lid with a handle that fits over a variety of pans/pots and while it allows the steam to escape it also prevents the oil from splattering everywhere by catching in it the fine mesh . The best $ 10 you 'll ever spend .
I 'd stew the raspberries down with a little water ( and sugar if the raspberries are n't sweet ) until they 're very soft , then pass the whole thing through a sieve to remove the seeds . You can then either store the result in the fridge , or pour it into an ice cube tray for easy portioning and a nice cold smoothie .

Clingwrap works fine for me -- but I do n't use a meat tenderizer -- I just use a small but fairly heavy pan ( but not my cast iron , as it 's not smooth on the bottom ) . When I was in college , I tried a few things . I can get pretty decent results just hitting it with my cutting board . ( with it between saran wrap ) . Part of it might be technique -- if I 'm doing chicken breast I first slice is sort of following the taper of the breast , so it 's neither with or across the grain , but kinda of diagonal . You also do n't want to hit straight down -- you want to angle the blows , so you 're actually pushing the meat out , and not just trying to force it through the counter . And I should mention that I 've only ever pounded out poultry and pork -- I assume beef would be the same , but I have no experience to confirm or deny it .
<URL> Freeze Brazil nuts , or soak them in water for several hours before cracking . Stand frozen nuts with the point facing up and hit with a hard object , such as a hammer , to crack . Crack soaked nuts with a nutcracker . Place the nut in the grip of the nutcracker so that the seam of the shell is subjected to the direct force . Use minimum force necessary to split the shell when squeezing , in order to avoid crushing the nut kernel inside . Rotate the nut while squeezing so the shell cracks slowly . Extract the kernel from the shell . Allow the kernels of soaked nuts to dry for a few hours after cracking . Read more : How to Crack Nuts | eHow.com <URL>
Yes , you can cook them in about 1 " of oil in a steep sided frying pan or wok . Just turn them reasonably frequently to ensure even cooking . If you 're dubious about using a lot of hot oil , you can use less by making your bhajis a flat , patty shape and shallow frying .
Heston Blumenthal has brought his unique scientific approach to bear on this recently . The main pointers for a perfect poached egg are as follows : The egg must be fresh . A fresh egg has a thicker , more gel-like albumen . As it gets older , this becomes watery , and so just disperses throughout the water when you add it . To test if your egg is fresh , place it in a jug of cold water . If it floats , it 's not fresh - the egg has had time to absorb air through its shell . A fresh egg sinks and stays sunk . The water temperature should be 80ºC / 176ºF exactly . You can measure this with a sugar or probe thermometer . The egg should be at room temperature . The egg should not come into contact with direct heat , so put a plate or small bowl on the bottom of the pan , bottom up . Once the water ( in a medium to large saucepan ) is up to temperature , carefully add the fresh egg and cook for 4 minutes exactly ( for a large egg of the domestic chicken , Gallus gallus domesticus ) . Drain and serve - the white should be set but not rubbery ( a drawback of using vinegar ) and the yolk should be creamy and rich .
The way you 've described is precisely how I melt chocolate . If you have a double boiler , that 's even better , but a bowl on top of a pot is fine too . I can only think of two things that might be affecting the quality of your end result : Is the bowl big enough ? The melting bowl should be larger than the pot if possible ; you want the steam to be forced under and around it . Is the water temperature reasonable ? You want it to be at a simmer . If it 's rapidly boiling , the heat is too high . As long as you keep those two things in mind , your chocolate should melt fine ! Edit : Thought of one other thing : It 's possible that the steam is actually rising above the bowl , then hitting something ( like your range ) , condensing and then falling back into the bowl as water . You should n't even be getting much steam with this method , but just in case , turn your fan on , to make sure you are n't getting any condensation .
Wilds of Russia ? If you have dry ice , just adding pieces of it ( chopped small ) to your drink will work to some extent . Here 's a vid : <URL> Be aware that not all dry ice is food grade . If no dry ice , you can get by with sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and vinegar ( acetic acid ) , or some other acid . Just mix the two chemicals , and bubble the resulting gas through your drink . Here 's an Instructable , w video : <URL> . It 'd be easy to improve on the kid 's method , for example by adding a <URL> , but the general principles are sound . Either method will cause some change in your liquid 's taste , as you 're lowering the pH by generating carbonic acid , but that 's true of any carbonation scheme .

How can I smoothly sugar the rim ?
The clumps come from too much liquid on the glass when applying the sugar . The way I learned to salt a glass was to dip the glass upside-down in a shallow plate or bowl of water , let it drip for 5-10 seconds , then dip it into an evenly layered plate of salt . I think this should work for sugaring a glass .
According to <URL> : Jaggery is not as sweet as white sugar , so when substituting white sugar for Jaggery use about 1/3 less . When swapping Jaggery in for sugar , use anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 more Jaggery than was called for of sugar ( if you want to keep the recipe as sweet as it was . ) That meshes with my limited experience too , so if the jaggery is ground in such a way that it will measure like the sugar you are replacing , and you are replacing 1TBS of sugar , then you would want to use somewhere in the neighborhood of 1TBS plus 1tsp of jaggery . If precision is needed ( which of course does n't really apply here , but bear with me ) consider that the way jaggery and sugar measures volumetrically are unlikely to really be identical . It would be better to measure by weight , or if there is liquid in the recipe , by water displacement .
The amount of tea you use wo n't affect the flavor of tea adversely ; the way you brew it will . This also depends on what kind of tea you 're making ( black , oolong , green , white , herbal ) . Greater quantities of tannins are <URL> , which makes the tea more bitter . TL ; DR : If you follow the instructions for brewing temperature and time , you should be able to more or less add as much tea as you want . Black teas are brewed with boiling water , typically for 2-3 minutes . Green , white and oolong teas are usually brewed at lower temp ( 180 F ) for 3-4 minutes , and herbal teas at just below boiling for anywhere from 4-8 minutes . I 've found that I can easily more than double the amount of tea leaves I use , brew it at the recommended temperature for the recommended time ( most tea packages should have instructions ) , and store the 2x concentrated tea in my refrigerator . Upton Tea has a <URL> for water temps and amounts . They also have <URL> for hot and cold brewing iced tea - they recommend double or tripling the leaf quantity when hot brewing , then diluting to taste . ( I buy a lot of my teas from here , and their instructions have never steered me wrong . ) If you 're looking for even more information about preparation of and descriptions / histories of different types of tea , I recommend the Harney &amp; Sons <URL> .
In recipes , buttermilk brings liquid , some milk solids , some acid , and if it is not made from skim milk ( it is a cultured product ) , some fat . In a pinch , you can substitute approximately 1 cup milk with 1 tbl lemon juice or vinegar . For information on making your own cultured buttermilk , <URL> . It is made from milk and an active culture starter from commercial or previous buttermilk batches , much akin to making yogurt . Edit : As hinted in Fisher 's answer , for some applications , particularly quick breads and muffins , buttermilk can also be substituted one to one with yogurt or sour cream .
You could try using arrowroot . This is a widely available alternative to cornstarch - it is used in cookery because it does n't turn liquids cloudy like cornstarch does . In your case , it might work better as it also has a more neutral flavour . Substitute 2 tbsps of arrowroot for 1 tbsp cornstarch , and make a slurry with cool water as you would cornstarch . One issue is that overheating can break down the arrowroot , preventing it from thickening , so you are probably better off adding it to the tea after removing it from the heat .
These products are called thickeners . Gum Arabic is often used for this as well as karageenan , xanthan gum , sometimes corn starch or potato starch . You have to experiment with the different thickeners so you get the consistency you want .
Refrigerate it and the fat will get on top of the water .
Gloves are annoying and , much like condoms , do obscure sensation and -- in the case of kitchen work -- precision with your fingers . For those reasons I avoid them wherever possible . As a lifelong nailbiter ( from when I was about 9 until I was 31 ) , it was a habit that was really hard to give up . But it has been worth it , not just professionally . I know this is n't the answer you 're looking for , but : stop biting your nails .
Honey , for me , makes zabaglione terribly heavy . However , you can buy Crumiel , a dehydrated honey product from the Texturas line by Albert and Ferran Adria . My understanding is that it can essentially be used as a substitute for sugar while retaining the honey flavour .
Bananas are imported unripe and then ripened in the country of sale . This ripening is achieved by forcing ethylene gas through the bananas in special pressurised rooms . Bananas naturally produce ethylene as they ripen , so you could just put them in a sealable plastic bag to contain that gas . Tomatoes also produce ethylene , so you could pop a couple of those in as well , but be aware that they 'll also ripen faster too .
If by going bad you mean becoming unsuitable for consumption due to toxicity , sugar , when stored properly , does not go bad for at least a few years . By storing properly I mean storing it in conditions of low humidity , as it absorbs humidity ( water ) from the air . This property is called hygroscopy . However , it may lose some of its mechanical properties , form " rocks " , or even solidify into your sugar container . Theoretically very wet sugar can get infested with mold , but I have not seen it happen .
The issue here is how long do you steep the tea , at what temperature , and under what conditions do you store the used tea bags ? The reason " sun tea " has been discouraged has been because of the likelihood that the tea leaves that are in the bags are contaminated with bacteria such that a long soak in luke-warm water such as that of the " sun tea " causes them to multiply to the extent that they become a serious health risk . Tea leaves are not typically pasteurized during their processing , and may carry viable bacteria and / or bacterial spores . If you were to soak the tea bad in warm water not hot enough to get a good bacterial kill initially , there may be enough viable bacteria in the tea leaves to grow during that 5 hour interval such that the next cup may be seriously dangerous ( some may divide every 15 minutes , for example ) . However , if you were to adequately kill the bacteria and spores off by a nice hot soak ( for this example , you would need to use a pressure cooker since some bacterial spores are not even killed by boiling water at atmospheric pressure ) , refrigerate the tea bag afterwards , and then reuse it 5 hours later it would likely be perfectly fine . I think the final answer to your question comes down to your own personal risk tolerance and the conditions above . If you brew in luke-warm water or for a very brief time and then leave the bags out at room temperature you are just asking for trouble and eventually you may hit the loaded chamber in your own personal Russian roulette game . For empiric answers , take your particular brewing temperature and time and compare it to the USDA tables for pasteurization . Then , look up the growth curves for the major pathogens at your storage temperature and figure out how many would likely be present after 5 hours ( 20 generations at 15 minutes per generation or 2 ^ 20 times more bacteria than viable after the brewing event at the end of the storage interval ) .
If you 're simmering it in a decent amount of liquid for a while , like curry , the slimy stuff ( mucilage ) will all go out into the curry and end up just thickening it . The okra itself wo n't be slimy . This is one of the traditional ways to thicken gumbo ! Even just stewed okra , with a decent amount of tomatoey goop , usually is n't very slimy .
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
It depends on a lot of factors : what you 're describing is n't much different from making jam , and homemade jam is good for about a month , once you open it . Assuming you got the temp high enough to kill all the bacteria , the time will depend entirely on PH and water content . The more acidic , and the less watery the better . Generally things like this freeze well though , so , when in doubt , throw it in the freezer .
Put the regular ( refined white ) sugar and molasses ( about 2 tablespoons per cup of sugar ) in a food processor and give it a spin . Use more or less molasses as needed to get the color and consistency that you want .
Speaking as a Brit - we are a nation of chip lovers :) Use an oil which can cope with the high temperature such as groundnut . For that proper chip experience ( * heart attack alert * ) add some beef dripping or lard . I add a small amount to give the chips a nice flavour . Whilst heating the oil regulary dip a chip in the oil . When it starts to bubble then it 's time to cook . If the oil is too cold the chips will absorb it and they 'll go soggy . ( This is easier to achieve with a traditional chip pan or I prefer a deep saucepan ) . For the perfect chip the potato variety is important but this is personal taste . Last seasons reds will make dark delicious chips but I prefer new potatoes which make a crisper lighter coloured chip . ( The potato variety also affects the colour when cooked ) . Finally , drain on kitchen paper and a sprinkle of salt .
Try peeling the asparagus . This would work better with <URL> . Since the outer skin of asparagus is so smooth , I can see how glaze would just slip off . Peeled asparagus will have a slightly stickier surface for the glaze to hold on to . An added bonus is that some of the glaze should penetrate if the asparagus is peeled . Be aware that peeled asparagus will cook faster than unpeeled . See also : <URL>
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
Assuming the rind chunks are fairly large , you could use a colander with fairly large holes or a metal sieve .

Why do fatty foods go with sour ones ?
In regards to the general question , our brains are wired to like fats ; they are compact sources of energy . However , too much fat in a given dish can feel unpleasant in the mouth , and acid washes that away ( in terms of perception , the same way that adding sugars changes the perception of how acidic something is ) . I believe ( by which I mean this is what I think , with no evidentiary basis whatsoever ) this is a learned response , but I could very well be wrong . The pairing of acids with fish , however , does have a scientific basis . According to <URL> : " Acid conditions cause heavy-smelling aldehydes , which accentuate the fishiness of <URL> , to react with water molecules and become nonvolatile , so that lighter alcohols dominate the aroma . " ( 2004 edition , p. 238 , hardcover )
If it 's fresh Trout with the skin on then yes , rinse the slime off . If it was frozen then you might have another problem ...
Depending on the specific application , you may ( and probably will ) get good results , but the flavor and texture will be may be slightly different when you substitute sour cream for unsweetened , unflavored yogurt . Consider that both of these products are fermented dairy . The main differences are going to be the level of fat ( based on the specific dairy item from which the product was fermented ) , and the level of acid . In many applications , because the characteristics are very similar , the outcomes will be very similar . In some uncooked sauces like tzatziki , you will probably get a delicious result , but it will be different since sour cream tastes slightly different . In cooked sauces like stroghanoff or some curries , again , the result will be similar but different . The one specific issue you may face is whether the sauce breaks , which will be dependent on the level of dairy fat in the sour cream or yogurt , not which one is being used . So you may wish to use a full-fat sour cream for cooked sauces . The one place where they are nearly freely substitute is baking , especially quick breads , where they perform nearly identically . The flavor differences are not dominant .
I believe that the best indicator of freshness is the colour of the leaves . Once they turn from green to brown , it is all over for the pesto . To boost the ' shelf-life ' of the pesto in the fridge , make sure that it is completely covered with olive oil before sealing the container .
My guess would be that you boiled the soup at some point , possibly for an extended period of time . If you bring it to a full boil the fat from the meat will emulsify and distribute itself through the liquid . This is the same stuff that foams to the top , the " scum " that a lot of recipes ( usually ones that say bring to a boil , then simmer ) tell you to skim off . I would venture to say that this distribution of the fat into the liquid is also why it tasted heavier . When making stock or soups , the most I 'll heat them is to just below boiling and keep them at that simmer for a little longer to make up for not bringing it to a boil . When making stock , I strain once through a chinois and again through a piece of cheesecloth in a chinois to help reduce the floating particulates , but this wo n't really solve the cloudiness problem ( though it will help some ) . You can also try putting it into the fridge overnight so that the fat comes to the top and solidifies , but I do n't think this will solve the problem , only help reduce it . If it 's just the stock that 's gone cloudy , <URL> has some suggestions on how to clarify it , but honestly unless you 're presenting it to guests , I see no reason to even bother . I 've made cloudy stock and clear stock before and except for a slight " heaviness " difference , the taste is generally about the same . The cloudy stock sometimes has a more oily mouth feel , but it 's not a major difference - and I 've found some people seem to prefer the soups or rices I make with a cloudy stock . If you have a hard time controlling the temperature on your range-top , you can use an oven-safe stock pot and cook it in the oven at 180 & deg ; F to keep it just below a boil . One other trick , depending on what kind of soup you were making - if you were making ( for example ) chicken soup , consider trying to turn it into a cream of chicken soup to hide the cloudy broth :)
The method I used in the past ( which might not be the best way ) is to lightly fry the food initially , drain it of all oils , and put it in the refridgerator until it is almost time to serve the large amount of food . Then you can finish deep frying the batches . The initial frying will dramatically reduce the time it takes to refry each batch . I found this was the best solution for myself as I was able to serve hot and ( almost ) fresh out of the deep fryer food to a large group of people at lot faster . I think the result is way better than if you had to store the fully deep fried food for 2 hours and had to reheat it up somehow .
Putting strong spirits in the freezer should not harm them . The solubility of air gases increases at low temperature , which is why you see bubbles as it warms up . Drinks with a lower alcohol content will be affected in the freezer . There is potential to freeze water out of anything with an alcohol content of 28 % or lower . Many people use the freezer to increase the alcohol content of their home brew in UK , by freezing water out of it - the alcohol stays in the liquid portion .
Aluminum is n't exactly toxic or harmful to the same degree as lead , <URL> . And as you 've identified , aluminum is fairly reactive . <URL> in any aluminum cooking vessel ( or utensils for that matter ) . This is an issue for three primary reasons : Absorption of aluminum is , as noted above , not necessarily healthy . Absorption of aluminum can result in a metallic flavor in your food , which is generally unpleasant . Absorption of aluminum into your food also corrodes the cooking vessel . That third is probably of the most concern here , since you 're talking about a vessel that 's under pressure when in use . Sufficient corrosion and the resulting structural weakness could ( in very rare cases ) cause a rupture and sudden pressure release , i.e. . <URL> This would take a long while to occur , and you 'd almost certainly notice the corrosion on the inside of your vessel before it became truly dangerous , but this type of problem is exactly why modern pressure cookers have such fancy pressure-sensitive locks and come with warnings all over them . They can pop if abused , and they do this in your kitchen , possibly while you 're nearby . So , extended cooking of certain acidic items ( what if you wanted to make , say , <URL> ? ) could be dangerous with long-term use , hence the warning . Such foods will also contain more aluminum than they would otherwise , and taste like it as a result . <URL> with information on the general pH levels of common foods , which may help you identify specific items of concern . Another good way to avoid this is to select a stainless steel model instead of aluminum . Stainless is more expensive and does n't heat up as quickly , but it 's not as reactive as aluminum either , so there 's less concern when cooking acidic ingredients over a long period . <URL> with comparison of features and some more specific recommendations .
If you 're not talking about very much water getting into the bowl , then these techniques should help . Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat source . For every ounce of chocolate , add one tablespoon of one of these : warm water , melted butter , vegetable oil , hot milk/cream . Stir or whisk until smooth . Add a bit more liquid if needed . Use the repaired chocolate for sauce , frosting , or a batter ( like for your brownies ! ) . It wo n't work well for coating candy . You may also want to check out <URL> on how to melt chocolate without getting it wet .
The most recent Cook 's Illustrated has a cinnamon swirl bread article that discusses this problem . According to them , the root cause is a lack of binding between the dough and filling . Gas from the yeast , and steam generated during baking , push into the spiral , creating pressure that compresses the dough and widens the gap . In the specific case of cinnamon bread , they recommend using powdered ( confectioner 's ) sugar instead of granulated , and using a large amount of cinnamon . The finer sugar dissolves more easily in moisture from the bread , quickly creating a paste that is reinforced by the cornstarch and by starches in the ground cinnamon . Misting the bread before adding the filling also helps . In order to make a sausage filling adhere to the bread , you would need a sticky , water-soluble element . Cornstarch or powdered gelatin spring to mind immediately as possibilities . The other tactic they employ is to actually expose the filling during proofing , preventing the yeast 's gas ( and later , steam ) from building up alongside the filling . Once the filling is rolled into the dough , the loaf is cut in half lengthwise . With the two halves laid side-by-side , cut face up ( exposing the filling ) , they are wound around each other , folding the left piece over the right until the end is reached ( this is called a " Russian braid " ) . The ends are pinched together , and the loaf is placed in the pan to proof . This , obviously , should help with any kind of filling , not just cinnamon sugar .
While I have n't heard of it happening for the specific ingredients you list , yes , the blender can make stuff really bitter . There are two ways this can happen . First , a chemical reaction . A blender really churns the stuff through , driving lots of air bubbles into the mixture with some force . It also causes friction heat , especially professional grade blenders like vitamix . The heat , force and large reaction surface can cause the oxygen in the air to enter a reaction with the ingredients which does n't happen when using a milder method for cutting up . Olive oil is a known culprit here , it usually turns bitter when blended , but it can happen with other stuff too . Besides oxygen , a chemical reaction can also happen between two ingredients coming from two different vegetables , which would not have been mixed well enough in the knife scenario to produce noticeable amounts of reaction product . The second possibility is releasing stuff which would have stayed " packed " without the blender . A knife will only damage the plant cells at the cut surfaces , and a blunt knife , if used with a somewhat inefficient technique , might even break very ripe vegetables along the cell walls instead of cutting through the cells . If there are mini-droplets of something bitter within the plant cells , it is possible that the blender ( which really cuts cells into pieces ) released these things . On a more macro level , it is also possible that we are not talking mini-droplets , but just plant parts which did n't get cut with the knife . Stray pepper seeds come in mind : you probably did n't cut any with the knife , they tend to be pushed by a knife instead of cut when you are cutting the pepper . The blender pulverizes everything that hits the blades , including these seeds . I can not know which of these is the most probable source , or which plant contained the bitter matter exposed/created by the blender . But the different methods of mincing vegetables are not equivalent , and can have very noticeable effects on taste and texture beyond the obvious chunk size . The bitterness you encountered is only one example . In general , use the method specified in a recipe . If you are not working from a written recipe , try out a few and see which works best .
My first reaction was to think that grapefruit seeds have cyanide , do n't they ? Nope , that 's apples , apricots and peaches . I did find an application you might find interesting : <URL> Self-made pure GSE processed without solvents is prepared by grinding the grapefruit seed and juiceless pulp , then mixing with glycerin . A few sites suggest that it 's not quite that simple , but a <URL> will give you quite a bit of reading material . If you try this , I hope you let us know how it goes !
Many of the chemicals in food responsible for how a it tastes are also the same ones which , as they escape into the air , give it it 's smell . These oils and aromatic compounds which give many spices their flavour break down or escape over time changeing the taste as they degrade . Some spices stay fresh for a long time once ground , others are well worth ( as you are finding ) doing your self . Many of these compounds react with the oxygen in air to become new ones , these would then potentialy taste stale . Other compounds may break down if light gets to them ; especially natural light as ultraviolet breaks many chemicals down . Other chemicals just evaporate away . All of these reactions depend on surface area ... so the smaller the bits of spice the faster they lose the flavor/smell chemicals . Very fresh powdered spices would n't have this issue . Also if you ground the spices yourself and then left them for a few week/months you would find much of the taste has gone from the powder .
Since it sounds like they are basically a dried out batter at this point , I would turn to implementations that rely on those kind of food-stuffs ; With some further baking and possibly additional brown sugar and butter or apple-sauce , I would use them for a crumble topping . If they are coffee and cinnamon an apple-cardamom cobbler would benefit nicely . The crumbles could be incorporated into a biscuit batter recipe In all likelihood , any kind of recipe that relies on a granola could probably be referenced for further ideas . You could also use the crumble as a stand-in for oat based no-bakes . The no-bakes might feel mealy to the tooth , so not entirely eliminating the oat might work best . If you wanted to repurpose , you might try thinking of it as a material to be suspended . With an ingredient like well-blended coconut butter ( not to be confused with coconut oil or milk or cream ) you could create a base with which to make a kind of post-raw bar cookie ( basically press and chill the coconut butter in a pan on top of wax/parchment paper , pulse the muffin bits with some dates or brown rice syrup , and once the butter sets press the bits/dates mixture into the top and drizzle with some ganache or whatever ) .
Just slice it into thin discs ( a mandoline is quick ) and the kids use it as chips 'n' dip . Try some natural or Greek style yoghurt and whole seed mustard as a dip . Very crunchy and tasty If the skin is dry or blotchy I quickly run the potato peeler over it first Otherwise , just grating it into soups or stews is a nice vegetable filler EDIT Doh , forgot the best thing to use it for Coleslaw , it replaces cabbage perfectly . Or you can mix cabbage and broccoli . Just coarse grate it with some carrot , onion . Blend it up with a little mayo and yoghurt , or lemon juice and olive oil . Add some ground fennel and cumin seeds or some chopped mint for extra zing
I 'd say that it 's not that we ca n't make cast iron pans as good as the old ones . It 's that for most companies that 's not where the money is . A company does n't make money by making super high quality cast iron ( " like the old stuff " ) that costs $ 100-200 per pan and selling them to a few cast iron enthusiasts ( those prices are random , I do n't actually know how much those would cost if they were made , but it would be a lot more than the current price ) . They make money by selling $ 15-30 cast iron cookware to loads and loads of consumers . Back in the day when manufacturing was n't as automated and people were involved in the process at a lot of steps , it did n't add much incremental cost to also sandblast and polish the surfaces , yielding the super-smooth surfaces that you used to see . Now , when lots of the manufacturing process is automated , adding in the additional time adds significantly to the cost of the product percentage wise . So , could we do it ? Yeah , sure . But big companies wo n't . I just suggest making your own :) As a side comment , newer cast iron is n't as nice as the old stuff for a number of reasons , but I use the newer style cast iron all the time ( my mom has not yet bequeathed me her old cast iron pans ) and it works great . Not as non-stick , heavier , and so forth , but still excellent for cooking .
This is not true anymore , and modern recipes omit that part . Back then , when silverware was made either from silver or pre-stainless-steel-alloys the acid in sourdough ( and other foods * ) would interact with the metal and corrode/color the metal and/or spoil the food . So put your sourdough in your ( stainless steel ) mixing bowl and knead it in your kitchen machine as you like . * examples ( thanks to @Stephie ) : eggs ( there were special egg-spoons made from horn or tortoise shell and later bakelite or plastic to prevent the sulphur in the eggs interacting with the metal ) , marmelade/jam ( special spoons , jam would get runny if it got in contact with the wrong spoon ) , potatoes ( there is a rule to not cut them with a knife ) .
Looking at the USDA database , roasting the almonds does not affect the calcium levels ( comparing equivalent weights ) . Look at the value per 100g or value per ounce rather than volume-based values and you 'll see what I mean . Raw almonds average 269mg of calcium per 100g ( or 76mg per ounce ) . <URL> Dry roasted almonds average 268mg of calcium per 100g ( also 76mg per ounce ) . <URL>
From wikipedia : Sour cream or soured cream is a dairy product rich in fats obtained by fermenting a regular cream by certain kinds of lactic acid bacteria . The bacterial culture , introduced either deliberately or naturally , sours and thickens the cream . Although sour cream is only mildly sour in taste , its name stems from the production of lactic acid by bacterial fermentation , a process referred to as " souring " . . Crème fraiche ( French pronunciation : [ kʁɛm fʁɛʃ ] , " fresh cream " ; from French crème fraîche ) is a soured cream containing about 28 % butterfat and with a pH of around 4.5 . It is soured with bacterial culture , but is thicker , and less sour than sour cream . From answers.yahoo.com : I am a former chef and there is a big difference , sour cream is made with milk , cream and thickeners and gums to keep it together , creme fraiche is just thickened cream with a souring agent , I made it as a chef with just whipping cream and buttermilk , you can use S.C as a substitute for creme fraiche , but the sour cream has to be a full fat , 15 % or higher , here in Canada I can buy one that is 30 % and C.F is 35-40 % BF . Just make sure if your using it in hot dishes not to boil it or it will split , C.F does not , or add a little cornstarch to the S.C and add it in the last 2-4 minutes of light simmering .
It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container . If the moisture is at a safe ( low ) level , then mold wo n't grow . See for example , <URL> , which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8 % for retail storage/shipping , although if you look at their data table , it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5 % range ( which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool , dry place ) . Honestly , cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities . Most likely what you 're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats ( the process which causes rancidity ) without actual full-blown rancidity . Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure . If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer ( sealed , to prevent contamination or off-odours ) . Although most ( all ? ) nuts are considered shelf-stable , they do keep longer in the fridge or freezer .

Are feral hog hind quarters hams , or a different type of pork ?
They would be fresh hams , the hindquarter of a pig . The word ham , unmodified , implies a cured product . I would imagine that for a feral hog , if you are willing to risk eating it , that you should cook to the highest temperature reasonable , which in the case of a fresh ham might be at least 180 F , and as high as 200 F . The best application at these ranges would be making puiled pork , which requires long , low , and slow cooking ; smoking is definitely an option . See also <URL> , although for a pork butt , should be easily adaptable to the fresh ham , which is similar , although not quite as fatty and full of connective tissue , so it wo n't be quite as tender when done .

A few things ... I brine for 12-24 hours . It really does make a difference . Do n't bother browning the meat ... you do n't want a crust , you want the meat to break down . Make your own barbecue sauce ! There 's a zillion recipes , and it always tastes better . When I make pulled pork , I take the cooking liquid ( you are cooking in liquid , yeah ? ) and reduce it right down to almost a demiglace , and use that as the base for my bbq sauce .
No , there is no reason they should . Bacteria feed on carbohydrates , not on fats . ( This is why oil does n't spoil outside of the fridge - it is pure fat ) . So it is the amount of milk sugar which is important for the bacteria , and it is the same regardless of the fat content . Also , the spoiled milk is not more or less sour at the end . The other important factors are initial bacteria count and storage temperature . You ca n't do anything about the bacteria count , and ca n't know what it is . The storage temperature is , of course , your fridge temperature , which should be in the small range of 0-4 ° C . The other factor is the type of pasteurization . Traditional pasteurization makes a milk with a shelf life of 7 days , ESL gives it a shelf life of 21 days , and UHT milk can last for months , uncooled . Once opened , each of these types spoils within 3-4 days . And then , normally pasteurized milk goes really sour , partly even separating into curdles and whey . ESL and UHT milks get slightly more bitter , but not much , and they stay liquid and do n't change their odour or colour . Unless you pay lots of attention to the taste , you ca n't tell when ESL milk is spoiled . But this happens the same way no matter the fat content .
The best resource I 've seen is here at <URL> . Egg yolk produces a shiny and dark look but remains soft . Egg white is still soft but less shiny . Milk and water only darken it slightly and produce what the article calls a ' satin ' look . Butter makes it shiny , smooth , rich , and well , buttery !
I 've been making rum-based vanilla extract successfully at home for years . Here are my recommendations . Your basic ingredients are 80 proof rum , sugar and vanilla beans . At the recommended proportions , the rum and sugar are plenty effective preservatives . You can use either light or dark rum , but it should be a good " call " 80 proof rum and not a bargain bottom shelf rum . I most often use Ron Rico . If you use a golden rum , your extract will have a warmer taste suitable for spicy treats such as pumpkin pie or spice cookies . If you use a silver rum , your vanilla will have a purer taste suitable for whipped cream or custard sauces . I get rum that is bottled in glass , because I think plastic imparts an off flavor . Your basic recipe will use a fifth less about a 1/2 cup of rum , four vanilla beans and 1/2 cup of organic sugar . We 'll go through that first , and then talk about variations . Place your vanilla beans on a clean , flat cutting surface . Using a small , sharp knife , cut them first in 1/2 crosswise at the middle . Then take each 1/2 bean and insert the knife tip just 1/2 to an inch below the uncut end and carefully slice lengthwise to the send . Repeat this process gently and carefully on each piece unti each piece has four lengthwise quarters attached at the uncut end . Some recipes will tell you to scrape some or all of the paste out of the beans , but this is not necessary . The simply split beans will infuse the rum just fine . Pour out about a cup of rum from your fifth and set aside . Put your sliced vanilla beans into the rum . Use a funnel to add 1/2 cup of organic sugar . Use the reserved rum you set aside to top the bottle back up . Recap the bottle and give it about 20 shakes to encourage the sugar to dissolve . Set aside in a dark cabinet or pantry . Take it out and give it a few shakes every week or so . Your vanilla will be usable but not fully extracted in about two months . It will continue to strengthen in flavor out to about 6 months of age . Once you are satisfied with your extract , you can decant some and bottle it up in smaller bottles . It 's a very popular gift for bakers . Once you have tried vanilla extract made this way , you will never want to go back to store-bought . The difference is indescribable . You can vary the type of rum you use , silver or gold , and you can vary the sugar . I mostly stick with light organic sugar , because I think the taste is better . I like the combination of dark rum and brown organic sugar very well . You can also increase the sugar up to about 2/3 cup in a fifth bottle , but I would n't go above that . Sugar gives the extract more body and mellows the flavor . Check out Wikipedia to learn more about the various kinds of vanilla beans available . I use the organic ones from my food coop , but different kinds can be ordered online or found at specialty food stores . A number of cooking blogs have instructions on making extracts or tinctures of other spices . There is no reason not to create combination flavors .
According to Cooking The Roman Way by David Downie , Fettucine Alfredo is a traditional Roman recipe called " pasta del cornuti " ( cuckold 's pasta ) . What either Alfredo Di Lelio III , or Mario Mozzetti , depending on whom you believe , invented in 1914 , was the dramatic tableside preparation of Fettuccine Alfredo , which is what made the dish a hit with visiting Americans in the 20 's and 30 's . The tableside preparation is really what makes Fettuccine Alfredo what it is : the hot pasta is tossed with the butter and cheese in front of the diner , and then served to them immediately . Again , according to Downie , the only ingredients of Fettuccine Alfredo are egg fettuccine , lots of butter , lots of Parmegiano-Reggiano , and ( if necessary ) a little salt . Recipes which add cream or milk are Americanized recipes designed to allow restaurants to hold orders of Alfredo for a long time under heat lamps ( and turn it into a gooey pasty mess ) . Italians , from my experience visiting Italy , rarely put cream or milk on pasta ( a real Italian could speak up here ) . Downie has a fun 3-page digression about the ongoing lawsuits between the Roman families who claim to own the name . It 's worth a read . Alan Davidson , predictably , says nothing about Fettuccine Alfredo . The Glorious Pasta of Italy likewise does not cover the dish . Wikipedia supports Downie 's story , except only attributing Di Lelio , and adding the tidbit that Di Lelio apparently called it " Fettuccine al burro " ( fettuccine with butter ) , and the Alfredo name was appended later when it was copied in the USA . Wikipedia also says butter and cheese only , on fettuccine pasta . So , to answer your question and the questions asked in the comments : Fettuccine Alfredo is an Italian dish , if more popular in the USA than in Italy . It is a variation of a traditional Italian dish . In its traditional form , it has only egg pasta , butter , and cheese . The pasta for Alfredo is egg fettuccine .
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
Assuming you 're talking about ggaennip , also known as shiso , it 's quite common to use it raw or salt-pickled . There are two common varieties , red and green-leafed , and to my taste there are some subtle differences between the Korean , Japanese , and maybe Vietnamese varieties . In Korea and Vietnam , ggaennip is frequently used to wrap foods ( ssam bap , for example , or the Vietnamese turmeric crepe ) . Shiso can be used to wrap foods , as a garnish , or chopped and served on some things , like grilled chicken ( yakitori ) as a flavor contrast . I do n't see much point in cooking shiso or yukari , but I 've cooked the red pepper and salt pickled version sold in cans ( or sometimes in the freshly made kimchi section ) by adapting it into a sort of variation on the mediterranean dolma . It retains much of the flavor , but is different than the raw leaf and mellower than just the pickle it starts from . I do appreciate shiso tempura , so I 'm not dogmatic about not-cooking , and there is certainly precedent for some cooked applications . I 've also made an agedashi-doufu , deep fried tofu in soup stock , which had shiso added before it was coated for deep frying . Shiso/gaennip is now popularly used in a drink that has added lemon juice or citric acid , but I 've only seen this as a concentrate or prepared beverage , so it 's possible that it requires some industrial techniques to retain the flavor when making a syrup . Dried salted shiso , called yukari in Japanese , is also used raw , but often mixed into warm rice either as a topping or to make onigiri .
Major ways of thickening a sauce -- or , for that matter , some other liquid : Starch ( e.g. , flour , cornstarch , tapioca , arrowroot ) Emulsion ( e.g. , butter , cream , yolk , mustard , blending in lecithin-and-fat ) Coagulated protein ( e.g. , blood , egg , pureed seafood ) Gels/polysaccharides ( gelatin , alginate , xanthan , pectin , agar agar , guar gum ) Suspension ( general puree of solids ) Note that some of the examples of one category can also fit into another .
With a pork tenderloin : Season the meat , sear all sides in a very hot pan , and then finish in the oven at 350 ° F ( 175 ° C ) degrees until the internal temp . hits 145 ° F ( 63 ° C ) . Then let it sit for 10 minutes , and cut ' er up . If you need it done faster , a higher oven temp will accomplish this , but may compromise quality . But like I said , for a tenderloin , you do n't want too low , or too high . Just watch the internal temperature , that is the key .
This sounds yummy ! I 'd recommend cooking sous vide ( SV ) as you suggest ( 130 F for 1-3 hrs ) . I tend not to season in the SV bag at all because salt &amp; spices often turn out oddly ; for example , raw herbs/onion/garlic are far stronger and taste " uncooked " . Figuring out how to spice SV takes a fair amount of experimentation and is best done with dried &amp; powdered herbs/spices instead of fresh ones . VERY IMPORTANT : Before cooking SV trim excess fat from the steak After cooking take the meat from the SV bag and DRY it thoroughly before searing ! If you 're planning to use bag juices , first bring them to a full boil in another pot and skim off the scum ( myoglobin " blood " ) , then use whatever is left as your meat juice . To sear , pre-heat the cast iron sear to a very high temperature ( ~ 500 ) and use a high-temperature oil like peanut . The sear should be at VERY high heat for only 30 seconds or so per side - if you leave it on much longer you 'll lose the beautiful 130 degree edge-to-edge miracle that should be your reward . Using butter for the sear is not a good idea as either the butter will be destroyed by the properly high heat OR the steak will be destroyed by keeping the cast iron 's heat low enough for the butter . Rather , use compound butter as a topper for presentation . As for using a torch , I 've used a brulee torch a few times and the heat &amp; coverage is insufficient to sear a steak well with my limited experience . You can sign your name on the steak with it , but getting a good , even edge-to-edge Maillard crust is very tough . Using a MAPP torch is quite a bit better ; MAPP gas is flavorless , it 's hotter than propane or butane , and MAPP torches tend to fan out broader flames , but I still do n't think they create as dense or flavorful a crust as a pan-sear . Moreover ANY torch runs a likelihood of flat-out burning areas of the meat , and that 's especially true for a first-timer ! Let 's talk about salt before going any further . I 've always salted meat before grilling . But SV is a completely different ballgame . Salting before SV does n't add much flavor for you on short cooks and hurts badly on longer ones ( cures the meat ) . There are online arguments about this , but I prefer salting only after SV and preferably after searing . Taste tests support this post-SV salting approach - check out <URL> for a great take on the subject . If you keep the searing time appropriately short you wo n't have to rest the meat before serving . The meat is still incredibly juicy and does n't need time to reabsorb fluids . As for what to do with a sauce , I 'd go for the butter instead and incorporate a steak-friendly sauce into a side dish . A quality hunk of well-marbled dry-aged beef should sing with this preparation and I 'd put it center-stage to sing solo , with the side dish 's sauce grooving nearby ready to join in on the chorus .
In my " expert " opinion as a great lover of all things pork , I say yes , that marinade will be fine overnight . It 's quite acidic , and that 's a concern , but it 's not so acidic as to create mush . You 'll be fine marinating overnight . As a matter of fact , I 'm surprised that the recipe does n't say " 2 hours up to overnight " .
In my experience at expensive tempura restaurants , sesame oil is almost always used at least as part of the blend , but my understanding is that it is not the roasted kind , which has far too low a smoke point . I 've been to a restaurant in Izu , now closed , where it was obvious because we were seated right in front of the fryer and the smell was quite noticeable , and the fancy place I went to in Tokyo was apparently using sesame oil as well , but they had more effective ventilation , so it was mostly obvious from the flavorfulness of the results . I 've seen unroasted sesame oil in middle-eastern markets and I know some companies sell it in the US , so it is obtainable , and I 've seen it at about $ 40/gallon on Amazon . I also know from experience that a blend of the roasted sesame oil and neutral , high-smoke-point oil will have a higher smoke point than just straight roasted sesame oil , and will add flavor , so it 's at least possible that some people do that . At home and at inexpensive restaurants , other vegetable oils are frequently used , and there 's a simple tempura set that you can buy as a gift pack that I 've seen used as a winter gift . This is usually cottonseed oil or a blend . In some regions , an ambiguous blend called " salad oil " is commonly used . It is not unheard of to use tea seed oil ( camellia ) , which is increasingly available in the US at Asian markets ( when I ran a specialty import business , I used to sell sell some that a Chinese tea importer was purchasing until he shifted his focus to larger packages suitable for restaurant use ) . The Japanese entry for tenpura on Wikipedia confirms that a custom blend of sesame , cottonseed and other oils is often used at tempura shops . The Tokyo style and Kansai style is a bit different , with many Tokyo shops serving a darker version thanks in part to sesame oil and egg , and Kansai region versions leaning a bit whiter thanks either to using neutral vegetable oils or lack of egg . I 've used canola oil but it tends to leave an unpleasant aroma in the air , especially after the second use . If I were in the US and on a budget , I 'd probably choose peanut oil , but it will taste different than most of what I 've seen in Japan . I doubt that I 've ever encountered peanut oil-fried tempura in Japan , though there 's a chance I just did n't notice . In practice , I 've found that the most important thing to get good results from homemade tempura is to prevent overloading the fryer , because the temperature will drop too quickly . This is true for other kinds of fried goods as well , but is far more important for tempura because the coating should be fairly thin . As an unpracticed amateur , I 've found that using a modest amount of katakuriko or cornstarch in the flour blend helps produce crisper results . It 's fairly difficult to get an assortment of different items to be ready at the same time , so consider making it in " courses " if you want flawless results , or make only one or two items at a time . Tempura restaurants tend to have wide , slightly shallow fryers , whereas most fryers meant for western deep-frying tend to have several stations of deep pots , since it 's ok in many cases for things to be submerged , like when making french fries . It 's quite unusual for tempura to be completely submerged . Edited to add : Assuming you 're coating with a batter ( there are some types that are dusted with flour or katakuriko rather than a full batter ) , I get far better results by keeping the batter ( or the flour ) very cold .
This information should be indicated on the label : sweet , sweet &amp; sour , spicy , smoked ... Generic paprika is sweet and will probably not have much flavor ( that is why paprika can be used in paella together with saffron - see <URL> )
One thing you also might want to consider when making pickles is the process of heating versus not . I recently learned that the crispy store bought pickles are pickled at low temps ( my preferred method ) , where as softer pickles were most likely heated first . Not sure which method you are using , but this may help as you move forward . My step-mother recently made some awesome pickles with chilies and dill and garlic but heated them first in the canning process and they turned out a bit too soft for my liking . Regarding salt ... I happen to agree with Adam 's comment on the brine . I usually confirm salt is dissolved before it goes into the pickling solution , so it 's not a problem . In that respect , a good quality salt , regardless of shape and size should be used ( feel free to grind it in a mortar with a pestle if you think it should be finer ) . I happen to use coarse Kosher from Morton for most things ...
The simple answer is no , you can not convert monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats through cooking alone . Before I can even begin to answer in detail , I have to start by pointing out that " saturated " and " unsaturated " fat is already an oversimplification . These are very rough classifications of fats and the chemical reality is far more nuanced . I 'd encourage you read the Wikipedia entry on <URL> for a relatively basic explanation . Fatty acids are actually classified , chemically , in three different ways : The existence of double bonds ( CH = CH ) somewhere in the molecular structure . Fatty acids with double bounds are unsaturated . Fatty acids with single bonds only are saturated . The chain length ( number of Carbon-Hydrogen groups ) . Another distinguishing characteristic of saturated fatty acids is that they are generally ( maybe always ) long-chain . The reverse is not necessarily true , however ; not all long-chain fatty acids are saturated . The configuration , either cis or trans . Trans fatty acids are not actually a different type of fat in the same sense as saturated vs. unsaturated ; they are actually unsaturated fatty acids , just in a different configuration . Although certain studies suggest that it is possible to create TFAs from edible oils with prolonged heat , it is also extremely difficult , to the extent that it 's nearly impossible to do in meaningful quantities by accident . I will refer you to <URL> which says that after 8 hours of heating at 180 ° C , the researchers found up to 6.5 mg of trans isomers per 1.0 g of oil , which comes out to a grand total of 0.65 % by mass . This is practically nil as far as a home cook is concerned - these quantities only matter if you 're doing commercial processing of vegetable oils , or maybe if you 're using the oil for deep-frying and you reuse it dozens of times ( far beyond what any experienced fry cook would recommend ) . The study also says that edible oils ( i.e. the ones you cook with ) experienced less isomerization than other kinds . So really , the amount of isomerization you 're going to get ( conversion of the " good " cis isomers to " bad " trans isomers ) is minuscule and simply insignificant as far as mainstream baking or frying applications are concerned . So forget about trans fats . Can you create saturated fats ? That would effectively mean breaking down the double bonds into single bonds . In order to do that , you need to add hydrogen ( that 's why saturated fatty acids are " saturated " - more hydrogen ) . There 's a name for this process , which you actually stumbled upon in your question . It 's called <URL> . It 's adding hydrogen atoms to an unsaturated ( double-bonded ) fatty acid . Hydrogenation requires a substrate ( involving benzene or some other hydrocarbon ) , a hydrogen source ( that 's pure , dangerous , H2 gas ) , and a catalyst ( heavy metal ) . My guess is that your kitchen has none of those things , unless you 're cooking in a chemistry lab . So there is simply no chance for you to accidentally hydrogenate your oils . What you really need to be more worried about with oils ( unsaturated fats ) is <URL> . That 's the oxidative breakdown and , eventually , rancidity of fats , and polyunsaturated fats are particularly prone to this . Heat is a catalyst for peroxidation , so if you " burn " your oil ( or other fats ) , you may end up creating the same sorts of free radicals normally associated with rancidity due to improper storage . The long-term effect of these free radicals is not firmly established but the consensus seems to be that <URL> ( cancer risk and so on ) . So do n't worry about converting your oils when you cook with them . It 's practically impossible . You should be more concerned with overheating them or letting them go rancid in storage .
I do n't think there is any " standard " type of vinegar worlwide . In recipes for French dishes , an unspecified vinegar can be assumed to be a red wine vinegar . Mien seems to have a different opinion , so I 'd say it 's pretty much a cultural issue .
All of the sources I read say the same thing ... what makes them different is that they 're fried twice . From <URL> : Frites are the supercharged cousin to paltry American-style fries : made from soft Belgian potatoes called bintjes , they 're thick-cut and -- this is key -- double-fried ( in the olden days , in molten horse or ox fat , though modern options range from lard to vegetable oil ) . Served in a paper cone with mayo and ketchup , properly executed frites -- the ones that have been fried , dried , then carefully fried again -- are an addictive riot of textures : soft and fluffy on the inside , surrounded by a crunchy , greaseless crust , dipped in luxuriously flavorful sauces . From <URL> : There is no fancy skill involved in making these crispy fries , but there is a trick . The potatoes are fried twice . The first time cooks them through and makes them tender . The second time , which can be done hours later just before serving , turns them golden brown and deliciously crisp . From a site <URL> : So high time time for a ( simple ) definition of what makes fries Belgian Fries : freshly cut , irregularly shaped cooked ( fried ) twice fluffy on the inside , crispy on the outside a distinct potato taste at least 10 mm thick preferably served in a paper cone Some sites mention the importance of certain fats or types of potato but the one similarity for all sites is the fact that they 're double fried .

Why stir sourdough only with wooden spoons ?
This is not true anymore , and modern recipes omit that part . Back then , when silverware was made either from silver or pre-stainless-steel-alloys the acid in sourdough ( and other foods * ) would interact with the metal and corrode/color the metal and/or spoil the food . So put your sourdough in your ( stainless steel ) mixing bowl and knead it in your kitchen machine as you like . * examples ( thanks to @Stephie ) : eggs ( there were special egg-spoons made from horn or tortoise shell and later bakelite or plastic to prevent the sulphur in the eggs interacting with the metal ) , marmelade/jam ( special spoons , jam would get runny if it got in contact with the wrong spoon ) , potatoes ( there is a rule to not cut them with a knife ) .
I can not imagine that sanding and buffing a wooden spoon would have any useful culinary applications , although I suppose it might feel smoother to the touch . Generally when you season something wooden for food preparation , the purpose is to create a protective layer to avoid warping or impregnation . If I really wanted to season a spoon , I would season it the same way as a wooden cutting board : Use a food-grade mineral oil and rub it in thoroughly with a cloth or paper towel , then repeat as necessary after it is dry . Like hobodave , however , I have never done this nor heard of it being done . The cost of a wooden spoon is probably less than the cost of the mineral oil you 'd need to season one . If your spoon starts to warp or take on strange odours , just buy a new one . N.B. I can think of one exception , which is if the spoon takes on a fuzzy texture when you get it wet . In that case , sanding it would be done in the context of <URL> . But once again , it 's extremely rare that you 'd need to do this with a cooking utensil - this is a far more common requirement for homemade ( i.e. DIY ) wood products .
Why stove top and why oven ? The stove top provides high heat for searing , which generates browning ( the famous <URL> ) which creates delicious , savory flavor components . The oven provides an even , gentle heat for longer cooking without burning . The beauty of the braise Braising is a technique where a food , usually a meat , is cooked slowly in a moist environment , partially covered with water . It is an ideal technique for tougher , generally less expensive meats , because it converts collagen to gelatin , changing the meat from tough to meltingly tender and wonderful . Braising is more common than you might think . Chili con carne , and pot roast , osso bucco and coque au vin are all braised recipes . Searing and braising Many braising recipes start with a sear , which is most commonly done stove top , because of the high intense heat that is easy to generate . Alternate methods would be to use a broiler or an outdoor grill , but these are often not as convenient . The purpose is to generate the savory flavors ( not as the old kitchen myth said , " to seal in juices " ) . Then the dish is finished in its liquid ( which will later usually become the sauce ) at a much more gentle cooking pace . Braising is flexible You can braise in the oven . The advantage is the heat is very even and predictable , and you can just let the pot sit in the oven for 2 , 3 , or even 4 hours without worrying about burning or sticking . You can braise on the stove top , with a gentle flame ( or lower electric element setting ) . You simply adjust to leave the pot contents at a slow simmer ( bubbles form lazily , not continuously ) . There is slighty more risk of burning , and the occassional stir might not hurt , but especially with a good pan , no risk . So almost any braising recipe can be easily converted to be stovetop only , by simply ... erm ... using the stove top for the long braising time . I prefer the oven personally , but that is a matter of convenience and easy control . Quality cookware Quality cookware like good multi-ply stainless steel , or your now famous dutch oven ( from your previous questions ) is ideal for braising because it can be used for both the sear ( just like a cast iron pan ) and for the slow braising portion . No need to dirty two pots or pans . Recipes that are just stovetop There are a countless myriad recipes that you can cook in your cast iron just on the stove top . Anything : Fried Deep fried Boiled Braised The one thing you may choose to avoid doing is highly acidic recipes , like tomato sauce , which are not great for your seasoning . On the other hand , in rotation with other recipes that rebuild the seasoning , or just doing some direct seasoning , there is no true harm done either . Recipes that are just the oven There are many recipes that would only be done in the oven . Many braises skip the searing part . Even recipes that call for it can be done without , at some loss of flavor . Any recipe you see for a crockpot can be done in a dutch oven in the regular oven .
By your description I would say it 's taro or 芋头 ( yu tao ) in chinese <URL> It can be bought in most chinese supermarkets For more info <URL>
It 's the same idea as puff pastry , when the layers of oil/fat heat up they expand and make air pockets in the dough which gives the flaky consistency . The fat or oil needs to be layered and not amalgamated to get the flaky layers . If it was spread throughout the dough randomly it would be a more spongy texture . The other name for this is laminated dough . In short the layering of dough and fat/oil are to generate texture .
A few tips : Marinate the meat first ( after chopping , before stir-frying ) ; Mix the sauce first - do n't just dump the ingredients separately into the wok ; Add corn starch or tapioca flour to the sauce to thicken it . I would n't even call it a sauce without any thickening agent . About 1 tbsp per cup of sauce should be alright . ( Note : The sauce should be about 50-60 % water , do n't use a whole cup of soy sauce ! ) Add some other savoury or flavour-enhancing ingredients to the sauce - i.e. toasted sesame oil , rice vinegar , brown sugar/honey . And ditch the oregano . Briefly steam the vegetables in the wok - add just a little bit of the sauce , then cover it for a few minutes . This will make them much more tender after frying . ( Note that this only applies to hard vegetables like carrots , celery , broccoli , etc. - add the soft vegetables afterward ) Add minced garlic with the ginger . The two go together like white on rice .
make waffles ! that 's what we do with ours , besides bread . sourdough waffles with syrup have this great sweet/sour balance going on that is really wonderful .
Robert Cartaino 's answer hits a main point : sourdough cultures are adapted to what they are typically fed . When switching flours , it may take a while for the culture to adjust . The starter may seem a bit sluggish at first . That said , I would NOT recommend trying to start a wheat culture if you already have a healthy starter that began with rye . There are two main reasons . First , rye is particularly rich in certain sugars and food that natural yeasts tend to like , so rye starters naturally tend to look more " lively " than wheat starters , especially in the early stages of a starter . Part of what you may be seeing in your transition to wheat is simply less activity produced because the food source is less rich in nutrients , not necessarily because the yeast and bacteria ca n't digest it . Second , a lot of recipes to generate new starters recommend using rye at the beginning , regardless of what you ultimately plan to feed the starter . Because it provides a strong food source for young cultures , it 's usually a lot easier to begin with rye ( perhaps this is why you did ) . In my experience , it tends to take new wheat starters at least twice as long to get strongly established compared to rye , and there 's a higher chance of failure if you do n't use a good recipe . For both of these reasons , some people even recommend always feeding your starter with rye flour , even if you tend to make wheat-based bread . Since many people have success doing that ( and I have personally ) , I do n't think you need to begin a whole new culture with wheat alone . If your starter really is sluggish ( and not just a little less active than it was with rye ) , you can help your starter to adapt to the new food . I 'm not sure what your typical feeding routine is or what the hydration level of your starter is . But the general thing to do in these circumstances is to dilute your starter and feed it large quantities of the new food . For example , if you maintain 200 grams of your starter normally , I would discard all but maybe 40-50 grams and then add enough new flour and water to get back to 200 grams in whatever your usual proportion is . ( Some people would be even more extreme in diluting the starter and cut the starter proportion even further . ) Within a few days of feedings like this , you will have strongly selected the yeast and bacteria that thrive on whole wheat and your starter should be strong again . After a week of feedings like this , I doubt you could distinguish the performance of your starter from one that was begun on wheat . ( Note that the specific microorganisms may still be slightly different , but your starter should do a fine job raising dough and providing flavor . )
Mineral oil is your friend As you said , Ana , the biggest enemy of a clean -- and warp-free -- wood cutting board is moisture penetration . The first trick to fight this is to wipe down your cutting board fairly often with mineral oil or other food-safe wood treatment . This helps with cleaning as it prevents liquids and bacteria from penetrating into the wood . It also has the nice effect of helping to keep flavors from embedding and transferring to other foods . Scrape it . Scrape it good . The second trick is to use a sturdy steel scraper to clean the surface as you go , scraping out excess moisture after each round of cutting before it can penetrate too deeply into the wood . This is something you 'll especially want to do with an end-grain cutting block , which is much more absorbent than other grains . Soap &amp; water is ( mostly ) all you need When I 'm done , I usually wash with light soap &amp; hot water on the board , followed by a good hard scrape with the steel scraper , so I have a nice dry , fresh surface for the next use . And store that board on its edge , not flat ! This promotes even drying and prevents warping . It 's science The smart people at America 's Test Kitchen used science n ' stuff and found that <URL> at killing bacteria , though the USDA recommends an application of bleach dilute to really sanitize that bad boy . Maintained board = clean board Notable board maker , Boos , has a good list of <URL> , including these related to cleaning : Periodically ( once every 3-4 weeks , depending upon the use and household conditions ) , apply an even coat of Boos ® Mystery Oil and Boos Block ® Board Cream to all surfaces of your wood cutting board . The Boos ® Mystery Oil acts as a shampoo that contains oils and minerals that penetrates through the wood surface to increase its longevity . Next , you will want to use the Boos Block ® Board Cream , that acts as the conditioner , to seal the top coating of the wood surface . DO NOT allow moisture of any type to stand on the cutting board for long periods of time . Do n't let fresh , wet meats lay on the board longer than necessary . Brine , water and blood contain much moisture , which soaks into the wood , causing the cutting board to expand , the wood to soften , and affects the strength , of the glued joints . Use a good steel scraper or spatula several times a day , as necessary , to keep the cutting surface clean and sanitary . Scraping the surfaces will remove 75 % of the moisture . Do not use a steel brush on the cutting surface of your board . DO NOT cut fish or fowl on the work surface of your cutting board , unless you have thoroughly followed the instructions in step # 1 . The moisture barrier must be intact prior to cutting any type of fish , seafood , or fowl on the work surface of your cutting board . ALWAYS CLEAN THE CUTTING BOARD SURFACE THOROUGHLY AFTER CUTTING FISH OR FOWL ON THE WORK SURFACE . Sanitize cutting board by wiping all surfaces down with mild dish soap and water . Dry throughly . DO NOT wash your wood cutting board with harsh detergents of any type . DO NOT wash your butcher 's tools on your cutting board surface . DO NOT put Boos Block ® wood cutting boards into dishwasher . Happy chopping !
Admittedly I have only stored my starter in a glass jar , but I would n't want anything else . You should look for a size that is neither too large , nor too small . It should comfortably hold your sourdough starter when you are simply feeding it - I usually store 200g of starter , at 100 % hydration ( 100g flour , 100g water ) or thereabouts . However , when actually making sourdough starter you make more - perhaps 400g or so , depending on how much bread you are making , plus you want to have something left to restart your bread . A typical recipe might call for 20 % starter , so 200g for a kilo loaf . The other solution is to of course have two separate jars , and only use both when doubling for bread . When I say it must be able to hold that much , I mean that it will have to hold it fully risen , which means around 2x to 2.5 x of the original size . In addition , narrow and high is better than low and wide , since it makes it easier to tell how much it rises . Also , you will want a wide opening , so that you can easily clean it . As for covering it , I just use a sheet of plastic . Just take care not to get it gooey . It will hold in the moisture so the sourdough does n't dry out , but wo n't trap the carbon dioxide . Good luck
From : <URL> Can sizes change over time , important if you are adapting an older recipe . Prior to 1980 's ) , # 303 was the popular size for most fruits and vegetables. ; No. 303 = 16-17 oz . ( 1 lb.-1 lb.-1 oz . ) = 2 cups = 4 servings ; Principal size for fruits and vegetables . Also some meat products , ready-to-serve soups , specialties . Tomato paste has , as far as I know , always come in size 1/2 ( 6 ounce ) cans , at least since I began using it , starting in the mid 1960s . Think this is what you are looking for . There are lots of information bits on line , search ; ' can sizes ' . cheers
More or less , yes . Just know that eggs of different species have different " flavors . " There may be some issues with substituting in dishes due to varying fat content of the yolks and such ... I 've had duck and goose egg quiches . I 've had fried quail eggs on toast . I have yet to try an ostrich or emu egg .
<URL> describes the process by which yeast is commercially prepared in good detail for an overview . There are several stages of cultivation and growing and increasing the yeast biomass , culminating as its final steps : Treatments and packaging The yeast in the final trade bioreactor is concentrated by centrifugation and finally harvested by a filter press or a rotary vacuum filter , until it contains 27 -- 33 % of dry cell mass . The yeast cake is blended with suitable amounts of water and emulsifiers and cutting oils ( soybean or cottonseed oil ) to obtain its extrudable form . The yeast is then packaged and shipped as compressed fresh baker 's yeast , or thermolysed and dried to form various types of dry yeast . The dried yeast is packed under vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere . The packaging method varies among manufacturers and depends on the type of yeast product . Note that this process requires assorted items of industrial or laboratory equipment which may not be suitable to the home environment , including centrifuges and filter presses or vacuuum filters . If you really only want to preserve your starter strain without maintaining an active starter , simply drying a sample and then storing it in the freezer may be a better option . This process is described at <URL> .
This question is a little vague , but probably your temperature probe is lying to you , or you 're not accounting for resting your meat . I would suggest a legit thermometer rather than one that gives you hints about the meat -- you 'll have more control over the final product . Temperature Guide : Medium Rare Beef has an internal temp of 145F / 60 Celsius Medium Beef has an internal temp of 160F / 70 Celsius Well Done ( ruined ) has a temp of 170F / 75 Celsius Remember that on resting your beef will rise roughly 10F / 12C in the middle as the heat distributes . So , if you pull the beef out at 160F / 70C , it will be well done by the time you eat it . If you want Medium Rare , pull it out at 135F / 55C .
Residual starches swell up and get sticky in hot water . This does n't happen with cold water -- In the time it takes to wash a pot .
Butter traditionally has salt in it as a preservative , mainly to stop bacterial growth on the residual whey , and to slow fat rancidity Modern butter has a much lower amount of salt than is required for shelf storage in the pre-electric era . Now we have refrigerators , salt is not required at such a high level Butter with no salt has nearly half of the shelf life of modern salted butter Processed sugar is a modern ingredient , and therefore there is no culture in having it in butter . Sweet yoghurt and milk are all " new " inventions Using salt as a preservative is as old as recorded history . Many cultures used salt to preserve fruits , as well as meats and vegetables
There is n't really a " test " , per se , to tell if a bread is a " real sourdough " or not . Without getting overly technical , the tangy " sour " is created by a lactobacillus ( bacteria ) culture feeding on the byproducts of the yeast used to make the dough rise . The byproducts of the bacteria produce the lactic acids which give the resulting bread its sour taste . The taste of sourdough can be simulated by adding other acidic components to the bread dough . Practically speaking , the only way to tell the difference is if you have the experience of a refined palate that you recognize the taste difference . Ah , but here 's the tricky part . Once a baker has a stable culture of yeast and bacteria ( starter ) , they 'll save a bit of the fermented dough to add to the next batch , and so on for batch after batch . It is not unusual for bakers to continue their culture for years or even decades . So the problem of recognizing the authenticity of sourdough is that each bakers ' sourdough will have it 's own distinctive taste . Yikes . So much for the standard taste test . There is one test I can think of ; although , I do n't know how practical this is : A very " healthy " sour dough culture is the result of having reached a really stable and balanced , symbiotic relationship between the yeast and bacteria . This is desirable because it prevents other undesirable bacteria from setting up shop . Because of this inherent stability , real sourdough breads are very resistant to mold and other reactions that cause them to go bad . So , if your sourdough bread seems to last longer then you would expect from fresh bread , that might be a good indication of real sourdough . Of course , this can also be the result of preservatives added to the bread ; so & hellip ; no help there .
<URL> has very good explanations about it . Let me sum of it up : The geometry of the wok is very important : better use of the surface area ability to shallow fry big items and deep fry small items with small amounts of oil . intense heat for low amount of fuel The temperature is also very important : caramelization ( or <URL> ) carbon steel , cast iron , stainless steel and others have different properties in terms of heat capacity and heat conduction .
I 've seen bread recipes like the one that you described . When bread is baked in an oven with steam - the starch in the crust is able to gelatinize before it all dries out and becomes crispy . This is what makes the crust crisp , shiny , and delicious - characteristic of " artisan " breads . Most people do n't have steam enhanced ovens ( or the ability to hack their oven to add steam : <URL> ) The recipe you linked has water added for steam but then takes out extra insurance ( they cheat ) by adding the cornstarch glaze to mimic the effect . By adding extra , pure , starch on the surface of the loaf more gelatinization occurs . Additionally , cornstarch gelatinizes at a lower temperature that wheat starch . Conceivably , you should be able to use any starch and see similar results but , in the US at least , cornstarch is by far the most common . It should n't be necessary if you are able to produce enough steam in your oven .
It 's actually a bit of an old wives ' tale that the yeasts colonizing your starter are from the air . Almost all of the yeasts in a starter are from the grains used to make it . This is why starters are frequently started with either whole grain kernels or grains like rye that are left mostly intact when milled . All of the microorganisms on the outside of the grain kernel are then included in your starter . As to leaving your jar open , I certainly would n't seal it up , especially if the jar is glass . The carbon dioxide produced by the starter could cause the jar to explode if it ca n't escape .

start question
Are Farro ( Triticum dicoccum ) and Spelta ( Triticum spelta ) interchangeable ?
According to Heidi Julavits ' in the <URL> , the grains are very different in their cooking properties , even though they are both members of the wheat family , and despite claims that they can be used in the same recipes : Farro cooks in about 45 minutes ; we cooked our spelt for four hours , and even then the result was extremely al dente . We threw in multiple sticks of butter , gallons of stock and $ 13 worth of grated Parmesan , but the spelt remained stoically flavor-impervious . You should look for recipes specifically for Spelt , if this is what you have available .
All excellent information , but can I answer bluntly : none of them come even CLOSE to the real thing . Once you use fresh stock , you will never , ever go back . Really . Making stock is easy , cheap , and as said above , unattended time . Stock forms the base of the kitchen , once you have it , you will notice the taste of everything you make improve so much . Get some bones ( most butchers will give the away for free , just become friends ) cold water , bring to boil , throw away the dirty water , start again with fresh water . This saves you the trouble to skim the grey foam , which is the white blood cells and other bitter tasting substances . It is also much more effective as skimming . And it results in a clearer , better tasting stock . When you do it , you will see what I mean straight away . I even rinse the pan Add onions and celery , and basically all the cut-offs of all your vegetables . pepper corns , bay leaves , unpeeled garlic cloves , whatever you like . You dont need to peel the onion . The fuller the pan , the better the stock . On your storage problem : two solutions . Big restaurants do not store , they just have a big pan boiling night and day . Small scale : after a hours or a night of slow boiling or so , remove bones and veggies . Cool . When fat is solid , remove and use this for frying : fried taters , etc. . Now boil down the broth , really down to say 20 percent . You have a demi glace now . Put it in ice cube trays , and freeze . When frozen , remove , and put in bags . You have now concentrated fresh stock that takes up no space , and you can use in any quantity you require . Please try it . Again : NOTHING comes close to the real deal .
It depends on what you mean by " yam " . Once upon a time , in the deep south of the US , there was a tuber known as the <URL> , and it was good . And then one particular grower decided to sell theirs under the trade name " yam " to get better marketing recognition . This lead to some folks in the US calling sweet potatoes by the name yam , especially in the context of candied yams ( a sweet casserole of spiced sweet potato ) . So if the word " yam " is being used to mean a variety of sweet potato , then they are culinary identical . Sweet potatoes of all variety are , well , potato sized ( or a bit bigger than the average potato ) , and their color can range from whitish through yellow , orangish or reddish . Most grocery store varieties are fairly orange in color . True <URL> originate from Africa , and are far more starchy and fibrous than sweet potatoes , no matter what they are called , and are used in entirely different ways . They can be very large , football to basketball sized or larger . There are also a tremendous variety of true yams .
Delicious variations abound , so it is hard to make absolute statements of what is " officially " a ladyfinger . In my pastry class , we were taught that the classic recipe for ladyfingers is close , but not identical , to genoise . Store-bought ladyfingers can be anything from , essentially , a meringue to a shortbread cookie . Foam-based batters -- i.e. , those that do not use chemical leveners or yeast -- can be divided into two categories : whole-egg and separated-egg . The main difference in results is that the latter tend to be stiffer and can better tolerate being overcooked a little . The primary example of whole-egg batter is the genoise cake . Because the whites are whipped together with the yolks ( and sometimes extra yolks are added ) , it is a finicky batter , requiring more skill to assemble properly than others , but when it works , it is more tender . Separated-egg batters are far more common , as they are easier to assemble ; the key is that you whip the whites into medium-to-stiff peaks , then fold it back into the rest of the batter . Examples include chiffon , dacquoise , and the French " biscuit " cakes . Most recipes for ladyfingers use a separated-egg batter ; others use a simple meringue . The meringue version will make a crisp cookie , the version with with the yolk , soft . Either will work well for uses like tiramisu or trifle . Here is a recipe for <URL> from Allrecipes.com and a recipe for <URL> from Epicurious . For my ladyfingers , I add a pinch of salt and some flavorings , such as vanilla or nut extract , but the base recipe is essentially the same .
A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element . A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat , similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb . An induction stove does n't actually generate heat itself , but rather induces it the pot or pan . It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field . This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat , thus heating the food . Induction stoves are faster , safer , and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves . It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up . They are safer because they do n't actually generate heat themselves . After taking a pot off the " burner " ( glass surface ) it quickly begins to cool . With regards to differences in the cooking process , there 's not much . You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove . It does affect your choice of pans however . All aluminum pans will not work , nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones . If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine . The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface .
According to <URL> , which is one of the few references I could find : They are essentially fully cooked beans that have then been dehydrated for long term storage . Therefore , they will " cook " again quickly as they are already cooked , and are essentially just being rehydrated . If you listen to the video ( it is mostly narration , and a few still pictures , and are very , very , very patient in listening ) , the narrator will describe how she creates them which comes down to : Pre-soak the beans Pressure cook them Dehydrate them Note that the first two steps are probably not that critical -- you could cook the beans by whichever method you prefer .
Any knife that has a symetrical blade profile should be ambidexterous in use . Santoku and chef knives typically come with a symmetrical profile1 , so you should be able to get a decent choice , whichever of the types you finally choose . Whether you chose a V-shaped or double-bevel , a hollow cut or a convex blade is ultimately up to you , your intended uses and your honing skills . Some knifes feature an asymmetrical edge , but as these are often intended for special uses and for left - or righthanded use ( depending on the orientation of the sides ) , a good manufacturer should point this out . If in doubt , either ask your sales person or simply look closely at the blade . Another option is laying the blade flat on the table ( or on a wooden block , if the hilt gets in the way ) and pressing along the cutting edge . The angle of the sharp edge will " lift " the spine . If it behaves the same way on both sides , you should be fine , whichever is your dominant hand . And a big thanks to a ESultanik below who reminded me : Knife handles are not necessarily designed ambidexterously , even if the blade is . In fact , I suggest " trying on " every knife you are willing to spend more than a few dollars on - it should feel safe and comfortable and fit your hand size and grip well . A handle that does n't fit your hand is uncomfortable at best , dangerous at worst . 1 <URL> discusses various styles , including pictures .
The choice of one onion over another is really going to come down to personal preference based on color and flavor . Red and white onions are usually milder in flavor than yellow onions which is the reason they 're often the choice for hamburgers and sandwiches . Yellow ( sometimes referred to as " Spanish " ) onions tend to have a more pungent flavor . Sweet onions ( Vidalia , Maui , Walla-Walla , Texas 1015 ) develop more sweetness and fewer sulfuric compounds due to the mineral content of the soil that they 're grown in . This is why you can have onion sets ( small bulbs ) from any of these varieties but they wo n't necessarily be sweet ( or as sweet ) because a lot of it has to do with the makeup of the soiling they 're grown in . Two years ago I hosted Jeanne Jones ( syndicated writer of " Cook it Light " column for King Features syndicate and writer of over 33 cookbooks including " Canyon Ranch Spa Cookbook " ) for guest chef cooking classes . If I recall correctly , she said she used primarily white onions because they have a lower sodium content than any other type . Did that " mean black eyed pea salad " recipe happen to come from a certain " Low Country Cooking Class " ? If so , I used it for two reasons : not everyone will have access to Vidalia onions and it provides additional color .
Like many fruits and vegetables , the sugar level in a plantain increases as it ripens . Green plantains are very starchy and hard . You must cook them to eat them . They can be used much like a potato ( think chopped &amp; put in soups or mashed as a side dish ) . Fried green plantains are referred to as " tostones . " Yellow plantains still require cooking , but they are sweet ( unlike green plantains ) . These work pretty well for frying and steaming . Black ( super-ripe ) plantains do not have to be cooked ; they can be eaten raw . They have soft flesh and a scent like a banana , though still not as sweet as typical bananas . When these super-ripe plantains are fried , they are referred to as " platanos maduros " ( ripe plantains ) or " platanos fritos " ( fried plantains ) . Regarding use by different cultures : Trinidad and Tobago , Honduras and Jamaica : the plantain is either simply fried , boiled or added to a soup . Kerala : ripe plantain is steamed and is a popular breakfast dish . Ghana : boiled plantain is eaten with kontomire stew , cabbage stew or fante-fante ( fish ) stew . The boiled plaintain can be mixed with groundnut paste , pepper , onion and palm oil to make eto , which is eaten with avocado . Southern United States , particularly in Texas , Louisiana and Florida : plantains are most often grilled . Nigeria : plantain is eaten boiled , fried or roasted ; roasted plantain , called booli is usually eaten with palm oil or groundnut . ( <URL> )
The existing answers already explain why yeast and baking powder wo n't work together . But even if they did , you would n't have a reason to use them . You seem to think that fluffiness depends on the amount of gas produced by the leaveners . In fact , it depends on both the gas and the ability of the dough to trap that gas . If you produce too much gas ( no matter whether through yeast or through baking powder ) , then the fluffiness will be less than when using the optimal amount of leavener . This happens because your dough can not hold the gas and the bubbles break , resulting in the dough deflating like a punctured tire . So even if combining two leaveners would have resulted in more " blowing big " action ( which it does n't , see the other answers ) , you would not end up with a fluffier end product . If you want fluffy muffins , you have to use a recipe and a technique which is best capable of retaining the gas produced by the baking powder . The amount of gas production is not a bottleneck .
The skin is the outer thick orange-coloured cover ; obviously as you 're not told to remove it this would include the pith ( the white fibrous material ) as well . The pips are the seeds inside the fruit : pip noun plural noun : pips 1 . a small hard seed in a fruit . synonyms : seed , stone , pit
I 'm culling a lot of information from one of my <URL> for this one . Yes , limes have a slightly higher acid content ( on average ) than lemons do - about 6 % for limes , compared to 4.5 % for lemons . More importantly for their flavor , lemons have about 2 % total sugar , while limes have somewhere between 0.5 % and 0.75 % . Sugar/sweetness has quite a suppressive effect on the perception of sourness , so lemon juice will most likely taste a bit less sour than lime . The composition of acids in the two also differ . The acid in lemon juice is almost entirely <URL> , which also makes up most of the acid in limes . However , limes include about 10 % each of <URL> and <URL> which have an effect on their flavor . Malic acid is most recognizable as the sour flavor from tart apples and rhubarb . About succinic acid , Wikipedia states : It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness , bitterness and acidity . Personally , I think the difference is perceptible in beverages , but less so in cooking . Culturally , lime would most certainly be the traditional choice for Latin American cuisine . Lime is much more readily available in Central and South America ( three of the <URL> are located there ) . How the difference in acid content would contribute to the browning of avocados is more questionable . EDIT : Here 's <URL> , suggesting that <URL> ( vitamin C ) is more effective at preventing avocado browning than citric acid . Which is an interesting wrinkle , because lemons contain significantly more vitamin C than limes do ... EDIT 2 : And along comes Jolenealaska , with <URL> that seems to undermine the entire assumption that acid reduces browning of avocado at all ! Seems like the real secret may just be keeping your avocados either uncut , or refrigerated and tightly wrapped if you have to cut them ahead of service .
If you have a gas stove , you need a hood to send the exhaust outside . One that recirculates is not sufficient . In my experience , the recirculator hoods work OK if you 're not doing a lot of cooking . If you do , however , you 'll end up with a nasty , greasy dusty coating on everything in your kitchen . I would n't bother with a recirculation hood if you ever cook things that involve grease or smoke . For someone who mostly heats up processed foods , it 's probably good enough .
The <URL> has several diagrams - a current one in the main section apparently originally derived from the German wikipedia , and two others from older Russian sources . I was also able to find <URL> with another diagram , and translations of some of the cuts into English , which is helpful because the names are difficult to translate to similar English cuts via Google Translate , which simply gives anatomical terms for many of them . <URL> discussing the subject , largely from the perspective of someone who only knows the American name for the cut they are looking for .
Whenever you want grill marks . Or , perhaps , if you want to ensure fat rendered out of meat drips away . Why you would want to do this I do not know .
They are not equivalent cuts and ' should not ' be used interchangeably . Stir Fry meat is cut from the more tender cuts of beef ( tri-tip , sirloin , rib-eye ) and do n't require much time cooking to be ' ready to eat ' . Stew Beef is from less tender cuts ( the Chuck or Eye of Round ) which will become tender after a ' significant ' time braising ( cooking in liquid ) . That said ... the food police wo n't show up at your door if decide to interchange these , and using stir fry beef for stew is n't a terrible thing to do ... but you will likely not be happy if you try to switch the other way .
Both refined sunflower oil and refined soybean oil are generally considered flavorless . Also included among these are : Canola ( rapeseed ) oil Corn oil Peanut oil Safflower oil Vegetable oil The most reliable method of course is to taste the oil :) . I 'm sure you can actually taste the flavor of extra virgin olive oil .
Consider what the " no cheating " version of the ingredient is , and get the closest thing to that , that 's convenient enough for you . For things like garlic , ginger , etc. , the " no-cheating " version is to get the fresh ingredients and crush/grate them - what you end up with is a paste . The paste you can buy in jars is this stuff , with preservatives added to make them last . Some flavour will be lost . To make powder , the paste is dried , and more flavour is lost . But the powder will keep for a long time in the cupboard . Note that some spices take on different , desirable flavours when processed . Paprika powder has its own properties when compared to fresh paprika peppers . You 'd use fresh ginger in many curries , powdered ginger in many cakes , candied ginger in some other sweet dishes . Recipes will specify what to use . For things like black pepper , cumin , turmeric , coriander seeds , the " no-cheating " version is to get whole seeds , roast them and grind them in a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar . So buying the ready-ground version is only one step away from the ideal . Try grinding your own at least once . The extra depth and complexity of flavour is striking . But for convenience , ready-ground spices are fine . " Roasting " , for small quantities of whole dry spice , involves briefly heating them on a hot dry pan . It brings out spice flavours you do n't get from just frying or boiling the spice . Of course , it 's optional . Ground spices have a shorter shelf life than whole dry spices . If you open a jar of powdered spice and it does n't have a strong aroma , throw it away -- you might as well use dust . Whole spices have the aroma " locked away " , to be released when you grind . To make a paste , these are sometimes mixed with wet ingredients ( like garlic and ginger ) , water and oil . That 's the basis of the jars of " spice mix " you can buy in supermarkets . It 's also the first step in many curry recipes -- grind your spices , mix with oil to make a paste , and gently fry before adding the onions .
The King Arthur website lists the ingredients for that item : <URL> It looks like the " sour " flavor comes from several acids ( acetic , lactic , and citric ) . I assume the recipe calls for " sour " flavor instead of being a sourdough recipe like a traditional rye bread would be . Pickle juice may be a good substitute , since it 's mainly vinegar [ i.e. acetic acid ] . The " bread improver " also includes wheat gluten , which may be helpful if you 're using a non-bread flour ( bread flour contains more gluten than whole wheat or AP flours ) .
There is no reason to worry . The worst thing which can happen is that a piece of bay leaf , being somewhat hard , can lodge somewhere in your digestive system , necessitating a trip to ER . But a medical paper on the topic starts its discussion section with the sentence " Reports discussing ingestion of bay leaves have been exceedingly scant " . They only cite 10 references in the period 1950-1990 , and most of these are general studies of foreign bodies in the esophagus , not specific studies of bay leaf ingestion . Given how often bay leafs must find their ways into people 's digestive systems ( they feature in our food ) , it is safe to conclude that only a tiny fraction of ingested bay leafes cause problems , else there would be more studies mentioning such cases . The same is true for side effects different from mechanical obstruction : if this had happened , somebody would have published it . The paper I mentioned is " Bay Leaf Impaction in the Esophagus and Hypopharynx " by Stephen K. Buto , MD ; Tat-Kin Tsang , MD ; Gerald W. Sielaff , MD ; Laurie L. Gutstein , MD ; and Mick S. Meiselman , MD. . Sadly , it is n't freely available ( I could read the full text because my uni has a subscription ) . I guess that if you are working as a cook , your workplace may decide that even if the chance for a customer choking on a bay leaf is something like one in a million , they 'd rather instill removing bay leaves from dishes as a policy . Probably prudent , although there are more important risks to care about .

How long can I store a food in the pantry , refrigerator , or freezer ?
General comments on the shelf - , fridge - , and freezer-life of foods The shelf-life is the amount of time a food can be stored before it is considered unsuitable for use . It may be unsuitable due to quality degradation ( no longer tasty ) or food safety ( risk of food poisoning ) . [ <URL> ] As far as food safety goes , food stored frozen at 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) or below is remains safe forever ; only quality degrades over time . [ <URL> ] . Thus the freezer-storage times below are entirely about quality . If your freezer is set at a temperature higher than -18 ° C ( three-star setting ) , these times may not apply . Especially the safe storage time in one-star freezers ( -6 ° C ) is much reduced . The times all assume proper storage . Freezers 0 ° F or below , refrigerators 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) or below . [ <URL> ] Cans should be stored in a cool , dry place , below 85 ° F ( 30 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The tables given here assume proper storage . Food which requires refrigeration is considered unsafe if left for over two hours at temperatures between 41 -- 135 ° F ( 5 -- 57 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The Tables Regardless of the table below , if a food shows signs of spoilage ( including mold , with some exceptions described below ) , its past its shelf-life . Note that the lack of spoilage does not imply safety . Uncooked Proteins Cooked proteins Dairy Sauces For home-made mayo , there do n't seem to be official shelf-life estimates . Seasoned Advice has a question on this , <URL> . Vegetables Freezer times are given for cooked or blanched , then frozen . Generally , this is required , otherwise enzymatic degradation will occur . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each vegetable . Refrigerator and shelf times are for storage raw . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . Fruits Many fruits must be at least partially cooked ( blanched ) before freezing in order to deactivate enzymes that would otherwise degrade quality while in storage . Some are best frozen packed in acid ( lemon juice or citric acid ) and/or syrup . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each fruit . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . * : bananas stored in the fridge will blacken . This is not a sign of spoilage , and they can be eaten safely . Cooked dishes Generally 3 -- 4 days in the fridge . This includes pizza , soups , stews , casseroles , pies , and quiche [ KC ] . Some salads get a fifth day [ CFG ] . Freezer time is generally under three months . Infused oils Putting any plant matter in oil ( such as garlic , chillies or herbs ) creates the danger for botulism , a rare but fatal disease . Thus infused oils are not shelf-stable . They can be kept in the refrigerator for 3-5 days , discard them earlier if you see cloudiness or gas bubbles . Or buy commercially produced infused oils , they have been treated with industrial methods to kill the botulinum spores . Shelf-stable until opened Pantry ( not refrigerated even after opening ) General tips for storing foods How do I freeze fruits and vegetables ? Fruit . Ripe ( but not overripe ) fruit should be used . Wash them , and sort according to size . Working in small batches , remove pits , seeds , and blemishes . For fruits that turn brown , apply ascorbic acid or sugar and citric acid . Most fruits benefit from packing in dry sugar or a sugar syrup . Small , whole fruits ( e.g. , berries ) can be spread on a tray and individually frozen , then packed in a freezer bag or other airtight container . Vegetables . Most vegetables need blanching . To blanch , immerse in boiling water over high heat or steam over rapidly boiling water ( steam ) . After blanching , transfer to ice bath for the same amount of time as blanched . Drain and dry . Freeze either by packing in a freezer bag with as much air as possible removed , or by allowing to freeze on a tray , then putting in a bag or other container . General guideline is 8 -- 12 months for best quality . The above is a very quick summary of Iowa State University 's <URL> . The five-page document includes full details on over forty fruits and vegetables . Feel free to ask here on Seasoned Advice if that guide does n't answer your question . What about mold ? Some foods are expected to have mold in them ( e.g. , P. roqueforti in Roquefort cheese ) . Unexpected mold , however , is something to be concerned about . Mold can grow even on refrigerated foods , and even those high enough in salt or sugar to deter bacteria . Some molds produce mycotoxins . Mold growth can be minimized by cleaning the refrigerator every few months ( use a mixture of 1 tablespoon of baking soda per quart of water , then rinse with plain water , then dry ) , by keeping dishcloths , sponges , mops , etc. clean and fresh-smelling ; and keeping indoor humidity levels under 40 % . In general , the visible surface mold on a food is only a small part of the actual mold growth . For most foods , any visible unexpected mold grow
What Tim said . Eggs just do n't hold very well , and they are very sensitive to temperature -- reheating them basically will mean re-cooking them . I would never store eggs in this manner , because the texture and flavour degradation will make them unpleasant to eat . However , to actually answer your question -- and again , I urge you not to do this because stored and reheated eggs will taste like garbage -- cooked eggs should keep for up to 72 hours in the refrigerator . Remember to chill them as rapidly as possible after cooking , and you may wish to undercook slightly in order to minimize problems when reheating . I would use 72 hours as an absolute maximum , particularly if you are undercooking . 48 hours is probably wiser .
To start with , the red , or dark , juice from red meat is not , in fact , blood , which is a common misconception . Most blood is drained from red meat when it is butchered . It is , rather , a protein ( <URL> ) and a lot of water . It is an animal 's levels ( or lack of ) myoglobin , that determine whether it is a ' red ' meat or white . As for its safety after being frozen , this is discussed further <URL> . Beef stored in the refrigerator for more than 5 days will start to turn brown due to chemical changes in the myoglobin . This does n't necessarily mean it has gone bad , though with this length of unfrozen storage , it may have . Best to use your nose to tell for sure , not your eyes As your venison was frozen , rather than just refrigerated , as mentioned above , I would say you are more than safe to do a nose test , as recommended above .
I have done no testing of this at all but I was surprised to find <URL> that they recommend trying a spoon full ( or cube of ) sugar . Perhaps the easiest way of calming down a flaming mouth is by sucking on a sugar cube or holding a teaspoon of sugar in your mouth . This helps by absorbing the spicy oil that is coating your mouth , as well as giving you a different , strong taste to concentrate on . A bit of mind-trickery and science combined ! Other things I 've eaten in the past include starches , like bread or rice . Here 's a fun infographic and most of the items on it are vegan : <URL> from <URL>
Truffles are a low acid food , and they grow underground , so they are at risk to have botulism spores present . Vacuum packing creates a low oxygen environment , which is what the botulism bacteria requires to grow and produce its toxin . Unless the truffles have been salted ( to 5 % by weight ) , acidified ( to a pH of 4.6 or lower ) , or frozen ( at all times after being vacuum packed ) , they are at risk for the growth of botulism . Some strains can grow and produce their toxins at refrigerator temperatures ( and most refrigerators have a temperature cycle that peaks in the more general growth range ) . While the growth is slow , it can occur . The risk is increased if the truffles have not been continuously refrigerated since they were vacuum packed . For this reason , mushrooms and truffles should never be vacuum packed and stored . You should discard these truffles . In the future , obtain your truffles from a reputable source ( which does not vacuum pack ) and use them fresh , or freeze them as botulism is not active at freezer temperatures .

Even if you just pull them out for about 30 minutes once you get home that will be better than not letting sit out at all . The main benefit is that it will cook easier and you 'll have a natural gradation from brown to pink on the inside rather than the gray color that often occurs . I myself do n't typically pull meat out an hour before cooking it . But As long as they have n't previously been sitting out for an extended period of time , most likely you 'll be ok for 1 1/2 hours since the steaks will be cold when set out . Make sure that they remain tightly wrapped/covered to minimize exposure to air .

I regularly store chopped onion in my refrigerator ( or at least halves &amp; quarters ) . I either use tight-sealing plastic containers or zip-top bags . You may want to double-bag in zip-tops to be sure to avoid a smell . One problem you may be having is onion-ness getting on the outside of the container . Be sure the outside is all clean and dry - no point in having a nicely sealed packet of onion when the outside can get all stinky anyway .
Most freezers are frost-free , which means that they occasionally cycle above freezing to prevent formation of frost on the walls of the freezer . This makes them easier to maintain but it shortens the storage longevity of the food . This makes products stored in them vulnerable to freezer burn , which is a loss of moisture . It can also cause ice and IQF products like frozen fruits or vegetables to solidify into a single mass . If you have ice cube trays , you may even notice them becoming empty after a few months of sitting unused . Freezer burn is a loss of quality , though , not a health issue . The food is n't spoiling . If you have a " deep freeze " or a non frost-free freezer that you only access occasionally , you can certainly keep foods for nearly indefinite periods of time without worrying as much about freezer burn . You can also reduce the likelihood of freezer burn by following better freezer practices . Resources available <URL> and <URL> and <URL> .
Keep it stored in an airtight container , so that it does n't absorb moisture from the air . If it congeals , put the container in hot water until honey is liquid ( ~ 10-15 minutes ) .
Yes , it will " make it last longer in the fridge " for a certain definition of " last longer " : it will not mould nor infect other foodstuffs in the fridge if it does n't come into direct contact with any of them . Is it still safe to eat after a few of these re-heatings ? Very probably not ! Elaboration : More then half of the number of cells in your body are actually bacteria ; bacteria do n't generally kill you but the toxins they release is what kills you . E.g. Botulinum Toxinum D ( one of the toxins released during Botulism ) has an LD50 of 0.4 ng/kg , which means that you need about 500g ( a pound ) to kill 99.9 % of all human beings on the entire planet ... ( And that is for just a few re-heatings ; for " nearly indefinitely " we need to bring extremophiles in the equation ... ) <URL>
There are several things in general that you can do to increase the speed at which food cools down , but two of the most effective are : Increase the surface area . Spread it in a wide , shallow pan , like a sheet pan , rather than a deep pot . This will allow more cooling . Use an ice water bath . Place the container with the food into an ice water bath , being careful not to spill the water into the food . Using a zip style bag to hold the food before putting it into the bath also can help . A variation of this , especially for hot stocks or stews , is to freeze water in clean water bottles or zip bags , and place those into the food in addition to the ice bath . For a pilaf , the first method should work very well . You can also bring physics to the party : Convection is far more powerful at heat transfer than conduction . A fan for air cooling will help , or running water for water for water cooling will also help , but these are not always practical in kitchen .
Yes , store them individually . First , wrap them tightly in plastic wrap , preferably one that says it 's specifically for freezer use . Then wrap this tightly in aluminum foil . They 'll keep for months without freezer burn this way .
To quote from your own <URL> : It 's best to plan ahead for slow , safe thawing in the refrigerator . After defrosting bacon by this method , it will be safe in the refrigerator for 7 days before cooking . If you decide not to use the bacon during this time , you can safely refreeze it without cooking it first . And , further up : It 's not important if a date expires after freezing bacon because all foods stay safe while frozen . Let 's look at what happens when you freeze food : Due to the low temperatures , the growth of all1 molds , bacteria and other " nasties " is stopped or at least slowed down to an extremely slow rate . So from the perspective of your food , time is suspended while frozen . ( <URL> left aside , we are talking food safety here . ) So the clock starts ticking again once you defrost your food and can be stopped when re-freezing . Taking into account that your bacon was supposed to be good until the end of the month and freezing does n't shorten that time , you should be fine at least until the original best-by-date . In theory you could calculate But that 's based on estimated bacterial growth , not taking possible quality issues into account - and we should n't always go to the limit , should we ? . 1 " all " as in " all typical pathogens " . Of course there are <URL> , but those are not relevant here .
Depending on what it is I am transporting I use different methods , and I use the same methods for both hot and cold transport . The easiest is the towels in a box ; lay four towels down in a shallow box , hanging the other ends of the towels out each side of the box , then put your dish or bread or pot or whatever in the box and fold each of the four towels over the food . If you have hot food , lay some more insulation material over the top , as heat rises . If you have cold food , put the box on the seat , not the floor , as the floor will conduct heat from your vehicle up into your food . I always have a sleeping bag in my rig and I will sometimes wrap food well with towels and then open the sleeping bag and shove the food into it , wrapping the rest of the sleeping bag over the top if hot food and under the bottom if cold . This has worked a lot for frozen foods when I go bulk shopping in the city , holding food frozen food for 4 hours and more .
Using the refrigerator for the first rise is absolutely easy , but that is not what you are asking about . For a second rise , tweaking your current approach a bit , I suggest : Place yout bread ( s ) on a baking tray or similar or use a well-floured banneton ( basket ) . Find a plastic bag large enough to fit the entire tray or the banneton plus a bit extra room inside . Lightly " blow up " the filled bag and close with a clip , rubber band or similar . You are not creating a " ballon " , just enough to have the bag " float " a bit over the loaf . Another option would be placing a glass , can or similar object next to your loaves to support the foil tent from below . You need not create an air-tight seal , but you want to limit the loss of moisture to keep the surface of the bread from drying out . For a single boule , an inverted bowl can protect the loaf enough , or if you use an appropriately sized Tupperware or similar bowl in lieu of a banneton , just close the lid . A few additional thoughts : For round loaves ( boules ) a banneton or in a pinch , a bowl , helps to keep the loaf in shape . Especially for long proofing times the tension created by shaping the loaf might not be enough to hold over hours , causing the loaf to " flow " sideways . Flour the basket well and do n't worry about excess flour at the bottom ( or top , depending in technique ) of the loaf , simply brush it off after baking . You do n't need to put parchment under the loaf if you transfer them to a pizza stone or pre-heated tray . Do n't try to lift a baguette by hand , use a sword-shaped <URL> or , in a pinch , a cutting board and roll the baguette onto the peel and back onto the pizza stone or second tray . That said , damp paper is n't much of a problem unless it is so wet that it will simply tear . Rolls or other small items are easier to pack into a plastic container - plus they bake quickly in the morning , which may add a bit of convenience ( or allows for a few extra minutes of sleep ) .

You find that storing in the fridge is going to give you the longest life span . Hanging will keep keep the process of drying out continuing , which will intensify the flavour but will eventually become jerky texture . Wrapping will keep a little moisture in longer . If you do keep it for a period of time , you will develop a white mould which I will just cut of as it is just surface . The curing has stopped the pork breaking down . When I travelled through Spain , all of the city markets would have whole pieces of prosciutto hanging from there stalls that where covered in a fat that was covered in a green mould . When they needed a new piece they cut the mould and fat off and would start slicing for the customers ( some up there for over a year ) . I think the fridge is safer .
This similar ( also has heavy cream ) recipe from epicurious recommends : " Room temperature , up to 3 days ; refrigerated , at least 3 months . " <URL> ... And that conforms to my personal opinion , as well . I would not freeze it .
Sure , why not ? It probably wo n't turn out quite like the stuff you get at the store , but all you need is cream , a way to churn air into it , and enough agitation that the milk fat molecules start to clump together . It will require some manual work once you 've got the butter and buttercream separated . But the food processor will get you most of the way there without too much of an arm workout .

What makes creme brulee set ?
While Rudy refers to one excellent resource , it is indeed one which the authors are quite proud of ( $ 450 on Amazon , yikes ) . @Yossarian provides a much better ( more economical source for essentially the same information ) In his first blog post : <URL> . <URL> , from Cooks Illustrated ( Amazon , $ 22.97 ) , accurately describes the coagulation process and heat concerns ( with a slightly different ratio of products ) it great detail beginning on page 952 . In addition to the direct question you pose , " What makes Creme Brulee set ? " to help you with your ' general frustration ' in making Creme Brulee I would recommend this 3 minute video from <URL> . I believe you will find it a useful resource . ( should the link fail : search on YouTube for " Alton Brown Creme Brulee " and you should find the video easily )
My partner has a very sensitive " dirt-flavor " sense ... One of the ingredients that may be found in salsa that often triggers it for her is cumin .
I 've eaten from the creme brulee cart in San Francisco before , which is basically a food cart that sells nothing but . They 're presented in one-serving disposable aluminum ramekins and the crunchy top comes from caramelizing as people order . I 've seen similar in bakeries and restaurants that sell creme brulee to go . Presumably this is far easier than cutting up large batches or trying to come up with ways that do n't melt styrofoam ! :) More pics from the cart : <URL>
Components : sweet - > sugar + mirin ( rice wine ) salt - > soy savory - > soy + mirin + eel bones At home , you probably wo n't be able to manage eel bones boiled down into stock . Ignoring that , it 's all a matter of mixing and reducing . Sugar + soy + mirin , reduce to 1/3 , revel in the joy of caramel and salt and sharpness .
Edit : If cooking longer softens the potatoes , then this is n't what 's happening . In that case , well , you just need to cook longer . The main variable is probably temperature ( maybe the pot is n't actually all hot for all 30-45 minutes ) , followed by variations in cut size and in the firmness of the original potatoes . But the rest could apply to some readers too ! I 'm going to take a wild stab at this . It can explain this sort of thing , but it does depend on how you cook your stew . The following is a quote from <URL> ( excellent book ! ) , one of my favorite discoveries from reading through the sections on fruit and vegetables . It turns out that in certain vegetables and fruits - including potatoes , sweet potatoes , beets , carrots , beans , cauliflower , tomatoes , cherries , apples - the usual softening during cooking can be reduced by a low-temperature precooking step . If preheated to 130-140F / 55-60C for 20-30 minutes , these foods develop a persistent firmness that survives prolonged final cooking . ... Firm-able vegetables and fruits have an enzyme in their cell walls that becomes activated at around 50C ( and inactivated above 70C ) , and alters the cell-wall pectins so that they 're more easily cross-linked by calcium ions . At the same time , calcium ions are being released as the cell contents leak through damaged membranes , and they cross-link the pectin so that it will be much more resistant to removal or breakdown at boiling temperatures . So , if you started the stew from cold ( or drastically reduced the temperature by dumping in the sweet potatoes and other things ) and had it on low heat , so that it took a while to come up to temperature , then your sweet potatoes may have been in that 50-70C range where the enzyme is active for a while . So maybe while your length of cooking time is consistent , your time before simmering is n't ; that could depend on how cold the ingredients were before adding , the pot you used , whether you got exactly the same setting on your stove , the temperature in your home , and so on . ( I know you said this is n't it , but having larger chunks of sweet potatoes could conceivably contribute to that too ; the inside would take longer to heat up , so you could end up with a firm interior , and the softer part on the outside could get rubbed off . ) Sweet potatoes do also vary some in firmness , but certainly not by that much . It could still be a factor , though , in combination with the rest ! In any case , if you want to avoid the firm potatoes , I 'd try making sure to get everything heated up quickly .
In most contexts , I would assume that simply means the leaves from the herb parsley . Depending on where your recipe originates -- especially central Europe , or some Asian cultures -- parsley root may also be used , so the recipe might be trying to make that clear . I suspect , however , it really is the recipe author 's idiosyncratic style . Now , as to chopping them , that would depend on how it is used and what the rest of the recipe says .
<URL> states that one cake is the equivalent to one packet of dried yeast ( 0.25 oz or 2.25 tsp ) : One ( 1/4-ounce ) yeast packet of dry yeast OR 1 cake fresh , compressed yeast EQUALS 2 - 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast ( active dry or instant active dry )
This recipe ! found <URL> , calls for buttermilk or sour cream . Perhaps you can find sour cream . Crème fraîche 1 cup heavy or whipping cream , room temperature 1 tablespoon buttermilk or 1/2 cup sour cream , room temperature In a jar with a lid , place whipping cream and buttermilk ( or sour cream ) ; cover securely and shake 15 seconds . Set aside at room temperature for 24 hours or until very thick . Stir once or twice during that time . NOTE : Cream will thicken faster if the room is warm . Stir thickened creme fraiche well . Refrigerate at least 6 hours before serving . Cover tightly and store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks .
They choose edible casings , either way , you 're better off taking the casing off . It sounds like it 's a cellulose synthetic casing . It 's possible to be natural casing , but papery fibrous leads me to think cellulose . I 've included some pictures to aid you along so you can guess for yourself . Often it 's easier to tell by the extra casing at the ends since natural and synthetic bunch up differently . Here 's a picture of synthetic casing from this morning 's session ( it 's a sopressata ) : This is what it looks like cured and partially peeled : And this is what natural casing looks like fresh :
This technique -- searing or marking on the grill or stove top , then finishing in an oven -- is called <URL> .
You can make the yogurt in an insulated container , like a thermos bottle . A wide-mouth bottle will probably be best . Pour hot water in and let it sit for a minute or two to warm up , then pour it out . Heat and add your milk and starter culture as usual .
The most prominent flavors in authentic paella are pimenton ( smoked paprika ) , saffron , a sofrito of onion and tomato , garlic , and the broth .
As long as the eggs are n't expired you should be fine . I 've made creme brulee many times with both fresh eggs and not so fresh with similar results .
No . Sourdough culture is not a mold . Even when the surface of your sourdough gets moldy ( per Adam , above ) to get moldy , it 's not the kind of mold which releases spores into the air . I speak as a severe allergy sufferer .
What is food grade lye Pure lye is by itself always food grade . There is nothing toxic about lye ( although it 's corrosive even at low-ish concentrations ) . When a manufacturer sells you food grade lye , they are guaranteeing you that it is not contaminated with anything unpleasant . After all , a chemistry plant will make a lot of different chemicals using the same equipment , and you do n't want to use lye which was mixed in the same erlenmeyer flask as a batch of pesticides . Also , the equipment used in an industry processes can leave unpleasant traces too , some search shows that one of the more common setups in the 20th century used an asbestos barrier for the electrolysis process of lye creation . The problems of making lye from sodium and water at home If you make your lye at home , you 'll only have to ensure that your ingredients are food grade . There is nothing in the process which can make the lye accidentally toxic . Even if you use wrong ratios : if you add more water than intended , your lye will be diluted , which does nothing bad , and even makes it less corrosive . If you add more sodium , you get more concentrated lye , which you can dilute . You do n't need any catalysts , solvents , or other intermediate reagents about whose possible residues you should worry . All you need is food grade sodium . But here we come to the first problem with your plan . It is much easier to find food grade lye than to find food grade sodium . Retail lye is used for household purposes , including baking pretzels and cleaning cooking utensils . I do n't know of any use for retail sodium beyond seventh grade chemistry class demonstrations . The second problem is that storing pure sodium at home is a PITA . First , you 'll need to find some food grade liquid for the airtight seal , and it will react with cooking oils . You obviously do n't want to use kerosene , so you 'll probably need to get medicine grade liquid paraffin . Should you ever have a fire in your kitchen , the sodium will also burn with a much hotter flame than anything else around , and you probably wo n't get it extinguished until it has burned itself out - non-watery fire extinguishers are not very effective on it , and water-based ones will actually accelerate the fire . The third problem is that you should pay lots of attention during the reaction . Sodium powder is prone to spontaneous explosions . Luckily , there is n't that much chance that you 'll produce powder from it unwittingly . But the byproduct of the reaction , pure hydrogen , is also explosive when mixed with air at certain ratios , and you can not control the ratio you produce . The fourth problem is that the reaction is quite exothermic . You can mitigate it somewhat by adding very small amounts of the metal to the water ( but not small enough to make a powder ) , but you 'll still get some heat development . And it is happening right under a possibly explosive hydrogen-air mixture - not a good idea . So my recommendation is to just buy food grade lye and use that . It will save you from lots of headaches . The problems of making lye by brine electrolysis at home You clarified that you had planned to use electrolysis . This is possible , and sodium chloride is certainly a more benign ingredient than pure sodium . The resulting sodium hydroxide should be safe for consumption . Still , I think it 's more trouble than it 's worth , and purchasing commercial lye is the better option . First , you still have to manage your byproducts . You 'll get elemental hydrogen and elemental chlorine bubbling up . You do n't want either of these gases floating in your living space , hydrogen being explosive and chlorine plain poisonous . Also , if you want a decent lye concentration , you usually do the reaction in a container where the electrodes are separated by a semipermeable barrier , else it reacts right back to salt . The problem is that your product will corrode most barriers quickly . I have done it as a kid in a u-shaped part of a drinking straw , with a piece of sponge in the middle . The lye ate the sponge away , and before that the chlorine turned the water in its part sickly green ( yes , you have to dispose of that byproduct too somehow , it does n't get out so quickly ) . If you use this method , it will be very hard to either find a barrier which is not corroded by the lye , or accept some corrosion but make sure that the product ( which will contaminate your lye ) is not harmful when eaten . Then there is the part about electrodes Wayfaring Stranger mentions in a comment : you want to choose a cathode material which is not dangerous when ingested , especially no heavy metals . To complete the equipment safety part , use a glass container for the whole bath , not a plastic or metal one . And of course , do n't use phenolphtalein drops to check for the proper concentration , get dry strips for dipping .
i am celiac , ideally you should clean your entire kitchen , clean out your silverware and utensil drawers and wash all utensils in the dishwasher . Wipe all surfaces and sinks with bleach wipes . Scrub all pots and pans , to remove gluten films then wash in dishwasher . give all dishes to be used a run through the dishwasher . off limit items are , seasoned pans ( cast iron , or porcelain ) , earthenware , pasta pots , strainers , toasters , cooking stones , wood spoons or utensils , cutting boards , blenders and crockpots . to avoid contamination use fresh mayo , mustard , peanut butter jars , etc. . do not use any ingredients such as sugar that may have been contaminated with flour from use while baking . because you are not familiar with ingredients that contain gluten , use only pure ingredients if you are cooking for your celiac guest . avoid spice blends . <URL> hope this was a bit of help .
What you want is cream with 35 % -40 % milkfat , and no gelatine or other stabilizers for whipping . If you use a lighter cream , then it will not have the rich , creamy texture , and evenly thick consistency you seek . In fact , if you use a light enough cream , it will not thicken properly . Now we enter the murky realm of regional naming differences , trying to find the appropriate kind of cream ! In Australia , this would be called pure cream ( 35-56 % milkfat ) ... which might be the same as " cooking thickened cream . " Read the label and make sure it is just cream , not gelatin or foam stabilizers like " thickened cream " . It could also be labelled " single cream " too ( ~ 35 % milkfat ) . In America , we call it heavy cream , or heavy whipping cream , and it is defined as 35 % + milkfat , and is generally around 38 % . In the UK , <URL> I found the uses a mixture of milk and " double cream " ( cream with 48 % + milkfat ) . They mix 100 mL whole fat milk + 426 mL of double cream . The final milkfat content is somewhere around 40 % . In the rest of the EU , the same procedure appears to be the best bet , since I ca n't find clear names for heavier creams besides double cream ( which appears to be the same as the UK ) . Edit : You may also be able to get a good result using straight double cream . I 'm looking at a French recipe that uses it . The catch is , of course , that while the minimum fat content is specified , actual fat content in double cream can vary considerably , potentially giving erratic results .
The biggest indicator I 've found of quality dried pasta is how rough it feels when you rub it between your fingers . Compare Barilla and De Cecco spaghetti to see what I mean . The best brands use copper dies when extruding their pasta and this lends a rougher texture that will hold sauce better than plastic or teflon extruded pastas .
Coffee beans contain gases , which causes coffee to float . Fresh coffee contains more gases compared to an older ( aged ) coffee . coffee tastes best between 4 - 14 days off roast , varies depending on roast profiles Specialty coffee shops usually have a roast date on their retail bags On a coarse grind setting each particle hold more gases compared to a fine grind setting which hold less gases . Hot water causes a faster release of gases compared to cold water which causes a slower release of gasses Darker roasts hold less gases compared to a lighter roast . A lot of agitation increases the rate in which gasses release compared to no agitation . All these can be easily tested , and affect how long the coffee stays afloat . Gasses in the coffee particles must first be displaced in order for the water to enter each particle and extract a delicious cup . All in all , it does n't matter why , as long as the coffee tastes good . Late reply but thought I 'd clarify .
Short answer ? Not a damn thing . The term is pretty much meaningless in the US ; at best it only means that the product does n't have added colors , artificial flavors or synthetic " stuff " . From the <URL> : What is the meaning of ' natural ' on the label of food ? From a food science perspective , it is difficult to define a food product that is ' natural ' because the food has probably been processed and is no longer the product of the earth . That said , FDA has not developed a definition for use of the term natural or its derivatives . However , the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color , artificial flavors , or synthetic substances .

Can you substitute honey for sugar in a pickling brine ?
Sugar is not critical to the pickling process - it exists primarily as a flavorant . <URL> preservation requires one of two methods - either immersion in vinegar of a sufficiently low pH to kill off unwanted bacteria , or through natural fermentation with probiotic strains of bacteria . Honey is known to have <URL> properties . When using natural fermentation , one might think that there may be a risk that the added honey will kill off probiotic bacteria before they establish a stable population , allowing other unsavory bacteria to grow . However , most brine-based recipes already include known antimicrobial herbs such as mustard seeds , garlic , cinnamon , or cloves . Honey should n't be any different than the addition of these spices . When using vinegar to pickle , there is no reason to be concerned about adding honey . Regardless , it is important to note that honey will have a distinctly different flavor profile from pure sugar . Perhaps try it in a small batch before committing to " large scale " production .
Given the science as Kenji Alt explained it in his article , the key fact of the vodka is that it is 80 proof , or 40 % alchohol . So beer , which usually is on the order of 4 to 6 percent alcohol ( yes , there are outliers ) will not have the same level of inhibition of the gluten formation . The vodka is not the only factor in the recipe leading to crispiness and good crust , so you will probably still get very good results with the beer , assuming you like the flavor profile it brings to the wings , but it wo n't be quite the same . If you use another liquer that is on the order of 80 proof , again assuming you like the flavor profile , you should get quite similar results . This would include mixing grain alcohol with water or orange juice or whatever to the appropriate ratio . Other than some white wine for cooking , though , I do n't buy spirits so I do n't what would be more economical -- and that might vary from region to region .
If there 's leavening in the cake ( baking soda or baking powder ) that gets activated once incorporated with the rest of the ingredients , and you substantially overmix , you may lose some of its power as you help the gas escape from your batter . Unless you 're whipping it vigorously , you 're not going to be bringing enough air into the batter to make up for it . This is pretty much like letting the batter sit out on the counter for a while before baking , except faster .
On first blush , you will probably want a fat or oil with similar qualities as the " vegetable " oil you 're replacing , such as olive oil . Butter has a much lower a smoke point , however , cornbread recipes exist that use butter or lard . I 'd be willing to experiment , particularly if you 're used to cooking with butter . ( Just be careful with heat . ) As far as quantity , I 'd use a bit less than 1/3 of a cup , but that 's me being defensive as I do n't know the recipe you 're using .
English toffee is very chewy - the kind of stuff that glues your teeth together ! Once it has been cooked and set , it 's not easy to handle and would n't be easy to chop up for a cookie recipe . You 'd possibly be better off with some kind of fudge which is easier to handle but will still hold its shape in a cookie .
I would try Lime Basil or a mixture of 1/2 vinegar , and 1/2 bottled lime juice ( small portion ) .
Sort of . Nut flours are the base of many " flourless " cakes and torts . This one from <URL> is typical , and uses almond flour , which is more common than walnut . <URL> that specifically uses walnut . Note that these are not examples of using nut flours as a substitution for flour , they are recipes developed for nut flours . Both of those recipes start with whole nuts that are ground in a food processor or spice grinder . Wheat flour behaves very differently , if you want to bake a cake using nut flour in combination with or instead of wheat flour , search for recipes that call for nut flour . Trying to work out an actual substitution would be fraught with peril . Nuts are full of fat and non-gluten protein , wheat flour has starch and gluten forming protein ( although a high gluten level is not usually desirable in cakes , that 's why cake flour is lower in protein than AP , so that it creates less gluten ) . Now I see from the edit to the question that the zucchini/chocolate cake that led to the qustion is actually a kind of cheesecake . Cheesecakes generally do n't contain flour , in the case of your recipe the nuts are actually replacing a portion of the cream cheese . In other cheesecakes you might see nuts in the crust or garnish , but I 've never seen flour in the filling .
You can stuff any pepper which is large enough . Poblano are moderately spicy . You can use bell peppers , but they will not be spicy . You might want to make up for that by including some spicier small peppers in your stuffing , perhaps a serrano or a jalapeno or seventeen , depending on your personal taste .
Wikipedia , as well as all 12 serbian recipes I found specify full-fat white brine cheese ( cow or sheep milk ) . Only one of them called for a type of cream in addition to the cheese . In Western Europe , Turkish groceries can carry typical Balkan white brine cheese . If you do n't have access to one , buy feta . Cow and sheep cheese are considered substitutes in Balkan cuisine - the cooks are aware that they have a difference in flavor , but they use what they have at hand , similar to the way that an apple recipe will call for crisp apples , but wo n't specify Pink Crisp or Elstar apples . So both cow and sheep feta will do in principle . But I have noticed that supermarkets sometimes carry expensive real Greek feta , which is high quality , and only cheap western-made cow feta-style cheese , which is of inferior quality and has a rubber texture . If you are not sure of the quality , go for the real imported feta ( which will be sheep ) , not the feta-style .
No , you ca n't . Or at least , you wo n't get the result you 're really looking for . Water needs to be able to move through the meat for the salt and flavorings to be transported to the inner cells of the meat . When the meat 's frozen , you 're dealing with ice crystals . ... that being said , you can <URL> if you 're desperate , but you have less control to know exactly how much salt will be absorbed . ( and I vaguely remember another question on here about temperature &amp; brining , and I seem to recall someone reported on experimental results that really cold brines did n't transfer flavors deeply into the meat . ) .
Keep it stored in an airtight container , so that it does n't absorb moisture from the air . If it congeals , put the container in hot water until honey is liquid ( ~ 10-15 minutes ) .
When I add a bit of baking powder to the flour breading I use for eggplant , the fried result is a little puffier than without . Frying forces water out of the eggplant into the breading . That along w heat sets off the production of CO2 . The same should happen with your chicken breading .
The most accurate substitution would simply be <URL> . It is concentrated rum with a huge kick of flavor , and much less alcohol . A little goes a long way . If you 're going to stick with a strong liquor my first choice would be a <URL> , it 's a similarly " sweet " liquor that tastes good in baking . Another good option would be <URL> . If you 're avoiding liquor , then you may be able to use vanilla extract . Non-alcoholic varieties are available . According to <URL> you can also use molasses thinned with pineapple juice . The rum is used simply for flavor .
Sort of . If you have sesame seeds on hand , grind some up . You could also use toasted sesame oil , and even combine it with the ground seeds . You can also use all-natural peanut butter . Do n't use mass market crap with sugar and other additives . The ingredients should list only : peanuts , salt . Obviously , this will taste like peanuts . It will still taste good in a hummus , but it will be a distinctly different hummus than with tahini .
I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit . Himbeergeist , sliwowitz , or what you can lay your hands on . Kirsch does n't taste much like cherries , and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste . Even though it does contribute a bit , the taste will be subtle , and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well . In a pinch , you could use a colored brandy too , like Chantre . But it will add more of its own flavor , and while it can make a good combination , it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser . I would avoid any liqueurs , they will add way too much foreign taste , and also wo n't have enough alcohol to solve the spices in the same way .
As stated by Logophobe below , you can of course substitute ingredients as you like . I personally find subbing beef for lamb or vice versa a bit risky though . Lamb in general has a much milder taste of itself and thus requires a sauce and other accompanyments that do not overpower the taste of the meat . In your case this could mean that the sauce will be too weak as an accompanyment to beef . In a case such as this and not knowing the actual recipe I would suggest replacing the Pinot Noir with a somewhat more fragrant red wine ( a new world Merlot low on tannines should do nicely ) . You could also make the sauce more rounded by adding some crushed juniper berries . Should you want to stick to your original recipe , you might try just reducing the sauce a little more than you usually would .
Short answer : Brining after boiling wo n't do much ( if anything ) , and you probably do n't want to boil all parts of the chicken anyway . One primary purpose of brining is to hydrate the cells of the muscle tissue before cooking , which allows the cells to hold on to more moisture during the cooking process via denaturation of the proteins . If you cook the meat first , then the heat will permanently denature the proteins first , so the brine will essentially be useless . The reason why you want to pre-cook chicken wings is that ( a ) they have a lot of fat which melts off into the cooking liquid , and ( b ) they have a good amount of connective tissue ( collagen ) which needs to be cooked low and slow to soften into delicious gelatin . Most of the other parts of the chicken do n't have nearly as much fat and collagen , so boiling them would likely only serve to overcook them .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .
The Nordic Food Lab , founded by René Redzepi , has experimented with blood as egg substitute , full blog entry including recipes <URL> . Apparently texture-wise the substitution can be possible , but the typical bloody aftertaste is hard to mask , which might have to do with the physiological way the metallic taste is perceived . It seems especially women tend to recognize this ingredient quite easily .
Fenugreek seeds are intensely aromatic and go quite nicely in curries , and any dish where such a flavour is required . In the middle-east they use it quite a lot , often as a condiment . Highly used in spice rubs , pickles , marinades , anything where a strong spice flavour is required and often in puddings as an aromatic like nutmeg is used in English cooking . The leaves have a similar flavour , but not quite the same , you could use the seeds in their place adding them in to the spice mix if there is one , but the leaves I prefer personally . The flavour of methi leaves in thepla or in curry is wonderful in my opinion .

Resources for reheatable meals , specifically fish ?
A few principles for re-heatable food that I 've found over the years : Things with or in sauces heat nicely Dry things do n't heat as well ( plain rice , for example ) Liquid distribution in the dish is important for even heating Dryer things like meats heat better when they have glazes or toppings ( keep steam in ) Things you can stir up mid-heat are nice for even heating Flavours improve over time , use this to make reheated dishes better Food continues to cook in the microwave ( and dry out ) , so avoid overcooked . This goes double for noodles ( nothing worse than mushy noodles ) Thickened sauces ( especially with flour ) reheat thicker than when cooked
All of the following are generally cooked items : Shrimp , ebi , available raw in sashimi , but almost always lightly poached . The poaching brings out sweet and subtle flavors otherwise masked by a metallic tang . It also prevents the highly perishable shrimp from losing texture to spoilage . Octopus , tako , available raw in sashimi when sliced very thinly , but otherwise poached lightly . The poaching reduces toughness and brings out additional flavors in an otherwise bland meat . Eel , unagi , as you noted , is ALWAYS grilled , and steamed . This is necessary to achieve the truly transcendent flavor and texture of unagi . In fact , the cooking of eel is such a challenge that it is generally a whole separate chef profession in Japan . Most eel comes from one of the professionals , because sushi cooks know they will never be able to match the quality themselves . Improperly cooked eel becomes tough and has unpleasant flavors . Raw , the blood of eels is even toxic ! Sweet egg omelet , tamago , is by definition cooked . This is not to say that raw egg does n't have a place in Japanese food though ; tamago kake gohan is a dish of raw egg on rice , with soy sauce . Cockle is lightly poached Crab , kani is always cooked because ... well eating raw crab meat is just vile . For further reading , I highly suggest the <URL> . Food Safety : Sushi is only prepared from the very freshest and highest quality seafood , and sushi chefs are trained to identify parasites and signs of spoilage . In addition , some areas ( including the EU ) require sushi to be frozen for 24 hours to kill parasites . If that was n't enough to help settle your stomach , the pickled ginger and wasabi served along with sushi are more than garnish or simple condiments ! Both ginger and wasabi have potent and documented anti-microbial and anti-parasite properties . Ginger is also well-known for combatting nausea . Source : the CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices , <URL> for wasabi and <URL> for ginger . ( links are to Google Books copy ) .
Butter is at most 82 % oil and the rest is water . So , you 're going to need to add more butter for the same amount of oil . Besides , you need to adjust the liquid content accordingly since you are going to have more water than you planned . If you are going to use the same amount of oil , then it will not make any difference other than the taste . Just make sure they are of same state ( i.e. melted butter instead of vegetable oil or vice versa )
I would use this broth to make soups . It would make a great base for a number of soups such as scotch broth , but also for using for the stock for making other soups such as lentil or whatever you fancy . Good luck !
The biggest concern with fish caught in the wild is the presence of parasites . You 'll have to look up which species of parasite are present in the species of fish that you wish to use , and treat it accordingly . Tapeworm is common in salmon , and several other varieties of fish have various parasites capable of infecting a human host . Most sites I 've seen suggest that you need to freeze the fish at -4 degrees Fahrenheit ( -20 Celcius ) or colder for 7 days or -31 Fahrenheit ( -35 Celcius ) for 15 hours to guarantee any parasites are dead . Many home freezers may have difficulty keeping temperatures this low . Also the freezing process , if done in a home freezer , has a good chance of ruining the taste and the texture of the meat . You may want to look into flash freezing methods to avoid this . Supposedly there are certain species of fish that do not have any parasites , or at least no parasites capable of infecting humans . You will want to do your own research on this to be certain . Beyond parasites bacteria are the other biggest concern . Make sure you put the fish into a cooler immediately , and freeze it as soon as you return home . Sources : <URL> <URL>
As a substitute for untoasted sesame oil , most light oils will work ( light olive , peanut , canola , sunflower , etc ) . Any nut or seed oil should be pretty close . Toasted sesame oil has a much bolder and nuttier flavor . It could perhaps be approximated with a light oil and adding toasted sesame to your dish .
First of all , if you 're seasoning tilapia , you 'll want to add some oil to it , since tilapia has almost no fat . So , here 's the steps : Drizzle oil over the tilapia ( both sides ) . Sprinkle it lightly with the spice mixture , all over Let sit 10-15 minutes . Sprinkle with starch ( e.g. flour ) at this point if you 're frying them . Optionally , you can also add some lemon or lime juice ( just a little ) in step 1 . You also want the tilapia sitting on something flat , with the filets in one layer , like a large plate or baking sheet , not heaped up in a bowl . For spicing small filets , you want a finely ground , moderate-flavor spice mixture . Unlike beef or pork , you 're not marinating the fish for a long time , and you 're not cooking it for along time . So the spicing on the fish is n't really a " rub " ; it 's spicing to eat . I recommend against using rubs designed for meat on light fish like tilapia .
Certain people who are " super smellers " who have a heightened sensitivity to smells . Assuming you are n't one of them : fish smells " fishy " when it 's starts to age . If you can find a reputable fish monger , that would help . That said , if you 're sure you have fresh fish , and some fish just simply smell more , you can cut down on the smell , by a quick rinse and a <URL> . As for why fish smell fishy ... it has to do with <URL> . Amines get released as bacteria work to release them . Salmon , Tuna , others ... are higher in amines , while <URL> .

... far from an expert , but I think there are two issues . First , the speed with which you can get an item frozen . Quicker freezing means smaller ice crystals . I assume this leads to a reduced cell structure breakdown . LN might get you there quickly , but the item will warm up when you put it in your freezer . The second issue is , not only is a home freezer not cold enough for prolonged storage without cell structure breakdown , but it probably also has an auto defrost cycle that cause temperature fluctuation . This probably leads to additional cell structure breakdown as things warm and cool over time . There are definitely other pieces of equipment , blast freezers and super low temperature freezers , however most make little economic sense for the home . Personally , my best success has been with vacuum sealed foods ... used in weeks , not months .
While this is n't a substitute , you can get better deals on saffron and make it go further . First of all , do not buy it at a normal grocery store . It tends to be very expensive there . Instead go to a farmer 's market ( not one that happens every Thurs evening at the local church , but rather the big store ) . I 'd imagine most major cities will have one or more . Atlanta has at least 4 . Saffron is much , much cheaper at the farmer 's market . Second , thoroughly grind the saffron before using it . This will help the saffron more completely flavor a dish , requiring a smaller amount of saffron to get the flavor . A quick Google suggested Tumeric , but I ca n't really imagine that working , nor did a lot of the comments on the internets .
I agree with yossarian , if I question it , I chuck it . Although in this case , the salmon probably will not harm you , it might just taste bad . Loss of moisture ( freezer burn ) , taking on of flavours , etc. . I would n't eat it because it would n't taste great . My father-in-law would eat it , because you do n't throw out food ( his rule ) . Bottom line , if it has been in the freezer for those two years straight , it wo n't give you food poisoning or harm you . It 's just a matter of palate . But rest assured , it wo n't taste great .
To answer your main question , you can bake very just about any type of fish . Looking at that recipe though , down in the " tips " section , it suggests you use a flaky white fish . So in that category , you have lots of options , snapper , cod , tilapia , for starters . Their flavours are often a little more mild and will pair nicely with the tomatoes and other flavours in there . If you 're prone to overcooking it , take it out sooner . I find many fish recipes that give cooking times tend to get you to overcook it . It 'd done as soon as the fish " flakes " fully . Leave it any longer it will start to toughen quickly .
That depends on how large your oven is . I certainly could n't do 6 whole fish in mine , but then I have a 24 " wide oven . If you have a 36 " , it would be completely possible ( these are standard US sizes ; no idea what the equivalent would be in other countries ) . Your main adjustment will be dealing with the extra mass to be heated by the additional fish , which will cause the oven to take some additional time to reheat . Again , this depends on how hot ( BTU ) your oven is ; a hot oven would overcome the extra mass in a few minutes , but an underpowered ( for this purpose , anyway ) oven might take an additional 15 or more minutes , which would not be good for the texture of the fish . So , It Depends . If you have a fairly powerful , large , high-end stove , I 'd be ready to flip them at 10 minutes . Less powerful ovens will take longer . Also , if the fish are individually closer together than 1 " , you 'll have the issue that the edges of each fish will be soggy from the moisture of the fish next to it , and they wo n't get good texture . If they 're touching even slightly , they will stick together . You 'll also want to try to ensure some drainage in the pan , lest all of the liquid runoff collect under one fish and make it slimy .
If you want to cure your fish ( basically a brine without moisture ) it is dependent on the thickness of the meat mostly . If it 's as thin as 1/4 " , it will take approximately 1-2 hours . If it 's more around 1 " thick , it could need 3-8 hours . If you use a dry-cure method you do n't have to worry about having too much salt because once you 're done , you just wipe it off . If done incorrectly ( ie . not enough time ) , you should notice a difference in the colour between the edge and the interior . Typically , the colour becomes more pale . The main purpose of the salt is to dehydrate the meat , not necessarily drying . If you use a brine , it obviously wo n't become dry .
I have had some success with this recipe : <URL> The fish should keep for a couple of weeks once pickled , but I always tend to eat mine in the first few days .
From <URL> : When you clean the fish , remove the skin and any dark-colored flesh . This part of the fish is especially strong tasting and somewhat oily . Check out these fish recipes to learn to cook bluefish . Also see <URL> for advices on improving the flavor ( e.g. soak it in milk ) .
Bolted lettuce tastes bitter ; I 'd suggest putting it in your compost pile if you have one . Of course , if you like bitter greens , you could make a salad of your lettuce ( perhaps with a mix of other greens ) with some dried fruit , toasted nuts , and a little goat cheese ; the flavors might marry well .
I think in general it is much safer to transport food cold ( frozen , even ) than hot . You can buy soft-sided insulated bags with straps - I see them in the grocery store - that should be ok for a trip of that length . I buy frozen food and then drive home for an hour with it , put it straight in the freezer , and would laugh at the thought of there being food-safety issues with that . So one approach is to make a lasagna , casserole , or the like in a disposable container , freeze it at home , take it to your relative 's and put it in her freezer . Now she has a semi-quick ( but at least easy ) meal waiting for her . ( A side note from remembering my days with an infant : something that heats up FAST and can be eaten with one hand will be more useful than a serves-12-needs-a-fork-heats-for-an-hour option . In other words burritos ( 2 min in microwave , can eat while holding the baby ) beat lasagna ( 60 + min in oven , you can forget and dry it out or burn it , then you need a plate and a knife and fork to eat it . ) Samosas are good one-handers , too . ) If you want to take something that is ready-to-eat , you could use the same bag to keep hot food hot , but I would probably suggest heating it up again on arrival .
Every substitution is probably going to require other alterations . Baking soda 's effects extend beyond leavening : it generally reacts with acidic ingredients ( making the batter less sour ) and also provides sodium ions which can affect flavor . If the substitute does n't react with acid as strongly , you may need to decrease acid ingredients or substitute neutral ingredients to obtain the same flavor ( e.g. , milk instead of buttermilk or yogurt , regular cream instead of sour cream ) . If the substitute does n't have sodium , sometimes adding a bit of salt may be necessary . As for the leavening action itself , any substitute will introduce its own issues in adapting . Unless you 're experienced with this sort of thing ( or like to " experiment " and possibly have cakes that fail in various ways ) , I would generally recommend finding a cake recipe that has leavening agents you actually have on hand , rather than trying a substitute . There are really only two common substitutions that often wo n't affect texture or flavor in major ways : ( 1 ) Potassium bicarbonate - can usually be substituted 1:1 for baking soda , but is generally tougher to find than baking soda . ( Look sometimes for it at drugstores ; baking soda itself can often be found as " sodium bicarbonate " or some other name in other countries at drugstores too . ) Without the sodium ions , you may need to add a bit of salt , roughly 1/4 or 1/3 of the amount of baking soda will be sufficient for flavor . ( 2 ) Baking powder - also often harder to find in other countries than baking soda . Also , other countries may have other formulations than what is found in the U.S. For standard U.S. baking powder , you 'd generally use 2-4 times the amount of baking soda in the recipe . The reason for this inexact ratio is a trade-off in flavor vs. reactivity . If you want the same reactivity with acidic ingredients , you 'd need 3-4 times more baking powder , but this often results in a " baking powder flavor , " sometimes described as " metallic . " But if you decrease the amount to avoid this flavor -- maybe twice as much as baking soda -- you wo n't react with as much acid , so you probably would want to reduce the amount of acidic ingredients in the batter . For baking powder outside the U.S. , you 'd need to look up the exact formulas/mixtures used and perhaps make further alterations . ( I 'm not going to go into the less common chemical alternatives -- like baker 's ammonia -- which are even less common for baking today . And I 'm not even going to bother with possibilities like homemade potash from wood ashes , which theoretically can provide some leavening . If you 're in a country where you 're that desperate for chemical leaveners , I 'd doubt you 'd have access to basic baking materials . ) Unfortunately , as mentioned , these two options are generally less common to find exact equivalents than baking soda . So , we move onto less reliable options that will require further recipe modification . ( 3 ) Egg whites as leavening - separate eggs and beat whites separately , generally to soft or medium peaks . Usually , fold into batter at the last moment ( generally in stages , first mixing in a portion of the egg whites more thoroughly to lighten , then gently folding in the remainder ) and bake immediately . This will only work by itself with relatively light cakes that do n't have a lot of heavy ingredients . Adding a small amount of sugar toward the end of beating may have a stablizing effect and prevent early collapse of a cake . Cream of tartar or a very small amount of other acids like lemon juice or vinegar can also prevent overbeating . ( Note that even if eggs are not separated , beating whole eggs or yolks until light colored will add in small amounts of air . ) ( 4 ) Creaming method - ignore recipe instructions and begin by creaming butter and sugar together until fluffy , often requiring at least 10 minutes of steady beating with a mixer for maximum results . ( By hand , this generally would be done for an hour or more traditionally . ) This will trap air bubbles that will ultimately leaven the batter ( the traditional method for pound cakes ) . This works better than egg whites alone for heavier batters ( e.g. , with more flour and/or butter ) , but it still will result in a denser cake than one with baking soda . Generally , continue after creaming butter and sugar by adding eggs one at a time while mixing vigorously , then fold in other ingredients more gently toward the end . ( If the recipe calls for a liquid sugar , like molasses or honey or whatever , substitute with dry sugar for more creaming action . ) ( 5 ) Yeast - there are <URL> devoted to the problems of converting a chemically leavened cake into a yeast-leavened one . Yeast is probably the only way to actually get the same volume without baking soda or other chemical leaveners , but it will usually change the cake texture significantly . Basically , yeast cakes tend to be tougher and more bread-like , while chemically leavened cakes tend to go for a softer cru
There 's always the delight of botulism , which thrives in the anaerobic environment provided by vacuum packing . Listeria and vibrio bacteria can grow in an anaerobic environment , and are potential food safety risks present in fish . With this in mind , I would not expect vacuum packing to extend the life of a fish much . It will reduce freezer burn though !

Should I steam or boil zongzi ?
I have looked extensively and it seems that whether to boil or steam is determined by region and it is as subjective as the fillings used . See below from this <URL> . Other variations include using black instead of white glutinous rice , or precooking the rice and filling , or steaming instead of boiling , or even wrapping into a cylindrical shape or a flat paddle shape instead of a pyramidal one . You may be able to make a decision based on certain factors of your recipe . For example : Some recipes call for the rice to be soaked while others call for it to be cooked . If I was using soaked rice I would probably choose boiling as the zongzi may become too dry with steaming . Same idea for other ingredients . Another consideration would be how well the zongzi are wrapped . If they are wrapped very skillfully , either way could work . However , if not , the filling could come out much easier with boiling . So , in the end , I would say that there really is n't a really definitive answer . I think I would use the method called for in the recipe as there may be specific reasons the prescribed cooking method was chosen .
Unless the recipe specifies " heaping " , read spoon measurements as level . That goes for cup measurements as well . Unless the recipe specifies another method to fill your measuring spoon or cup , use yet another implement to fill the spoon or cup , then level it by scraping with a knife . That is the most precisely repeatable way to measure ( especially flour ) with a cup or spoon . The one exception to the " spooned and leveled " technique is in the measurement of brown sugar . Recipes will usually call for brown sugar to be " packed " , which is just as at sounds . Press the brown sugar into the spoon or cup to squeeze in as much as you can and still have a level top . It 's far more accurate to measure by weight but most non-professional recipes in the US are written with volumetric measurements . For baking especially , consider converting volumetric measurements to weight using sources like this : <URL> , and measuring with an accurate digital scale . Depending upon the methods used in developing the recipe , measuring by weight the first time you make a recipe may not get you any closer to the measurements the author of the recipe intends , but at least your results will be accurately repeatable and tweakable .
Unfortunately I do n't agree with the given answers . I recently bought a $ 350 zojirushi rice cooker . According to the manual there is such a thing as " rinse-free " rice . There is even a function on the rice cooker for this setting . In addition , the rice cooker manual explains that the rice should be rinsed several times with cold water .
There are two ways to thicken gravy : simmer down Requires time , patience and a wide pot to get a large surface area for optimum evaporation . Simmering down results in very concentrated flavours ( including salt , so be careful with salting in the beginning ) . use a thickener This is often something starchy like flour or corn / potato starch that binds the liquid . Note that the flavours wo n't be as concentrated , sometimes even a bit dulled by the starch . So try your sauce and depending on the flavour level you have reached now , you should simmer longer , use starch or do both sequentially . ( If your guests are hungrily gnawing at the tablecloth already , whip out the starch , adjust the seasoning and serve asap ^_^ )
<URL> , using olive oil to fry is basically a waste of money . " After I 'd heated them , none of the olive oils had much olive flavor left . In fact , they did n't taste much different from the seed oils . " According to a <URL> I have access to , you could use high oleic sunflower oil for frying as it degrades better .
If you are using a additional containers or surfaces in the oven for baking , you should absolutely pre-heat it with the oven . Use an IR thermometer to measure the actual temperature of the container - a dutch oven or heavy stone will take longer to come up to temperature than the air in the oven will , so the oven will claim to be preheated sooner than it is actually ready . Remember that temperature and heat are two different things - one of the benefits of using a baking stone or dutch oven or other " heavy " thing is that it stores a lot of HEAT . Air at 450F and Cast Iron at 450F contain very different amounts of heat , and it is heat that will bake your bread . You can tell that they have soaked up as much heat as they can when their temperature is close to your oven set-point , which will take a while . The only possible exception to this would be if you are just using a thin sheet metal steam tray to cover your pizza stone to trap steam , since it has so little thermal mass . A thin tray could probably be put over the bread without preheating the tray since it wo n't absorb or store much thermal energy . To prevent burning , choose containers with a good , solid handle , and get quality oven mitts , preferably with long-ish sleeves to protect your forearms .
Technically , your idea seems sound . But I would n't do it . What you are proposing to do in your electric kettle is very close to the standards for flash pasteurization . According to wikipedia , the standard procedure for flash pasteurization is to heat and circulate the liquid at 71.5 ° C ( 160 ° F ) to 74 ° C ( 165 ° F ) , for about 15 to 30 seconds , which results in a five log ( 99.999 % ) or greater reduction in bacteria . Other journal articles seem to indicate that some protozoa like cryptosporidium are killed by flash pasteurization , but others , like giardia , might survive in small numbers . I suspect the guideline for boiling water in issues of safety and in recipes is used because steam and bubbles are such convenient guarantors of temperature . Psychologically , though , this makes me a little nervous . Personally , I would boil the water - if you have time for tea , you have time to boil water . It is possible , though , that you are a more adventurous tea drinker than I am .
Most cakes freeze extremely well -- especially cakes that are not iced , such as bundt cakes . Wrap the cake in plastic wrap , then aluminum foil , and freeze . For cupcakes or slices , you can put them in a freezer bag . If you are going to freeze a whole cake , it is better to frost it after thawing , as the icing can be tricky . If you have icing , you can put the cake in the freezer long enough for the icing to br firm , and then wrap and freeze -- however , thawing can be tricky as you might get a bit of condensation , which can affect the texture of the frosting . EDIT in response to question about a plastic box , and why the double layering : Boxes consume space extra space , often at a premium in a freezer , and offer air gaps in which freezer burn is more likely . Not all plastic is food-safe . The food-safe plastic wrap is for direct contact with the cake but is gas permeable . I suppose you could just go directly to foil , but things are more likely to stick to it . The foil provides a gas and moisture barrier ( and light , but that is less of a problem in the freezer ) . The direct contact with the with the cake eliminates the air gaps , making freezer burn much less likely .
Physics to the rescue : Contrary to popular belief you can not see steam . What you can see is tiny droplets of water that were steam ( = gaseous form of water ) before , but have condensed ( = returned to liquid state ) again on very small particles like dust motes . If the amount of droplets is big enough in a certain volume of air , they become visible . In other words , you have created a small cloud in your kitchen . Now back to your pot : If the pot is simmering , a lot of water will condense over or near the pot , especially if your kitchen is rather cool . At a full boil , the steam disperses more , so when the condensation happens , the tiny droplets are spread out wider , making the " cloud " harder to see . Also , the air around the pot is likely to be a bit warmer , so that the gaseous H2O will likely condense at a greater distance from the source anyway . This may lead to the assumption that a boiling pot emits less steam when actually the opposite is the case . If you want to verify this , look for condensation away from the heat source , e.g. your cool kitchen windows . There , the different amounts should be very obvious .
No . The amount of salt you would have to add to water to make an appreciable difference is enormous . Salt is added to water for various reasons : to season whatever is being cooked in it ; to maintain colour ; to maintain structural integrity .
You should n't cook more than a few minutes , and should cool them as quickly as possible afterwards . Ideally , you 'll be blanching them , and here 's how : Bring a pot of water with a pinch of salt in it to a roiling boil Dump beans in , and cook for a few minutes Check that beans are fully cooked ( time will vary by variety and ripeness of beans ) Strain beans , and IMMEDIATELY transfer to an prepared ice water bath to cool as fast as possible This ensures beans are precisely cooked , but do not have a chance to over-cook , and using the ice water helps them retain color and flavor . It 's how we get deliciously crisp haricot vert ( French green beans ) at the restaurant I work for . Note that cooking times and crispness will also vary based on the variety and age at which the beans were picked .
Looks like ehow has the <URL> thus far to storing bean sprouts After purchasing Bean Sprouts should be stored and washed after purchasing in growing . The article indicates that the best methods for storage are the following : Wash them after you purchase them . Wash bean sprouts after purchasing or growing . Wash them in cold water to remove seed coats , roots and other residue that may be present . If you are using them within a day , store them in the refrigerator at 40 to 45 degrees . Place the sprouts in a plastic bag with a wet paper towel to keep them moist . Store in icy water and change the water few times a day You can also store sprouts in a bucket of icy water and change the water a few times a day . Depending on how long the sprouts were in transit or on the store shelf , they should last longer than when stored in a plastic bag . Freeze them Freeze sprouts for the longest storage . Wash sprouts as described in Step One . Then heat one layer at a time in steam for three minutes . Cool right away in icy water and drain . Put the sprouts into plastic containers and seal . It also mentions in the <URL> to just grow them to provide the best freshness . Apparently the shelf life of beansprouts should only be stored up to <URL> Source : <URL>
A stiff brush and a set out in bright sun is about all I 've felt the need to do with mine . Normally I 'll just tap out any extra flour . If I 've got a dough that sticks ( like last night when I did n't flour enough ) , then I just take a stiff brush and get all the bits off . If they do get a bit wet , dry them with a towel and then in a warm oven . If I think there 's been enough moisture to be concerned about something growing , I 'll set it in bright sun ( or my UV exposure box ) . Strong UV is a good inhibitor for much of that .
You do n't have to peel garlic before using a garlic press , but doing so lets you press more garlic before you have to clean out the skins and so forth . If you only need to press a clove or two , there is not a lot of reason to peel first , since you will just have to clean the press out once .
As Jefromi mentioned in the comments , what you do is highly dependent on the recipe for the Bao you are making . Traditionally Bao is made with yeast but if your recipe includes baking powder as the main leavener , then you would need to steam the Bao as your recipe indicates . Otherwise the leavening will expend itself and you will get tough Bao . If the Bao recipe you are using have yeast as the main leavening agent , then you can do either . If you want to steam it the next day then you can leave the dough in the refrigerator to rise the first time overnight . You might want to decrease the amount of yeast used in your recipe in this case . The next day , take the dough out 2 hours before you want to steam it and let the dough sit for about 1 hr to get to room temperature . Then cut and form the dough into the Bao shapes and let it rise for another 45 minutes at room temperature . Then you can steam it . Resteaming Bao is not an issue if thats the route you want to go . A lot of places that sell Bao actually premakes it , steams it and then refrigerates the Bao . Then it is resteamed when it is needed . You can even freeze the Bao if you make a particularly large batch . The quality of the Bao wo n't degrade too much as long as you resteam the Bao .
I mostly agree with GdD 's answer , but I 'll add a couple more comments . This may be an obvious answer , but I 'd generally follow the recommendation on the specific bottle . Some sauces will clearly state " refrigerate after opening , " and others wo n't . The Frank 's FAQ <URL> is an example of these sorts of instructions : two specific products recommend refrigeration , but in other cases for Frank 's hot sauces it is n't required ( " but doing so will keep the product fresher for a longer period of time " ) . I 've also seen an occasional product that said refrigeration " recommended " or something on the package . I 'd generally assume that if a manufacturer bothers to say something about refrigeration , it 's a good idea to do it . Sometimes it may be for food safety , but in other cases it may just be a product with ingredients that will lose flavor or degrade rapidly at room temperature . Most hot sauces wo n't degrade noticeably at room temperature even over a period of several months , and many will be stable for a couple years . Others will change flavors slowly over time at room temperature , but not necessarily in a negative way . ( Some sauces are deliberately " aged " or fermented at room temperature for periods from a week to several years , and sometimes these processes will continue to change the product even after it is bottled . Some sauces will undergo natural browning reactions at room temperature as well , which can alter flavor . I know some people who actually prefer hot sauce this way , though I 'm personally skeptical . ) If there 's a " best before " date on your sauce and no instruction to refrigerate , you can probably assume the sauce is supposed to maintain quality at least that long without refrigeration . However , that does n't guarantee that it will stay exactly the same over that period . As GdD said , refrigeration will almost always keep the sauce more stable .
I 'd say freeze nearly all of them uncooked and bake when ready . That way they go through only one cooking and maintain the fresh lasagna taste/feel . The sauce and and the cheese will freeze ok . Mozzarella is a pretty sensitive cheese and once it 's been baked , it 's not going to hold as well when thawed and re-warmed . In my experience it gets gummy and the fat runs off . You have much better chance of enjoying a good meal with the cheese frozen raw . Unfortunately , your noodles will likely take the hardest hit , but will likely fare better than going through two heat cycles . The ground beef and sausage will also fare better that way . The reason I suggested freezing MOST and not all , is that there are times when you 're behind the 8-ball , hungry , and do n't have the time to bake the sucker , and even ponder settling for dog-food . At that point having a silver bullet in the freezer is a bonus ;) and you 'll be ok with inferior lasagna .
Recipes for preserving tend to be very specific . They 're calibrated to balance factors like pH and sugar content in the final recipes , and of course to minimize the risk of spoilage . In general , you should always follow the steps as written in your recipe . What I 've generally observed is that jam-type recipes do n't always include the final boiling step because the jam is already cooked ( edit : and because <URL> , the sugar content is generally high enough to be inhospitable to bacteria ) . That differs from canning fresh fruits and vegetables which are largely raw . The purpose of the boiling step here is to kill off pathogens before they get a chance to settle in and spoil the contents , as no matter how well you clean them , there are likely to be some spores , bacteria , etc. remaining . Even a tiny initial population can grow and spoil your preserves over the length of time they 'll be put away . So , initial sterilization is always required to clean the jars themselves . The second boil <URL> the contents . If you 've already done this as part of your preparation , as with a jam , then it most likely is n't required . It probably wo n't hurt , especially if you plan to put up your jams for an extended period of time ( i.e. months or years ) but you 'll have to weigh the convenience of skipping that step against the potential risk of spoilage . That said , let me state again for the record that if your specific recipe says to include the final boil , then there 's likely a very good reason , and you should follow that instruction .
After a bit of googling , I found <URL> which suggests that searing twice ( both before and after ) might be preferable .
I have tried a number of similar tools and find that the Pampered Chef " <URL> " to be the best-in-breed for choppers . It is sturdy , it is well built and will last . reliable , after cleaning it assembles easily and works consistently easy to clean , opens up easily and is dishwasher safe . I find this model works well for small chopping tasks , such as those advertised with the " slap chop " . If you have more than " a handful " of material to chop you will do well to divide it into smaller bundles . Much more and it is time to move to a larger device . Mine if 5-6 years old , with no signs of slowing down . I am not a Pampered Chef rep I do not broadly endorse their products . Many of their items are " not so good "

Is there anything gained by butterfly cutting a hot dog for grilling ?
Butterflying a hot dog ( or any similar sausage ) has two effects . First , as the moisture inside the hot dog expands during cooking , causing the casings to frequently burst due to the pressure that builds up . When you butterfly a hot dog the this is prevented . Such blistering does not ' harm ' the hot dog but are somewhat ' unsightly ' , so I would call this an aesthetic effect . The second effect is that it allows the hot dog to cook through more evenly . Particularly for those who prefer their hot dog well done butterflying can get the insides cook through without charring the outside . [ Edit : found something interesting to add ... ] If you want to impress your friend with something different , try <URL> .
It sounds kinda similar to <URL> , but that is usually made with extra sweeteners added to the milk as it is cooked down . You might look at <URL> , which is a Russian food , although it looks like the cooking down is usually less than you describe - that is , it may produce a brown crust , but the bulk of the milk is perhaps still creamy in color . You could look at <URL> or <URL> , which are made by cooking milk down into a evaporated , caramelized brown sauce . It looks like both are usually sweetened during or after cooking , but since the sugar is added later in the process , with other flavorings to taste , I see no reason that sweetening might not equally be omitted if the flavor is enough for whoever is making it . An interesting sort of match comes from <URL> , which was made by cooking down whey into a brown sauce ( Norwegian <URL> and Swedish <URL> are variations of this ) - but more recently cream and sometimes milk was added to the whey for a fattier end product . I could see someone cutting out half the process by making something similar with only milk , instead of some balance of whey plus cream . As a bonus , I do n't believe these products usually have added sweetener , so that might be a closer match . Honestly , there are a lot more variants where there is sugar or other sweeteners added to the milk while it cooks down and caramelizes , or even afterwards to taste , then variations where the milk is cooked down plain . However , there 's no reason why someone might not have adapted one of those recipes to omit the extra sugar for various reasons , so go ahead and figure out which name ( or tradition ) seems most in line with what your friend makes .
BTU means British Thermal Unit . So : lbs of water x temperature rise = BTUs required for one hour ( British units ) ( 1 lb of water x 1 degree Fahrenheit ) = 1 BTU for reaching temp in 1 hour ( approx ) Let 's do a simple calc : 1 ) Suppose a 30 % efficiency ( you are heating air and pot too ) 2 ) Four lbs water 3 ) 70 F as water initial temperature ( 212-70 = 142 to boil ) So : ( 4 lb water x 142 F ) * 3. ,33 ( eff ) = 1900 BTUs for reaching boil in one hour 17000/1900 = 9 ( your burner output / required output to boil in 1 hour ) 60 mins / 9 = 7 mins So you could expect bringing to boil your 4 lbs of water in 7 mins in a 17.000 BTU burner starting from 70 F . Normal pressure and altitude , of course . <URL> is a video of a 17.500 BTU burner working to compare with yours . Keep in mind that many approximations were done in this calc . No evaporation , medium to heavy pot , etc. .
Coupling design matters more than material . If you make your coupling short and thin , concentrating all the force in a small area , it will strip even it 's metal . Conversely , a well-designed coupling is longer , so the strain is spread over a large area . I have a Cuisinart CSB-76 hand ( immersion ) blender , and it has handled ice numerous times without any problems . It has a plastic coupling , but it is a good 3 cm long to spread out the force over more material . If I recall correctly , the professional-grade Vitamix blender also uses a plastic coupling , but with careful engineering to prevent problems . It is now common to advertise kitchen appliances based on their motor 's power ( 700 watts in this case ) , but many of these appliances will have mechanical failures if called on to deliver that much power . I suspect that you 'd be better served to look for a lower-power blender from a reputable brand with good consumer reviews . I do n't think the professional-grade immersion blenders I 've used in restaurant kitchens are rated to more than 400 watts . Personally , I recommend the Cuisinart CSB-76 , and have never had a case where I needed more than its 200W .
There is no default temperature . The recipe is telling you the temperature : 350F . You preheat the oven to 350F so that it 's already fully hot when you put the cake in , and then you leave it at 350F to bake the cake . The whole point of preheating is to have the oven already at the temperature you want to bake at . If you preheated then changed the temperature , then you would n't have preheated properly : the oven would be at the wrong temperature . If a recipe actually wanted you to change the temperature , it would explicitly say so , something along the lines of " preheat the oven to 550F , put the bread in , then reduce the temperature to 500F " . That 'd cause it to be baked at closer to 550F at first , then closer to 500F later once the oven cools down . But that 's not something that comes up much ; most things just get baked at a constant temperature . Bottom line , just do what the recipe actually says to ! If it does n't say to change the temperature , do n't .
Flick water on the pan . If it just sits there , it 's not hot enough . If it combines into balls and skates around on the pan , it 's either too hot or just right for a wok or blackening something . If it sizzles and evaporates within a couple of seconds , it should be good for a normal sautee or sweat .
The USDA <URL> that " all plastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time . Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves , they should be discarded . " Other advice they offer for avoiding food contamination from cutting boards : Avoid Cross-Contamination The Meat and Poultry Hotline says that consumers may use wood or a nonporous surface for cutting raw meat and poultry . However , consider using one cutting board for fresh produce and bread and a separate one for raw meat , poultry , and seafood . This will prevent bacteria on a cutting board that is used for raw meat , poultry , or seafood from contaminating a food that requires no further cooking . Cleaning Cutting Boards To keep all cutting boards clean , the Hotline recommends washing them with hot , soapy water after each use ; then rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels . Nonporous acrylic , plastic , or glass boards and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher ( laminated boards may crack and split ) . Both wooden and plastic cutting boards can be sanitized with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented , liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water . Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes . Rinse with clear water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels .
I 've had the same problem once . The first substitute is <URL> . But they 're not easy to find either . The second one is using <URL> . Tamales will be done in the same time and you could eat the leaf if you want . I 've tried it once and it came out great . Here it 's a recipe for <URL> . Here it is a graphic <URL> . They are written in Spanish , let me know if you need a translator ;) PS . My mexican mother in law used to do it with chard .
The exact number of cutting boards is n't critical , the important piece is minimizing cross contamination . You can use one cutting board safely as long as you 're using it in a food-safe order ( cut vegetables , then proteins ) , and follow good sanitation practices ( wash &amp; sanitize the board between ingredients ) . A quick scrub with soap and water and a spritz with a bleach , alcohol , or quat solution between ingredients will minimize your need for different boards .
True , you may have cooked it too much and spinach is cooked when it reaches 160 degrees F . If the spinach overcooks , it does not necessarily mean it is bad , it is just overcooked . In my opinion , eat it , I have because mine did not taste bad as I understand yours did not taste bad . Now , another idea is that when you have smelly spinach , you might have cooked in on very high heat and you burned it or overcooked it , you could still eat it . Again , if it does not taste bad , it is ok to eat it . Another idea is that you used rancid oil , which using the rancid oil on the spinach would taste bad and you would then get rid of it . That would taste bad . Also there is the problem of listeria , which is some kind of a bacteria , I think , and the spinach is bad to begin with and will or might make you sick . Please look that up , lettuce also has that problem . I think the spinach would have a blackish hue to it and taste bad . Get rid of it . Lastly , what I read about spinach is that you do not re-heat cooked spinach , eat it cold . I make big batches of creamed spinach , my family loves it , takes it to their homes , nukes it , and nobody has gotten sick . I am no doctor , so take that info for what it is worth . Lastly secondly , I use frozen spinach to make dips . I make too much of that also and I make my own creations of that . My family likes to take that home also . What I do with any dip is put out smaller portions at a time and fill up as necessary . It is time consuming but as a safety issue it makes me feel good and when you feel you are doing your best to keep people eating safer , it is worth it . At very Last , use your judgement , do n't take chances . When in doubt , throw it out . I do what I do because I have a lot of experience , but that does not mean I do n't get into trouble once in awhile . Good Luck
Googling , I found <URL> , presenting a chemical and technical analysis of curcumin . Skimming through it , it seems that degradation of the substance should not be a problem due to temperature , although the report does n't say much about it except that it should n't be a problem : Curcumin is stable in dry food . It is relatively stable to heat so it can be used in thermally treated foods . However , it warns about using it in solutions of a high pH , without stating which of the degradation products may be unfortunate to ingest . Furthermore curcumin is sensitive to light , so if you want as little as possible of it to degrade it is probably a good idea to keep a lid on the pan while you 're heating the solution and consume it fairly quickly afterwards : In native form curcumin is not suitable as a colouring agent in aqueous solutions of pH > 7 The principal colouring components of curcumin are not particularly stable to light , especially in solutions . After the photo-irradiation of compound 1 , a cyclisation product was detected , as well as decomposition products , such as vanillic acid , vanillin , and ferulic acid ( Sasaki et al , 1998 ) . Commercial formulations of curcumin are available that are designed to minimize the inherent light instability . With regards to the pH of your solution I do n't think that should be a problem , as it is probably fairly acidic from juices of the lemon .
You could try lightly steaming it , but in all likelihood there 's no rescuing . Your best bet is to chop it and throw it in a blender to ' grate ' it . Alternatively , blend it with maltodextrin/dextrose to ( re ) obtain the powdery quality .
Context would make me more sure , but I expect this is referring to neutral flavor . If you need oil in something for purposes other than flavor , and want to make sure that the other flavors in the dish are n't affected or obscured , then you 'd want a neutral oil . For example , for frying and sauteeing , we rarely use strongly flavored oil . ( There 's the additional problem that many flavors are destroyed at high heat ; many more aromatic oils have lower smoke points . ) Oils like sesame oil , chili oil , and walnut oil are decidedly not neutral . On the other end , oils like canola oil and grapeseed oil are neutral . Close to neutral , there are very mildly-flavored oils like peanut oil . ( Note that there 's also strongly flavored peanut oil , but " plain " peanut oil is very mild . ) Somewhere more in the middle there are things like olive oil , which has some flavor but is n't overwhelmingly strong .
Cooks Illustrated apparently <URL> to a lab for analysis : We were also interested in finding out how much sodium penetrates during the process . To answer the question , we brined natural pork chops and boneless , skinless chicken breasts in standard quick-brine solutions of 1/2 cup table salt dissolved in 2 quarts of cold water . After 30 minutes , we removed the pork and chicken , patted them dry , and cooked them in different skillets . We also cooked an " enhanced " pork chop ( injected with a saltwater solution ) and a kosher chicken breast that had been salted during processing . We sent the samples to a food lab to measure sodium content . The brined pork chops had a sodium content of 245 milligrams per 100 grams of meat ( just under 1/8 teaspoon per serving ) ; the enhanced pork had a bit more , with 268 milligrams . The kosher chicken breast weighed in at 252 milligrams of sodium . The brined chicken came in with the most sodium of all , at 353 milligrams ( just over 1/8 teaspoon per serving ) . The USDA recommends limiting your daily sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams , about 1 teaspoon . Why did the chicken absorb more salt during brining than the pork ? The loose white muscle fibers in chicken absorb salt water more quickly than the tighter muscle fibers in pork .
Dilute heavily by using a very small portion of peppers per dish Allow cooking time for the pepper flavor to permeate the dish before adding more . It 's not like black pepper where the taste spreads instantly . Remove the seeds and membranes holding them , as this reduces spiciness considerably Cut peppers very finely or puree so there are n't any large pieces to deliver a shocker in the final dish Wear gloves when handling the peppers If you do n't use gloves , wash your hands well before touching your eyes , mouth , or other " sensitive regions . " AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY , DO NOT FRY OR SAUTE THE PEPPERS . No , seriously . The last one is a mistake you only make once , and should be on a warning label with all store-bought chilis . The capsaicin somehow becomes volatile when heated enough , and the result is like filling your entire domicile with pepper spray . I am ashamed to say that the last two cautions are drawn purely from personal experience . It 's not the kind of " hot date " you want to share with an ( un ) lucky person , believe me .
The answer , quite simply , is no . Even advanced laboratories have difficulty making the determination for certain . This is also a complex problem that gets more difficult as various standards are used and then fail . Before 2000 , a common solution was to simply use microscopic analysis to look for pollen and and other vegetable matter . Since then , many honey processing plants have been developing increasingly advanced filtering techniques that will remove the characteristic markers ( deliberately or unintentionally ) . [ ** See detailed note below . ] Various chemical or basic physical markers also have proved insufficient , since the sugar composition of honey can be faked quite well with various sugar syrup blends . The accepted standard these days , as mentioned in the question , seems to be to use a mass spectrometer to determine the <URL> in a rather specific lab procedure . ( Obviously most people do n't have a mass spectrometer at home . ) The current procedure for this test was adopted after previous lab tests were shown to <URL> in some batches of honey . The isotope ratio method is the only one specifically listed in the FDA 's <URL> to determine the possibility of adulteration : FDA laboratories do not have the instrumental capability to analyze honey according to the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International , AOAC Official Method 991.41 , which requires an isotope ratio mass spectrometer . Ironically , in order to avoid the previous false positives for the New Zealand honey mentioned above , the new testing process <URL> , a process which has also been used to hide the origin of honey and to confuse analysis : To eliminate a false positive C ( 4 ) sugar test for Manuka honey , prior removal of pollen and other insoluble material from the honey is necessary to ensure that only the pure protein is isolated . But even a refined isotopic methodology is flawed when it comes to detecting various types of adulteration , specifically beet sugar . As <URL> notes : [ Using isotope ratios from a mass spectrometer , ] adulteration using C4 sugar syrups ( HFCS and GS ) could be detected to a certain extent while adulteration of honey using C3 sugar syrups ( beet sugar ) could not be detected . Adulteration by using SS ( beet sugar ) still has a serious detection problem , especially in countries in which beet is used in manufacturing sugar . So , what 's the alternative ? Well , the other general method that could detect various adulterating components is <URL> ( DSC ) . <URL> gives a good summary of the process , which essentially looks at how a material behaves as it undergoes thermal changes . At certain temperatures when crystallization or something occurs , there will be excess heat absorbed or given off compared to at other temperatures . And at other points there will be minor changes in heat capacity ( i.e. , the amount of heat it takes to alter the temperature of a substance by a specific number of degrees ) . Honey , for example , displays a glass transition temperature ( Tg ) around -40 ° C ( -40 ° F ) near a certain point in crystallization . Other sugar syrups may not show this , but they may show changes at slightly higher temperatures ( still below freezing ) , due to water crystals freezing or thawing . ( Water is included in the sugar network in honey , so it does n't show the same characteristics . ) There are other thermal properties that can be measured at various temperatures . As <URL> summarizes in its conclusion : Used concomitantly with the second enthalpy of fusion ( occurring between 40 and 90 ° C ) , the glass transition temperature , Tg , is one of the most potentially useful parameters for characterizing honeys and syrups and for distinguishing between them . The Tg value , being strongly dependent on the amorphous phases of the sample , will respond to modification of the chemical composition and the implicit structural modification caused by the addition of exogenous material . Thus , adulteration of the honey will cause inevitable changes in both Tg and [ delta ] H2 values . Under laboratory conditions , adulterations by industrial sugar syrups can be detected from 5-10 % additions depending on the measured parameter . I would pay particular attention to this final sentence -- the differences can only be detected " under laboratory conditions " where precise temperatures and amounts of heat can be measured . To replicate such a test at home , you 'd need to be able to add a certain precise amount of heat to the honey at subzero temperatures , all the while keeping it isolated from other sources of temperature fluctuations and observing where the heating " stalls " briefly . Then , you 'd have to calibrate your homemade test against some known samples ( syrups , 100 % honey , etc. ) just to be sure you 're actually observing the same things as in the article cited here . You 'd need to confirm that by observing a more subtle difference in heat capacity changes that would occur in hot temperature ranges
The original Buffalo Wings are made with <URL> . The original recipe is simply equal parts melted butter and hot sauce . However , you truly can use just about whatever hot sauce you want in even greater ratios if you want more kick . There are also some distributors that specialize in spicy wing sauces . I recommend <URL> if you are adventurous and enjoy a very nice kick of heat .
Wiki 's cited entry on <URL> is interesting . The ready-made spice blend " Herbes de Provence " did not come into existence until the 1970 's , as a product marketed by the French company Ducros . If there 's a standard blend ratio , it would therefore be what 's in the Ducros ' product - though since it is a generic term rather than a trademarked one , other manufacturers and cooks have their own recipes and interpretations . Ducros ' own blend <URL> , according to the " My French Cuisine " blog ( who also has the McCormick blend breakdown and a home-made alternative blend sourced from a French cookbook ) : Rosemary ( romarin ) -- 26 % Savory ( sariette ) -- 26 % Oregano ( origan ) -- 26 % Thyme ( thym ) -- 19 % Basil ( basilic ) -- 3 %
1 ) I do not think so , the technique was described in e.g. modernist cuisine , they suggest using a ISI siphone and if I can remember correctly does not describe any other tool . Any pressure chamber would work , if you have access to one :-) 2 ) I have something like <URL> which can be charged with both soda and cream charges , that is what I woudl suggest . ( mine is not ISI ) . Think both you show will work since both charges are the same . Charge with N2O ( cream charge ) . 3 ) For the infusion part , you want pressure , look for size of the device that suits your needs . The bigger , the more you can do at the same time , but will require more charges for same pressure .

Can coconut cream be made from coconut flour ?
Coconut flour is what remains <URL> when extracting the milk from coconut . So I doubt you can make anything resembling coconut milk ( much less coconut cream ) from it , unless the manufacturer has done an exceptionally poor job of doing so already !
Yes , you can freeze buttermilk . When thawed , the emulsion will break into solids and whey . This makes no difference for baked goods ; you can also use a blender to restore it to a smooth , thicker liquid if needed for applications like salad dressing . See also : <URL> . <URL>
Well , yes and no . A lot of recipes for semifreddo are n't truly semifreddo because they are hard frozen . Recipes like that can be fried just like ice cream . The key to fried ice cream is to hard freeze the scoops of ice cream . By definition , that is n't semifreddo , but definitions do n't seem to matter much to writers of recipes . So , if the " stuff " is hard frozen , it can be coated and fried like fried ice cream . Perhaps after being deep fried , the name " semifreddo " is more apropos .
I do n't think the amount will matter too much for cooking , just may take a bit longer , but a thermotor should help there . What I would consider doing is make the crown out of the three like you had planned and cook the fourth seperatly ( but at the same time ) . When the lamb is done carve the extra rack ( by the single bone ) and use it to garnish the crown either inside the crown poking out , or infront of the crown laying on their sides so everyone can see how perfect the lamb is cooked ... so everyone will be impressed with both the pretty crown and how well the meat is perpared .
This can be a hard one to get right . There are three important phases of baking these : An brief initial high heat phase A longer lower heat phase A brief slow cooling phase For the initial phase I go with 400 ℉ for 15 minutes . The high heat provides a rapid rise with a hollow center . For the second phase I reduce the heat to 350 ℉ for 30-40 minutes . This phase allows the shells to firm up and dries out the center . At this point you should cut one of them in half and see how moist the center is . It 's important that the center of the dough be as dry as possible here , having an undercooked center is what causes the dough to deflate . A little bit of moisture is ok . For the final phase , turn the oven off and let them cool with the door ajar for 10-15 minutes . With the door fully open the rapid cooling can also trigger deflation .
There are a variety of frozen desserts which are all related . The main difference between ice cream and frozen custard is the amount of eggs used to thicken the base mix . Philadelphia style ice cream is made from a base mix of milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings . French ( or simply plain ) ice cream is made from a base mix which is essentially a very thin custard or creme anglaise : milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings thickened with egg yolks or whole egg . The base mix is cooked to thicken , and then chilled prior to churning . Frozen custard is very similar to French style ice cream , but with a greater ratio of eggs or egg yolks to dairy or liquid in the mix . With this information , you can adapt nearly any custard recipe to be freezable as ice cream or frozen custard . My survey of frozen custard recipes indicates a ratio of eggs to dairy of about 5 egg yolks to three cups ( 700 mL ) dairy , or 6 whole eggs to 4 cups ( 1 L ) of dairy . To adapt any custard recipe for freezing , then : Adjust the ratio of egg yolks to dairy to no more than about 5 yolks per 3 cups dairy . You may also want to adjust the total yield to be based on no more than 3 cups dairy depending on the capacity of your ice cream maker . Many home ice cream makers have a 1 quart ( close to 1 L ) capacity , but you need to leave room for the air which will be incorporated as the mix is churned . I recommend not using whole eggs for frozen custards , as the yolks facilitate a better texture , and create the rich eggy custard flavor . Frozen desserts are served colder than custards normally are , so the flavors will be more muted . You may need to compensate by increasing the ratio of flavoring ingredients . This will be hard to judge until you have made the frozen custard/ice cream at least once . Cook the custard until it thickens on the stove top , per the normal custard method . Chill it rapidly for safety , and then hold it for at least 4 hours ( overnight is even better ) . While I can not explain the science , empirically , allowing the mix to mature lets the flavors meld and produces a better frozen dessert . Churn it into a frozen dessert according to the instructions of your particular ice cream maker . Note that you can even convert a custard recipe into a Philadelphia style ice cream by eliminating the eggs completely , and simply creating a dairy/sugar/flavoring mix . These still benefit from overnight maturation before churning .
If you have raw milk and let it sit , the cream will indeed rise to the top . To separate , you can just wait and skim off the cream as you did . However , if you store the raw milk in the refrigerator , it will take longer for the cream to rise . Perhaps that is why you are having difficulties . Alternatively , you can use a spigot jar to drain the " skimmed " milk from the raw milk , leaving the cream behind . I think you end up with about 1/10th of your raw milk that is cream .
I 'd look towards a dutch oven and cake-like items : upside-down cakes cobblers / crisps / grunts / bettys / slumps / etc. . In all of these , the fruit on the bottom helps to protect from the bottom of the cake-like-item cooking too quickly . You can either cook directly in the dutch oven , or drop another pan inside the dutch oven to speed on cleaning if you 're going to be cooking a few of 'em . You 'll also want to look for dutch ovens that are made for baking -- they have a lip on the lid , so you can put coals on top and pull the lid without the ash falling into what you 're cooking .
Coconut oil has a low smoke point ( 177-204C depending on processing ) . Ghee has a smoke point of 252C . The effect of this is that it will be quite hard to stop the oil burning . But that 's not to say it would be impossible - softening onions and garlic in butter or olive oil is common , and they have lower smoke points still . But the texture from frying at a lower temperature will be quite different . It may also affect the flavour of your spices . In addition , the coconut oil will change the character of your curry significantly . That may not be a bad thing . ( all figures from <URL> )
In all cheese making and especially with young cheeses like cream cheese , fat adds a lot to the flavor and texture . You can skim off extra fat but your cheese will be thinner and less richly flavored . Shaking the cream in wo n't help if you are using a fermented method ( as opposed to using boiling and acid to curdle the milk ) because it will separate out again during the fermentation . Your thickened , fermented milk will be richer on top where the cream rose . It will mix back in when you drain the cheese and form it .
In NZ normal pure cream is close enough to " double cream " in performance , it 's around 35 % to 40 % fat . By general global definition it should be called " heavy cream " NZ cream is pure skimmed cream from fresh milk , and does not need thickening or other processing to produce excellent results as a whipped product , or for a thick cream additive in sauces or fillings Cream can get a little seasonal just after calving time ( Aug ) , but in general it 's just perfect The export variety is often labelled " Culinary Cream " and is 38 % fat or higher . This is what many people around the world would consider NZ cream ( other than NZ butter or AMF ) If you want closer to 50 % fat cream , ask your local farmers for some raw milk and skim out the lumps of fat from that . Let the milk settle overnight and skim the cream from that . Then gently heat the fat lumps to melt and carefully mix into the skimmed cream . Not for the faint of heart ! NZ " Thickened cream " or " Mascarpone cream " is standard pure cream with a thickener like E1442 added , you can <URL>
<URL> As Alton describes . As you beat the cream bubbles of air get worked into the mixture . The beating makes the bubbles smaller and smaller until the fat globules touch and the mixture becomes stable . As you mentioned - if you whip it a little more then the fat will coalesce and squeeze out all the water and air and you have butter . Time is a factor in this process ( when done mechanically ) in that it is required for homogeneously sized and distributed bubbles . The fats have to stay plastic . The fact that it can be done very quickly is easily seen with whipped cream chargers . The gas is pressurized into the cream - upon release expands into the tiny bubbles we need . <URL>
Yes , they can . Most people I know who make them for the first time just use too much filling . Traditional leaf-wrapped dishes ( I know them under the Turkish word ) use a softened leaf ( use pickled ones , or blanch fresh leaves ) and a small amount of filling . Use one heaped tablespoon of filling on a 10 cm leaf , then wrap tightly . A demonstration with sauerkraut sarmi is available on YouTube : <URL> . Watch 2:10 to 2:30 . The end result does not fall apart , even after cutting into it . ( grape leaf on the left , sauerkraut on the right ) .
Whole wheat flour goes rancid . There is a lot of fat in wheat germ and when it oxidizes the flour becomes very bitter and has a very noticeable , unpleasant scent . First of all - if you use bleached white flour there is little to worry about . Bleached flour has had much of the wheat removed to give it a longer shelf life . At the expense of flavor and nutrition of course . Keeping whole wheat flour out of light , sealed from oxygen , and cold will keep it from going rancid . Any one of those will extend the life of the flour - putting it in the freezer sealed from air will keep it good indefinitely . In the cupboard I will start noticing off flavors in my fresh ground flour in a couple weeks . In the freezer I have gone as much as a year with no discernible degradation . You will notice if it has gone bad because it will smell and taste bad . This rancidity is n't dangerous so if the flour smells and tastes fine then it is .
According to this step-by-step <URL> , you can definitely make sweetened coconut from dried coconut . Things You 'll Need : 1/2 cup desiccated coconut 1 tbsp . powdered sugar 1 1/2 tsp . canola oil 2 tsp . water Instructions : Blend dried coconut and powdered sugar with a whisk in a medium-sized bowl until the mixture is uniform . Combine the canola oil and water in a small bowl , stirring until the ingredients are well blended . Pour the liquid ingredients over the sugared coconut . Stir them to thoroughly coat the coconut . Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes , or until the coconut absorbs all the liquid . Stir the mixture once or twice to turn it over . Use the moistened , sweetened coconut immediately for best results . Alternatively , place it in a plastic freezer bag for short-term storage in the refrigerator or long-term storage in the freezer . While sealing the bag , press out as much air as possible . Tips and Warnings : The vegetable oil moistens the coconut and helps the powdered sugar adhere better . If desired , increase the amount of water in the recipe to 4 tsp . and eliminate the oil . Likewise , substitute the canola oil for safflower or sunflower oil . Do n't use olive oil , however , as its saltier flavor will mask or diminish the sugar 's sweetness . The recipe calls for a small amount of coconut because it 's best to use homemade , sweetened coconut as you make it . You can easily double or triple the quantities of each ingredient to make larger batches . Sweetened , shredded coconut will stay fresh for about a month in an airtight container stored in a cool , dry place or the refrigerator . If the instructions do n't work out for you , I 'd suggest re-hydrating your coconut in a bowl of room temp water , draining the water out of the bowl , blotting the coconut until damp , and then adding the sugar .
Even though it is n't really milk ( in the dairy sense ) , coconut milk still naturally separates into a thick cream and thinner liquid like regular milk . As such , when working with coconut milk you should still follow the same procedures you would to make a milk-based cream sauce . The number one rule when making any creamy sauce is : DO N'T LET IT BOIL ! Boiling will guarantee that your creamy sauce ( including sauces made with coconut milk ) will break in some form or fashion . At most , you should cook these at a bare simmer . Other than that , there are some techniques you can use to keep your curry smooth . You could use an emulsifier like honey ( common in vinaigrettes , where it is used to make sure the oil and vinegar do n't separate ) , added toward the end of cooking . You could also use a thickening agent , like a cornstarch slurry or a quick roux . Curry paste is also a thickening agent . As a general rule of thumb , when making Thai-style curry I usually cook my vegetables in a little more oil than I think they need , then add the curry paste and sauté that until it has absorbed the oil ( along with any dry spices ) . It will act as a roux for the coconut milk and make sure there are no lumps in the final curry . Lastly , cooking the curry uncovered at a simmer , stirring occasionally , will thicken it up nicely and help all the ingredients stay together .
Yes , but not in shell ( they explode , often spectacularly ) . See <URL> for some more information . In general , whites are better to freeze , although you can freeze yolks as well .
According to <URL> , cream cheese , opened should last about two weeks between 32 ' f and 40 ' f. For the cheese itself , unopened , they recommend to " Use within one week of the ' best when purchased by ' date " . Unfortunately , in this situation , you can not simply cut away the mold from the cheese since it is a mixed dish . When you factor in the fact that the cheese was not only unwrapped , but heated along with other components , and likely sat out for some time on the counter in addition to in the pan , with added protein ( the black beans especially ) , the math for how long cream cheese can last in your fridge shrinks and shrinks . Personally , I would follow the cooked meat guidelines to be on the safe side . This means that well-wrapped leftovers , quickly taken out of the danger zone range of temps ( <URL> ) , should last for 3-4 days after cooking .
Unfortunately you 're fighting bread-physics ... Bread with a high crust : crumb ratio become stale faster than those with low crust : crumb ratios like large boules or miches . Their large surface area allows moisture to evaporate quickly and the starches dry up and harden . This is why thin breads like baguettes are traditionally " daily " breads , i.e. made/purchased to be consumed that day . Soft pretzels have an even higher crust : crumb ratio than baguettes . Breads with extremely high crust : crumb ratios like hard pretzels , crackers , and hardtack are usually cooked to the point of being dry to prolong their storage capacity . These bread actually " stale " in the opposite direction by becoming more moist . There are a couple of things you could try that might help a little . It might take a lot of experimenting to get something that helps , and you will likely still need to reheat the pretzels just prior to serving them to have the soft texture you 're looking for . Without re-baking or light toasting there really is n't a way to bring back the original crust texture . Use pre-ferments to increase the concentration of a-amylase in your pretzels . Using a prolonged autolyse and/or sourdough starter can increase the amount of a-amylase in your bread which has been <URL> to slow staling . Incorporate conditioning ingredients like fat , sugar , malt , or honey into your dough . All of these slow staling . Try baking the pretzels at a lower temperature . The article linked above also mentioned that higher temperature baking leads to faster staling . For storage , your best option is probably to allow them to cool completely ( 15-30 minutes ) then place them in a sealed container at room temperature . Placing them in a sealed container before they are cool fills the container with humidity , which then coalesces and makes the crust soggy .
The best seems to be a 1:1 ratio of normal wheat-based flour and rice flour - <URL> . First the wheat flour sticks to the dough and creates a nice smooth surface . Then the rice flour ( which does n't adsorb very quickly ) creates small ' rollers ' that keep the dough from dragging , like ball bearings . This is similar to semonlina or cornmeal for working with pizza . A key part of the technique to a banneton is to sprinkle and rub some flour mix on the surface of the dough first , then sprinkle some flour mix in the basket , then put it seem side up in the basket . No sticking . This same mix and similar technique works wonders for using a peel as well .

Is it possible to make guacamole without acid ?
At its simplest , guacamole is just mashed avocado . Avocado is not particularly acidic on its own , so add whatever non-acidic ingredients you like . Consider cilantro , sour cream or whatever low or non-acid flavorings suit you . See : <URL> for more on acid and avocados .
Authentic flour tortillas use lard . For an authentic taste , use that , or consider using shortening or butter since they are solid at room temperature like lard . You also might want to consider increasing the fat in your recipe . Fat will coat the proteins of your flour and keep the gluten network from forming so easily . I was also taught when making tortillas to let the dough rest for an hour after kneading and before rolling/pressing . This helps everything relax . After cooking each tortilla , put them in a pile with a clean towel over them . The tortillas will sweat liquid , helping them to soften up . You can also put them all in a heat-safe bag ( paper or microwave safe plastic ) for sweating . When storing your tortillas , make sure to store them in a bag and not in the open air . If your tortillas are too small , you should be able to roll out a larger piece of dough . Part of the texture issues might actually be from you rolling them too thin . If you are used to working with dough your ideas of thin might be different from the overstated ones found in recipes . Try rolling to various thicknesses .
I have also not tasted hoop cheese . All descriptions of it that I can find describe it as unsalted , pressed cottage cheese . While you can definitely press out extra liquid from acid set cheeses , the proteins are not as firmly set and the texture is going to be very different . I think you will find that using rennet is not much more difficult and opens a wide variety of cheese experiments . Junket also provides quite a few recipes and I have had success with many of them : <URL> This recipe for cottage cheese uses the bacteria in ( fresh ) buttermilk to acidify the milk . Then with the addition of rennet a curd forms that is much firmer than what you get with acid alone . Making their cottage cheese recipe and pressing it into a hoop should be easy enough for you . I use the end cap of 6 " PVC pipe with holes drilled in it as my mold and bungee cords for the press . For an excellent page on home cheese production in general check out this page : <URL>
Shellfish is usually somewhat sweet in flavour . Acidity is the natural balance to sweetness .
Yes , you can cook them in about 1 " of oil in a steep sided frying pan or wok . Just turn them reasonably frequently to ensure even cooking . If you 're dubious about using a lot of hot oil , you can use less by making your bhajis a flat , patty shape and shallow frying .
Doing both is possible , but there is no point . For both , you need a <URL> , and this is a good contender for a gadget not worth its shelf space in a home kitchen . For a good chocolate , you have to mix the melted combination of base chocolate and additional ingredients for hours ( Wikipedia says 6 for low quality , up to 78 for best quality ) , and this is what the conche does for you . For a nice structure and shine , you also want to temper the chocolate afterwards and cool it under appropriate conditions . Chocolate is made by pressing roasted cocoa beans to cocoa liquor ( consists of cocoa butter and cocoa solids ) . The dry remainder of the beans is then ground to cocoa powder ( and sometimes also deacidified in a <URL> ) . The cocoa butter can be separated from the liquor . The pure liquor can be tempered and sold as high-end baking chocolate , also called " unsweetened chocolate " in the US ( low-end blocks of " baking chocolate " are mostly cocoa powder mixed with hydrogenated vegetable fat ) . To create bars of chocolate , chocolate creators like Lindt put cocoa liquor together with sugar in a conche to create different grades of dark chocolate ( US name : semi-sweetened chocolate ) , or also add milk or milk solids to create milk chocolate . Lower grade semisweet chocolate has cocoa powder added , so a 72 % chocolate will always have 72 % cocoa bean products and 28 % sugar , but depending on the brand , the ratio of cocoa solids and cocoa butter will vary , which will have effect on its behavior in confectionery ( a higher ratio of cocoa butter will produce a smoother chocolate with more shine ) . If you insist on changing the darkness of a chocolate you have and achieve reasonable quality , you have to throw together the needed ingredients , conche them , and temper them . For example , you could start with 100 g 60 % semi-sweet dryish chocolate , add 80 g cocoa butter and 20 g cocoa powder , and you will end up with 200 g of smooth 80 % semi-sweet chocolate , if you do it right . Given the prices for high quality raw materials , energy requirements and space taken up by a conche , and the availability of different grades of chocolate , I do n't see any reason to go through all of this instead of directly buying good quality 80 % chocolate . This all assumes that the final product you want is pure chocolate . If you are making , say , a chocolate flavored custard , where you mix ganache into custard , and you have a chocolate bar darker than what the recipe specifies , you can get a perfectly good solution by first dissolving sugar in the warm cream and making the ganache with it , and then adding it to the custard . Other recipes which work with chocolate mixes ( e.g. cake layer batters ) function in a similar way - add your ingredient ( cocoa powder if your chocolate is too light , sugar if it is too dark ) to a wet ingredient which will dissolve it , and then mix the melted chocolate in as usual .
Evidently , there are some recipes for frozen confections based on oat milk . For example , <URL> provides " 5 vegan ice creams " , most of which are based on oat milk . They read more like sorbet recipes , due to the lack of fat in the mix . If you were to try to create your own oat milk based frozen dessert recipes , I would suggest modifying a base sorbet recipe , as they are not as dependent on fat as ice cream recipes . The additional starches in oat milk compared to water should add slightly more body and mouth feel , and make the product more opaque than a traditional sorbet . If you are not opposed to egg whites , you might also consider using sherbert recipes as your base . Note : the lactose in dairy products does not have a huge effect on the chemistry of ice cream ( it is a small part of the total sugar in the mix ) , although it could potentially help inhibit sugar crystal formation somewhat ( this is not usually an issue in frozen desserts ) . If you want to replace its effect , a small amount of honey , maple syrup , or even corn syrup would be very similar .
The reason popcorn can be popped is that they have a water-impermeable hull , which contains the pressure of the steam created inside the kernel as it is heated , until it passes a critical point . When that happens , the steam explodes out , breaking the hull , and creating the popcorn . Some of the other puffed products are more complex , as the link you have already found shows . Potatoes do not have a water impermeable skin , and so can not be puffed in the same manner as popcorn . There is a dish -- sometimes called puffed potatoes -- where the steam inside fried potato pieces is used to puff them up , but it will not be similar in texture to puffed grain . See <URL> , for example . They will be more akin to fluffy french fries ( or chips , as they say in Britain ) . There is another dish called puffed potatoes , which are essentially a choux paste with potatoes that are baked or deep fried . They are a great dish , but are a different type of thing entirely . See <URL> from the great Jacques Pepin .
<URL> for limoncello/lemoncello out there that use vodka . I would reference one specifically calling for vodka rather than adapting one that relies on either 150 or 190 proof Everclear . The <URL> ( does not necessarily apply to leeching of sugars , just oils ) , and a corresponding need to be sugared down more . As vodka is easier to just sip and lower in alcohol , it would likely require less simple syrup , and either more lemons , agitation , longer steeping or a combination thereof .
Fondant must be kneaded like dough , until it 's soft and smooth , before you roll it out . If you roll it out straight from the pack it will be too cold and stiff .
According to ( US ) <URL> : ( c ) In accordance with § 184.1 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the ingredient is used in food with no limitations other than current good manufacturing practice . ( d ) Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived . Basically , you can eat the stuff by the spoon-full if you can stand the sour . If you 're adding a lot compared to how much you think you should have to add , you might consider Phosphoric acid instead . You get a little <URL> with that , and it too , within limits , is generally regarded as safe ( GRAS ) .
In the star trek world you have plenty of beings with body temperatures higher or lower than humans , so if you had a being with a body temp of 79C then ethanol would work out perfectly ! However , with humans the liquid which would fit the bill of vaporizing just below body temperature would be Pentane , which not only smells bad but is also toxic . The science behind it is wrong anyway , you 'd want a liquid with a much lower vaporization point than body temperature so it would boil off quickly . If you pick a liquid that boils just below body temperature it would take some time to vaporize and you would n't have the same effect . All is not completely lost , you can still have some cool effects with liquids that are safe for consumption . What you have to remember is that the closer a liquid gets to its boiling point the more it evaporates , and any volatiles in it will tend to remained suspended in the vapor and be detectable by the nose . This is the effect you get when you sniff brandy or cognac that has been brought up to body temperature . You can savor it by holding it on the tongue for a few seconds and letting the vapors fill your nasal cavity . So all you need is some strong ( at least 80 proof ) and flavored ( or more accurately scented ) alcohol , and the right glasses . Brandy snifters would work best as they are designed to capture the vapors so they can be inhaled . You could then heat the liquid to just above human body temperature and then serve . Keep the quantities served down unless you want some very drunk guests !
You could do it , and it would certianly cause the meat to be cooked . However , I suspect it would lead to a less-than-tasty result . There are two potential issues here that I can see : If you 're steaming , the temperature maxes out at 100 degrees Centigrade . This leads to longer cooking time , and a " washed " look . Think of how the chicken meat looks in chicken soup . You 'll be losing the Maillard reaction , which is what gives that lovely outside texture to anything fried . This is because of the relatively low temperature of steaming , and the lack of liquid ( oil ) to react with .
I would say you could use it once , and probably just to make refrigerator-type , quick pickles . The problem is that you have no way to determine acidity or salt levels once you remove the previously pickled items . Of course it should look clean and clear . If you were previously doing a lactic acid fermented pickle , some of the liquid could be used to jump start your next ferment .
Its been a while but I found this thread as I was wondering the same thing ... Not much info on raw okara but I just googled raw soybeans ... " For human consumption , soybeans must be cooked with " wet " heat to destroy the trypsin inhibitors ( serine protease inhibitors ) . Raw soybeans , including the immature green form , are toxic to humans , swine , chickens , and in fact , all monogastric animals . " From wikipedia <URL>
Yes you can mature cheeses , most hard cheeses can be matured either in the refridgerator or elsewhere . Remove from the plastic packaging , the cheese will need to breathe , but not dry out - a cardboard box , paper towels , parchment paper would work . Just be careful on the amount of moisture &amp; bacteria/mold growth . You 'll find a lot more helpful information if you search on " maturing cheeses " or " maturing cheeses at home " .
You have several options for the crust . It is possible to purchase mixes that will get you started . There are also several recipes available . A good resource for all your gluten-free baking is <URL> , and you can find a recipe there . Another great option is former pastry chef <URL> at Tartlette . <URL> has compiled a list of gluten-free baking recipes which may also provide you good jumping off points . You can make a dairy free crust by replacing butter with lard or vegetable shortening . Margarine is likely not be dairy free . Lard will provide a texture and taste that is better than an all shortening crust , but shortening is easier to find in stores . If the dairy free requirement is a requirement to avoid casein , you will have to do some experimentation on your own to find an appropriate egg replacement , as gluten free crusts appear to require eggs to hold together . Options for egg replacers can be found <URL> and <URL> . Once you have assembled a crust recipe from these tips , if you have questions about it or are struggling you can ask a follow-on question here about how to improve the crust and the community can provide specific help on a provided recipe . In general it appears that the gluten free crusts available are actually similar to work with versus a regular pie crust , something that is not always the case in gluten free baking . As usual you want to do everything cold and refrigerate your dough over night . Pie dough of all forms is easiest to roll when you place it between two floured sheets of parchment paper . Remove the top piece of parchment paper , flip the bottom piece with crust on it ( hold it all together , because your crust should n't be sticking ) into the pie plate or onto your pie , and remove the top piece . Apple pie is sometimes thickened with flour , and obviously you do not want to do this when cooking gluten-free . The absolute best pie thickener is actually not flour , so you are set here . In taste tests the editors of Cooks Illustrated determined that instant tapioca , a gluten-free product , is the best pie thickener . Make sure , however , not to use more than 2 tablespoons or your pie may be gummy . Since apple slices contain pectin , you should n't need more than 2 tablespoons for your pie to set up . Sugar , apples , and the usual apple pie spices ( if you choose to spice your pie - with good apples you can actually make an amazing pie with simply sugar , instant tapioca , and apples ) should all be gluten free and dairy free , with the usual caveat that in gluten-free cooking and baking you want to make sure that there has been no gluten added to anything by carefully reading labels .
Egg replacements are an option depending on where you live and what products are available , but from what I hear they do n't produce a similar result to eggs . Most egg-free french toast recipes use applesauce mixed with milk or yogurt and a bit of sugar for dipping , and from what I 've heard they work well .
No , it is n't possible to over soak wood chips , chunks , planks , or any other size that you want to throw on the grill ( within reason , I would n't soak them for weeks because the water would get scummy ) . In fact , the directions given often grossly underestimate optimal soaking time . I assume this is because the manufacturer does n't want to scare people off by saying " soak for 12-24 hours before use . " Wood smokes better when it 's wet . If it 's dry , it catches on fire and produces less smoke for a shorter period of time . What you really want is for the wood to be thoroughly wet so that it smolders rather than flames and produces lots of smoke for a long time . As you would expect , the larger the piece of wood , the longer it will smoke and the longer you need to soak it . My general soak times are as follows : Small Chips - These are very small , coin sized . Generally get totally saturated in 2-3 hours . Large Chips - Between Small Chips and Chunks . Soak for 12 - 24 hours . Chunks - These tend to be about 1/2 to a whole fist sized . These want to soak for at least 24 hours . Planks - For plank smoking . Soak for 8 - 12 hours . You can always soak for less time , you just wo n't get quite as much smoke production . Judge the need based on what you 're cooking . If you want a little smoke on a steak that you 're only cooking for 5-8 mins , then you do n't need to worry about it . If you 're trying to smoke salmon , it matters more . If you want to smoke a butt for 12 hours , it matters a lot .
Short answer : cream is far from ideal as a frying medium . In the US at least , heavy cream is about 35 % milkfat . Recently , I have learned the UK has a product called double cream which is closer to 50 % milkfat . So what is the rest of the cream , if it is only 50 % milkfat at the high end ? It is water , with dissolved milk solids and minerals . Even butter is only about 80 % milkfat -- the rest is an emulsion of water and milk solids in the main milkfat phase . When butter is made , one by product is buttermilk ( the old fashioned kind , as opposed to the modern cultured milk product ) which is the remainder of the liquid components in the cream after the butter precipitates . The essence of making ghee is separating the milkfat from the other components . What does all of this mean ? Cream would be far from an ideal medium for frying , as the water would have to evaporate before the temperature could rise to frying levels . It may be possible in some way by reducing the cream until only essentially the fat is left , and then frying in that , but it does n't seem very practical . I am not sure how you would do it without introducing many off flavors from scorching or burning the milk solids . I could not find any references to such a thing when googling , although the results for fried ice cream did tend to predominate . If you want to fry in cream -- use ghee . It is highly concentrated milkfat .

Where do I buy food additives ( not in bulk ) ?
Hey guys , since the question was posted they opened up <URL> , which specifically caters to this need . They supply chemicals for molecular gastronomy in consumer-sized portions . For $ 10 or less apiece , you can order small amounts of emulsifiers , gelling agents , foaming agents , etc. . They also have spherification kits , the Texturas products , and Molecule-R 's lineup .
I 'm going to take a wild guess at what 's happening , based on what I know of thermodynamics , ( but I could be wrong about the whole thing ) When a cakes and bread bakes , it bakes from the outside ... as it forms a crust , it can no longer rise . ( for yeast breads , this is why we slash the top , so it can get a little extra rise out of it ) With a cake , as the sides set , it 'll continue to rise in the middle , creating a domed top . With a metal tube pan , the heat from the outside of the pan conducts to the middle of the pan , so the middle will set shortly after the outside . ... With the silicone pan , you 've actually got an insulator ... the heat 's not going to conduct to the inside , so it 's going to be able to rise longer than around the inside -- basically , the domed cake , but you 've got something for it to stick to , so it does n't fall back down as it sets . As I do n't think the issue is distribution of the batter , I 'd recommend trying other techniques to reduce the domedness of the cake -- cook it at a lower temperature ( try 25F / 15C lower ) for a longer time . You ca n't remove the problem entirely , but you might be able to reduce it . I 'd also look at the instructions that might 've come with the pan -- it 's possible that they have reommendations on how to deal with the problem . ( and it 's possible that this might not be as significant a problem in convection ovens , but replacing your whole oven for a set of pans is kinda silly )
The chemical responsible for " the burn " is Capsaicin . The main reason you and everyone else has trouble with the lingering burning sensation is that it 's not water soluble ( which means it does n't dissolve in water ) . So , flooding your mouth with water-based liquids does n't loosen up those Capsaicin molecules on your tongue and throat . Like @Iuls says , the most common and effective relief comes from full-fat milk or cream . That 's because , while Capsaicin is n't able to be dissolved by water , it is fat soluble . It 's also why more than a few people have been upset that the " milk solution " did n't work , when they tried it with skim milk . If you 're looking for a more " fun " solution , it 's worth noting that Capsaicin is also alcohol soluble , which might explain all of that tequila and beer they sell at Mexican restaurants .
This really depends on the locale . For example in Seattle we have a couple of Washington State grain farms and mills that do sell their product at farmer 's markets . If you have trouble tracking down a miller directly , you might do well to ask at your local natural foods co-op if they can source this or direct you to people who can help . Another place to ask would be at your best local artisanal bakeries , as they may well be using local flours .
They go into soup . Or pot pies . Or any of the other myriad industrially produced canned or frozen foods which require chicken stock or chicken flavoring and sometimes canned chicken meat . The millions of cans of Campbell 's have to come from somewhere :-) For smaller home chicken farmers , they probably end up in the stock pot . If you know people who keep backyard flocks , they may be willing to sell you their culls for a very reasonable price .
Strangely enough , I do live near Campinas ( where UNICAMP belongs ) , where water once " was " <URL> ! ( non-english site ) , what a coincidence ! I 'm noticing the local water smell is terrible in chlorine , I wonder they 're adding water in milk or cows are drinking thw water , very strange ... I will buy milk from differente towns and test this again .
It 's not just American supermarkets that rarely carry mutton , this situation is similar across the Anglosphere , and I suspect most Western countries too ( or at least those without a strong mutton culture ) . The reason is largely economic . Mutton is expensive and not as tasty as lamb . First , the immediate reason is that nobody really eats mutton anymore . Yes , there are certain locales , cultures and movements still eating mutton or are trying to bring it back , but today , on aggregate , the demand for mutton is near zero . According to the <URL> : The U.S. market for lamb and mutton has weakened throughout the decades . Since the 1960s , per capita consumption has dropped from nearly 5 pounds to just about 1 pound . This drop is due in part to declining acceptance of lamb from a growing segment of the population , as well as competition from other meats , such as poultry , pork , and beef . Most meat is sold as lamb and comes from animals under 14 months old . Here 's a per-capita consumption graph : <URL> If nobody buys mutton , supermarkets do n't sell them . The supply chain for meats is pretty complex ; it 's not something that a store manager can just decide one day to order a batch and shelve to see if it sells . Meat needs to be slaughtered and deboned in an abattoir , butchered either in store butcheries or at centres ( unless you fancy buying an entire , 50kg cut ) , and displayed in refrigerated sections . If there 's enough local demand for mutton then maybe individual supermarkets can carry them , just as meats like rabbit , duck or kangaroo is sometimes sold at a few supermarkets . But why do n't people eat mutton ? People just do n't like it . It is an <URL> . Mutton comes from older animals and is often less expensive but less desirable to consumers . ( USDA ) . As can be seen , the average income elasticities across the studies are 0.77 for beef , 0.24 for lamb , -0.65 for mutton , 0.47 for chicken and 0.48 for pork . ( Negative income inelasticity = inferior good ) That is , as incomes grow , as they have over this timeframe , people want to buy less of it . Lamb is a superior substitute for mutton . Anecdotally , compared to lamb , mutton is gamier , tougher , and harder to cook . Economically , lamb and mutton have high cross-price elasticity - if one 's price grows , demand shifts to the other , indicating that they are substitutes . And the real killer is ... Mutton prices have grown faster than lamb . <URL> Mutton is still cheaper than lamb , but in relative terms it has become more economic to raise and sell lamb . There are multiple market forces at play : the cost of raising the sheep past lamb age , the efficiency of raising lambs ( i.e. increased lamb weight ) , the growth of dairy leading to higher beef supply , the relative decline in wool reducing mutton supply and so on . You 'll have to ask a farmer . <URL> Update : did n't notice that the graph was price indices and not actual prices
In the world of high-end chocolate , Valrhona is n't even the most expensive - in fact , it 's practically entry level . Amedei Signature retails at a whopping $ 40/lb in " bulk " ( 1 kg ) quantities . I do n't think I 've ever seen Valhrona in bulk quantities and/or at a significantly discounted price . On the other hand , there are similar-quality brands that are way more affordably-priced . On <URL> you can buy 22 lbs of Callebaut callets for just over $ 6 per pound . Or you can get one of Felchlin 's Grand Cru chocolates for about $ 10 per pound . You can even buy Guittard there for what appears to be $ 6.60 / lb . But you 'll notice that they even though they also carry Valrhona , they do n't have it in bulk . I also see <URL> selling the Guittard wafers for , apparently , $ 3.10 / lb if you buy the 25 lb bag . <URL> sells the Felchlin Maracaibo chocolate ( not Grand Cru ) for a measly $ 7.80 / lb . They 've got a variety of other well-known brands as well , although their selection is limited , they do n't have a lot of the crazy high-end stuff . Chocovic chocolate also sells at around the $ 10 range at most stores . If you can find it , they distribute 10 kg and 25 kg bags ( that 's 22 lbs and 55 lbs ) . I 'm not sure where , but if you go to their official site they explicitly mention that they make that size . You should consider that the exorbitant prices may not be a result of where you 're buying from , but of what you 're buying . Valrhona is just expensive . You may say that is because it 's better than all the others , and you may be right ( although some would disagree - it 's more than a little subjective ) - but that is the price you pay for " premium " products . They can get away with charging $ 13 - $ 15/lb , so they do . Do yourself a favour - try some of the lesser-known brands . A lot of them really do make fantastic chocolate , they 're just not as famous as Valrhona .
There are a couple tricks I 've learned from Cook 's Illustrated about making oven fries : Soak your cut potatoes in warm water to rinse off excess surface starch . Drain them and dry them very well ( I use a salad spinner and paper towels ) . Use a heavy duty sheet pan on the bottom rack of a hot oven to focus the heat on crisping the bottoms of the potatoes . Oil your sheet pan well , and sprinkle salt on it . This will act kind of like ball bearings under the potatoes to prevent them from sticking too hard . For the first 5-10 minutes , tightly wrap the sheet pan ( with the potatoes ) with aluminum foil . This will essentially steam the potatoes and help get a really nice creamy interior . After that , remove the foil and flip the potatoes halfway through . Make sure you use a thin metal spatula when you flip them . These techniques work well for potatoes in general , and really do turn out some fantastic spuds .
I come from a culture where rice is our staple and I have a rice cooker . Here are some of the advantages from my perspective : Rice is perfect everytime -- not stuck to the bottom , not watery , not mushy and stuck together , etc. . If you make rice in a pot , and the heat is too high , it will boil and spill over creating a mess . You can switch the rice cooker on and go do other things , whereas it is dangerous to walk away from a stove . The rice cooker can be used for other things such as cooking lentils and steaming vegetables . Rice cookers are cheap .
Here 's a neat list of plastics &amp; whether they 're supposed to be microwave-safe or not : <URL>
By quick-prepare ravioli , you mean without sauce , right ? It 's fine to ( and you should ) cover the pot to bring the water to a boil . Incidentally , it 's best to start with cold water from the tap , hot tap water will be more contaminated . Once the water is boiling , you add the salt , then the pasta . Now , adding the pasta will bring down the temperature of the water , so you can briefly put the lid back on to more quickly bring the water back up to the boil . Once the water is boiling again , you should keep it uncovered because pasta water is very prone to foaming up and boiling over . It 's a royal pain when that happens , so it 's generally recommended to not cover pasta while it is boiling . If your pot is big enough and you watch carefully , you can save some energy by cooking with the lid on , just be careful because boil-overs happen quickly . Obviously , it 's good to have a stockpot with a glass lid for that . EDIT : Now that I 've covered the conventional wisdom , I 'd also encourage you to read this : <URL> , especially the Serious Eats link . I admit , I have n't done it ( set in my ways , I suppose ) , but considering your set-up , you might find the method works better for you .
Any halfway competent chef should indeed be tasting . The only way to know whether you 're putting up good food is to check it yourself - and you 'd better be consistent if you want to continue getting paid for it . That 's not to say that all chefs do , nor that there 's any one standard for how frequently to taste or what method should be used . It 's pretty obvious that using your hands to taste or double-dipping is frowned on ... but shortcuts do happen when it 's the middle of the rush and you have 30 things to be doing at once . The best practice I 've personally seen in a commercial kitchen was to have a large set of spoons at each station , kept with the " business end " submerged in hot water with a mild sanitizer solution . Each chef also carried a few clean towels which they changed out copiously throughout the evening ( these have a million uses , from wiping hands dry to cleaning plate rims to handling hot pan handles ) . When tasting , we 'd grab a spoon , tap off excess water , wipe with a clean towel if necessary , take a small taste , and discard . This got to be as much of a habit as washing your hands after handling raw meat or wiping down your cutting board . The used spoons would be collected and washed regularly along with used pans and so on , then returned to the line . With a system like this there 's minimal risk for contamination and relatively little waste , except for frequent washing . At home , you can play things a bit looser , unless you like washing all of your spoons every night . Double-dipping is n't a big concern unless you 're ill , in which case you should n't really be cooking for people . You 're probably introducing your friends and family to just as much contamination in the form of dust and such simply by having them in your home . EDIT : I agree with Jefromi 's point in comments , so I want to emphasize this further . Safety aside , I strongly believe that tasting is necessary to make you a better cook . It teaches you how to make corrections on the fly and balance flavors , rather than simply following a recipe . As a matter of fact , even if you 're following a recipe , you will need to account for variation in things like produce . Fruits vary in their flavor depending on how ripe they are , where they were grown , whether it was a good season ... The vegetables that I get at my local market may be a slightly different variety from yours ... Meats vary widely depending on how the animal is fed and raised , even if you 're using the same cuts . Even when using packaged ingredients , you ca n't guarantee complete consistency unless you use the exact brand as written in a recipe . ( And I dare say that if your recipes uses only packaged ingredients , you can do much better . ) Recipes can not account for this sort of variation in anything but the broadest strokes . It 's up to you to balance all of this , plus the preferences of yourself and your guests . If you 're only tasting when you 've finished cooking , it 's probably too late to correct any problems . Like any skill , cooking ability is improved by practice and feedback . Tasting as you go provides you with immediate feedback on how the dish tastes and what it needs , rather than just at the very end when you sit down to eat . Learning how flavors interact , how much seasoning is enough , and so on are fundamentals . They 're what help you get creative , go beyond cooking someone else 's dishes , and start coming up with your own . So : yes , you should taste , and you should taste often . There are many ways to deal with safety concerns , but there is no other way to get better at fixing your mistakes before they hit the table .
Interesting question and I 'll try to give an answer to the questions that you state explicitly . Blood is edible and is eaten in loads of countries . Black sausage comes to mind . However , blood tends to coagulate rather fast and meat needs a fair amount of time to mature . I 'm guessing that leaving blood in the meat will give the meat dark spots that are not appealing , therefore the prohibition . Milk and meat are eaten together at least in Spain . The only reason I can imagine for not mixing them is historical . Originally the Jewish tribes lived in a desert . A hot climate and food ... do n't go well together . Maybe milk turned sour fast , or it turned into yoghurt , and maybe that was feared ... All this is just guessing , so anybody that finds a valid reference is welcome to post here .
Since you specified not wanting any equipment other than a campfire and a stick , the best I can do is add one more piece of equipment you should be able to find anywhere ( i.e. , not have to carry with you ) : a rock . If you put a flat-topped rock just to the edge of your campfire , you should be able to place a graham cracker and slab of chocolate on top of it . While you are toasting your marshmallow on the stick , the chocolate should start to melt . This technique wo n't produce totally melted chocolate ( unless you have a very large , very hot fire ) , but the chocolate should get a little melty without being so runny that none of it makes it into your mouth . This only works if you have thin Hershey bars or other chocolate in relatively thin pieces . Thick slabs wo n't soften all the way through with this type of indirect heat . And for those people concerned about dirt , bring some aluminum foil to act as a buffer between the rock/dirty stuff and your s ' more . Extraneous but related note : Your question got me thinking about ways to achieve melted chocolate with microwave s'mores ( a last resort if I 'm stuck inside with an electric oven or no oven at all ) , and I have an idea I 'll test out tonight . When I microwave s'mores , I usually microwave the bottom graham cracker , chocolate and marshmallow together , then top with the other graham cracker once the marshmallow gets gooey . The chocolate does n't really get melted that way , though , because marshmallows take almost no time at all to melt . I 'm wondering if pushing the chocolate inside the marshmallow before I stick it in the microwave might help the chocolate melt more . I will update once I 've had a chance to try this . Edit : I did n't really notice any difference between microwaving the chocolate inside the marshmallow v. underneath the marshmallow .
This probably refers to whole eggs mostly ... A microwave can boil water very rapidly , and a tight but fragile container like a whole egg will violently rupture if such rapid boiling happens inside it , because the overpressure inside it is already significant when the shell finally breaks . Here is a <URL> showing an experiment with ca. 180 eggs in a microwave oven , which after a minute or two rupture simultaneously and with enough force to blow the oven open , with debris being propelled several meters .
Your microwave is n't exactly cooking your food from the inside out . Instead , what is happening is that some parts of your food that happen to be on the interior are being heated faster than those parts of the exterior that you observe . This sort of uneven heating is intrinsic with how microwaves work . Microwave ovens cook unevenly because a pattern of standing waves forms inside the oven chamber , and the pattern creates an array of hotspots throughout the oven 's volume . An operating frequency of 2.45 GHz will produce a wavelength of around 12.25 cm , and the regions of maximum intensity ( hotspots ) will be at half-wave points , or every 6.125 cm , but in a complex 3D pattern From <URL> So , in your microwave the waves happen to be arranged just so the inside of your casserole heats up faster than the outside . In microwave ovens that do not have a rotating carousel , this effect is even more pronounced , although even using a carousel is not a panacea . Many microwave oven recipes often include instructions to rotate and/or stir the food intermittently as a means of distributing the heat more evenly for the same reasons ; changing the position of the food within the oven has the effect of shifting the hotspots around in the food as it cooks . So , my suggestion is to try changing the position of the food in the oven over time , particularly if it 's being heated over several minutes , as that should help it heat more evenly . If you can , it is also a good idea to stir the food intermittently as well . Personally , after the microwave finishes the allotted time , I also will stir and then wait a few minutes before serving to let the hot spots naturally dissipate a bit via <URL> .
There 's a serious dearth of information about the differences between the Henckels product lines , but from what I can tell : The biggest difference is the handle design , which impacts the balance . You 'll want to hold the knives to find which is right for you . Stamped blades are used in the following lines : <URL> , Twin Gourmet , International Everedge , International Everedge Plus , International Fine Edge Pro , International Fine Edge Synergy , International Eversharp . Source : <URL> . Forged blades are used for the following lines : Twin Profection , Twin Four Star and Four Star II , Twin Cuisine , Twin Professional S , Twin Select , International Classic , International Forged Premio , and International Forged Synergy . Sources : <URL> , <URL> , <URL> Microserrated blades are used in the following product lines : Eversharp Pro , Everedge , Everedge Plus ( Source : Henckels International website ) All but the Twin Cermax line are X50CrMoV15 steel , hardened to 54-56 HRC ( some reports say up to 57 Rockwell C ) . This means they 're slightly softer than Wusthof ( which now hardens many of their products to 58 HRC ) , but less brittle . Twin Cermax uses special , superhard ( 66 HRC ) MC66 steel , meaning they take a sharper edge and hold it MUCH longer than the other lines . This is probably a clone of the ZDP-189 supersteel . ( <URL> ) The microserrated blades aid in slicing , but hurt the ability to chop and mince . They WILL help retain a cutting edge longer , but also can not be sharpened normally . Edit : Personally , I 've not been impressed by Henckels knives . Wusthof knives strike me as better quality at a similar price , and Victorinox is almost as good but a lot cheaper . Why do I say this ? Well , Wusthof blades are n't as thick and unwieldy as Henckels , and they harden the steel to 58 Rockwell , so it takes a better edge . Victorinox is comparable hardness to Henckels , but about half the price , and the shapes of the blades just seem so perfect , with a deeper belly to slice thick items , and awesome grippy Fibrox handles . Edit 2 : 5 March 2016 - Henckels appears to have moved to a 57-58 HRC steel standard now for many of their blades , and switched to a narrower 15 degree bevel . This means they are capable of finer cuts , but the edges may be a tad more fragile . Twin Profection is now 60 HRC . This means that steel-on-steel , the knives should now be competitive with Wusthof . The Twin Signature and International Forged Classic still use the inferior 53-55 HRC steels . Victorinox has also raised the prices on their Fibrox-handled knives . Personal opinion , they 're still a much better value than Henckels , but Henckels may be more competitive with Wusthof now .
In November 2007 a recipe was published in Cooks Illustrated for a Foolproof Pie dough with vodka . That recipe was created by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt who was one of the chefs on America 's Test Kitchen and writer for Cooks Illustrated . He has an article about the recipe here <URL> . As far as I know this was not a well-known trick and Lopez-Alt came up with it originally .
Lemon juice and lemon zest have a different taste . Lemon juice has obviously more water , is tart ( adds fruitiness and freshness to the dish ) and the aroma is not as intense as in the zest . If you bake a cake or cookies it 's often more desirable to use lemon zest because it does n't mess up the water-solids-ratio and what you often want is a rather sweet cake/cookie than a tart one . In contrast often the cookie glaze should be somewhat tart - you can use both zest and juice . I have the impression that the zest has a bitter component . So you have to decide if you want to have a tart component in your dish and whether the dish tolerates additional liquid . Acid is not only important in taste but also in the further " food chemistry " . As Jay pointed out , acid can make milk curdle . Also , cooking with acid in aluminium <URL> ( and probably health-wise , too , but that 's another topic ) . Someone else asked a question in the opposite direction : <URL>

What are the differences between an induction stove and a regular electric stove ?
A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element . A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat , similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb . An induction stove does n't actually generate heat itself , but rather induces it the pot or pan . It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field . This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat , thus heating the food . Induction stoves are faster , safer , and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves . It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up . They are safer because they do n't actually generate heat themselves . After taking a pot off the " burner " ( glass surface ) it quickly begins to cool . With regards to differences in the cooking process , there 's not much . You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove . It does affect your choice of pans however . All aluminum pans will not work , nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones . If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine . The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface .
With flax seeds I like using 1T of seed ( ends up being 2.5 T of powder ) to 3T of water , and use it for thing that are suppose to be light like cake or something that needs a nutty flavor . But with chia seeds I use exactly 1T of powder to 3T of water ( ends up looking like egg whites ) and use it in brownies , cookies and so on . Also chia does n't add flavor like flax does . ** For me chia is definitely stronger . The first time I used a chia egg I thought it was like a flax ( 1T seed = 2.5 T powder ) but I was wrong , my baked good came out very dense in the middle and tasted raw . You can still use a chia but you have to be exact . Also a chia egg will become very thick and gloppy once it 's mixed with water whereas a flax just get gooey .
Dutch oven ( a proper cast iron one , mind you ) Put your dutch oven on the stove top with the lid on , and turn on the heat until it gets hot Place the thing ( s ) to be baked inside ( but not directly touching the sides or bottom ; a little rack or other standoff will be helpful ) Put the lid back on and turn the heat way down Wait . And this is a bit of a problem because it is hard to know the exact temperature , so baking is tricky . This is also how one bakes over a campfire , though there you use coals and can get a reasonably repeatable temperature . Works better with cobbler than cake ( I have seen cakes done this way , but more often I 've seen them messed up ) , but it should do garlic bread just fine . The pure mass of the iron serves to smooth out the uneven heating from the stove . This is also the reason a proper dutch oven has a lip on the lid : so you can put some coals on there to insure the lid stays properly hot too .
I agree with @jwenting , 5-7 minutes in boiling water is the way to go . Remember to always put the eggs in cold water , if you put them in hot water you risk cracking the shell , especially if eggs are cold . Also , to avoid premature cracking of the shell , that may leave some egg white leaking out , add a spoon of vinegar ( should work with lemon juice too ) to the water .
I very quickly found nutritional information for storebought ( Swanson ) <URL> and <URL> . As you 'd expect , neither one contains all that much protein . The stock does contain substantially more : 4g per cup compared to 1g - this should also be expected , since stock has some gelatin in it , and gelatin is mostly protein . Of course , it 's commercially made ; I imagine you 'd be hard-pressed to find good nutritional data for homemade stock and broth .
I would consider the professional equivalent of the electric carving knife to be the meat slicer , i.e. the rotating blade device most often seen behind the deli counter . At home , to break down a roast bird , take the meat off of a lamb-leg , etc. , a good manual knife is most likely the proper tool . If , on the other hand , I have a large ham ( cooked or cold ) , or some other chunk of boneless meat that I want to slice more-or-less uniformly , then I will break out my electric knife . For the home user , it is a fairly practical device , not taking up too much space , etc. . But its uniformity and speed can not compare to the slicer . As to a professional kitchen , you may or may not find one there . Certainly in deli-type restaurants you would have them . In a more traditional restaurant they are not as concerned with quick production of sliced meat , so any slicing is probably done by hand .
Use a carbon-steel wok ! The shape works very well to keep the unpopped kernels in the hot oil , while the popped kernels end up on the cooler sides . I usually use about 2 T of oil and 1/3 c of popcorn to make enough for two people . If you want to keep with the Chinese theme , Szechuan peppercorn-salt goes extremely well on popcorn ! To make it , grind Szechuan peppercorns and kosher salt in a spice grinder .
Pros : Higher smoking point . Regular butter 's smoking point is 325-375F while clarified butter is around 485F . But it can still smoke and burn ! However the higher smoking point means it 'll be much more applicable in terms of sauteing food without worrying about burning the butter . 100 % fat . Often times its hard to calculate the exact replacements in baking when you want to replace a fat with butter because regular butter is n't 100 % fat . Using regular butter , you would need to factor in how much extra water you are introducing into the recipe . Longer shelf life . Without the water and milk solids , the shelf life of the clarified butter will be much longer . Can even be stored without refrigeration . Cons : Less buttery flavor . The milk solids that you are removing makes up a lot of butter 's flavor . By removing this , you are removing flavor .
Chapathi or Roti is made from wheat flour usually in all of the Indian homes . Chapathi is usually bigger in size than Phulka . both sides are cooked on pan . Some people apply oil/ghee after completely cooking it but when it is not on the pan but while eating . Roti / chapati is usually not made to swell up , especially if it is rolled comparatively thick . Bubbles do appear in the roti / chapati when steam forms in some places . The word ' Roti ' is used commonly in north , central and east India , whereas ' Chapati ' is used more in west ( Mumbai ) , and south India . Only in south India Chapati is fried in a bit of oil ! Elsewhere , only a Paratha is fried with oil or ghee Paratha is something which can be stuffed paratha or non stuffed paratha . Stuffed parartha is like Aloo Paratha , Methi Paratha and it is cooked on a pan too but oil/ghee/butter is applied while cooking on a pan . Non stuffed paratha is you make a puree of spinach or fenugreek with different spices and add it while preparing the dough itself . And then it is cooked on pan . Paratha ( plain , folded or stuffed ) is made from an unleavened dough of wholewheat flour , and shallow fried with a little oil / ghee / butter . Parathas generally stay soft and moist even when cold . Yes , certainly sometimes meaning differs with context to people and region , though there may not be much difference in preparing it.Triangle Shape has nothing to do with the Taste or Texture , it deals more with Presentation . Oil indeed influences the flavor &amp; texture of dough . The " moistness " of the Parathas - the soft texture - is actually from oils and fats . Adding in extra fat , such as oil , butter , shortening , makes the Parathas seem extra moist and soft .
Emulsifier will make two or more element blend together , for example the egg in the mayonnaise recipe will act as an emulsifier . A thickener will simply make something thick , as you wrote , cornstarch is a thickener . Personally , I would use neither cornstarch or xanthan gum in a chill sauce ; seems to me that it is a shortcut instead of letting it cook down properly ( but I might be wrong ) .
If you like to cook using 3 or more elements at once , ensure you buy a sufficiently powered model . There 's nothing more frustrating than upping the power on one element and watching another one reduce at the same time . Touch controls look nice but they 're horrible from a usability standpoint . I always had problems with responsiveness with wet or greasy fingers . Cockroaches love induction . I do n't know if the frequency attracts them or it 's just the heat but they will come and eat out the wiring , even if you 've never spotted one in the house before . It 's a common problem as it 's hard to seal the electronics for thermal reasons . Board replacements are expensive . It 's one item I would consider an extended warranty on . As for any 2 " cooktop , larger pot/pan sizes ca n't be accommodated if you 're using 3 or more elements . Go 2 ' 8 " minimum .
There are three major properties an edible fat ( I am assuming you are not asking about inedible oils like petroleum based products ) has that affect how it is best used : Flavor Saturation Smoke point Properties Flavor The flavor of the fat is very important . So called <URL> ( like canola oil or refined grapeseed oil , or refined peanut oil , among many others ) have very little flavor and so are suitable for almost any cooking task , as they will not interfere with or compete with the other flavors in the dish . Other oils such as sesame oil are primarily used for the delicious flavor that they provide , and are almost more of a condiment than an oil for culinary purposes . In between are oils like olive oil and coconut oil which have a distinctive flavor , but also have good qualities for cooking . Many non-oil fats used in cooking ( like butter , or bacon fat , lard , or suet ) also have distinctive flavors . Saturation The level of <URL> in the fat controls how hard the fat is at room temperature . Most oils are fairly low in saturation , and are so quite liquid even at room temperature . The major exceptions among the vegetable based lipids are coconut oil and cocoa butter . Coconut oil is solid at room temperature , and cocoa butter is actually quite hard at room temperature . Note that while you only asked about " oils " , many common cooking fats not usually called an oil are much more saturated , including butter , lard , and hydrogenated vegetable oil such as the US brand Crisco . The level of saturation can affect texture of baked goods made with a given oil , and whether the fat is suitable for the creaming method or in making laminated pastry in baking . Saturated fats also resist rancidity better over time better than non-saturated fats ( although they are still subject to rancidity ) . Smoke Point The smoke point of a fat or oil is temperature to which it can be heated before it begins smokng . Oils which have a high smoke point ( such as grapeseed oil or peanut oil among others ) are more suitable for high temperature searing , or deep frying . Applications The oil for a given application is based on the properties it has . Cooking For general cooking uses ( by which I am inferring general sauteeing , shallow frying , greasing of casserole dishes , and so on is meant ) , normally you want a fat which is either : Neutral in flavor so as not to interfere with the dish . The neutral oils are all useful for this . Complimentary in flavor , to enhance the dish . Many cuisines have traditional fats which are flavorful , but are integrated into their cuisine , such as olive oil or butter . Saturation matters less ( as the fat can be melted before greasing a pan , for example ) , and smoke point is not terribly relevant unless the application is searing , in which case you want a very high smoke point . Depending on the application and the cuisine from which a dish derives , almost any oil or fat may be used for general cooking purposes . The major exception is sesame oil , which is so flavorful that it is used as a condiment , not a fat , for culinary purposes . Deep Frying The most important aspect for deep frying is smoke point . A low smoke point oil would break down and add off flavors to the dish ( not to mention making the kitchen smoky and setting off smoke alarms ) . Secondarily , for oils that are going to be reused over time , saturated fats such as hydrogenated vegetable shortenings break down more slowly , and may be considered advantageous . Generally , flavorful oils are not indicated , as the same factors that give them good flavor often give them low smoke points . Some good oils for deep frying include peanut oil , canola oil , or hydrogenated vegetable shortening . Dressing For most dressings ( by which I infer you mean salad dressings as used in many Western style cuisines ) , the most important factors are flavor and saturation . You want an oil with good flavor ( such as olive oil ) or neutral flavor ( such as the many neutral oils like canola , refined peanut , corn oil , and so on ) . Most dressings also need an oil which is liquid at room temperature , and thus low in saturation . The major exception is the class of hot dressings made with bacon fat . Many dressings are made from olive oil , or one of the neutral oils . Baking While you did not ask about baking applications , there are two types of baking which require a fat with specific properties : cakes made by the creaming method , and laminated pastries like croissants or puff pastry . These applications require a fat which is solid at room temperature , but still plastic enough to be manipulated . Generally , only butter and hydrogenated vegetable oil are suitable . Bottom Line The oil or fat you choose for any particular purpose will be based on what is best for that application -- but a good neutral oil with a high smoke point such as refined peanut oil or canola oil can serve the vast majority of culinary purposes most of the time .

Good Answer Hobodave ... tacking onto that : Most southern U.S. brands ( White Lily , Martha White ) of all-purpose flour are bleached because southerners tend to make more quick breads ( biscuits , cornbread , hoecakes , pancakes , as well as cakes , pie crusts , cobblers ) where tenderness is desired . White Lily has just started producing unbleached all-purpose flour as well . Brands from the Northeast ( King Arthur ) and midwest are usually unbleached because those regions tend to make more yeast breads and the additional gluten forming capability of unbleached flour produces better results . National U.S. brands ( Pillsbury/Gold Medal ) often produce both types or stick with unbleached . Cake flour is always bleached ( usually chlorine gas ) . More information on differences in types of flour can be found in my article titled <URL>
Generally speaking , butter spreads have a water component to them . That 's what the emulsifier is for , as it keeps the fat and water from separating . The problem is that you ca n't fry/cook with it . If you place it in a pan it will separate , and sizzle in a very unpleasant manner . If I remember correctly , it actaully smells quite awful in the process . As for baking , I think it 'll be fine anywhere there needs to be fat as fat . Wherever you need fat as something to hold the structure , you had probably best not use it . Caveat emptor , as I do n't bake very much at all . Let it be aid , however , that margarine as opposed to butter spread , can be used anywhere that butter is used . It is n't as tasty , and has trans-fats . On the other hand , it has less cholesterol .
I 've never heard of anyone trying this . I think its very unlikely though . Those gas deflectors are actually specially designed to pull in the appropriate amount of atmospheric air for a proper flame . This is why the flame you see is so blue and has very little orange . I 'd look into seeing if there is some way to get a replacement deflector that is better suited for wok cooking . You could also do what Alton Brown does and use the bottom half of a turkey deep fryer , outside preferably , and not over any pipes or electrical wiring or gravel .
There are three ( to the best of my knowledge ) main factors at work here : <URL> . This is a gelling agent , a bit like gelatin . Fruits such as apples and plums are very high in pectin ; citrus fruits are not that high in pectin but citrus peels are incredibly high , so if you 're using any of the peel , you 're getting tons of great pectin . Obviously , the more pectin , the faster and firmer it 's going to gel . If the fruit does n't contain much pectin then you 're going to have to cook it down a lot or just add actual pectin ( you can buy it in stores ) . Acidity , as you suspect , makes a big difference . It 's not just acidity , it 's the relationship of acidity to pectin as above . For more details read <URL> . Basically , pectin gels best at a pH of 2.5 ( almost exactly the pH of lemon juice ) to 4.5 ( about the pH of sweet grapes ) . It 's best to hit the sweet spot in the middle rather than the extreme ends , so you wo n't generally be using pure lemon juice , you 'll be adding some sugar and other ingredients . Which leads me to the final factor : Sugar . As described in <URL> , sugar precipitates the pectin , basically making the pectin molecules less soluble which mimics the effect of a higher concentration . Therefore , more sugar makes the jelly set faster . So : Pectin-rich fruits + high acidity + high sugar content = fast setting . There are actually various other factors that affect the pectin ( which is pretty much the only gelling agent at work when working with natural fruit jellies ) like salts and even alcohol , but in the vast majority of recipes , it 's acidity and sugar that are your primary concerns as well as the actual pectin content of the fruit itself .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
Depending on where you are , the word <URL> can mean a few different things . In Mexico it refers to a flatbread made of either wheat or corn and a few other ingredients . These flatbreads tend to come in standard sizes in the United States at least , one of which might be labeled the " burrito " size . A <URL> is one use for a tortilla . A burrito consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped around a filling . Often the filling might include beans , cooked meat , rice , and perhaps vegetables .
Red pizza sauce is often ( but not always ) two things : Thicker . Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings , otherwise thin is fine . Depending on the crust , the heat of the oven , the toppings above sauce , and how watery it is , this may not be needed . If you 've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand . If you 've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese , precook and reduce the sauce . It 's often simpler . Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection . They 're all about the sauce . Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it . Many of the best pizzas are simply topped . Crushed san marzano tomatoes ( sometimes ) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do , and franky , it 's enough . I 'm not talking about the jarred varieties here , but what you might cook at home . Jars in the store , the main difference is just how thick it is .
There is no strict delineation between these two terms . Either can be savory or sweet . Some common differences are : Mousses may get their foaminess from from plain whipped egg whites , a meringue , whole eggs , whipped cream , or something else ; a souffle is always leavened by whipped egg whites . Mousses ( except for some seafood mousses , which are gently poached ) are rarely cooked as a whole dish ; souffles are always baked to get additional rise . Mousses are almost always served cold ; souffles are usually served hot , immediately out of the oven to retain the additional rise they get in the heat of the oven . One might consider souffles a type of baked mousse , much as quiches are a specific type of tart , but that terminology is rarely used . See also : <URL>

Is there a spice that is hot and colorless ?
Let a hot pepper ( jalapeño or habañero , perhaps ) soak in your liquid for however long it takes to achieve the desired hotness .
There is no problem at all doing this . At a restaurant where I worked , we would make up a couple pounds of butter worth of roux at a time . The main thing you want to do is use a pan with a lot of surface area , so it cooks evenly . A whisk will work fine . You do n't have to stir constantly , just frequently .
It seems the main thing you 're trying to do is avoid any work in the morning before bake . As suggested in comments , the easiest way to do that is to get a mechanical bread-maker . Since you say you 're inexperienced in bread-making , you can dump everything in the night before , program it with a time , and voila -- fresh bread in the morning . ( I do n't tend to like the loaf quality that comes out of most home bread-makers , though ; but if you find one that makes good bread , this is the best solution . ) That said , if you actually want to make the bread yourself , you can do what you want . It 's just going to require a lot of work the evening before . Many recipes can be adapted to do this , though it tends to work best with sourdough loaves . Basically , the technique works like this : Mix dough Knead First fermentation ( 1-3 hours , depending on yeast quantity and bread type ) Shape tightly , preferably with a pre-shaping and bench rest ( another 15 minutes ) Second fermentation , generally takes place entirely in fridge Place in fridge overnight Remove and bake immediately Jeffrey Hamelman suggests this for a number of sourdough recipes in his book Bread : A Baker 's Book of Techniques and Recipes . He also notes that it 's not necessary to let the dough come to room temperature before baking : assuming it has risen enough , you can remove it directly from the fridge and bake with little consequence . ( Also , just to reply to one notion in comments -- it is possible to bake bread starting from a cold oven . Many people prefer to do it that way , though the results tend to be a little less consistent and oven spring is generally a little less . If you do so , it might be easier to bake in a pot . But it would be possible to get up in the morning , turn your oven on , throw the bread in immediately , and have it baked maybe 30-45 minutes later , depending on the size of the loaf . For those who do n't believe me , <URL> who did a comparison of cold oven start vs. preheated and found little difference . ) My experience trying shaping before overnight retarding long ago is that it can work well for sourdough ( see method # 2 <URL> for more details ) , since the yeast tends to rise much more slowly in the fridge . The danger with normal baker 's yeast is that most recipes use too much yeast to make this method work -- what will happen is that your bread wo n't cool fast enough in the fridge , then the dough will overproof and collapse a bit in the oven , often with poor crust formation . Normally , when professional bakers retard pre-shaped dough in the fridge , they do so for only a couple hours , which tends to add flavor . For detailed instructions with illustrations and a recipe showing this , see <URL> . Basically , what you want to do is a similar thing to that recipe , but with less yeast , so you can refrigerate overnight . Unfortunately , that will tend to make your bulk rise go slower , which means a longer wait in the evening between steps . For more information and recipes online , I 'd try instead searching for something like " retarding after shaping , " which is the kind of recipe you 're looking for . You just need to find one that allows retarding for 8 hours or more , rather than just a couple hours . The other option is obtain sourdough cultures and try those recipes . Usually with them the pace of the yeast rise is appropriate for an overnight final proof in the fridge . Still , the results will be a little more finicky ( i.e. , harder to get a " perfect " loaf every time ) than using a more standard method . Also , I just noticed you mentioned rolls in your question . Those would be a lot easier than trying to do this with an entire loaf , and it 's pretty standard to refrigerate overnight before baking . If the recipe is one that depends on removing from the oven for a while before baking , then just delay putting the dough in the fridge for maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of that time ( varies by recipe ) the night before . Then you should be able to bake straight from the fridge to the oven the next morning . Again , it may take a bit of experimentation with a specific recipe to get this perfect .
There are at least three potential downsides : wood is quite light , so you will not get the benefit of added weight of the pestle for crushing ; many wooden mortars have a smooth texture , which will not aid in the grinding as much as , e.g. , a coarse ceramic mortar ; and wood is porous -- increasingly so as it dries over time -- so it may have the tendency to pick up the flavors of its contents .
There certainly is such a thing as pork stock , it 's made the same way as beef and chicken stock - by cooking down bones to extract the flavors . With beef you use beef bones , with pork you use pork bones . Supermarkets stock the products that make economic sense , they do n't carry items which wo n't move - especially if they have a very limited shelf life . Beef , chicken and vegetable stocks are the most widely used ones in many parts of the world , so they will carry those as they have a good chance to be sold . Pork , lamb , and fish stocks can be found in supermarkets in areas where enough of the customer base will buy it . If you ca n't find it in your local supermarket then there may be specialty stores ( online or bricks and mortar ) which you could get it from . Butchers may carry it as well . If not then making stock is very simple , all you need is some bones , vegetables , a heat source and some time .
In general , the chances of significant heat damage to granite are very small , though depending on the pan , the granite , and any products that may be on the granite ( not only sealant , but residue from granite cleaning or polishing products , etc. ) , you might sometimes get some staining/charring . I would also take into account the amount of heat that will transfer from the pan/pot/tray -- a small pan which is nearly empty and not very hot is a very different thing from a giant cast iron dutch oven filled with chili or superheated cooking oil . I personally would n't risk injecting a huge amount of heat into a small area , because it will cause the material to expand and contract unevenly . When done repeatedly , it could even lead to cracking . Unlikely ? Yes . Impossible ? No , particularly if the granite is thin or lower quality ( e.g. , with some minor fissures or weak spots already in the stone , etc. ) . Another issue is a safety one -- granite countertops that absorb heat from very hot pans can stay exceptionally hot for a quite a while . Since there 's often no visual cue about the temperature ( unlike a stovetop ) , it can easily cause burns if you forget that that part of the countertop may be hot . Other answers have mentioned that most references on the internet say it 's safe , but with just a quick search in the first 10 links or so that came up , I see a number of places that actually manufacture or install granite do NOT recommend placing hot things directly on granite . See , for example : <URL> : " Trivets or cloths are highly recommended . " <URL> : " Repeated exposure to high heat can eventually leave black marks and gashes on granite slabs . " <URL> : " The darker the material the more dense and therefore the more heat it will hold . The biggest issue with putting a hot pan on granite is that if you touched the spot it could be as hot as the pan itself and therefore cause you an injury . You should especially be cautious with black granite since it is the most dense and with repeat exposure may actually crack . " <URL> in a list of myths : " ' Granite is heat resistant , so it is perfectly okay to place hot pots on a granite countertop . ' While it 's true that granite is quite resistant to the sorts of temperatures encountered in kitchens , excessive heat can damage or discolor some types of granite sealers . Rapid heating can also generate internal stresses that could cause a crack at a weak spot , such as a natural flaw or fissure in the stone . An easy way to eliminate potential problems is by using a trivet with feet . " Many sites agree with these cautions . There are other sites that say it should be okay , or it 's safe up to X degrees , or it 's okay but you should n't do it repeatedly , or whatever . Everybody seems to have their opinion . And you can find sources that claim the cracking is a myth . <URL> , for example , heats small blocks of granite in a toaster oven and with a blowtorch and observes no damage . But the heat damage ( if it exists ) is not going to be caused simply by heating , but by thermal shock created when a large slab is heated unevenly and thus expands and contracts unevenly ( usually repeatedly over a period of years ) . If you look around a bit , the internet does have anecdotes of people who have had granite countertops develop cracks or discoloration . Personally , I have granite , and I avoid doing it on a regular basis . However , in a pinch when I have a lot of hot pans or trays around the kitchen , and I need to set something down , I do n't worry too much about doing it once in a while . I think the chances of damage are quite small . But with the cost of granite , why take any risk when you can just use a trivet or something ( as you 'd do on just about any other surface ) ? That 's just my habit anywhere .
They are both soft-ripened cheese , and there are certainly many similarities , but they are by no means the same . Camembert is aged at least 3 weeks ; Brie may be aged as little as 1 week . Brie is generally drained for 18 hours ; Camembert is drained for 48 hours . Brie may be salted before aging ; Camembert is not . Brie is more often pasteurized than Camembert ( although " genuine " Brie is unpasteurized ) . That said , there are many different varieties of Brie and many different varieties of Camembert , and it would n't be too surprising to find at least one Brie that tastes exactly like another Camembert . Still , they are quite different - different moulds , different draining , different aging .
If you 're buying bacon at the store , and trying to reduce the actual sodium in the product you 've just purchased - you 're out of luck . Like most things , you ca n't un-salt it . You can reduce the flavor , but in your case , the sodium is still there . Alternative options include : Buy reduced sodium bacon Make reduced sodium bacon Use less bacon , in order to reduce the total sodium intake .
Sounds like the technique for <URL> , from <URL> , only with hot sauce added . I do n't think it has a name other than " pan fry/sear in caramelized sugar "
There is empirical support for the effect of temperature on pitting corrosion , although from what little I 'm able to understand of the very complicated metallurgy , the common explanation given is far too simplistic and the actual behaviour is not nearly as clear-cut as " colder = more salt crystals = more pitting " , but rather due to something called transpassive dissolution ( searching for this will give you lots of scholarly results on stainless steel corrosion ) . I 'll get straight to the point by referencing this <URL> from the Metals Handbook ( textbook ) which has the following convenient graph : More pitting happens at lower temperatures . As the link explains : At low temperatures , extremely high breakdown potentials are observed , corresponding to transpassive dissolution , not localized corrosion . Just above the critical pitting temperature ( CPT ) , pitting corrosion occurs at a potential that is far below the transpassive breakdown potential . But you can see from the graph that that 's not the whole story , either . Excluding what happens at very high temperatures ( above the CPT ) , the impact of temperature looks to be maybe 20-30 % , but there are much more significant variations based on other factors , the most notable kitchen-applicable examples being the material ( described as the <URL> - Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number ) , surface condition ( grit ) , and inhibitor elements in the solution ( traces of which may or may not be found in tap water ) . While this does certainly support the conclusion , it 's also obvious , if you read the explanation of pitting or look at the lovely reaction diagram on page 2 of the textbook link , that it has literally nothing to do with undissolved salt . In fact , pitting is caused by the Cl - ions specifically , and so can only happen after it is dissolved in the water . If you just poured salt on a dry pan in a dry environment , it should n't corrode . Moreover , pitting is a <URL> - it 's quite literally random even when you know all the other parameters , so while one can certainly average it out over many experiments and thus quantify the correlation with temperature , that ends up having little meaning in a kitchen setting because you are cooking with one pan/pot and the random variation seems to be a lot more profound than the effect of the temperature variable . Anyway , in case anyone was thinking that it sounds pretty simple so far - it 's not . The experiment that produced the graph above was performed under one set of conditions - using just salt , water , and stainless steel . While that 's certainly comparable to cooking , it 's interesting to see what <URL> ( Inﬂuence of the electrolyte composition and temperature on the transpassive dissolution of austenitic stainless steels in simulated bleaching solutions - PDF warning ) says about oxalic acid : The addition of oxalic acid has accordingly a much bigger impact on the transpassive corrosion rate at 70 ° C than at room temperature [ ... ] In the solutions containing organic additives at 70 ° C , transpassive oxidation starts at significantly lower potentials than at room temperature . In case you 're not familiar with oxalic acid - or wondering why you should care - it 's the primary ingredient in <URL> , which many " premium " stainless steel cookware brands such as All Clad recommend using to clean your cookware - and nearly every cleaning guide recommends warm , but not hot , water . Admittedly , I just looked at the label and BKF does n't specify a temperature , so the warm-water recommendation is entirely anecdotal - but looking at the above , it makes sense ; you want to use warm water in order for it to be more effective , but using hot water ( or even warm water for more than a minute or so ) increases the risk of corrosion , especially if what you 're trying to clean is caked-on salt or charred food . The effect of pH is more generally supported by <URL> , where neutral is better ( i.e. less corrosion ) , not to mention that strong acids cause the other type of corrosion ( called intergranular ) , and <URL> , although the effect is very slow , but still appreciable over time if you like to deglaze with boiling vinegar , for example . Even of the type of salt makes a big difference , if you scroll further down on that same previous link . Ammonium chloride is , for example , often found in sea salt , and it would appear to cause pitting corrosion much faster than the sodium chloride in table salt or kosher salt . Here 's what really does matter in a practical sense : Pitting is a reduction reaction , it 's caused by a lack of oxygen available to the metal surface - unlike , for example , rust , which is caused by oxygen . Quoting the last link : If debris of any kind is allowed to accumulate on the surfaces of stainless steel equipment , it will reduce the accessibility of oxygen to the covered areas and pits may develop in such locations because of the reduced oxygen concentration . [ ... ] ... carbon deposits from heated organic compounds are typical examples of t
First off , try digestive biscuits . They 're really very similar cookies/crackers/biscuits , and it 's a common enough substitution that it 's even <URL> . <URL> implies that they 're called wheatmeal biscuits in Australia . sourd ' oh 's suggestion of particularly crunchy gingersnaps might work too , but you 'll also want to make sure they 're not too spicy ! ( Unfortunately , I do n't know about specific varieties since I 'm not Australian . )
you might try forcing whatever it is into the cherries . This can be done under pressure , which you might be <URL> using a <URL> or maybe <URL> , or simply by vacuum packing the cherries with the soaking liquid . once vacuum packed you might be able to put in a pressure cooker to increase the pressure , but I 'm not sure what the heat would do to the cherries . EDIT : having read the recipe , I 'm not sure any of this would work .
The Kansas City Strip and the New York Strip refer to the same cut of meat . Apparently restaurants in New York City in the 1930 's decided they could n't sell a fancy steak named after Kansas City ( where the stockyards and slaughterhouses were located ) . So , they just started calling it a New York Strip . If you want a steak renamed by a egotistical chef , order the New York Strip . If you want a steak named for the cut of beef originally selected by butchers working next to the stockyards , order the Kansas City Strip .
Dilute heavily by using a very small portion of peppers per dish Allow cooking time for the pepper flavor to permeate the dish before adding more . It 's not like black pepper where the taste spreads instantly . Remove the seeds and membranes holding them , as this reduces spiciness considerably Cut peppers very finely or puree so there are n't any large pieces to deliver a shocker in the final dish Wear gloves when handling the peppers If you do n't use gloves , wash your hands well before touching your eyes , mouth , or other " sensitive regions . " AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY , DO NOT FRY OR SAUTE THE PEPPERS . No , seriously . The last one is a mistake you only make once , and should be on a warning label with all store-bought chilis . The capsaicin somehow becomes volatile when heated enough , and the result is like filling your entire domicile with pepper spray . I am ashamed to say that the last two cautions are drawn purely from personal experience . It 's not the kind of " hot date " you want to share with an ( un ) lucky person , believe me .
There certainly are differences . Specifically regarding lemon there are differences not only in taste , because the lemon olive oil is flavored using the zest of a lemon , but also in acidity . Lemon juice is very acidic , olive oil is not . There are plenty of times where it is completely inappropriate to add an acid . A better comparison would instead be lemon infused olive oil compared to olive oil and lemon zest . There would still be a difference , but it would be less noticeable . The infused olive oil has had more opportunity to capture the fat soluble flavor compounds in the lemon zest , however the flavor compounds that are n't fat soluble will be forever lost . That is generally the trade-off when it comes to any infused oil . You will get lots of the fat soluble flavor compounds , but you will lose the non-fat soluble flavor compounds . As for difference of use in the olive oil and lemon juice case , yes , definitely . You ca n't always add acids to foods . In the lemon zest case , apart from the slight flavor difference , there 's also a texture difference . Of course , if you want something very smooth , pieces of zest would n't be a good thing . Apart from those though , not really . All of these differences still apply both in uncooked as well as cooked preparations .
It is almost impossible to reduce the sweetness of cookie dough once made , without further reducing the quality . The closest you could come would be to create a second batch of cookie dough ingredients with reduced sugar , and combine it with your existing dough . However , it will be difficult to achieve good integration of the two batches , and even if you do , the extra working of the first batch from the mixing will create additional gluten , making tougher cookies . In this case , you might want to try some sort of tart lemon glaze or perhaps a very bittersweet chocolate icing to compliment your cookies and reduce the impression of sweetness . On the other hand , except for butter , sugar cookies contain no expensive ingredients . It may not be worth trying to salvage this batch . In the end , this is probably a lesson learned that your particular recipe is not to your liking as is . Next time , you will want to either reduce the sugar , or use another recipe .
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
While I found many references to Chinese egg noodles , I did not find much information on Japanese egg noodles . Digging into the edit history of your question , it appears that the actual product you would like to substitute for is <URL> . Their website is parsimonious with information , but does call the product vermicelli , and only indicates that they are made with wheat , and does not mention egg . <URL> , a producer of Asian ingredients for the US market , suggests using suggests substituting Italian style fettuccine or spaghetti for Chinese egg noodles . Putting this all together , you should be able to substitute dried Italian vermicelli , spaghetti , fettuccine or angel hair in the your recipe with good results . Check the package to ensure that the ingredients are only semolina ( and water ) , as some Italian pastas are made with egg ( this is most likely with the fettuccine shape ) . Any non-egg based semolina pasta will be completely cholesterol free . See also : <URL> from Recipe Tips .
In my book , this is pretty trivial . Wasabi is absolutely a spice - it 's something with a very specific flavor , derived from a plant , that can be used in fairly small quantities to add flavor to something . It 's not spicy ( spicy hot , piquant ) in the normal sense , though . It does n't contain capsaicin . It is hot in some sense : it contains allyl isothiocyanate , which we obviously have a very strong reaction to . This is the same compound that 's in horseradish and hot mustard . The reaction is very different from capsaicin , though . Capsaicin causes you to register heat at a much lower temperature than you normally would , so you 're actually feeling heat , like you would if you were burning your tongue . It 's quite literally hot , as far as your body is concerned . It 's also an oil , so it ca n't be washed away easily with liquid , and the burning tends to linger . Wasabi , on the other hand , does n't produce an actual sensation of heat , you feel it mostly in your nasal passages , and can easily be washed away with liquid , so it tends to be a brief sensation . So sure , " hot " is a reasonable way to describe it , mostly because we do n't have a word for the actual sensation , but it 's definitely not the same thing as a hot pepper . I 'm sure you can find plenty of people who would say that these are just two different kinds of spicy hot ( piquancy ) , but arguing over definitions is n't going to get us anywhere . The important thing is that there 's a fundamental difference , and there 's no way you could substitute one for the other . If you want to understand why I think this ( and it 's not just a personal definition ) , go to any recipe site , search for " spicy " , and see how many things with wasabi/horseradish/mustard supplying " spiciness " you find . Edit : To stave off further debate in the comments , let me just repeat : arguing over definitions is not useful . There are probably a lot of people who think " spicy hot " should include this , and a lot who do n't . I would n't generally expect anyone to think of wasabi without context when you say spicy hot , but you 're welcome to use the terms however you and the people you talk with understand them .
Yes , yes there is . Black truffles are dark , earthy , sexy in flavour . Renaissance writings compare them to ' unwashed slatterns ' and ' bedchambers , rooms of sexual congress , unaired and reeking of the recent activities contained therein . ' White truffles are lighter in aroma and flavour , with distinct garlicky notes . Each has their place -- black works better on its own , white works better as an adjunt or finishing note to a dish . I am personally partial to white truffle oil drizzled on cured duck breast , or a black truffle risotto with charred endive .

Should you store cutlery upside down ?
This discussion is a bit far fetched , ( going for safety 's sake ) . If by upside down you mean the ' business end ' of the utensil is down and the handle up , this comes to mind : If there is a drop of contaminated water ( from hands or a splash ) it 'll work its way to the very tip . The tip also is the last place to dry . the tip of the utensil ( nearly guaranteed to touch food and likely lips and mouth ) is touching a surface that many other utensils hit ( bottom of the basket ) . A parallel issue to ground meat from multiple animals here where if one piece is carrying something , then it 's spreading . A clever thing I saw a banquet hall staff do , was to bring the utensils with the bucket to the table which was covered with clean ( disinfected ) table cloth and tipped it over . That way she did n't have to pull them out by the business end and could grab the handles once they rested on the table .
The oil will always separate from the rest of the product . ( home made or natural/bio peanut butter will behave the same way ) When that happens , just spend some time and elbow grease to mix it back together again . if the tahini was stored in the fridge , it might take longer because everything will be harder . Just leave it on the counter for a while until it gets to room temperature before mixing it back together . ( after googling ) People suggest to keep the jar upside down and when you want to use it , just put it back straight and let it stand for a while , it will mix itself ( a little bit ) together again .
Generally , cooked beans keep best frozen , at least if you 're keeping them for more than a day or two . As for what you 'd refrigerate them in to save the to use tomorrow , I 'd suggest either their own liquid ( if you 're going to use it in the recipe ) or drained ( but tightly covered ) . Alternatively , if they 're going to go into some sauce , you could let them marinate in it . A teaspoon of citric acid ( assuming anhydrous , i.e. , dry ) is a fair bit , especially for 1L . That will be very sour . ⅛ tsp citric acid into 1L water is notably sour .
In a cup with water . You place them straight up in a small cup with a little water . Just like you would if you were storing flowers . You 'll want to store this in your chill chest on the top most rack ; to avoid any cross contamination from other possible food products ( chicken , etc ) . You may want to leave the rubber band on to allow it to stay tidy . If you must you can cover your asparagus cup with a zip lock bag on top . With this method we usually can store asparagus for 5-7 days . If you must keep them longer it maybe better to just freeze them in an air tight bag . after they 're dried out .
First of all , people indeed often add some seasoning in the beginning , but are usually careful with the amount , especially with salt . Flavor-wise , you could add it at the end , after the reduction and be fine . However , salt can also affect the process of cooking . For instance , it can draw moisture out of some vegetables when frying them first , meaning that they will be cooked a bit faster . That is why some salt can be added at the beginning . At the end , after the reduction , you should taste and add some more seasoning , if needed .
Yes , you can store it for about a day in the fridge . Let it warm up again before you cook it though .
Just keep it dry . I buy 100 sheets packs and store them in a zip-loc type bag in the cupboard for over a year
In either case store the cheese in the liquid it came in , transferring it to a clean container and covering well . Feta lasts reasonably well , but mozzarella only keeps well for a couple of days .
This similar ( also has heavy cream ) recipe from epicurious recommends : " Room temperature , up to 3 days ; refrigerated , at least 3 months . " <URL> ... And that conforms to my personal opinion , as well . I would not freeze it .
Sterno is gelled denatured alcohol . It is denatured alcohol ( a combination of methanol and ethanol ) so that you ca n't , safely , drink it , but it is still mostly alcohol , which will dissolve in water and clean up just fine . While I would n't dump a lot of it down the sink , you should have no problem with cleanup . And while Sterno is n't safe to drink , it wo n't be a problem if you touch it in cleaning up . I just double checked the Sterno site and they confirm water cleanup and say , additionally , that it is biodegradable .
The chemical responsible for " the burn " is Capsaicin . The main reason you and everyone else has trouble with the lingering burning sensation is that it 's not water soluble ( which means it does n't dissolve in water ) . So , flooding your mouth with water-based liquids does n't loosen up those Capsaicin molecules on your tongue and throat . Like @Iuls says , the most common and effective relief comes from full-fat milk or cream . That 's because , while Capsaicin is n't able to be dissolved by water , it is fat soluble . It 's also why more than a few people have been upset that the " milk solution " did n't work , when they tried it with skim milk . If you 're looking for a more " fun " solution , it 's worth noting that Capsaicin is also alcohol soluble , which might explain all of that tequila and beer they sell at Mexican restaurants .
The true aficionado would claim that you actually do n't store cooked pasta , but for those cases where this is n't viable , you have a few options : Pasta that will be cooled and re-heated later , e.g. left overs Drain well , cool , refrigerate . The pasta will stick , but you can dump it in hot salted water foe a bit to re-heat where it will unstick again . Not perfectly al dente , but probably ok . ( Slightly undercooking pasta can mitigate this a bit . ) Pasta that should stay warm , e.g. on a buffet Add a bit of fat ( olive oil , butter ... ) to coat your pasta . Keeps it from sticking . Critics claim that it also keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta . Adding the sauce can have a similar effect , but you risk soggy pasta . Pasta that should stay cold , e.g. pasta salad The only case where rinsing pasta is kind of allowed . Side effect : cool pasta ( well drained after rinsing ) can be mixed even with heat-sensitive dressings right away , avoiding stickiness issues again .
Store them in the bag in your fridge . Also , if you take the greens off they will last longer . I keep mine in the drawer at the bottom .
Do n't wrap the chicken in foil . Instead you can use a steamer basket inserted in a pot with the lid on ( making sure your liquid does not touch the chicken ) and steam it that way . If you do n't have a steamer basket and what you are trying to do is replace one , instead of wrapping the chicken roll that foil into balls or strips and use it to elevate the chicken above the cooking liquid in your pot . If you wrap in foil , the chicken will be cooking via the heat transfer from the foil rather than from the steam .
It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic , it will rot quicker , so I wrap it in paper towels , then bag it ( but not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . For whole heads of lettuce ( iceburg , butter , red leaf , etc ) , I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels , then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer 's market . I then pull off leaves as I need it , and re-wrap it . It stores for well over a week this way . For mescalin mixes , arugula , or other individual leaves , I 'll wash them , dry them , then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on , then roll up the whole thing , and bag the roll ( again , not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . I can probably get a week out of it this way . ( all times assume you 're not buying from a store where it 's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it ; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer 's market ) So , to answer the specific questions : keep the bag open ; you do n't want moisture to condense inside the bag , as it 'll make the lettuce rot faster . I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole . If you 're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days , it probably does n't matter , and for loose lettuce , I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway . You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged , but damp will lead to it rotting faster .
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
<URL> by Janet Bailey says : Keep stored eggs covered . Eggs readily absorb odors from , and lose moisture to , the air circulating in the refrigerator . The best container for them is the carton you bought them in . Do n't use the open egg racks in the door of the refrigerator . The rack is too warm and unprotected . Store eggs with their broad , rounded ends up . This position helps the chalaza keep the yolk centered in the white , away from the air pocket where it might encounter unfriendly bacteria . The rounded end of the egg is also less likely to break when accidentally bumped . Do n't wash eggs before you store them . If they have been coated in oil , you would be washing away that valuable protection .
Wooden blocks are ideal for knife storage because they keep the blades dry ( the wood absorbs some of the humidity in the air ) , preventing rusting . The motion of inserting and withdrawing blades over wood will not noticeably dull them , because you 're not actually cutting the wood or indeed even applying any pressure as you do so . A good tip is to use a good quality steel to sharpen your knives with just one or two passes on each side before each use . Wash them with hot water by hand , avoiding dishwashers unless you like replacing your knives annually , then return them to the block once they 're fully dried .
Although ours rarely lasts for more than a week , we typically just store it in an airtight container with the rest of the cereal . I would imagine the fat could eventually go rancid , so if you need to store it for weeks or months , either refrigeration or freezing should work . You 'll still want the airtight container , however , to prevent any fridge funk from tainting the taste .
There are several things in general that you can do to increase the speed at which food cools down , but two of the most effective are : Increase the surface area . Spread it in a wide , shallow pan , like a sheet pan , rather than a deep pot . This will allow more cooling . Use an ice water bath . Place the container with the food into an ice water bath , being careful not to spill the water into the food . Using a zip style bag to hold the food before putting it into the bath also can help . A variation of this , especially for hot stocks or stews , is to freeze water in clean water bottles or zip bags , and place those into the food in addition to the ice bath . For a pilaf , the first method should work very well . You can also bring physics to the party : Convection is far more powerful at heat transfer than conduction . A fan for air cooling will help , or running water for water for water cooling will also help , but these are not always practical in kitchen .

How do you properly cook a steak ?
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
Any meat that is good for fast cooking ( BBQ , frying , grilling etc. ) will be suitable for this . Do not use meat that is normally casseroled or slow cooked . For beef this is the non-exercised top parts of the cow . Typical western cuts are called sirloin , rump , and fillet You need very thin slices of meat more than cubes if you want any level of browning and cooking to be achieved The easiest way to do this is to partially freeze you meat for one to two hours in a normal domestic freezer . A slab of meat with a profile of around 30 x 80 mm ( ± 50 % ) is the easiest to handle . Use a sharp chef 's knife or meat cleaver and slice it into 2 to 3 mm thin slices which will cook very nicely on a pizza A well marbled ( mixed fat content ) cut would work better , like in this picture
Yes , the problem will be the vinegar . Vinegar is acidic and you 'll end up with mushy meat . 48 hours is almost certainly too long . For a vinegar base , I try not to push it over 8 hours and that 's only if really necessary . A few hours is typically fine . Right now , you 've got to consider how to save the meat . I 'd freeze the meat right now . Freeze the meat with the marinade ( which seems like such a waste for 40 ' ish hours , but better that than mushy steak ) . When ready to cook , take it out and let the marinade do its business as it thaws . I 'd thaw it in ziplock under running water ( quicker than the fridge ) and let it marinade a short time and go on the grill . If you let it sit in any unfrozen stage too long , you 'll get mushy steak with a vinegar marinade .
This is a recipe that we used for the concierge lounge when I was a chef in the main kitchen of the Disney 's Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa : Paneer 5 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons lemon juice Bring the milk to a boil , add the lemon juice so that the milk separates into the curds and whey . Add a bit more lemon juice if necessary . Let set for approx . 5 mins . Line a strainer with a cheesecloth and strain the milk . Reserve the whey to use in curries instead of water . Squeeze the excess whey out of the curd and fold the cloth around the paneer to form a 4-inch square . Place the paneer on a plate and place a heavy weight on top to squeeze out excess whey . Leave for about 4 hours to set .

You can cook steaks from frozen , it is just a matter of adjusting cooking times . They will take longer to cook . But you have saved several hours in defrost time . I take my frozen steaks and sear on both sides , then finish them off in the oven for about 16 mins depending on cut , or with a thicker cut for about 18 to 20 mins . America 's Test Kitchen has experimented with this idea and says that the steaks taste better cooked from frozen ( <URL> ) . I have to watch the temperature otherwise the steak might get a little tough , but I always preheat the oven . For me , 180 ° C.
Butchered meat is generally sterile except on its exterior . ( That does n't mean parasite - or botulism-free , but it 's a start . ) Get the best quality you can from a source you trust . Keep it at as low a temperature as possible , and do n't expose it to warm air for more than the few minutes it takes to prepare . Cut with a clean knife on a clean surface . Put it right back into the fridge at a very low temp . Salt and acid , if you use them in your sauce , will provide some anti-bacterial benefits , but this is not foolproof . People all over the world eat raw meat , but it 's best to start with small amounts and see how your system handles it . If you 're a child/pregnant/old / sick , it 's much less of a good idea .
Three potential methods or changes you can try : soak the quail in brine for 2-3 hours before searing . You can do this in a large zip-lock sack or in a covered bowl . Make sure to store the quail/brine combo in your refrigerator during the soaking . Let quail reach room temperature before cooking . Pan-searing the quail might dry out the smaller pieces , i.e. the bony wings or legs . Try your 20-minutes cooking in a very hot oven , making sure not to burn or sear the quail too much . Similar to cooking a turkey , cover the thinner pieces with foil so they dry out more slowly . Ultimate method : use a " Sous Vide " method - you basically seal the quail and your flavorful broth in a vacuum seal bag , making sure to get as much air out as possible before sealing . Then you slow-cook the bag + contents in a Sous Vide hot-water bath . Instead of buying an expensive/French Sous Vide cooker , just follow these steps for very similar results : <URL> Note : to get a good finish , after cooking the quail to tender in a Sous Vide bath , you can sear the quail a little bit with a cook 's blow-torch ( for good presentation ) or just pan sear it quickly in a hot pan .
Chicken fat is what you want , and -- this is important -- no cream or milk . Use chicken fat to make a roux , and then chicken stock . This will get you a yellowish colour . For extra bonus points , make your pastry with schmaltz as well . They do this at the gourmet supermarket down the road , and their chicken pot pies fly off the shelves .
If you want to turn your cold butter spreadable quickly , patience is about your only option . You can try microwaving it very briefly , and maybe on the " defrost " setting , but you run a strong risk of melting it too much . If I 'm thinking of the same thing you are , a butter conditioner is really just a unit that allows you to keep your butter in the fridge but still keep it closer to room temp -- so that 's more about storage than turning hard butter into spreadable butter on the spot . A storage option that allows you to keep your butter fresh for a pretty long period , but still leave it out on the counter so it 's soft , is a butter bell . You can look them up online -- many shops have them . It 's basically an inverted cup that sits inside a larger one with a little water at the bottom . The butter is packed into the inverted cup and stays put when you place the cup so the edges are under the water in the other cup . The water keeps air out so the butter stays fresh even at room temperature . You could do the same thing by mashing a bunch of butter into a teacup , then setting it upside down in a saucer full of water . If it 's too hot in your house , though , the butter will slip out of the inverted cup , so I mostly only use our butter bell in the winter . One thing to note about butter itself : Some butters are more spreadable at cooler temperatures . The Irish and French butters we can get here are much closer to spreadable at refrigerator temperatures than the regular US supermarket brands . I 'm not sure what the difference is , though .
I have ( nearly ) no sense of taste and smell , and what sense I do have is heavily distorted . As a result , my senses are non-indicative of dish quality . Nearly every meal I cook is shared with at least one person , though , so I 've had to adapt . I iterate over the same recipe over and over varying the spice mixtures and ratios , and ask for comment every time . I write down said comments with the recipe , and then adjust from there . Usually my recipes stop evolving by the time I 've written iteration # 4-5 ( less for newer recipes , as I can now " play " the flavors by ear ) . When I 'm cooking for people I do n't see often , I use my well-rehearsed recipes . I also select foods where the cooking is more of a science , where it 's hard to mess up the flavor , or where people take a self-seasoning approach ( e.g. baking bread , grilling steak , baking potatoes ) . Edit : Here 's some simple spice trends from my personal recipes . These have been calibrated almost exclusively on Southern U.S. guests : Mild Spanish Paprika ( Pimentón ) is great for grilling and pan-frying pork ( along with the usual suspects like salt and pepper ) . Add 1/person dried bay leaves ( whole ones , not chopped or ground ) and 1/person garlic cloves to your rice when cooking it . Remove them after cooking . Do the same for stews , and really anything that cooks in water ( other than pasta and potatoes ) . Add some granulated garlic ( which is basically powdered garlic without the dust issues ) to nearly everything . It 's quick , mess-free , and I think most people ( at least near me ) harbor a terrible addiction for garlic . Use actual garlic when doing stews , sauces , or you just have the extra time to peel it . Substitute bacon fat for butter when cooking things other than bread and pork . Only thing people are more addicted to than garlic would be bacon . Use both garlic and bacon fat when making mashed potatoes , watch them cry happy tears while they ask for additional helpings . Instead of plain vegetable/frying oil , get a bottle of non-virgin olive oil and a bottle of peanut oil . After cooking with them a few times you 'll get a feel for which is right for each dish ( rule of thumb : higher temperatures means peanut ) . I have yet to find a dish that was n't improved by sprinkling some parsley on top at the very end . It adds color ( specially to anything that does n't have green otherwise ) , and everyone either loves it or is neutral to it .
I 've been reviewing old family recipes , and I 've seen pickled onions called for in some soup , stew , and casserole recipes as an accent ; this may or may not be because my foremothers grew and canned loads of onions . It 's worth an experiment or two , I think !
I do n't endorse beef in the microwave , but that said , the best possible way to cook it is going to be on one of the microwave plates that raise your food off the plate . ( the ones that look like the inside of a george foreman grill ) You are going to have to play with your power settings a bit to achieve a optimium patty . In mine , it 's 2:30 at 40 percent power and 1:30 at full power but depending on wattage , your particular times are going to vary . The trick to having an edible patty come out of the microwave is use low power to achieve the desired temp and then hit it at full power to get the outside done . It will always produce a slimy-er patty than cooking it on a stovetop or in an oven . Make sure that you cover the patty during cooking as it is going to spatter like crazy . You do n't want to clean that mess up . If you have access to a toaster oven , you can cook a patty in that in about 15 minutes and you will have a much closer to delicious product .
I see no reason that a cast iron waffle pan should be treated differently in regards to seasoning than other cast iron . Since it wo n't be cooking anything with significant fat in it naturally , if anything it may be more important ! Seasoning is both for non-stick reason and non-oxidizing reasons . Season it well on your own , then use it with some fat ( of some kind ) very lightly brushed on to keep it well . Only brushing right before use will keep one good likely , but would take a long , long time to naturally season since a large portion of the fat will immediately get used by the food . Cast iron gets gummy if you either 1 ) season with a spray like Pam consistently or 2 ) do n't cook your seasoning long enough and/or high enough . Use a fat , bacon fat , would be great here and season away - properly . In regards to seasoning , I recommend checking out <URL> , as its unneeded to replicate detailed information elsewhere in the site .
You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan , if you have a strong enough exhaust . Oil the cast iron pan ( with canola or such ) , then heat it very hot , until it starts to smoke . Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside ( wipe with a paper towel , water will prevent browning ) and gently place in the pan . Leave it there for a minute or two ( it 'll smoke quite a bit ! ) , rotate 90 ° to get the nice grill marks . Leave for another minute or two . Flip , and repeat for the other side . It may splatter , have a splatter screen handy . It will smoke , quite a bit , make sure the exhaust is on high . You will probably have a medium-rare steak now . Using a thinner cut will make it more well done ( you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef 's knife , making two thin steaks ) ; so will plopping it in the oven ( not sure if you want the oven before or after searing , I like 'em medium rare ... ) . Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving . Also , if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough , you 're probably using the wrong cut of meat , or some terrible grade . What cut are you using ? [ edit : I should note that , in case it was n't obvious , the burner should be up pretty high ] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan . If you are limited in your cookware choice , pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate . If you are using a non-stick pan , you have to go on medium heat and wait longer , else you 'll damage the pan . ( And sorry , but you ca n't get it as tasty as on high heat that way ) .
It 's easiest to skin the deer when it 's still warm , but since that is n't an option let it hang for a day or two , if the weather is n't going to get above around 40 degrees F . If this is your first time , definitely have a helper on hand to help you hold the deer . Have a hacksaw and a sharp knife on hand . A small electric knife/chainsaw is helpful but not necessary . Growing up , this is how we did it : Peel the hide off ( start from top , go to bottom ) . Cut out the tenderloins with your knife . Quarter the deer with the hacksaw and bring the quarters inside individually to cut further . Be sure to look up some more videos/articles , but it 's not too difficult . Have plenty of freezer bags and freezer space on hand . It helps to have a " team " cutting up the quarters ... it 's not hard but it 's a lot of work . Enjoy !
The true aficionado would claim that you actually do n't store cooked pasta , but for those cases where this is n't viable , you have a few options : Pasta that will be cooled and re-heated later , e.g. left overs Drain well , cool , refrigerate . The pasta will stick , but you can dump it in hot salted water foe a bit to re-heat where it will unstick again . Not perfectly al dente , but probably ok . ( Slightly undercooking pasta can mitigate this a bit . ) Pasta that should stay warm , e.g. on a buffet Add a bit of fat ( olive oil , butter ... ) to coat your pasta . Keeps it from sticking . Critics claim that it also keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta . Adding the sauce can have a similar effect , but you risk soggy pasta . Pasta that should stay cold , e.g. pasta salad The only case where rinsing pasta is kind of allowed . Side effect : cool pasta ( well drained after rinsing ) can be mixed even with heat-sensitive dressings right away , avoiding stickiness issues again .
I recommend ( and use ) a <URL> . Not only are they fairly tough and sharp , you can adjust the blade to the depth you need ( you do n't want to cut too deep ) . And the blades are cheap to replace ... As others have noted in the comments , be careful with this as you would with any knife : the blades may be small , but they 're quite sharp .
Sausages are pretty forgiving . As long as you do n't burn them or leave the center raw , they should come out OK . Since they 're pretty fatty ( at least the good ones are ) there 's little chance of drying them out , so when in doubt , cook them a little longer . They 'll feel firm , not squishy , when they 're done . The easiest way to cook raw sausages is in the oven ( at 350-375 ° F , 180-190 ° C or so ) . If you 're doing it on the stove , I 'd brown them first in a little ( very little ) oil , then add some water , or beer , or wine , or whatever you happen to have ( not much - just enough to cover the bottom ) , cover , reduce the heat , and simmer until done . Feel free to cook some vegetables in the pan along with the sausage .
Tomato paste is just tomatoes with the water removed , essentially . I 'd slice the tomatoes in half and roast them ( cut side up ) at 350 degrees F for an hour ( this will concentrate the flavour nicely and you can add s &amp; p/olive oil/herbs/garlic if you want ) . Then mash them through a sieve or food mill to get a smooth consistency . Then put that tomato puree in a pot and just boil them down until it 's as thick as you want . As it gets thicker , you 'll need to stir it regularly to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning .

What should I cover bread dough with while it 's rising ?
The goal is to keep the surface of the bread from drying out . A wet towel works fine but plastic wrap is cheaper and easier than constantly cleaning wet towels . I have used both methods and have n't noticed a difference in the bread produced . In very dry climates , when I made bread with multiple rises I sometimes had to redampen the towel which was an added inconvenience . Lately I have been proofing large batches of bread in a large stock pot and just use the lid of the pot as the only cover .
Unbaked lumps probably mean you are n't mixing it enough . Try starting with a little less flour and knead in more as you go . Another issue is you may not be kneading it enough . Next time try using the <URL> . You do n't have to do this every time , but if you 're having trouble with a specific recipe this will help you figure out how the dough should " feel " when its ready by giving you a visual indicator . I 've found that when I have dough rising problems , it 's usually because I did n't knead long enough . This should also help fix your mixing issue . That being said , there are two good methods to see if dough has risen enough . One is to let it rise in a marked container ( though this does n't work well for shaped loaves or if you are n't supposed to let it double ) . The other is the poke test . From a <URL> : To test for doneness , use the finger test : Poke it with 2 fingers ; it holds the indentation , it 's ready . Generally I poke it and if it pops right back out , it 's not ready . For sourdough , if it holds its shape for a moment and then slowly starts to expand back , it 's perfect . For other breads , holding the indentation is a good indicator . This is n't necessarily advisable for delicate doughs . If you 're working with a delicate dough , try the test on one loaf that you do n't " need " to be perfect . You can use this as a relative time measurement for the future .
As eggs are a very versatile ingredient : when substituting , it is important to determine whether the eggs are being used as a leavening agent or binder ( or both ) . In recipes where the egg is used primarily as a leavening agent , I have used a mixture of baking powder ( not soda ) , water , and vegetable oil in a 2:3:3 ratio , though you may want to experiment with the proportions depending upon your recipe . You may also need to vary the amount of other liquid in the recipe . Where the egg is used primarily as a binder , you could use banana , applesauce , or gelatin , depending upon the recipe ( obviously , you 'll probably want to avoid the fruits in a savory recipe ) . I 've used , and been thoroughly disappointed with , the available commercial " egg replacers " and do n't recommend them for any purpose . I 've heard of using flax , but have no personal experience with it . However : as the father of ( and resident chef for ) a young child with egg and milk allergy , it is my experience that successfully substituting for eggs is very difficult . For breads in particular , I do n't even bother with recipes that call for eggs or milk , and favor those that use the basic 3 ( 4 ) : flour , water , yeast ( salt ) .
The original Buffalo Wings are made with <URL> . The original recipe is simply equal parts melted butter and hot sauce . However , you truly can use just about whatever hot sauce you want in even greater ratios if you want more kick . There are also some distributors that specialize in spicy wing sauces . I recommend <URL> if you are adventurous and enjoy a very nice kick of heat .
Time is n't the main factor , gluten development is . You should knead the dough until the gluten is sufficiently developed to give the dough elasticity , and the final bread good structure . There are two simple tests you can perform to check whether your dough is kneaded sufficiently . First , the Poke Test . Form the dough into a ball , and with a floured finger , give it a light poke . If it springs back to its original shape , you 're on the right track . Secondly , you can do the Windowpane Test . Grab off a chunk of dough , then try and stretch it apart . If the gluten is sufficiently developed , the dough should n't tear - it should stretch to a point where you can see light through it , hence the name .
It causes the pepper to steam a bit , making it easier to remove the charred skin . ( resting might also be a factor ... I 've never done a side-by-side comparison of covered vs. uncovered )
The quickest way to get rid of leftover wine is to think of it as flavoured water . In many if not most recipes that call for water - especially stovetop recipes like sauces and stews - you can simply substitute wine for the water or stock that the recipe normally calls for . We actually had a similar question recently : <URL> and I 'd recommend you take a look at that , as many of the points there apply equally well to wine . Probably the best summation was in <URL> : I 'd consider stock to be just another flavorful liquid ( thanks Alton Brown ) , to be usable in exchange for others like wine , etc. . You need to be conscious of the gelatin aspect and mindful that some substitutions will be more successful than others , flavor-wise , but it 's always worth considering if stock might be a good substitute for any other flavorful liquid . Just swap the terms " stock " and " wine " and you 're good to go . Even though wine does n't contain any gelatin , you actually do need to be mindful of the gelatin aspect when substituting wine for stock , because you might have the opposite problem if the liquid is supposed to thicken . Similarly to stock , I also would n't recommend using wine in anything that you plan to refrigerate or freeze for a long period , for a different reason obviously - because it can go sour over time . So try to only use it in recipes that will be consumed in the near future . Other than that , just experiment ; whenever you 're making a savoury recipe that calls for water or stock , try using some wine instead . You 'd be surprised at how much character it can add to otherwise simple dishes . Some examples of places where you can replace some other liquid with wine : Rice or risotto Soups and sauces Deglazing a pan ( for a pan sauce ) Salad dressings ( this is an especially good use for sour/fermented wine ) Marinades Poaching liquids ( for eggs , chicken , etc. ) There really are no rules , and any time you find yourself tossing plain water into a pot or bowl , you should keep in mind that you are potentially missing an opportunity to add flavour ( which a good wine will add plenty of ) .
It is because of the way starch retrogrades . It does so in stages . The first stage needs between 1 and 2 hours , the second one a few days . You have probably seen it more clearly in starch-thickened puddings : they thicken a bit on stovetop , but are only ready to unmold after a few hours , else they wuold n't keep their shape . In a bread , the starch granules are the same way : right after baking , they contain too much moisture . Sure , if you eat the bread right away , the aroma is very good . But the texture is problematic . It gets doughy and dense at the smallest amount of pressure . Tearing instead of cutting helps a bit . And if you are at home , eating with your family , go for it and eat the tasty still-hot bread . It is especially good with soft , low-gluten breads made with AP flour with the least amount of bran ( 50 % milling grade or even less ) , my grandma would say that they " melt in the mouth " when they are hot . But if you serve bread slices to guests , or want to spread something on the bread , wait for its starch to set . On a side note , the second stage of starch retrogradation is the reason why you should use day-old bread for crumbs for thickening , and the third stage is the one which makes bread inedible . But this goes too far away from the original question .
Bread Improver is a mix of various acids and enzymes that serve to strengthen the gluten in the flour and feed the yeast , both of which yield a better loaf . The idea is to give bread a similar texture and taste to sourdough-based loaves , without having to go through the laborious feeding process usually involved with that method . For more information , look at this <URL> article .
So I waited about 3 weeks because I was on vacation since I put my loaf in the freezer . Some notes on the dough structure The dough was fully proofed , but that meant that the structure very much resembled a cracker . It would be stiff until you broke into it , at which point it would break &amp; collapse into itself irreparably <URL> The dough was frozen into the container , so I waited about 1.5 hours for it to thaw out . That meant that the core of the dough was frozen while the outside was thawed <URL> Fortunately , the thawed dough was still just as moist as it had been went into the freezer I could not score the loaf because the interior was too frozen . The loaf therefore came out without any perforations in the top . This , along with the frozen interior , likely severely limited oven spring . I expected the non-frozen version of this loaf to have double the volume . <URL> The flavor is pretty bland , unfortunately . Overall , would not recommend unless in an emergency !
I can think of a few things , but I 'm not sure how well they 'd work for water bottles , specifically , as I do n't know what the temperature of the liquid is how long it needs to function as a container , and how long it needs to be on the shelf before use . ( and what liquid you 're using , so it does n't make things taste really foul ) . If we 're just using water , I 'd be inclined to use : Nut butters : ( eg , peanut butter ) The high oil content will repel water . Of course , if it 's being held for long times , you 'll have issues with rancidity . And it does n't really harden up at room temperature . Chocolate : so long as it 's not a hot liquid , it 'll resist water for quite a while . This is one case where ' coating chocolate ' may be better than real chocolate as it 's got a higher melting point . I personally would n't use honey as it 's water-soluble , and will start disolving into even a cold liquid .
I think you will get the ' best result ' out of ' par baking ' your rolls . I have done this myself , though not for shipping . It is simply easier to make a large batch and then store them for use as needed . IMHO rolls are best served hot and fresh , and while re-heating fully baked rolls can recapture some of the glory that is fresh baked bread , allowing your customers to finish bake a partially baked product will give them the convenience of truly fresh rolls on demand . The technique ( and recipe , for my part ) I picked up from Alton Brown , in the episode of Good Eats : <URL> . Alton 's recipe for <URL> includes a par baking option : For Brown and Serve option : Assemble rolls as above , but bake as follows . Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake until the outside of the rolls just begin to set but have not browned and the internal temperature is 185 degrees , about 30 minutes . Remove and cool on the pan for 10 minutes . After 10 minutes , remove the rolls from the pan and place on a cooling rack until they are room temperature , 30 to 40 minutes . Place the rolls in bags and freeze for up to 3 months . To Finish : Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thaw the rolls for 60 to 90 minutes . Spray a sheet pan with nonstick spray . Place the rolls on the prepared sheet pan and bake until the rolls reach an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. Rotate the pan halfway through baking , 10 to 12 minutes . Remove the pan to a cooling rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving . The key ' take-aways ' that you will want to apply are : Bake to internal temp of 185 ° F Cool to Room Temp Freeze for up to 3 months
Based on experience and experimentation alone ( I bake bread several times a week ) , I 'd say to be consistently safe you probably want to max out around 3 % in baker 's percentages . 2-2 .5 % is much more common , but I 've done as much as 3 % . After 3 % , things got very inconsistent . Sometimes it would work if the structure was just right , but mostly I got loaves that did n't rise well . If I did my math and conversions to weight right , it looks like you 're probably in the 2 % range , so you should be able to add about 50 % more salt . EDIT : It must be higher , but I 'm not sure how high . Bread Baker 's Apprentice as a 4.2 % Poolish Focaccia and other others in that range . BBA seems to max out in the low 4 's .
If you do most of the kneading while the dough is very wet ( like Jeff Varasano recommends for his pizza dough here <URL> ) , you should be able to do most of it with even a comparatively weak hand mixer and not have too much trouble holding it steady enough ( see link - gluten IS working even though the dough is still only slightly more dry than a batter ) . That said , if you try to work with a drier dough , even if your motor can handle it ( which it likely ca n't ) , it will probably be more difficult to hold the mixer than to just knead the dough by hand .
An0r4k , I assume that you 're making a cup of black ( ? ) tea and steeping some lemongrass in it . If so , perhaps you should make the black tea very weak as its tannins might be amplifying the ( pleasant ) slight bitterness of the lemongrass to distasteful levels . Alternatively , if you are steeping the lemongrass in hot water , try removing the outer layers of the lemongrass stalk . If they are old or tough , this can increase the bitterness of the drink . In any case , check that there is n't any dirt trapped between the layers of the lemongrass . Some recipies call for putting the lemongrass into water , bringing it to a boil and then letting it simmer for 10-15 minutes . I have n't tried this . Even if it does produce a smoother taste , then the boiling might well degradge any health-giving nutrients from the lemongrass .
No , you do n't have to freeze it at all . The recipe you linked is indeed for puff pastry . It is rather tedious to create it , so it is available in supermarkets as a pre-fabricated food , just like pizza dough and other doughs . But it does n't have a long shelf life in the fridge , so it is sold frozen . The recipe assumes that you will buy it frozen , and warns you to let it come to room temperature before you start baking . If you are making your own , the end product can be used in cookies immediately . Just pay attention to follow proper technique and work with a very cold dough and butter while making the puff pastry . The link you posted probably explains it - if not , search for better instructions .
Ok , first of all make sure you are getting French or Italian truffles , not Chinese or Oregon . Some people like the latter but they are quite a bit different . Black truffles do well cooked , while white truffles are usually only used shaved raw over a dish . When I use them , I like to use them in a situation where I will really be able to taste them . A few classic ideas are an omelette , risotto , or pasta with a cream sauce . Those all carry the flavor and aroma of truffles very well . Chop some of it very fine and put it in the dish and then slice the rest paper thin ( with a mandoline if possible ) over the finished food right before serving .
You could use them , together with the core , to make apple-glaze ( for your pie ) . Cover everything with water , simmer about 30 min , strain , simmer until you reach the desired density .
My first thoughts are this which is actually a scraper but I would n't use a metal scraper in a bowl . Being flexible plastic , it flexes and molds itself to the inside of a bowl and allows easy removal of dough .
The purpose of all kneading techniques is the same : as @rumtscho wrote , to stretch and align strands of gluten . The traditional kneading method is to fold the mass of dough on itself , press it together with the palm of the hand , turn , and repeat . With very high hydration doughs this is impossible because the dough will hopelessly adhere to the hands . The technique is , therefore , modified to reduce hand contact with the dough as much as possible . A dough scraper is used to gather and fold the dough which is laid over on itself instead of being pressed . The result is the same as normal kneading but only the fingertips come in contact with the dough . After just a few turns the gluten sheets will align and the dough will still be tender but much less sticky . As for why it seems more effective I can only conjecture . Gluten forms in the presence of water . Higher hydration doughs allow for faster gluten development . It is not that the folding is more effective but that kneading very wet doughs progresses faster .

How long do eggs last outside the refrigerator and out of the shell ?
One day on the counter at room temperature is approximately equivalent to a week in the refrigerator . When I used eggs at a rapid rate , baking every day , I always kept them on the counter , since they would not have to be brought to room temperature to beat easily to the ribbon or whatever . They should be good in the refrigerator for several weeks past their sell by date , or on the counter for several days . 6 hours is fine . ( All of the above is assuming they are in their shells , uncracked ... ) Out of the shell , eggs are highly perishable -- what the health codes call a " potentially hazardous " food . Do n't hold them for any length of time at room temperature . I would say no more than 30 minutes to an hour , less if you can . <URL> , but they do insist that the eggs are refrigerated .
I 've done it before without problems . Even if they 're peanut butter &amp; jelly ( something that 's typically stored in the fridge ) , it has so much sugar in it that it 's inhospitable to microbes . If you want to play it extra safe , and the sandiwiches wo n't be easten shortly after you leave , you could place them in the freezer and then let them thaw in your bag . ... all that being said , if you 're in the US , the TSA considers peanut butter to be a gel , so wo n't let you fly with a container of it . I have no idea what their rules are in sandwich form . ( I 've never tried it , as I typically fly w / cold cut sandwiches , and just take them straight from the fridge before I go ) .
According to <URL> , cream cheese , opened should last about two weeks between 32 ' f and 40 ' f. For the cheese itself , unopened , they recommend to " Use within one week of the ' best when purchased by ' date " . Unfortunately , in this situation , you can not simply cut away the mold from the cheese since it is a mixed dish . When you factor in the fact that the cheese was not only unwrapped , but heated along with other components , and likely sat out for some time on the counter in addition to in the pan , with added protein ( the black beans especially ) , the math for how long cream cheese can last in your fridge shrinks and shrinks . Personally , I would follow the cooked meat guidelines to be on the safe side . This means that well-wrapped leftovers , quickly taken out of the danger zone range of temps ( <URL> ) , should last for 3-4 days after cooking .
No more than 72 hours , maximum . You do n't know how long they 've been out of the water . I would freeze or cook them no later than tomorrow evening .
Your fridge speeds production of polyphenols , which speeds the blackening process . Unrefrigerated bananas ripen by ethylene gas which will also eventually turn them black , but the cold short circuits that process .
General comments on the shelf - , fridge - , and freezer-life of foods The shelf-life is the amount of time a food can be stored before it is considered unsuitable for use . It may be unsuitable due to quality degradation ( no longer tasty ) or food safety ( risk of food poisoning ) . [ <URL> ] As far as food safety goes , food stored frozen at 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) or below is remains safe forever ; only quality degrades over time . [ <URL> ] . Thus the freezer-storage times below are entirely about quality . If your freezer is set at a temperature higher than -18 ° C ( three-star setting ) , these times may not apply . Especially the safe storage time in one-star freezers ( -6 ° C ) is much reduced . The times all assume proper storage . Freezers 0 ° F or below , refrigerators 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) or below . [ <URL> ] Cans should be stored in a cool , dry place , below 85 ° F ( 30 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The tables given here assume proper storage . Food which requires refrigeration is considered unsafe if left for over two hours at temperatures between 41 -- 135 ° F ( 5 -- 57 ° C ) [ <URL> ] . The Tables Regardless of the table below , if a food shows signs of spoilage ( including mold , with some exceptions described below ) , its past its shelf-life . Note that the lack of spoilage does not imply safety . Uncooked Proteins Cooked proteins Dairy Sauces For home-made mayo , there do n't seem to be official shelf-life estimates . Seasoned Advice has a question on this , <URL> . Vegetables Freezer times are given for cooked or blanched , then frozen . Generally , this is required , otherwise enzymatic degradation will occur . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each vegetable . Refrigerator and shelf times are for storage raw . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . Fruits Many fruits must be at least partially cooked ( blanched ) before freezing in order to deactivate enzymes that would otherwise degrade quality while in storage . Some are best frozen packed in acid ( lemon juice or citric acid ) and/or syrup . See " Where can I go for details on a specific food ? " for where to find specific steps for each fruit . If a column is , it means that storage type is not recommended . " Ripe " means " until ripe " . * : bananas stored in the fridge will blacken . This is not a sign of spoilage , and they can be eaten safely . Cooked dishes Generally 3 -- 4 days in the fridge . This includes pizza , soups , stews , casseroles , pies , and quiche [ KC ] . Some salads get a fifth day [ CFG ] . Freezer time is generally under three months . Infused oils Putting any plant matter in oil ( such as garlic , chillies or herbs ) creates the danger for botulism , a rare but fatal disease . Thus infused oils are not shelf-stable . They can be kept in the refrigerator for 3-5 days , discard them earlier if you see cloudiness or gas bubbles . Or buy commercially produced infused oils , they have been treated with industrial methods to kill the botulinum spores . Shelf-stable until opened Pantry ( not refrigerated even after opening ) General tips for storing foods How do I freeze fruits and vegetables ? Fruit . Ripe ( but not overripe ) fruit should be used . Wash them , and sort according to size . Working in small batches , remove pits , seeds , and blemishes . For fruits that turn brown , apply ascorbic acid or sugar and citric acid . Most fruits benefit from packing in dry sugar or a sugar syrup . Small , whole fruits ( e.g. , berries ) can be spread on a tray and individually frozen , then packed in a freezer bag or other airtight container . Vegetables . Most vegetables need blanching . To blanch , immerse in boiling water over high heat or steam over rapidly boiling water ( steam ) . After blanching , transfer to ice bath for the same amount of time as blanched . Drain and dry . Freeze either by packing in a freezer bag with as much air as possible removed , or by allowing to freeze on a tray , then putting in a bag or other container . General guideline is 8 -- 12 months for best quality . The above is a very quick summary of Iowa State University 's <URL> . The five-page document includes full details on over forty fruits and vegetables . Feel free to ask here on Seasoned Advice if that guide does n't answer your question . What about mold ? Some foods are expected to have mold in them ( e.g. , P. roqueforti in Roquefort cheese ) . Unexpected mold , however , is something to be concerned about . Mold can grow even on refrigerated foods , and even those high enough in salt or sugar to deter bacteria . Some molds produce mycotoxins . Mold growth can be minimized by cleaning the refrigerator every few months ( use a mixture of 1 tablespoon of baking soda per quart of water , then rinse with plain water , then dry ) , by keeping dishcloths , sponges , mops , etc. clean and fresh-smelling ; and keeping indoor humidity levels under 40 % . In general , the visible surface mold on a food is only a small part of the actual mold growth . For most foods , any visible unexpected mold grow
Two things control the " sharpness " of onions : variety and age . While certain varieties of onions are sharper than others ( i.e. Reds , walla-walls and vidalias are sweeter ) , any onion which has been in storage too long is going to be sulphurous and sharp-tasting . Since it 's January now , that 's going to be pretty much all onions . Since onion sharpness comes from sulphur compounds ( as I understand it ) , the best way to sweeten onions is to release some of them ahead of using the onion . The best way to do that is : Slice the onion thinly , crossways ( parallel to its equator rather than pole-to-pole ) . Place the sliced onion in a wide bowl , uncovered or very loosely covered , in the fridge or other cold place for at least an hour and up to a day . Additionally , either vinegar or salt -- or both -- will help accelerate removing sharpness from onion . For example , for a New Year 's Eve appetizer this year I sliced a red onion in to rings , tossed it with 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp red wine vinegar , and left it in an open bowl on the 45F porch for 5 hours . The result was intensely sweet red onion which could then be used as a canape topping . If you 're in a hurry , though , the only way to make the onion less sharp is to cook it .
<URL> He writes it better than I can , so I 'll just quote him . I 've used the second method he describes , but after watching the video below , the other looks much easier ... The breast halves should each have a flap of meat called the chicken tenderloin ( or chicken tenders or strips ) . Lifting the tenderloin should reveal a white tendon . I recommend two ways to trim off this tough tendon . The most popular method is to grab the tendon with your fingers and pull on it while scraping with your knife to release the tendon from the breast . Continue to lift and scrape until the tendon is completely removed . Alternatively , you can use a sharp boning knife and slice along both sides of the tendon ( without slicing through the tendon ) . Then lift any part of the tendon that has been separated from the breast and use your boning knife the cut any parts where the tendon has not cleanly separated from the meat . <URL>
Sifting and whisking are not the same thing . Sifting breaks up lumps in dry powder ingredients , mixed powdered ingredients , and makes the flour less dense . Some people would say sifting makes flour " airier " . I measured the volume of flour before and after sifting and I found a significant increase in volume for the same weight of flour post-sifting . Sift flour when making light sponges , or if your flour has gotten densely packed over time . Whisking is just a way of quickly mixing dry ingredients together , it does n't break up lumps like sifting or mix things as effectively as sifting , but for many recipes it does n't matter .
First off , pretty much everything stored in a properly cold freezer ( 0 ° F / -18 ° C ) will be safe to eat forever . The flavor will eventually go , e.g. , by getting <URL> and also by enzymatic degradation ( if not blanched ) . How long this will take depends on exactly how you 've stored them . In general , airtight packaging with no air inside seems to be best . For example , vacuum-sealed thick bags work well . Cheap , thin plastic " storage " bags do n't work well . You can get around <URL> . Colorodo State believes you can get <URL> . edit : It also occurs to me that it matters what freezer you 're using . The one on my fridge , for example , has fairly large temperature swings ( yet mostly stays below 0 ° F ) and automatic defrost , it freezer burns things much quicker than my chest freezer ( which has a temperature variance of maybe 2 ° F , staying in the -3 ° to -1 ° F range )
By maximising first the flavour of every single nut and then maximising the surface : Gently roast the cashews , then grind them finely . If the resulting " gritty " texture is not to your taste , grind them further until you get a nut butter , which should dissolve nicely especially in cream-type soups .
Someone made an instructable on how to make what they call a Japanese Golden Egg ( although a search for that just gave me lots of hits on Angry Birds ) ; they spin the egg quickly , breaking up the internal structure , and then boil it to get a scrambled-egg-colored boiled egg . <URL>
I 'll assume that you 're talking about pure maple syrup in a glass container ; if it 's that adulterated pancake syrup then it 's probably riddled with preservatives , so any advice here does n't apply . Pure maple syrup can and will grow mold on the surface if left in a cupboard . There are <URL> of this happening , and although several of those people say that it 's OK to simply strain the mold and re-boil the maple syrup , ( a ) I would n't chance it , and ( b ) that process is hardly any more convenient than simply taking it out of the refrigerator a half-hour earlier and letting it come up to room temperature . Maple syrup should be stored in the refrigerator . It does n't have to be , and it will probably take at least a year for it to grow any mold if left in the pantry . But it will last longer in the refrigerator ; I 've seen refrigerated jars 3 + years old without any mold .
The crisper provides a somewhat enclosed environment , which prevents moisture from escaping as rapidly . Vegetables keep best at a certain humidity , higher than that typically found in the rest of the fridge , but not so high that condensation starts accumulating on them . Vegetables kept in too-dry air in the rest of the fridge will tend to dry out and shrivel up faster ; those kept in the crisper will retain their water and texture better , keeping them crisp . Leafy vegetables are also much more prone to drying out , since they have much more surface area , while hardier vegetables with a decent skin on them ( like bell peppers ) do n't dry out nearly as quickly . Fruits benefit somewhat from this as well , but do n't generally need as high a humidity as vegetables . Some crisper drawers have little sliders on them which vary the size of the opening to the rest of the fridge , letting you vary the amount of circulation and therefore the humidity ; you can adjust this to suit what you tend to store in the drawer . If you have two crisper drawers , both adjustable , then it might be a good idea to put fruit and hardier vegetables in one , and more vulnerable vegetables in the other .
When I have mixed thoroughly I then put it in mason jars with lids and keep it in fridge for about 1 and 1/2 weeks . I have not found the tomatoes to get mushy at all . When I take a jar from fridge , I have to break seal as it does tend to seal when we put cap and seal back on . I hope this helps ! ( In case it 's relevant , mine contains tomatoes , red onion , lime juice , cilantro , jalapeños , peperoncini , salt , and pepper . )
If it 's raw , stick with the best-before date on the label . If cooked , you have at least <URL> , regardless of whether it 's pork , veal , or regular beef .
Any number of things can go wrong . Is your flesh cut correctly , that is , against the grain ? Hint : if you see a string , it 's cut with the grain and will affect tenderness . Has your flesh properly aged ? Enzymes in the meat dissolve the tissue , making it naturally tender . 21 Days is recommended . You marinade too long . 15-30 minutes is <URL> for your cuts . You cook the meat too long . A thin slice should be fried on high heat for a short time . Restaurants get better meat . Fact of life . Edit : Basic sauté method . Heat the pan . The pan is hot when a drop of water becomes steam instantly . Add some oil and heat it . It should become very hot very quick . Look for wrinkles on the surface . Add the meat . When you see a drop of ' blood ' ( that 's plasma ) flip the meat . Retire the meat . [ Optional ] Add cold liquid to pan ( could be the marinade ) , clean the bottom of the pan . Lower the heat and make a pan sauce . Add the meat to the sauce for a minute and serve .
Getting the Vanilla from the bean to the taste bud takes time . While many will advocate the use of fresh vanilla beans ( as you have tried ) , I have always preferred the flavor that is granted from a good vanilla extract . In my opinion it is stronger and better distributed throughout the dish . Whether you buy or <URL> I think you will get a more consistent and rich flavor that way . ( note : thanks to @rfusca for providing the extract link in a <URL> )
Salt or acid is often added to the water when boiling eggs to denature egg whites faster should there be a crack and a leak . I have not read anything that experiments whether this is effective . It also sounds like " do n't wash mushrooms " or " pasta must be cooked in a ton of water " kind of old wives tales .
Yes , it will " make it last longer in the fridge " for a certain definition of " last longer " : it will not mould nor infect other foodstuffs in the fridge if it does n't come into direct contact with any of them . Is it still safe to eat after a few of these re-heatings ? Very probably not ! Elaboration : More then half of the number of cells in your body are actually bacteria ; bacteria do n't generally kill you but the toxins they release is what kills you . E.g. Botulinum Toxinum D ( one of the toxins released during Botulism ) has an LD50 of 0.4 ng/kg , which means that you need about 500g ( a pound ) to kill 99.9 % of all human beings on the entire planet ... ( And that is for just a few re-heatings ; for " nearly indefinitely " we need to bring extremophiles in the equation ... ) <URL>

How do I quickly get okra to stop being goopy ?
The best way that I have found to cook okra , and prevent it from being slimy is to avoid cooking it with moisture . If you dredge it in seasoned cornmeal , then pan fry it , you get none of the slime that is common to okra . I have n't done any tests to verify if a quick fry would then prevent it from developing slime if you then add liquid , however . If you 're trying to add the okra to a soup or a sauce , you might still need to spend some time cooking it to break down the slime .
If the ice cream mix is setting up but tending to leave a buttery coating in your mouth the best thing would be to try cutting back on the cream and replacing it with whole milk or half &amp; half . If it 's a recipe that you 've used in another machine with great success but it does n't seem to in this one , it 's probably a case of how long the frozen bowl is staying cold . I have used the freezer bowl ice cream attachment for KitchenAid machines and have been frustrated more times than not as it does n't freeze up as it should . Too much sugar can also be a culprit in the mix not freezing quick enough . Sugar does n't freeze so a really sweet mix is going to be softer . You might try decreasing sugar content slightly ... not too much or you will end up with an icier result ( If adding fruit to ice cream , combine the chopped fruit with some sugar and cook just a little to allow the sugar to dissolve and the moisture to evaporate . The sugar soaking into the fruit will keep the fruit softer in the ice cream instead of forming icy chunks of fruit . Or , just mix in fruit preserves . ) Make sure that the mix is VERY cold , ideally chilled for several hours or overnight before it goes into the the freezer . If time is n't on your side , then quick-chill it in a metal bowl or container in an ice bath and stir frequently to help chill it throughout . The primary indicator for most ice cream freezers is that the dasher starts to sound labored in its attempt to stir the mix . Or if cranking by hand , you start to sound labored in your attempt to crank it ! Another factor that can affect freezing of ice cream ( although probably not the case in your instance since you do n't have control of the speed ) is the speed of the machine . In the case of the KitchenAid insulated bowl for freezing ice cream , they warn not to go faster than " stir " or the mix wo n't have a chance to freeze to the side of the bowl before the dasher scrapes it . I would try one of their recipes with it to see if it freezes up firm enough without turning to butter and then compare differences between your current recipe and theirs , adjusting sugar , milk to heavy cream ratio , etc. .
Things to try Rice should still be warm Handle rice gently , do n't squeeze it Does it fall apart because it is sticking to your hands ? If so : Use warm salt water on your hands ( not dripping wet hands though ) Rinse the rice more before cooking to remove excess surface starches . The process is : Rinse in bowl of water , gently tumble , let stand 20 minutes , change water . Repeat until rinse water runs clear If this still fails to solve this sticky issue , you can use cling film ( plastic wrap ) as a guide and release agent on your hands . Peel the plastic off as you wrap the nori on
I use a liquid oil instead of a spray oil ; you 're far more likely to get hot spots with a spray , which is bad for any kind of cooking . That stuff works better as a grease than an actual cooking oil . I also tend to have pretty good success by frying the tortillas up to just a hint of golden-brown ( dark brown spots is overdone ) and then finishing it off ( i.e. to melt the cheese ) in a low-heat oven . As an added benefit , if you 're making a largish batch then that makes it easy to keep them warm until they 're all ready to serve . YMMV , but I find this to be the case for a whole lot of stovetop cooking ; with the direct heat , it 's very easy to dry foods out before they 're cooked to the stage you want . It 's far easier to control the heat in an oven and just use the stove for an initial ( or final ) fry/sear .
Making Mozzarella is not fantastically difficult , but certain things during the process are critical , probably the most important is temperature . If it 's your first time making cheese , you might find the buying a ' starter kit ' the easiest way to get up and running . These will provide you with all the important items you needm such as rennet . If you feel brave , then you forego the kit and dive right in . For Mozzarella try to find Buffalo milk , which is what ' proper ' Mozzarella is made from . It 's lower in cholesterol than cows milk , has more protein and makes a much richer cheese . If you ca n't get Buffalo milk use the best full fat , non-homogenized milk you can find . Here 's a recipe I 've used before <URL> Here 's a link with the differences between Buffalo milk and cows milk <URL> Whilst it 's quite possible to make virtually any variety of cheese at home , some cheeses , such as blue cheese , require a place to develop at the correct temperature and for quite long periods of time . ideally , this would be a temperature around 10c with a humidity around 70 % and a time for maturing at around 2 to 3 months . Here 's a good place to start : <URL>
Yeast action is only one factor in getting a rise when baking . Yeast metabolizes sugars and produces CO2 bubbles which puff up your dough , and also help with gluten development to make your dough stretchy . However , when you bake your dough much of the lift you get is from the expansion of water turning into steam - this is what makes pizza dough puff up a bit when baked and gives you that texture . Water is also important in gluten development when your dough is proofing , without enough water you wo n't get an elastic dough with good crumb . My thinking is that your dough is too dry , so add more water to your dough . Stick to the amounts of flour and water in a trusted recipe and knead with oil instead of flour . After kneading your dough should be fairly loose and just a bit sticky , and you should be able to stretch it quite a bit without breaking . Regarding oven temperatures you do n't need the fires of hades to make a good pizza - the most important things for a good pizza is a good base , sauce , and quality ingredients . Crank your oven up as high as it will go and use a pizza stone ( make sure to heat it up for at least 30 minutes ) and you 'll get a good result .

Firstly consider a lower temprature but do start with a very hot pan , and turn down the heat and make sure you baste your fish correctly ; cook skin side for a longer time , untill you have the desired colour . Add your butter and let it foam , and only then turn your fish . Once you have turned your fish you can take your pan off the heat . Start basting with foamy butter . For plaice , It should be done in under 1 minute . If your not serving straight away remove from pan for hot holding . If you keep to do this method , its hard to end up with a dry fish .
Is n't that normal ? I suppose if it 's causing a problem , you could use a non-stick ( teflon , etc. ) muffin pan , without the paper liners . You could also try silicone-coated ( parchment ) liners . A quick check reveals that e.g. , Amazon sells them . < purist > cornbread shall be cooked in preheated cast iron , and if that 's sticking , you need to <URL> . < / purist >
You are n't going to be able to get a sourdough starter from flour to ready-to-bake in 24 hours . You could easily make a poolish or pâte fermentée in that time , and get some of the flavor . You might also be able to use some yogurt whey or another source of lactic acid to get some of the sour flavor . Unfortunately , a sour starter is something that you kind of need to keep going and have on hand .
Toasted nuts keep their flavor pretty well , the way to keep them is the same way you 'd buy them at the store , ie a sealed container . What you get from freshly toasting nuts is more aromatics than flavors . Most of the aromatics go pretty quick so there 's no preserving them , it 's use 'em or lose 'em . Could you substitute pre-toasted nuts ? Sure , it wo n't be quite the same , but it will be close .
Moisten your hands with a clean , damp towel . This helps the rice not stick . Look at any sushi bar ; the chef will be frequently moistening their hands on such a towel .
From <URL> published by the United States Department of Agriculture : Is Frozen Food Safe ? Food stored constantly at 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) will always be safe . Only the quality suffers with lengthy freezer storage . Freezing keeps food safe by slowing the movement of molecules , causing microbes to enter a dormant stage . Freezing preserves food for extended periods because it prevents the growth of microorganisms that cause both food spoilage and foodborne illness . Does Freezing Destroy Bacteria &amp; Parasites ? Freezing to 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) inactivates any microbes -- bacteria , yeasts and molds -- present in food . Once thawed , however , these microbes can again become active , multiplying under the right conditions to levels that can lead to foodborne illness . Since they will then grow at about the same rate as microorganisms on fresh food , you must handle thawed items as you would any perishable food . Trichina and other parasites can be destroyed by sub-zero freezing temperatures . However , very strict government-supervised conditions must be met . Home freezing can not be relied upon to destroy trichina . Thorough cooking , however , will destroy all parasites . Freshness &amp; Quality Freshness and quality at the time of freezing affect the condition of frozen foods . If frozen at peak quality , thawed foods emerge tasting better than foods frozen near the end of their useful life . So freeze items you wo n't use quickly sooner rather than later . Store all foods at 0 ° F ( -18 ° C ) or lower to retain vitamin content , color ,
You can not make good hummus from canned chickpeas , you should make it from fresh dried beans The beans need plenty of soaking and rinsing When cooking , add one tsp of baking soda per cup of beans . Baking soda chemically softens the bean proteins . Never add salt or other flavourings during the bean cooking stage Traditional hummus is somewhat coarse , but very soft ( due to baking soda ) . It is made with a minimal amount of olive oil , but drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkle of cooked , and still warm chick peas when served Restaurant hummus is often just over processed junk made in a factory with a commercial grinder ( like a peanut butter grinder ) Also , see <URL> if your chickpeas never go soft
I have to make both mayonnaise and aioli every day at my job . We sometimes do R&amp;D on off days and we spent quite some time trying to imitate our favorite gourmet mayonnaise . I think that we were successful , here are some tips : Lemon juice comes closer to that crisp tartness that I taste in even cheaper mayonnaise . Try using the juice from lemons , limes , or both and see where that gets you . The store bought brands do n't taste like mustard , but let me emphasize that mustard is vital to getting you closer to that taste . There is a specific " tang " to store bought mayonnaise that does n't come from the acid -- you can get very close to this tang with mustard . I use a good quality dijon when I make mayonnaise and the difference is noticeable . Keep adding dijon in small amounts and observe the change in taste . I end up 2 - 3 tablespoons to my batch . Experiment with fresh garlic and/or garlic and onion powders . Try adding white pepper instead of black pepper and see where that gets you . I add a little water at the end . I find that it tones down some of the intensity of the acid and dijon . Also , you do n't have to add your acid in the beginning . In fact , I almost always add mine after the initial " setting " of the emulsification . It is easier to control the thickness and flavor of my mayo ; I use my acid for my first thinning and then add oil to adjust from there .
If you are speaking of a salmon filet , you must remove the pin bones one by one . The easiest way to do it is with tweezers or needle nosed pliers . This <URL> demonstrates the technique : Run the back of your knife across the line where the bones are , from tail to head , to make them pop out more . Pull each bone , on an angle towards the head of the fish
What you need is to deflect the heat from the top of your pie . If you have two racks in your oven , and can position them so that the pie is in the middle with a rack above it , place a piece of aluminum foil directly above the pie . Another option would be to set a piece of foil on top of the pie after it has partially baked . Either way will protect the top from direct heat , allowing the ambient heat to penetrate and bake the whole pie .
Put the meat in a sealed plastic bag , place in a bowl in the sink , fill with cold tapwater , then set the tap running in a thin stream with the water overflowing the sides of the bowl . The moving water will safely thaw the meat through convection . Make sure you get as much air out of the plastic bag as you can . You might need to put some weight on it in the bowl to keep it submerged in the water .
Indian curry traditionally has - in addition to the ginger , turmeric , cumin and chili ( I assume you mean chili powder ) that you used - a generous amount of garam masala , coriander powder , and garlic . Sometimes you 'll see " curry powder " used in recipes instead of garam masala ; they are similar but not exactly the same . Either one of these would be fine , and arguably the most important missing ingredient here . I 'm not even sure you could legitimately call it a curry without one of the above . Depending on your spice tolerance , you might need to add more chili powder as well . Note that most spices in a curry will need to be heated before they 'll really release their aromas ( and therefore flavour ) , so you ca n't just add them cold , and I definitely do n't think you 'd want the taste of raw garlic/ginger in your curry , even if it is presently tasteless . Give it a good simmer after adding some garlic ( powder is fine ) and garam masala or curry powder and you might be able to salvage it . Or you could try heating the new spices dry , for a very short time , to give them a bit of a head start aroma-wise ; just be very careful not to burn them .
There are lots of recipes for oven - " fried " sweet potato chips ( crisps ) and fries ( chips ) and I 'll let you search that part . I 've noticed a wide variation in recommended oven temperatures , from as low as 350 to as high as 450 . Though I 've never had great success with crispiness , my overall best results were with a temp of 425 . Crispiness with sweet potatoes is notoriously difficult due to the high water and sugar content ( which will caramelize and make them appear and to some extent taste burnt , usually long before they crisp up ) . There 's some discussion of this on <URL> . Key points seem to be : remove as much surface moisture as possible prior to cooking avoid overcrowding the pans , especially when cooking thicker cuts use a convection oven if possible If you have success please report back and tell us what worked !

What is English Afternoon tea ?
Please see below from an article on <URL> . Breakfast tea blends tend to contain teas that produce a cup strong and robust enough to " get the body moving " in the morning , allowing you to start your day with a kick . Conversely , afternoon tea blends are designed to be lighter in character and tend to be smoother on the palate , creating the perfect feel for a day winding down . There is more to read and some very interesting information on the subject . You may want to take a look at the page .
An0r4k , I assume that you 're making a cup of black ( ? ) tea and steeping some lemongrass in it . If so , perhaps you should make the black tea very weak as its tannins might be amplifying the ( pleasant ) slight bitterness of the lemongrass to distasteful levels . Alternatively , if you are steeping the lemongrass in hot water , try removing the outer layers of the lemongrass stalk . If they are old or tough , this can increase the bitterness of the drink . In any case , check that there is n't any dirt trapped between the layers of the lemongrass . Some recipies call for putting the lemongrass into water , bringing it to a boil and then letting it simmer for 10-15 minutes . I have n't tried this . Even if it does produce a smoother taste , then the boiling might well degradge any health-giving nutrients from the lemongrass .
It appears to be brown sugar instead of white sugar . So there will be some flavor difference from less refining ( e.g. , more molasses remaining ) You could pick up turbinado sugar at the grocery store , which will probably taste just about the same , for much less money . edit : I should also note that honey makes a good sweetener for tea as well , depending on the type of tea . You could use normal brown sugar as well . Maple sugar ( or syrup ) goes in some ... there are a lot of sweeteners you can use , and most of them you can get fairly cheaply at the grocery store so you can experiment . ( Except maple , I suppose , which is just expensive )
I 'd presume they just mean dish soap and not some more powerful cleanser . With regard to additives , etc. . I guess whatever you are okay with normally should be okay . Obviously you have to rinse the trays thoroughly to get the soap off . I 've had a few dehydrators and there is nothing special about the plastic trays . I doubt they are dishwasher safe but I 've never put that to the test ( I suspect it would not work that well anyway ) . The trays can be pesky to clean if you 've used a marinade . The best thing I 've found for this is a small , soft circular brush .
I would assume it 's a synonym for parchment paper . And yes , pan release is a generic term for any food release spray .
English toffee is very chewy - the kind of stuff that glues your teeth together ! Once it has been cooked and set , it 's not easy to handle and would n't be easy to chop up for a cookie recipe . You 'd possibly be better off with some kind of fudge which is easier to handle but will still hold its shape in a cookie .

I think what you 've stumbled across here is an interesting implementation of a technique , and not really a specific dish . The technique ( simplified ) is poaching . It 's just a very unique way of doing it . I 've had eggs poached in black tea in Macau , and you 'll also find the technique used in English and French cooking . There 's an old recipe for scallops with demi-glace that calls for the scallop to be garnished with a quail egg poached in tea with bergamot ( Earl Grey , commonly ) . I wish I could remember the name of it and my French is n't nearly good enough to search effectively . My eggs were cooked until just runny , but it 's not uncommon to have them warmed just to hot and gooey with the white still translucent ( and delicious with noodles ) . There 's probably a colloquial name for what she described , but it 's essentially an adaptation of a technique that ( very likely ) originated in China .
It 's all about balance : the fresh bright and stimulating effect of the early part of brewing , first minute or so , versus the calming deep flavours of the later part of brewing . some folks use more tea for less time to achieve that first effect ; conversely , less for longer for the latter . stewing for 10min spoils a proper English cuppa . One trick worth trying with bags is to dip briefly in a small amount of boiling water and discard : this is to rid the ' dust ' . One can then steep the ' fannings ' longer without too strong a pot . Interestingly , green tea is traditionally rinsed this way more for hygiene than flavour .
A kitchen rag is typically a white , rectangular towel that has various duties in a professional kitchen . Some of the uses include : wiping-down counter tops , sopping-up spills , securing cutting boards ( use DAMP rags ) , and grabbing hot pans ( use DRY rags ) . Generally , it is a good idea to wash your hands with soap and a sink . Often kitchen rags are used to clean debris from the hands between preparing food items . Usually the rags are dropped-off , picked-up , and washed by an outsourced service provider ( e.g. Cintas ) . The kitchen rags from these providers often have a thin , colored line that runs lengthwise down the towel . If you would like to find some for your home , try searching ' bar mops ' . They are essentially the same as kitchen rags , and are usually very cheap .
The flexible generalist thermometer of the kitchen , the instant read thermometer , should be quite suitable measuring the temperature of the water for tea brewing . It covers the right range , has reasonable accuracy , and responds relatively quickly . You can get traditional ones such as the <URL> very inexpensively , or high quality electronic ones such as the <URL> , as well as a large number of mid-range models that offer excellent value , accuracy , and reasonable response time . Many come with a clip that would allow you to set them on the side of a pot , but you would not attach them to kettle . Instead , you hold them in , and they register the temperature in a few seconds ( depending on the model ) -- thus the name , instant read .
It is not exactly the oil you used for the chicken wings . The recipe says " a touch of oil " , so you should use a small amount only . When you pan-fry the wings the first time around , the fat in them will melt and gather in a puddle in the pan . The oil you used will be there , but most of it will be the chicken 's subcutaneous fat . So , after you remove the wings from the pan , whatever is left is considered " rendered chicken fat " , even though it will have traces of oil mixed in .
It sounds like you have Fleischman 's Pizza Crust Yeast ( or a no-doubt quite similar product if from another manufacturer ) . The relevant phrase from the Fleischman marketing web site is : Pizza Crust Yeast is specially-formulated with dough relaxers that keep the dough from pulling or snapping back when shaping it . It is intended to make it easier to stretch the pizza dough into shape . The yeast itself is normal instant yeast , to the best of my knowledge -- the additives in the packet are what make it " pizza crust yeast " . Researching the additional ingredients other than yeast : Sorbitan monostearate -- According to <URL> is an emulsifier with a polar and non-polar ends : Sorbitan monostearate is used as an emulsifying agent in cake mixes , icings , baked goods , puddings , imitation whipped cream , hemorrhoid creams , and creams to treat dry skin . <URL> mentions that this helps the dough absorb the water . l-cysteine * -- is an amino acid , which is naturally occurring , and often extracted from hair or feathers . <URL> explains the science in bread dough , where it acts as a reducing agent : During mixing the gluten in the ﬂour is stretched and pulled apart so that it can be reformed during prooﬁng and baking to provide the needed strength and structure . Reducing agents act like mixing to reversibly break down gluten so that once they have been used up the gluten reforms . This mechanism is the opposite of oxidizing agents , which build up gluten . Reducing and oxidizing agent ascorbic acid * -- is of course Vitamin C , and a fairly strong acid . According to <URL> in Czeck Journal of Food Sciences , at concentrations under 0.6 % it has little effect on wheat flour , so it is unlikely to have any practical effect in a full batch of pizza dough . Its inclusion is probably ( as mentioned in <URL> ) as an anti-oxidant and preservative in the packet , rather than as an active ingredient in the bread dough . enzymes -- no doubt the particular enzymes and their ratios are proprietary to the brand you have , but according to the Wikipedia article on <URL> , they are used to increase transformation of starch into sugars to facilitate the action of the live yeast . Common enzymes used include : Amylases break down the starch in flours into simple sugars , thereby letting yeast ferment quickly . Malt is a natural source of amylase . Proteases improve extensibility of the dough by degrading some of the gluten . Lipoxygenases oxidize the flour . See also this <URL> which discusses various commercially available forms of yeast . My personal opinion is that I would not buy " pizza crust yeast , " since recipes are not designed for the presence of its dough conditioners . I would rather control my dough 's ingredients myself . However , since you have the product , why not try it using the vendor 's recipe ? I would be fascinated to hear how it performs .
Worcestershire Sauce is added where the recipe wants a fast way to develop or add savoury richness , umami . It 's often used where umami would develop over time with slow careful cooking ( and heavy bottomed pans ) . Adding this extra ingredient is a good cheat where you just want that kick without the wait .
Here in China , it is normal to reuse tea again and again . Typically the first cup from the tea is bitter . Chinese people commonly pour one cup and then throw it away and drink the second cup from the same leaves . Workers here can be seen with a large mug or jar of tea . When drunk , they top up the water again with hot ( but not boiling ) water . This will go on all day . The next day , however , they will not reuse the tea . My Chinese wife always tells me off if I reuse the previous days tea leaves . She says they are bad for you , though I have never had any problem myself .
Whole leaf black tea is available , but because it has to be processed by hand it is expensive . Twinings whole leaf black tea is roughly 50 cents per teabag as opposed to the equivalent processed tea bags at about 8 cents . To make black tea , the leaves are wilted and processed by various methods - none of the mechanical methods will produce whole leaf tea .
The term " ground red pepper " is ambiguous in English . Things sold under that name in the US have a wide range of heats , and likely are made from multiple varieties of peppers , though I 'd say they 're more commonly hot things like cayenne , or other varieties with somewhat less heat . That said , do n't worry about it too much in these cases . Anything from mild paprika to cayenne would likely fit within what the authors meant , and you 're not going to harm a recipe by increasing or decreasing the heat , or by using a chile powder with a slightly different flavor . Just use something ( or a blend ) that provides the heat level you want , and you 'll be fine .
I 'll attempt to expand upon daniel 's answer above . Boudin describes a sausage that is generally created from a blend of beef , rice , and/or pork ( <URL> ) . Sometimes other types of proteins are added to create variations : Gator , Shrimp , crawfish , etc. . Boudin is widely known to be used in Cajun cooking . Other various types of Boudin exists . As wikipedia defines various different types of boudin : Boudin blanc : A white sausage made of pork without the blood . Pork liver and heart meat are typically included . In Cajun versions , the sausage is made from a pork rice dressing [ ... ] In French/Belgian cuisine , the sausage is sauteed or grilled . The Louisiana version is normally simmered or braised , although coating with oil and slow grilling for tailgating is becoming a popular option in New Orleans and Baton Rouge . Boudin noir : A dark-hued blood sausage , containing pork , pig blood , and other ingredients . Variants of the boudin noir occur in French , Belgian , Cajun and Catalan cuisine [ ... ] Shrimp Boudin : Similar to crawfish boudin , it is made by adding the shrimp to rice [ ... ] [ 4 ] Boudin rouge : In Louisiana cuisine , a sausage similar to boudin blanc , but with pork blood added to it . This originated from the French boudin noir . Brown Rice Boudin : Taste is very similar to traditional pork boudin , except this boudin > is made with a brown-rice substitute for those looking to cut down on white rice intake .
I would read that to mean reducing to the point of it being syrupy . You can go with moderate heat until you sense it thickening , then you probably should turn it down to be very careful not to burn it . It 's the kind of thing that will seem a lot easier the second time you do it with the same recipe . Use your smallest saucepan . You probably wo n't need a whisk , but keep one handy just in case . A wooden spoon is probably your best implement . If at any point you feel like it 's getting away from you ( getting lumpy or otherwise weird ) , remove it from the heat and whisk it a bit . Usually recipes will say to reduce by half or two thirds , or it will say until you have a certain amount left . Since this one does n't , go with your gut . You 're done when it has thickened and will nicely flavor a pint of crème fraîche without making it watery . That term is used in recipes for Beurre Blanc ; look at this recipe from <URL> . It 's the same idea . Let us know how it goes . It 's an interesting question .

Pre-made seasoning to add to rice in rice cooker to make rice more flavorful ?
You can combine it with practically everything , so the question is somewhat broad . So my answer is equally broad : rice pairs well with fresh tastes and acidity , or with moderately sweet components . Or you can just underline its own slightly nutty notes . Below is a list of specific examples , but it is impossible to make it exhaustive . For fresh tastes , use herbs . Summer savoury and spearmint are the classics , I never make stuffed peppers without them . But other light tasting herbs are also a good choice - lemon balm , oregano . Rosmarin is sometimes good , but somewhat overpowering , it is better for a dish where the rice is cooked together with veggies ( eggplant , zucchini ) . Beside herbs , you can try more exotic seasonings . Lemon zests are good , finelly chopped grape leaves and shoots are great . Coriander powder should give you a similar taste profile to cilantro , but it is easier to keep at hand for when a quick dinner without much planning is needed . The sweet option is also interesting ; if you do n't overdo it , it is OK to serve it as a side dish for a savoury meal . The easiest way to achieve it is to cook the rice together chopped dry fruit . Sulfured raisins are popular , the dish will be somewhat si milar to pilaf . But others work too , I especially like dried apricots because they are slightly tart . Other methods for sweetening do n't really fall into the " dry seasoing " category , but are worth mentioning . You can add fruit juice to the cooking water ( apple or other slightly sour juices are best ; this will affect the starch in the rice , causing it to cook firmer than usual ) or you can add a small amount of sweetener to the cooked rice ( prefer aromatic sweeteners lik honey or C grade maple syrup ) . Or if you prefer it spicier , mix it with a sweet chutney , like mango . If you want a subtler taste , combine the rice with nuts ( cook them together ) . Always use nuts with the brown skin removed . I have found unroasted , finely chopped nuts to work better this way . Hazelnuts and almonds are a very good choice . Para nuts also pair well with rice , but are seldom availablr blanched + chopped . This works especially well if you use the parfrying method for the rice , frying in the oil of the nut used . However , I do n't know if you can parfry rice in a rice cooker , I always make mine on the stove .
The pie crust is ready to use . There is nothing in a graham cracker crust that requires baking , although a little toasting gives some color and deeper flavor . If you are putting in a filling that will not be baked ( a refrigerator pie ) , you might choose to " blind bake " ( bake without filling ) the crust for a few minutes to give it more color and flavor , but it is not required . If your filling will require baking , there is little reason to bake the crust separately .
Moisten your hands with a clean , damp towel . This helps the rice not stick . Look at any sushi bar ; the chef will be frequently moistening their hands on such a towel .
I can only answer from a perspective of the Indonesian kitchen , and my own personal experience , but in general the answer is : In the water , with the rice I quite often use saffron , turmeric , cloves , <URL> ( The English Wiki entry links to bay leaf , which , completely , utterly , is not the same thing ) , and lemongrass , and they all go in while cooking the rice . Possible exceptions would be green leafy herbs , ( coriander / cilantro for instance ) , which you put in the end . Not so much to flavor the rice , but more to " scent " the bowl of rice . [ Edit ] In answer to your edit : There is no preferred way . The preferred way depends on the herb , as observed by <URL> in his/her answer . Going by experience , and the herbs I use myself , the answer is in the water with the rice . Putting a bay leaf in after the fact , is not going to do much for a dish . Putting it in while cooking the dish is . This goes for a lot of herbs : Turmeric , ginger and laos ( galangal ? ) can flavor rice , but not if you put it in the end . On the other hand : Putting cilantro while cooking the rice will just destroy the cilantro , and leave nothing to show for it . I lack the knowledge of what is water-soluble , and what is fat-soluble , but as a general guideline I use my highly personal " is-this-going-to-survive-the-15-to-20-minute-cooking-process-or-not ? " guideline , and the even more personal " did-it-work ? " guideline . In addition , and perhaps also supporting <URL> 's answer , Indonesians are not shy of cooking their rice in <URL> ( again : English wiki does not do justice , creamed coconut is not quite the same ) , adding a mildy greasy layer to the grains , aiding in flavor absorption , although I have to say it 's not a common practice , but more often used for festive occasions .
Do you mean this one ? <URL> . If so , in Japan it is actually known as <URL> ( meaning pomelo candy ) as shown in this description . Here is a <URL> to how a similar milk version is made ( I think you would use mandarin/pomelo ( bontan ) juice in there somewhere for what you want ) , but it is in Japanese ... Perhaps the pictures will help but ... sorry , I do n't know if it 's ok to translate this ... but it says : milk 500ml , sweet glutinous rice 500g , sugar 500g , mizuame ( maltose ; could use corn syrup instead ) 600g , potato starch 200g , and a tray 31cmx24cmx3 .5 cm . Briefly , it says to soak the rice for half a day , then drain , and blend with the milk for 2-3 mins . Transfer to a pot and simmer on medium heat for 20-30 mins . Add sugar in a few lots , mix until dissolved . Drop to low heat , add mizuame and stir/knead very well - the firmness of the final candy will depend on how long you do this . Dredge tray with a thick layer of potato starch then pour the mixture in . To harden , refrigerate when cool .
You have misread the Wikipedia quote . It says ( emphasis added ) : Kale freezes well and actually tastes sweeter and more flavourful after being exposed to a frost . While not terribly well written ( since there is the red herring that it freezes well ) , this does n't mean that the harvested plant was frozen , but rather that the live plant in the ground was exposed to frost . This causes it to begin converting starches to sugars in preparation for winter , giving it a sweeter taste . Per <URL> , for example : Frost enhances the flavor . Some of the tastiest kale is harvested under a foot of snow ! Never harvest kale until after a hard frost or two . A few freezing nights make all the difference in flavor as the kale plants need a hard frost to transform their starches into natural sugars .
There are many dishes where chicken and rice are cooked mixed together in the same pot . Look at Arroz con Pollo for example , it 's an easy classic and there are loads of recipes . There 's also some types of Biryani , Jambalaya , and other traditional recipes from across the world that would work . Chicken pieces and rice cook in about the same time as you say , if you want to get vegetables in there it 's a bit more complicated as you want the vegetables to be cooked , but not overcooked . I 've generally made them separately to put put as a side as it 's more attractive , however large carrot chunks cook about the same time , and you can put in pureed vegetables or even vegetable juice . One my mother makes uses crushed tomatoes instead of water to cook the rice in . As for having the chicken mixed in or on top there 's no right answer , I like to brown the chicken and lay it skin side up on top of the rice as the rice will cook up around the chicken and the visual effect is good when the pot is put on the table . Visuals aside there 's little difference in the method .
As I note in <URL> , I use the exact model you are considering . It is one of the best gadgets I 've purchased . It has no problem making any batch down to 1 cup in size . Being able to cook the full 5.5 cups when entertaining is invaluable as well . I will sometimes cook more than I need for lunch the next day , as well as making fried rice for the following night 's dinner . Bottom line : you wo n't regret the purchase .
No . It is not general practice to add bleach to rice . The brown rice bran is removed through mechanical processes . As to whether he should continue to indulge this worry ... I 'd be more concerned about [ insert common American male problem here ] before ammonia in rice . <URL> This review has many free references in it . Should you want further peer-review reading , I can provide it .
I usually use 1/4 cup per person for a smallish portion , and 1/3 cup per person if you 're a bit hungrier . You 'll probably want to check the instructions for your rice cooker to check exactly how much water you should add as different manufacturers vary . I believe the one I used in the past needed an equal quantity of water to rice .
It is the rice that is important , regardless of the cooker you use . If you think you are unable to find Sushi rice on your own in local market , why not check with a Sushi stall chef/owner near by ? Some people get mistaken with sticky rice , because really Sushi and sticky are on the same category . You could even say that Italian risotto is as well . However sushi rice is rinsed and surface starch is removed . Yamikuronue has already given you some good insight . Perhaps she could tell you what rice you could buy :) I hope you have the basic sushi rolling bamboo mat to help you with . From mine and many of others ' experience , the mat is very useful . I have used <URL> to make nice maki rolls . The following <URL> seems to be indicating a method ( water sprinkling ) that I saw/ate in a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo near Maru building . Hope it helps . Edit 1 : If you want to make best sushi out of normal rice , this is a bruteforce method we tried at home for the first time . Not the best Sushi found in a Sushi bar in Japan , but still it was a taste to remember , and an experience that made sense . break the long grain rice ( you can use a mortar , or bottle , or any clean/non-contaminated cylinder on your cutting board :) ) wash the rice until the starch goes away - even if it 's not 100 % , it 's good enough when you have soaked it . soak the rice rinse and wash again and rinse depending on the usual ' hardness ' of the rice you use , and how much water you add per cup of rice , you may have to change the amount of water you add . For example , if you have 50g of raw rice , and 75g of water , then the total weight is 125g . You must keep the same total weight when you add water to the soaked/washed rice . you can very well cook the rice in a pan good heat to cook rice : after boiling , bring down the heat to minimum and let it be , no need to take lid off once rice is cooked , you can mix it with sushi vinegar . If you do not have rice/sushi vinegar , then you can add some plain vinegar and pinches of salt mix all , stir well This gives you just nice rice for sushi :)
Wetted starch is not the same thing as cooked starch . If you want to see the difference in a simple experiment , make two starch slurries , boil one into a pudding , and leave the other one cold . Starch only gelates at high temperatures ( I think it starts around 70 ° C , but needs even more to complete the process ) . When you have a grain of rice , you have the problem that the starch is very closely packed together , and water ca n't penetrate into the center of the grain too well - the outside layers soak all the water they come in contact with , and so water only seeps into the center of the rice after the outer part has been hydrated . It is similar for pasta . In the worst case , when you cook rice , the time needed for cooking will be enough to heat the whole grain to the gelating temperature , but not enough for the water to hydrate the innermost part of the corn . This is fine if you want hardish-cooked rice , but if you want soft , mushy rice , you should presoak it so the inside is already hydrated when you start cooking it . I suppose you can do the same with pasta . This is the reason why some sources will advice you to presoak . But , as I said , this is not the same as cooking . Yes , the rice or pasta will get soft , so you wo n't break your teeth if you try to eat it . But it will still be raw starch . I do n't know if it is unhealthy to eat raw starch ( my mother certainly told me so , but it could have been a myth ; I asked <URL> and got no conclusive answers ) . But it will probably taste unpleasant , similar to raw potatoes or raw flour . I would try to get other sources of food for this time period . Or , as @justkt 's comment suggests , it is easy to get an electric kettle in a brand new house before the kitchen is installed . You can use it to pour cooking water over " instant " versions of pasta and rice . These have been pregelated and then dehydrated , so do n't need a prologned cooking . They are usually available as instant hot soup or rice meals in sachets and cardboard boxes , I have n't seen them as pure ingredients .
In general , the stickiness of rice can be reduced by removing some of the starch by pre-soaking and/or <URL> . For sushi rice , chewiness can be increased by <URL> . For what do you use oil ? I do n't believe that is a traditional ingredient in sushi rice .
It should n't be a problem , since their cooking times are similar .
Reducing the amount of charcoal used in the Orion Cooker and cooking longer can produce a more tender result . Specifically , using 6 lb of a 12.5 lb bag of charcoal and cooking for 120 minutes for 3 racks produced ribs that were not quite as tender as desired , but much better than the normal Orion recipe ( 12.5 lb of charcoal for 70 minutes ) . The temperature profile was as follows : The above shows that the meat temperature was held between 195 and 205 for 60 minutes . This profile is not optimal for the most tender ribs , so additional changes toward lower/slower may improve the result . Note that the charcoal reduction required a minor modification to the equipement since unless the charcoal is adjacent to the Cooker 's wall , the wood chips will not smoke . The modification is shown in a you tube video entitled " Orion Cooker Charcoal Saving Mod And Improved Tender Rib Cooking " ( <URL> ) .
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
Many of the Italian style gluten-free pastas are made of rice , most of the rest are made of corn or a combination of both . America 's Test Kitchen did a taste testing of gluten-free pastas and a brown rice version was the clear winner : <URL> So , my first piece of advice is to choose the pasta carefully , if you do n't like a brand try another brand next time . For what it is worth , ATK disliked all of the corn-based pastas . I looked at a few articles about cooking gluten-free pasta , a few points were repeated in every article . First , start with a big pot of generously salted water . Bring the water to a hard boil before you add the pasta , stir the pasta frequently as it boils , and absolutely do not overcook . You should taste the pasta frequently ; it will turn to mush on a dime . More articles say to not rinse the pasta than call for rinsing the pasta assuming that it is to be served hot . The same goes for regular pasta , you should n't rinse pasta except for use cold as in for salads . While I do n't have a citation that specifies finishing gluten-free pasta in the sauce , it absolutely makes sense to me to put the not-quite-done pasta in the sauce to finish cooking . Again , taste often , gluten-free pasta overcooks very easily . Reserve some of the cooking water , just like as is recommended for regular pasta , in case you need to loosen the sauce . Do n't be tempted to add oil to the water . It does n't work to keep regular pasta from sticking , nor does it work for gluten-free pasta .
I do n't know that type of rice , but it sounds like it ran out of liquid before it was done . Some types of rice can be done in about 10m , some take over half an hour . My tricks for risotto like dishes are : wash the rice to remove loose starch taste regularly so you can intervene as needed , avoid stirring as much as you can ( you can stir a few times to avoid burning ) , fry the rice with the onions before adding water , add liquid in small batches until it 's done . Try it with a few small batches to get the hang of it . It could very well be the wrong type of rice , so you may want to try other brands .
For rice it depends . Cooking any starch in water will first cause the starch granules to swell and eventually tangle up with each other ( the gelatinization ) . Dissolving sugars or salts in the water slows down the process by raising the temperature the swelling starts . While few prefer pasta as a stuck blob of strands , the same is not the case for rice . I like my Basmati loose , but my risotto and sushi sticky , so salt may be required for Basmati and optional for Arborio . There are many techniques for controlling the starch for rice . To control the starch gelatinization of rice : <URL> ; or <URL> Method 1 wo n't avoid the grain surface starch gelatinization , but it will help with stickiness ( you may oil coat it after draining ) . Method 2 delays the starch release allowing you to finish a risotto in seven minutes . Cool for parties or for restaurants .
I never boil rice noodles . Just soak them in cold water for about an hour .

Can palmiers be refrigerated/frozen overnight ?
You should be able to cut them , wrap them up , and freeze them to be baked and served the next day without a problem .
Cheaper spirits can certainly be used in culinary applications . The results wo n't be identical , but inexpensive liquors are a lot more cost-effective since the subtle differences in flavor between middling and quality spirits tend to get masked by other flavors . This is especially true when you 're applying heat , which will burn off much of the alcohol ( though not all ) and change some of the volatile flavor compounds in the spirit . For things like a tomato sauce made with wine , a pan sauce deglazed with brandy , or a dessert flambeed with rum , the difference between bottom-shelf and high-end product will be evident only in the cost . Poor-quality vodka will have some " rough " flavors if you 're drinking it straight , and those might carry over into the liqueur in particular . Chilling will help , so you probably wo n't notice much difference in your borscht , and once you bake the liqueur into something I doubt any flavor difference will be noticeable in the final product . As a rule of thumb , the more you manipulate the spirit , the less you 'll notice its provenance . I can say confidently that using free , leftover plonk in a culinary application will be a much better use than drinking it !
The most common methods to create chocolate coated ice cream bars , with or without a stick are to : Use truly tempered chocolate , which may be more trouble than it is worth Use a mixture of chocolate thinned with vegetable oil . See for example , this recipe from <URL> .
So to sum up , so far , we have : use a silicon tray , there should be no problems there . put the tray in warm water for a short while and they would let go .
I have only seen it used in dahl dishes , presumably because of it 's claimed digestive properties . Asafoetida is incredibly pungent ; anything more than a pinch seems too much and unpleasant . I think of it as a flavour-enhancer , a natural , Indian MSG rather than a spice in the normal sense . It makes your mouth water quite intensely and seems to stimulate the savory tatse buds ( umami ) . This is lovely when done subtley and kept in the background . Therefore , I suspect you could add small pinches to all kinds of savoury food .
Yes , you can freeze buttermilk . When thawed , the emulsion will break into solids and whey . This makes no difference for baked goods ; you can also use a blender to restore it to a smooth , thicker liquid if needed for applications like salad dressing . See also : <URL> . <URL>
Sure it 's safe , there 's no risk in putting jam in baked goods . It says refrigerate after opening so it does n't spoil after being left out too long - some people do n't realize it needs to be refrigerated after opening because it is stored in the cupboard before opening . The important thing for food safety is to make sure that the pastries are eaten soon enough after baking . The cream cheese will go off sooner than the jam will , so do n't let them sit around .
I 'm writing this so it helps someone else . I decided to freeze my fondant because I did n't have time to air dry the fondant like @Sunishtha Singh suggested . I did n't want the fondant to become too dry either by adding the tylose/CMC powder or use the gum paste/satin ice because personally , I prefer the flavour of fondant better than gumpaste . So , I found <URL> link and <URL> one and decided to follow the instructions . But I did add a bit of guess work and common sense and instead of freezing the fondant panels for 15-20 minutes , I only froze for 10 minutes and did n't open the fridge/freezer until the 10 minutes were finished . I also put the panels in the freezer at the same time and worked very quickly to attach the panels once the 10 minutes were finished . Once I attached the panels , I switched on the aircon but not for more than 15-20 minutes and it seemed to be fine , even considering that it had been raining all day . I do n't know what role does the fridge play in this but I have a frost free fridge . I also used black fondant for the panels and even though I personally find it much more moist than the white fondant , the panels attached nicely and the shoebox looked very smooth , at least from the sides . I hope this helps someone and I give the fondant freezing a thumbs up :)
The best I can offer you comes from <URL> : The gelation of egg yolk can be partially reversed by heating after thawing . This treatment improves the functional properties of proteins . The stiffness of the gels obtained after frozen storage can be reduced by more than 50 % and become pourable at 21 ° C by heating up to 45 ° C for 1 h. Eggs do n't actually start to set until you hit 63 ° C , so if I had previously-frozen eggs , I would heat them as the above paragraph suggests . Just be very careful not to use too much heat . You wo n't get perfect eggs , but they 'll be edible .
I 've not been able to use store bought cheese cloth more than twice and then only if I used it gently . And I 'm not gentle on the stuff . I use it for cheese making regularly as well as juicing and random filtering . I gave up on normal cheese cloth because it is too fragile and way too expensive for what it was . I now use instead a tightly woven polyester mesh fabric . I found a yard of it in the scraps section of the fabric store for $ 1 . A yard is about 3 times more than I will ever need . I cut it into smaller pieces and hemmed it . It is strong enough to be rung out full of grapes as well as laundered and a tight enough weave to filter small particles out of beef stock . I was surprised how often I end up using these cloths and highly recommend them .
This should n't be a problem . What I recommend is to go in this order : Do n't pre-salt the food , other seasonings are fine but anything with a high sodium content should be left out Cook to your desired temp ( and I would recommend pasteurizing since it 's not a direct serve situation Pull food from bath and plunge immediately into an ice bath filled about half and half with cold water and ice to rapidly drop the temp of the food Once chilled , put in freezer to store , leave them directly in the bag your cooking with . If your using ziplocks I would suggest wrapping them in plastic wrap and then putting them back in the ziplock before freezing . When it 's time to reheat , repeat your sous vide process from the initial cook . It will take the same amount of time it initially took to bring the core up to temp + the time it will take to unthaw the food in the bath . Reheating direct from frozen is your best bet for quality . Post-sear the food and add salt at that point . Adding salt at this point will prevent the food from taking on a cured texture when it is frozen and held for a period of time . Enjoy !
The only difference between regular whole wheat flour and white whole wheat flour is the variety of wheat from which it is ground . Regular whole wheat flour is ground from red wheat while white whole wheat is from a lighter pigmented wheat and thus the lighter color . In both cases the germ is still intact and thus as Jonathan Campbell stated , it will go rancid more quickly than white flour . Keep it in a cool dark place and use up quickly if you ca n't refrigerate or freeze it . When you keep it in the refrigerator or freezer and plan to use it for yeast breads , remember to allow it to warm to room temperature before using for best results with your yeast .
Heavy cream can be frozen but only if intended to be used in its liquid form ( soups , sauces , etc. ) It will not whip properly once frozen . I agree with Pointy that there 's really no point in freezing it because it 's usually dated about 2 months out from the time I 'm purchasing it . Additionally , if kept cold and not left out on the counter unnecessarily ( as with most dairy products ) it will keep well beyond the date on the carton . I 'm not a milk drinker but use it baking/cooking . If I have a recipe that requires milk I use a 50:50 ratio of heavy cream and water and have n't had any issues yet . If I was using milk it would be whole milk so it 's kind of like making your own version .
I do n't think so . In the mayonnaise case , all that has happened is the fat has come out of emulsion and gathered together again , so you can re-emulsify it . In the whipped cream case , you 've started to create large fat crystals ( butter ) . I guess technically it might work to heat it up to melt the butter , re-emulsify it into cream and then beat it again , but I do n't think it would be worth the effort . You could go ahead and finish churning it into butter and buttermilk if you want to avoid wasting the cream .
I freeze cheese all the time , mostly mozzarella . It keeps longer . ( If I keep mozzarella or similar cheeses too long in the fridge it gets moldy , often even before its expiration date . ) However , I usually use frozen cheese only for cooking - i.e. if it 's going to be melted . Freezing cheese does change the texture . Parmesan , though , being a hard , aged cheese would probably be less affected by freezing . However , on the same token , aged cheeses keep very nicely in the fridge , so I would n't see much benefit in freezing it .
In France , white button mushrooms are called champignons . Before refrigeration was common , books suggested <URL> , because undercooked mushrooms would quickly spoil . If you cooked them and later keep them in the refrigerator , it is safe to reheat mushrooms . Treat mushrooms as you would treat meat . Mushrooms are mainly water , so they reheat well in the microwave . Do it on low power . Depending on the cooking technique , the texture may change by using high power .
Raw lima beans do contain a compound , a cyanogenic glycoside , which would release cyanide if ingested raw . ( 1 ) <URL> ( 2 ) <URL> ( 3 ) <URL> ( 4 ) <URL> Frozen lima beans are typically uncooked . The usual stories about cooking many varieties of lima beans quote boiling for at least 15 minutes and discarding the cooking water . Now trying to unwind the folklore ... ( A ) What is the toxicity of cyanide ? Cyanide in the body is an anion , which has a negative charge . In order to balance the charge a cation , a positive charged ion must be present too . Since beans would be eaten let 's look at the toxicity of sodium cyanide . The dose of <URL> which would kill 50 % of the subjects ( LD-50 ) is about 15 mg/kg of body weight for mammals . But by weight sodium cyanide is 47 % sodium and 53 % cyanide . So the lethal dose for cyanide itself would be about 7mg/kg . So a 154 pound person weighs 70 kg ( 2.2 lbs per kg ) . 70 * 7 is approximately 500 mg or 0.5 grams . ( B ) Does the cyanide content of lima beans vary ? Yes . Supposedly the varieties of lima beans consumed in the US ( and presumably Canada ) are specifically chosen to be low in cyanide . Cyanide in " lima beans [ varies ] between 15 and 500 mg HCN/kg fresh weight ( Bickerstaff , 2003 ) " quoted from : ( 5 ) <URL> But I can find the original source by Bickerstaff in the article . ( C ) How much does cooking reduce the cyanide ? There is a paper which notes that in other foods the cyanogenic glycosides are 100 % destroyed by cooking . ( 6 ) <URL> ( D ) How does the bean produce cyanide ? The cyanide in lima beans is present as " pure " cyanide , but a cyanide compound called a cyanogenic glycoside . Lima beans contain two such compounds , <URL> and <URL> Linamarin <URL> Lotaustralin <URL> I 'll quote Dr. G. Speijers of the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection , Laboratory for Toxicology , Bilthoven , The Netherlands ( 7 ) <URL> The first aspect is the processing of plant products containing cyanogenic glycosides . When the edible parts of the plants are macerated , the catabolic intracellular enzyme ß-glucosidase can be released , coming into contact with the glycosides . This enzyme hydrolyzes the cyanogenic glycosides to produce hydrogen cyanide and glucose and ketones or benzaldehyde . It seems that the human gut also has bacteria which are capable of hydrolyzing the cyanogenic glycosides to produce hydrogen cyanide .
There are a variety of frozen desserts which are all related . The main difference between ice cream and frozen custard is the amount of eggs used to thicken the base mix . Philadelphia style ice cream is made from a base mix of milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings . French ( or simply plain ) ice cream is made from a base mix which is essentially a very thin custard or creme anglaise : milk and/or cream , sugar , and flavorings thickened with egg yolks or whole egg . The base mix is cooked to thicken , and then chilled prior to churning . Frozen custard is very similar to French style ice cream , but with a greater ratio of eggs or egg yolks to dairy or liquid in the mix . With this information , you can adapt nearly any custard recipe to be freezable as ice cream or frozen custard . My survey of frozen custard recipes indicates a ratio of eggs to dairy of about 5 egg yolks to three cups ( 700 mL ) dairy , or 6 whole eggs to 4 cups ( 1 L ) of dairy . To adapt any custard recipe for freezing , then : Adjust the ratio of egg yolks to dairy to no more than about 5 yolks per 3 cups dairy . You may also want to adjust the total yield to be based on no more than 3 cups dairy depending on the capacity of your ice cream maker . Many home ice cream makers have a 1 quart ( close to 1 L ) capacity , but you need to leave room for the air which will be incorporated as the mix is churned . I recommend not using whole eggs for frozen custards , as the yolks facilitate a better texture , and create the rich eggy custard flavor . Frozen desserts are served colder than custards normally are , so the flavors will be more muted . You may need to compensate by increasing the ratio of flavoring ingredients . This will be hard to judge until you have made the frozen custard/ice cream at least once . Cook the custard until it thickens on the stove top , per the normal custard method . Chill it rapidly for safety , and then hold it for at least 4 hours ( overnight is even better ) . While I can not explain the science , empirically , allowing the mix to mature lets the flavors meld and produces a better frozen dessert . Churn it into a frozen dessert according to the instructions of your particular ice cream maker . Note that you can even convert a custard recipe into a Philadelphia style ice cream by eliminating the eggs completely , and simply creating a dairy/sugar/flavoring mix . These still benefit from overnight maturation before churning .
You should be able to cut them , wrap them up , and freeze them to be baked and served the next day without a problem .
If you mean like a potpie or a TV dinner ? Yes you 're fine , go for it . If you 're really worried about it here is the rule . ( been a few years since I took serveSafe ) When reheating foods you want the internal temperature to reach 165 degrees F. ( 74C ) for 15 seconds . In practice ( at home NOT at the restaurant ) just get it nice and hot . Note : Homemade foods generally need to be carefully reheated but not frozen dinners etc. . They cook them pretty good at the factory .

Are Garlic cloves supposed to be put as whole or as chopped up pieces in a soup ?
From my experience and what I 've seen , garlic cloves are often applied to soup in un-chopped glove . Overtime , the boiling will release the garlic 's sweet to the soup without melting itself into the liquid or dissolving into tidbits that attached to the ingredients . I have also seen people pan fry the garlic gloves to golden brown before dumping them into the water . I believe the purpose is to harden the outside of the garlic while getting more exotic flavor out of it . Otherwise , I would chop/dice/smash garlic for dips and frying .
The purpose of stock is to dissolve collagen out of the meat and bones into gelatin . The liquid is then not so watery , collects a lot of flavor , and can be reduced for sauces if desired , etc. . The problem with the scrapple is that , while it does have a some gelatin , it also has a ton of fat and starch . The fat would melt and have to be skimmed off again . The starch would gelatinize . This would result is not a stock but a gravy . The solution would seem to be to find recipes where the starch and fattiness would be desirable . The first thing that would come to mind would be a thick stew . I would cube and sear the scrapple before adding it . It might take some experimentation to figure out how long to let it stew to thicken the stew without turning the crapple to mush .
I 'm looking for the online reference , but I remember reading in Cook 's Illustrated that they were able to substitute a bit of gelatin to mimic the mouth-feel of homemade stock . I did find a <URL> recipe that used gelatin . Based on how you described your recipe , I would say that the long cooking of chicken bones is indeed what 's missing . You might get a better result if you roast your chicken breasts and vegetables before cooking them in the broth .
The first thing I have to say is kebabs and overcooked are synonymous . If you want all your meats and/or veggies to be cooked right , I would advise you to put each item on it 's own skewer so you can take them off as they are finished . As for a broiler and broiler plate functioning as a substitute for a grill , I would say that it wo n't be an exact substitute , but you will at least get the high temperature cooking and caramelization you would expect from a grill ( you will just be missing the smoke flavor ) .
If cooled and stored properly ( minimize air space in the container ) , most soups will should last in the refrigerator up to 5 days . Do you really want to be eating the same soup that long ? I would suggest dividing your soups into smaller sized containers and freezing it so you have a wide selection available at any given time . Depending on the ingredients most soups can be succesfully frozen for long term storage . Dairy based items are more likely to curdle/separate after thawing so you 'd be better to add the cream/milk when you 're reheating it . Chunks of potato or pasta are likely to break up a bit and have a more mealy consistency so it would also be better to leave the potato out and add to it and cook when reheating .
I 'd say it is a " matter of taste , " literally , because what comes out will change depending on how you process the vegetables . For example , despite the common use of carrots in stock , I feel like many chefs do n't actually want a real " carroty " flavor in stock . Quartering or roughly chopping a carrot is enough to give them plenty of " carrot notes " in their optimum flavor . Thus , my theory is that chefs often follow their particular chopping pattern to produce the balance of flavor that they want . If you chop things more finely , you may actually alter that balance . Anyhow , if your goal is maximum flavor extraction , then you 'll need to chop your carrot into finer pieces . ( You may then find that you need less carrot in your mix of vegetables . ) Other vegetables like onions do n't necessarily need fine chopping , since they already exist in relatively thin layers to allow circulation . If you quarter an onion , the liquid will already be able to infiltrate -- if you want even greater circulation , just break up those quarters into layers as you throw the onion in . And things like herbs , etc. do n't generally need to be chopped at all : just throw in whole sprigs , and they 'll provide most of their flavor after simmering even for a brief time . I would note that simmering time is also an issue here . Most chefs do n't cook vegetable stock for longer than an hour or so , since there 's no benefit ( as there is with meat stocks , where it can take hours for collagen to break down , etc. ) . In fact , by simmering too long , you can actually break down some of the more subtle flavor components , lose them to evaporation , or bury them in the more generic " overcooked " vegetable flavors . Thus , some recommend adding finely-textured herbs only briefly toward the end . ( That 's also the reason why a small amount of fresh herbs are often added as a garnish to a finished dish ; the flavor is greater and more noticeable than if they were cooked in for a long time . ) I 'm therefore somewhat skeptical of the method that used a blender before cooking , since that would cause a very fast breakdown of the vegetables and potentially unbalance the flavors . ( Some people do puree the vegetables after simmering and add them back for a more hearty or thicker broth/soup . ) In general , I 'd plan on simmering vegetable stock until the various vegetables are " done " ( soft ) and then going a bit longer , tasting it periodically until the flavor is rich and full . Chopping finer will release more flavor faster , but there is a limit because things will rapidly get " overcooked . " At that point you 'll be releasing less of the " bright " and " fresh " vegetable flavors that you get early on ; these flavors may start to break down or get lost , and eventually you 'll have more of a generic " vegetable mush " flavor .
I have had great results by taking individual garlic cloves and cutting the root end off each , but leaving them in their papery skins . Then you put those dry into a small saucepan ( ideally one with a thick bottom ) over low-to-medium heat . Put a lid on it , and let it go for 20 minutes or so , shaking vigorously every couple of minutes to turn the cloves over . When the cloves are really soft , you 're done . The paper skins protect the garlic cloves from burning , but the direct contact with the hot pan cooks them nicely . When you 're done you can squeeze the soft , roasted garlic goodness out of the root end of the skins . This is a particularly nice technique when you want roasted garlic flavor but only need a few cloves , not a whole head . The first time I did a recipe that called for this process , I was sure the garlic would scorch or the skins would catch fire , but it worked great .
According to <URL> , industrial and food grade CO2 generally come from the same plants : The slight difference between industrial-grade CO2 and food-grade CO2 is the type of tests that are done to qualify CO2 as beverage or beer gas-grade compared to industrial-grade . Currently , the FDA 's requirement for food-grade CO2 a 99.90 % purity rating . The other .09 % is made up of impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . Industrial grade CO2 is 99 % pure CO2 , also containing impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . However , the nature of those impurities extremely important . They go on to suggest : One impurity that all homebrewers should be aware of is benzene . Benzene is a no-no for homebrewers . If the CO2 that you are purchasing has high benzene levels , it will leave you and fellow drinkers with terrible headaches . When I say high levels , we are not talking about much . Benzene is usually an impurity that is referred to in PPB . The benzene level should be around 20 PPB . They suggest you ask for a profile of the impurities , although I suspect that Dick 's will be unable to comply . You will have to assess your own tolerance for risk , but you may better off seeking a more appropriate local vendor .
I do n't know that you 'd want to make a full meal of it , but it sounds like you 'd enjoy nutritional yeast . You can find it at any " health food store " type of grocery . It is deactivated , so you do n't need to worry about it filling you up with CO2 . The flavor is somewhat reminiscent of Parmesan cheese . Googling " nutritional yeast recipes " will give you plenty of ideas for what to do with it .
I think everyone agrees that " artisan " gets tossed around as a marketing term that is largely empty or vapid , referring as much to the " old world " images used on the bag than to the bread itself . However , I think there is an actual " artisan " quality to food , and that it relates to several qualities or ethics of the producer - which you do find in some actual bakeries : Develops their own recipes - an artisan baker should be developing recipes that meet their needs . If they do n't know enough to do that , then they are just following instructions . Tweaks recipes carefully over time to maximize the intended qualities of the bread . An " artisan " producer understands the variables that impact the quality of their product and constantly adjust them to keep the bread quality high , despite changing or variable ingredients . Follows the ethic of " Flavor Rules " , and flavor is the first priority . Of course they have to be a business-person as well , but recipe changes and enhancements should primarily be made to improve flavor , not reduce cost , improve packability , etc. . Has a real passion for what they are doing , and holds themselves to the highest standard . Artists are always the most critical of their own work , and are constantly looking for ways to improve . A home baker may not be an " artist " , but when I make " artisan breads " at home ( and I think this is what Peter R. is referring to ) , I do so with an intent to make the bread as good as I possibly can , even if this means baking it tomorrow instead of tonight , or ordering special flours online . I contrast this with my " makin ' dinner " baking , where I obviously want it to be good , but am willing to give up some perfection in order to get it done tonight . Neither method is inherently better , but they are undertaken with a different intent and process .
We take home-dehydrated cooked meat ( beef , chicken , ground beef ) along with spices , tomato leather to make tomato sauce , pasta , rice , dehyrated potato-and-sauce ( eg scalloped potatoes ) from the grocery store , home-dehydrated vegtables , and dried fruit . From that you can make stew , pasta-with-meat-sauce , curry-on-rice , and so on . You might also be interested in making your own english muffins since bread products squish and do n't keep well : <URL> . Backpacking is tougher than canoeing but as long as you can be sure of plenty of water , you should be fine with dried products . We usually bring a little frozen meat for the first night , and frozen bacon for the first morning , well wrapped in newspaper , but those might be too heavy when hiking .
I would use it for anything other than deep frying or high temperature frying . It would be great for anything that requires oil but not cooking , like hummus .
I do n't have any experience with frozen or canned pearl onions ( I assume canned because of the mention of draining ) , but I regularly cut and freeze 10lbs of onions at a time for ease of use later in the week/month ( more info on how/why <URL> ) . With these onions that I freeze myself , caramelization seems to be the same as it would be with fresh onions . I have n't done anything special when caramelizing with them , and there 's been no increase in necessary cooking time or decrease in flavor . If you really wanted to be safe , you could probably drop them in boiling water for a minute or two ( or defrost them on the counter for an hour ) , but with how long it 's going to take to caramelize anyway , I would think this extra step is unnecessary . Also : if you 're going to take the time to caramelize , but you 're short on time during the week after work/school/etc , I recommend making a huge batch and then freezing the resulting caramelized onions as well . Very handy !

Strictly speaking most gumbo recipes I am familiar with rely on the use of a roux as the primary thickening agent . Sure the okra contributes somewhat but in my experience using a darkened roux is what is called for . Please keep in mind that the more you cook the roux the less thickening power it has so you need to use a little more .
No , you 're not crazy . You have good taste . The reason for drinking darker beer like stouts and porters is for the flavor . If they are over-chilled , you lose most of that flavor . Do n't obsess over it , but in general a lot of people serve dark beer too cold . That said , you should drink your beer at whatever temperature makes you happy . There is nothing wrong with a nice cold pilsner or Hefe-wizen on a hot day .
No , it 's not . White vinegar ( also known as distilled vinegar ) is made of acetic acid diluted in distilled water . Its flavor is simple -- its just sour . Typical concentrations range from 5 -- 7 % acetic acid . White wine vinegar is made by allowing white wine to turn to vinegar . It has a much more complex flavor profile . It is also frequently less sour ( acidic ) than distilled white vinegar .
I 've tried unfermented birch sap before ( I got it at a local Russian supermarket ) . I was expecting it to taste somewhat like <URL> . Instead , it was surprisingly tasteless ; like <URL> , I suspect one would have to reduce/concentrate it quite significantly to get a pronounced birch flavor . It had the taste and consistency of a thin/diluted simple syrup with only a faint hint of birch flavor . I made a cocktail using birch sap and <URL> : a liquor modeled after a <URL> liquor called " root tea " that was the predecessor to <URL> ( which is , ironically , non-alcoholic ) , one of whose primary flavorings is birch bark . I forget what else ( if anything ) I put in it , but I seem to recall that it worked quite well . I asked a Russian friend of mine if he had ever heard of fermented birch sap . He said that , although birch sap ( " берёзовый сок " , if you ever want to find it in a Russian store ) is very popular in Russia , he has never heard of anyone fermenting it . However , he did add that " Russians would ferment anything ... " On a somewhat related note ( at the risk of going off topic ) , there is an extremely popular low-alcohol drink in Russia called <URL> ( квас ) which is made from fermented rye bread . Despite the fact that birch sap is also popular , every Russian for whom I 've served root beer or <URL> absolutely hates the stuff . Likewise , I love root/birch beer , however , I hated kvas the first time I tried it ( but I have since developed a taste for it , over time ) . I have developed this theory : Anyone who liked the taste of kvas the first time he/she tried it will undoubtedly dislike the taste of root/birch beer the first time he/she tries it . Likewise , Anyone who liked the taste of root/birch beer the first time he/she tried it will undoubtedly dislike the taste of kvas the first time he/she tries it . I have surveyed dozens of Eastern Europeans and Americans alike who have tried both , and I have yet to find a single person that invalidates my theory . Is there anyone out there who has tried both ?
Quite the opposite , large ginger rhizomes are more potent both in flavour and aroma , because those compounds take time in the ground to develop and accumulate ... There 's a Chinese proverb : " It 's the older ginger that 's got the punch / heat " , referring to wisdom of the elders / the experienced ... The younger rhizomes have a milder flavour , and a smoother texture ( the older ones are more fibrous ) so are used for pickling in both Chinese and Japanese cuisines ...
Onions always benefit from a few minutes on their own to soften and start sweetening . Garlic burns easily , especially when finely chopped or crushed , so in general should not be fried as long as onion . Having said that , when doing a quick stir fry or similar dish , you can throw in the garlic first for 10-20 seconds so that it flavours the oil .

How much citric acid is safe to use ?
According to ( US ) <URL> : ( c ) In accordance with § 184.1 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the ingredient is used in food with no limitations other than current good manufacturing practice . ( d ) Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived . Basically , you can eat the stuff by the spoon-full if you can stand the sour . If you 're adding a lot compared to how much you think you should have to add , you might consider Phosphoric acid instead . You get a little <URL> with that , and it too , within limits , is generally regarded as safe ( GRAS ) .
Propane and butane are pure alkanes . They do n't produce anything nasty when burned . The worst you could possibly get should be carbon monoxide ( and I am not even sure it can be produced in a torch , the dioxide ifs much more likely ) , but it being a gas , it wo n't stick to your food . The complex molecules you get from heating the food itself have more potential for being harmful than the combustion products of a propane butane torch . Ago yes , it is food safe . Another matter of safety is that it is easier to cause a fire with a hardware store torch , because it has more power than the kitchen ones . But a sensible adult should be able to handle the thing safely .
If it 's refrigerated , it 'll last for at least a week , as long as you did n't pre-dairy it . Unrefrigerated , I would n't trust it for more than a day . Coffee is a crappy growth medium and it should start out the next best thing to sterile , but , even covered , its going to start to get moldy . Obviously if you add dairy , then you 're dealing with that dairy shelf-life , and that is n't very long at all .
I probably would not recommend eating a box of baking soda and chasing that with shots of vinegar . But aside from that silliness , I ca n't think of a single thing that is actual " food " that is unsafe mixed with another actual " food " , assuming reasonable quantities . Certainly anything with alcohol can be dangerous in huge quantities , as can a lot of other ingredients . Allergies or food sensitivities can make certain ingredients dangerous to certain people . But mixing ingredients to which the individual has no special sensitivity and in normal quantities ? No , I do n't think you are risking anything by doing so other than unpleasant food .
It 's usually safe to eat the skins of potatoes . If there is a greenish tint under the skin , you 'll want to peel down to below the greenish bit . If you do n't , it could lead to solanine poisoning . See <URL> and <URL>
It can range on the size of the lemon and the time of year . A medium lemon will give 2-3 Tablespoons of juice , where a larger lemon can give 1/4 cup ( 4 Tablespoons ) . Just have to decide on much lemon flavor you want in your recipe as to which number you pick .
In short , the answer is no , it is NOT safe . <URL> It 's tempting to lop off the fuzzy patch , but the mold could have spread already . " Once you 're able to see mold on bread , it means there 's quite a lot of mold , " said Nelken , a food consultant in Woodland Hills , California . " It 's indicative that there 's mold on other slices , just not at the level you can see it . Why jeopardize your health on a slice of bread ? " Nelken likened mold to jellyfish . " Even though you scrape off the head of the jellyfish , the tentacles are still in the food product . " Eating moldy bread could cause an upset stomach . Although most molds are innocuous , it 's probably not going to taste good , food experts said . The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends discarding moldy bread and baked goods , because of their porous texture .
It 's safe because freezing greatly slows ( if not completely arrests ) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil . It does n't kill them , it just puts them in ' stasis ' . The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated . If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date , best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP , and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting . The main hazard is in that defrosting . At no point should the chicken ( any part thereof ) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours . The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge . You can also defrost it under cold running water , providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark . Of course , you can also cook the meat straight from frozen . There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts . Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe , especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat . You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature ( 170 ° F/75 ° C ) .
According to <URL> , a very common yeast brand in the US : The strip contains three packets ; each packet in the strip is considered one package . Each package contains 1/4 oz . or 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast . This is approximately 7 grams , or 11 ml . This is representative of all of the US brands .
Rare duck meat is safe to eat because it does NOT contain the same risk of Salmonella as does chicken meat . Primarily because ducks , as mentioned above , have not traditionally been raised in the same squalid conditions as " factory raised " chickens - salmonella is a disease that is primarily transmitted through dirt/dirty unclean conditions . Now , on the other hand , as more and more ducks are being raised in industrial conditions , they are also becoming more likely to contain strains of Salmonella .
I 'd suggest <URL> as a starting point . They specifically investigated the food safety of chicken in 2010 and found that ( among other things ) : Campylobacter was in 62 percent of the chickens , salmonella was in 14 percent , and both bacteria were in 9 percent . Only 34 percent of the birds were clear of both pathogens . That 's double the percentage of clean birds we found in our 2007 report but far less than the 51 percent in our 2003 report . Store-brand organic chickens had no salmonella at all , showing that it 's possible for chicken to arrive in stores without that bacterium riding along . But as our tests showed , banishing one bug does n't mean banishing both : 57 percent of those birds harbored campylobacter . Among all brands and types of broilers tested , 68 percent of the salmonella and 60 percent of the campylobacter organisms we analyzed showed resistance to one or more antibiotics . The same issue seems to come up over and over again in food safety questions , and I really ca n't stress this enough : Salmonella is not the only dangerous bacteria in food . <URL> is just <URL> and produces heat-resistant enterotoxins that simply put , can make you very , very sick . Perfringens is also common , and <URL> . I 've seen a number of articles and blogs claiming that people " worry too much " and most of them cite Ippuku in SF , which generated quite a stir by serving chicken tartare . It 's legal in many countries for a restaurant to serve raw or undercooked food , provided that there is informed consent ( the customer is specifically informed or specifically orders that their food be undercooked ) . However , legal is a very long way from safe , especially when we 're talking about raw meat . Steak tartare is more acceptable because , for some reason , <URL> and the incidence of E.coli is <URL> at only 0.26 % . Raw beef is n't totally safe but most healthy people who eat it will not have complications afterward . So , to summarize : Raw chicken : ~ 20 % salmonella ( depending on source ) , ~ 60 % campylobacter ( any source ) Raw beef : Less than 0.1 % e.coli , ~ 2 % campylobacter ( any source ) Conclusion : If you eat raw beef ( steak tartare ) , you 're a risk-taker . If you eat raw chicken , you have a death wish . Just say no . At an absolute minimum , please do n't serve this to your dinner guests with assurances that it will be safe . What you do to your own body is your decision to make , but it would be grossly irresponsible to serve anything made with raw chicken to anyone who has n't been made fully aware of the risks . P.S. . Some of this data may be U.S. specific , but the problem is worldwide . For example : A <URL> showed a 36.7 % contamination rate for salmonella and 84.3 % for campylobacter , ( thanks TFD ! ) . A <URL> showed a 37.5 % incidence rate for salmonella and 75 % for campylobacter . So do n't expect to be safer simply because you do n't live in the U.S. . If you 're planning on doing this , you should check what your country 's regulations and current statistics are regarding salmonella , campylobacter , C. perfringens , and listeria , for farms and plants producing chicken meat . That is your actual risk . Buying " organic " might help , or might not , since organic is currently not a true legal or regulatory category in most regions .
Official : No definitive answer , there are different governing bodies and plastic wraps ( cling films ) in the US/Europe . There are also different plastic wraps for different purposes , microwave safe , safe for use with fatty foods , so on . Whether its safe or not will depend on the product used and most likely the time boiled for . The UKs Food Standard Agency <URL> - " Do not use cling films where they may melt into the food , such as in conventional ovens or with pots and pans on cooker hobs " . The cling film industry are understandably much more <URL> . Practical : I 've poached eggs using cling film for ages and I 'm still here . Read the plastic wrap boxes for warnings and choose the plastic wrap that 's most suited . Poach an egg as described <URL> ( as of 2016 , link requires registration to read ) and check if the wrap comes away cleanly , If so you 're good . I 'd revisit this advice if your recipe called for cooking like this for longer than 5-10 minutes , there are likely more suitable products/recipes for extensive boil-in-the-bag manoeuvres .
Yes it is completely safe . It is even <URL> . • To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration , and stains from using too high of a heat , we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper 's Friend . Bar Keeper 's Friend even has a cookware specific cleanser , <URL> . I 'm not sure of the difference between this and their regular cleanser , since they are n't required to list ingredients , but it is marketed specifically for cookware , and priced equivalently . Other manufacturers recommend this product as well , as noted on the <URL> page . You should also check out <URL> on how to remove brown stains . The accepted answer there is BKF . If you have something particularly terrible that BKF ca n't handle , you can always use <URL> , though I daresay your wife will say no to this . :-)
My italian grandma does it , but says to really make sure they dry out . You can dry them out and then freeze them , if it makes you feel any less hesitant .
I ended up measuring the scoop spoon the next time I was in the US , and it turned out to be 1 Tablespoon .
Are you using non-stick cookware ? Beware because there is a well-documented medical effect caused by the fumes released when various non-stick components are heated starting at about 300 ° F ( 149 ° C ) and beyond . <URL> You should always have something in a non-stick pan when it is over a flame .
Taken out of context , that does n't make much sense , but I can think of several similar claims you might have heard - all of which are true and most can be found on the <URL> and the sites of most other agencies : Perishable food should not be left in the " danger zone " ( 4.4 ° C - 60 ° C or 40 ° F to 140 ° F ) ( room temperature ) for more than a total of 2 hours ; 1 hour if the temperature is above 32 ° C / 90 ° F ( mouth/gut temperature ) . Freezing does not reset this countdown , it only stops it temporarily . Thus , it is not a safe practice to thaw and refreeze food several times ( especially if it 's being brought above refrigerator temperatures ) . Cooking does reset the countdown , but unless you are in a completely sterile environment ( hint : you are n't ) , you still have to keep food out of the danger zone after cooking , which is why guidelines say to refrigerate within 2 hours . Most people reheat their food to " warm " or even " hot " but not cooking temperature . Unless you reheat to an internal temperature of 74 ° C / 165 ° F , then all that time in the danger zone after cooking is cumulative . So if you do what most people do and reheat food to 40 ° -50 ° C , a nice comfortable eating temperature , then you 'd better either ( a ) only reheat the portion you plan to eat , and/or ( b ) throw out any uneaten portion instead of putting it back in the fridge . Really it 's all about the cumulative amount of time , since being fully cooked , that the food has spent in the danger zone . Theoretically , if you boiled the same piece of chicken every 12 hours and quick-froze it immediately afterward , it would stay safe indefinitely . It would also have no flavour or texture left , so I do n't recommend it . Since most people do n't carefully measure the internal temperature of food when they reheat it , we have the " best practice " of only reheating perishable food once after it 's been cooked , because otherwise it gets really hard to estimate how much time is left on that metaphorical clock . And , obviously , do n't leave it in the fridge for more than a few days , because it can still spoil in there , just slower .
My first instinct was no way , remembering that the branches and leaves contain a high amount of <URL> , which is a neurotoxin and not without risks , especially if used over a long time or while pregnant . This is the same stuff that caused absinthe to be discredited for decades . But Thuja oils typically contain 40 % α-thujon , sage ( salvia officinalis ) up to 60 % . Thuja 's pungent smell would prevent ingesting too much . So my conclusion would be : do not use for a long time or when pregnant ( most midwives caution against using sage , too , btw . ) use sparingly for health reasons , a limited amount is considered safe by health agencies world wide , <URL> for example . use very sparingly for culinary reasons , because the taste is quite " pronounced " . I had to take a herbal medicine with thuja decades ago and still shudder to think of it . ( It did work , though ... ) When thinking of potential culinary uses , think of uses for sage or juniper - you will want to use it as a spice in foods that can " handle " the woody , bitter tinge . Dark red meat or even game perhaps ? Complement with a generous amount of pepper and perhaps a good red wine . Another approach that might be worth a try is sweetening it up - like " fir syrup " ( is this known in American cuisine ? ) .
On another couple of sites ( <URL> for starters ) I found the answer to this . It appears that mould is expected sometimes in the Pancetta making process and as a general rule of thumb as long as it is n't too green and furry then it should be OK . I 've followed Ruhlman 's advice and dabbed the spots of mould with a vinegar soaked cloth and it wiped straight off and looks fine . My meat was coming up to the end of it 's hanging time anyway so rather than worry about it further I 've refrigerated it . I hope this helps anyone that stumbles across this with the same issue .

How to roast peanuts for peanut butter ?
If you 're going to roast the peanuts , definitely roast them before grinding . Do like you would any other nuts : in the oven , maybe 350F , spread out not too deep in a pan , until they smell toasty and nutty , making sure not to burn them . If you ground them into peanut peanut butter , and then tried to roast it , it 'd be a lot tougher to roast . You 'd have to spread it out in a thin layer on a pan , since if it 's thick only the surface would really roast . You 'd have to be really careful about overroasting , since you wo n't be able to directly see if the bottom is scorching . And then you 'll have to scrape out the pan to try not to waste any , and still have a greasy pan to clean up . Roasting before , on the other hand , is easy . There 's space for air between the peanuts so they 'll all roast . You can easily give them a stir if you need to , and see directly whether they 're burning . And the pan will basically still be clean when you 're done . Whether or not to remove the skins is mostly down to personal preference . You will end up with flecks of skin in the peanut butter , so if that bothers you , remove them . If you 're really sensitive ( and eating the peanut butter mostly by itself ) it 's possibly you 'd notice a texture difference too . But they wo n't taste bad ( some people even think they improve the flavor ) , so do whatever you feel like ! If you do want to remove the skins , you can and should wait til after roasting : they should be much looser and easier to remove after roasting . You might even be able to get a lot off simply by putting them in a bowl or colander and shaking . Otherwise , putting them in a kitchen towel and rubbing around should work pretty well .
Take double cream ( you want a 48 % milk fat , which is hard to get in the U.S. outside of a specialty market ; heavy cream has a 30-40 % milk fat content ) and shake it . Forever . To be more specific , after sealing your double cream in , say , a jam jar , shake it until you hear the sloshing sound of butter forming ( which will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour ) ; drain the liquid off and then rinse the butter until the water runs clearly over it . Squeeze your butter ( I use cheese cloth or a linen napkin for this ) to rid it of excess liquid ( excess liquid can lead to rancidity ) , shape it into a block , and wrap it with wax paper .
I learned that the flame on the gas stove was to strong so I will try lowering the flame .
Lamb meat is tougher and more fatty than your typical beef roast . 2 cups of red wine is a lot of acidic liquid and that can eat away at the meat as to tenderize it . Your mother may be right , some beef stock to thin out the alcohol may in fact do the trick . Also , rotating the roast would be a good idea as well since a beef roast will dry out at the top because it 's not as fatty as lamb . I would typically rotate my roast every now and again if I 'm not using an electric rotisserie . I definitely recommend an electric rotisserie for beef roasts .
From <URL> : Rotisserie is a style of roasting where meat is skewered on a spit -- a long solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire , or roasted in an oven . A spit is a long solid rod :) ( as confirmed by <URL> )
If you just want to change the color - just some <URL> should be fine . If you ca n't find it in a store locally , you can always see if a bakery that does cakes will give you just a tiny bit or if they 'll blend a few colors to make a dark gray .
That great taste comes from the compounds produced by the <URL> . It not one reaction but many that occur when the building blocks of proteins and sugars react as food is heated . Many new compounds are produced giving the cooked food a richer range of flavors . The <URL> produced by the Maillard reaction give roasted peanuts their characteristic aroma , in particular <URL> . To produce pyrazines , you need to heat your peanuts above 70C , with 110C to 170C ( 230F - 340F ) suggested by most cookbooks . For unshelled peanuts at 110C it can take up to ten minutes for the amount of pyrazines produced to reach its peak . If the peanuts are not dry , you may need to add up to 20 minutes of oven time ( longer on a tawa ) at a lower temperature to dry them . Color will be your guide . The flavor of the pyrazines will be masked by oxidizing oils in the peanuts , so keeping them in an airtight container helps preserve that nutty-cracker-peanut flavor .
1 . The main nutrients destroyed by heating are vitamins from B complex and vitamin C ( possible loss 50-70 % ) . ( <URL> ) . The extent of this effect depends on the temperature , so roasting in oil can have more negative effect than cooking in water . 2 . Minerals , such as potassium , are not destroyed by heating , but they can leak into the cooking water . So , boiled potatoes can have less potassium than roasted . Boiled potatoes , in skin ( 1/2 cup , 78 g ) : 296 mg ( <URL> ) Baked potatoes , in skin [ should be similar to roasted , I could n't find ] : ( 80 g ) : 440 mg ( <URL> ) A side note : sodium partially counteracts the effects of potassium in your body , so if you worry about potassium intake you may also worry about salt intake . ( <URL> ) 3 . Oil slows down stomach emptying thus slowing carbohydrate absorption and therefore lowering the glycemic index of a given roasted vegetable . Anyway , this sounds as overthinking to me . From the other viewpoint , roasted foods are heavier for the stomach , so they can increase the discomfort after meals . 4 . Heating disinfects foods and makes them more digestible . I 'm not aware that roasting in oil would be better in this regard than boiling in water . Roasted potatoes will retain more potassium than the boiled ones , but this alone is not already a " beneficial health effect . " On the other hand you may consume more calories than intended vegetables roasted on oil . 5 . Cooking , cooling and reheating can increase the amount of resistant starch in the food ; this would , obviously , have a significant effect only in starchy vegetables ( potatoes , red kidney beans , chickpeas ) rather in greens ( <URL> ) . I have not found any reliable information about significant health benefits of resistant starches , anyway . My conclusion : I do not consider roasting healthier than cooking in water ( boiling ) : more vitamins destroyed , heavier stomach after meals , greater unnecessary calorie intake from oil .
In the <URL> , Madhur says one of the few uses she 's found for a plain microwave oven is to roast cashews . She dresses them in a little bit of oil , then spreads them out on a plate in a single layer and cooks them in the microwave oven until they turn brown . I assume dressing them in a little bit of oil helps browning . I found <URL> for cashews and other nuts , but which implies the oil contained in the nuts themselves is enough to get them to brown . And finally , about.com has a page which is specifically about <URL> .
Oil is hydrogenated by bubbling hydrogen through it at high temperature ( on the order of 400 to 500 degrees F ) , in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel . Air is 0.00005 % hydrogen , you are probably not using temperatures high enough , nor doing it for a significantly long period of time , nor having an appropriate catalyst present . The amount of hydrogenation introduced via this recipe is somewhere between none and vanishingly small . However , coconut oil itself is about 92 % saturated fat -- which means the fats are naturally saturated with hydrogen . While a natural saturated fat , not a manufactured one , coconut oil is saturated . If your recipe is delicious and you enjoy it , eat up in moderation like anything else ( chocolate excepted ) . :-)
It means the butter is made from cream that has n't been fermented . Butter made from fermented cream is known as " cultured cream butter " , and it has distinct sour , lactic acid notes . Sweet cream butter tastes , well , sweet , and if it is from really good fresh milk you may be able to taste grassy notes . Both are good in their own way .
Try a <URL> . This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time ( weeks , not days ) .
It actually depends on the quality of the shortening you 're able to get . You might think they 're all the same , but you 'd be wrong . When I was taught how to make pies , we used shortening , and the crusts were perfect . However , I was told that for home baking , the shortening you buy in supermarkets ( Crisco , normally ) just is n't going to cut it and to use Tenderflake ( lard ) instead . I actually verified this once and found out that he was right - using the exact same technique , the supermarket shortening just did n't turn out the way the " industrial " shortening did . The crust is always too mealy and dry and tastes " off " somehow . Unless a lot has changed in the past 5 years , lard is actually much closer to the good shortening that 's being used in bakeries . Butter would , obviously , impart a much richer flavour than shortening , but I would n't use just butter in a fruit pie . You wo n't get anywhere near the flakiness of shortening or lard . Half-and-half is a decent compromise , but the result is neither as flavourful nor as flaky as lard . So , generally , I would stick to lard . You could take plor 's suggestion and mix it with some butter , but I 've found that the flavour and texture is very good with just lard ; if you do decide to mix , be careful not to overdo it , otherwise you 'll lose all the wonderful flakiness that the lard imparts ( I 'd recommend 75 % lard ) . Do n't mix lard with shortening . That can only take away from all aspects of the quality , and unless you 're worried about nutrition ( in which case , why are you using lard at all , or eating pie for that matter ? ) then there 's absolutely no reason to " taint " the lard this way . P.S. Do n't forget to add some sugar . A little goes a long way in pie crusts .
Coffee taste is indeed subjective . However , there are some things you can look for since the added pressure ( versus drip ) can force extraction of flavours you do n't like . Below are some of the drivers ( Disclaimer , I do n't use the Aeropress ) : Oily beans : Towards the end of the roasting process the coffee oil can seep out ( sweat ) and you end up with beans that look wet . This may turn out ok taste with drip coffee , not so much for espresso types . Roast Colour : Drip coffee roasts tend to actually be darker and most espresso roasts are usually lighter in colour ( see illy or LaVazza Oro ) . This may be to compensate for the forces of added pressure extracting deeper and more into the bean . There are exceptions to this ( Bar Mexico in Naples uses dark roast but on a manual lever machine ) . Bean Type : Aeropress might handle some robusta ( similar to Muka ) as opposed to pure Arabica . More than 40 % and imo your coffee will taste like earth . Grind Size : Each bean type and locale and roast level will require minute grinder setting changes . You can make the best roasted beans taste awful with the wrong grind . Try varying your grind from fine to super fine and experiment . Usually the higher pressure requires finer grind with the exception of turkish coffee . Dosage : To the get right extraction , a balance of pressure , grind size , and dosage is required . Good cafes measure their dosage to ~ 0.1 gram when setting their grinder . If you find the coffee starting to clear up too fast in your extraction try increasing the dose .
Dude you said you have cast iron . Cast iron rules . And it performs very well in the oven . No contest against glass and you can make pan sauce on the stove-top after the roasting is finished . My favorite pan to make roast chicken with is my 12 " Lodge cast iron skillet . Glass is probably better at roasting than cheap cookie style sheets , because it keeps the heat distribution fairly smooth . But glass will not hold up well to heavy roasting use and will eventually ruin your dinner when it cracks or shatters . All Clad makes a great roasting pan with wire rack . But for most roasting a simple cast iron skillet works well and is indestructible .
Peanut butters that are not " all natural " include cheaper oils along with sugar and emulsifiers to keep the mixture from separating and to make it lighter and smoother . That lack of emulsifiers could make a huge difference but it depends a lot on the recipe . In a normal cookie dough fat is creamed with sugar and eggs are beaten in one at a time which adds a ton of emulsification power from the lecithin in the yolks . Additionally - the fat will bind with the flour and be baked into the cookies . Like Jefromi - I have not had any problem with the fat from natural peanut butter separating out after baking . If you made a cookie dough and either left out the yolks or did n't beat it well enough to properly emulsify - and then let the batter sit out for a while before baking I would fully expect the peanut oil to separate .
You 've pretty much answered your own question . Put the PB in a blender , drizzle in a little peanut oil , blitz and season to taste with salt and a little sugar if you want it . I 'd add them all slowly : you can always add , you ca n't take away .
I 'm familiar with the preparation of what the Portuguese call <URL> and <URL> ( the former being a clam , the later a cockle ) . A general advice upfront : make sure that cockles in your region at this season are safe to eat as shellfish tend to accumulate potential harmful substances in their tissue . Cleaning with seawater I ( or already the fishermen that collected the cockles ) usually put them in a container with seawater which was changed every five or six hours . The more often you repeat this procedure the less sand you 'll have in your meal ( however , even in restaurants it is not uncommon to find a bit of sand ) . You do n't want to keep them in there longer than a day though . Keep them out of direct sunlight . Refrigeration generally is not necessary for half a day to a day . Afterwards discard all individuals that are open ( = dead ) and use the remaining cockles to prepare your meal . Cleaning with freshwater I have never put them into freshwater , therefore here only a guess : theoretically you can simulate seawater by adding the right amount of salt . You 'll miss all other elements though , including nutrition , and therefore will generate stress for the cockles which will likely impede their ability to filter water ( = clean ) and survive . I advice you to use seawater if you have access . A recipe A Portuguese recipe includes white wine , a fair amount of garlic , parsley and olive oil . Heat the olive oil in a pot , cut the garlic in half or quarters ( not too small ) and add them to the pot . Once they are precooked add the cockles and the white wine . Put a lid . Once the cockles are open they are ready to eat ( some will not open - Discard closed cockles ) . Add the parsley when nearly all the cockles are open and cook for a minute more . Eat them straight out of the shell , maybe with a bit of lemon juice . Use bread to enjoy the cooked white wine mixture . Eat the garlic , it should taste delicious .
Nutella is over half sugar by weight ; peanut butter might be more like 5-10 % depending on brand/style . That already sounds like enough that it wo n't make a good one-for-one substitution in most things , especially anything that 's not already pretty sweet . It probably also means that it 'll have a slightly different resulting texture ; nutella is already a bit less thick ( probably again affected by the sugar ) , and I believe this is pretty obvious when heated , though it 's been a while since I tried .
There is no single answer to this question . Instead , a number of factors ( not including the weather ) affect the perceived tenderness or moistness of a steak or other cut of meat . Overview There are two major factors that effect the perceived moistness of a steak or other cut of meat : The amount of connective tissue . The more connective tissue the meat has , the tougher and chewier it will be , at least until the collagen that composes the connective tissue is converted to gelatin The temperature to which the cut is cooked . The higher the temperature , up to about 165 F , the more different types of proteins are denatured and coagulated , squeezing out moisture , leading to a dryer , tougher mouth feel . Additionally , some minor factors contribute to or enhance perceived tenderness or moistness : Cutting the meat against the grain enhances the perception of tenderness . Marinating in an acid or enzymatically active marinade may enhance tenderness Mechanically processing , cutting , or pounding the meat ( as in a cube steak ) to disrupt its fibers can enhance tenderness . Connective Tissue The more an animal uses a muscle , the more connective tissue that muscle will contain . For example , the shoulder of the animal is usually worked very hard ( it has to keep the animal standing up ) for pigs and cows , so it has a low of connective tissue . Other muscles are used rarely , such as the tenderloin , and do n't develop very much connective tissue . The connective tissue is composed of a protein called collagen , which is tough and rubbery , and makes cuts high in it seem much tougher than those which are not . However , with certain types of cooking , collagen can be converted to gelatin , and convert from being tough to being unctuous and soft . Temperature As the temperature in the steak rises , more and more proteins tighten and denature , squeezing out moisture , resulting in a drier , tougher mouth feel . Various groups of proteins denature at different temperatures , so the higher the internal temperature , the more moistness will be squeezed out , and the drier and tougher the steak will seem . By the time the cut reaches about 165 F , all of the proteins are denatured , and it is fully well done , and as tough as it will be . According to <URL> : 122 ° F - Myosin protein in mammal meat begins to denature . 130-135 ° F - Target temp for medium rare lamb chops and beef steaks , the temperature at which they are at optimum tenderness , flavor , and juiciness . 130-140 ° F - Fats begin to melt and render ( liquefy ) . This is a slow process and can take hours . 140 ° F - Collagens begin to contract and squeeze juice from within muscle fibers into the spaces between the fibers and out to the surface . 140 ° F - Myoglobin denatures rapidly and red or pink juices begin to turn clear or tan and bead up on the surface . 150 ° F - Actin protein begins to denature making meat tougher and drier . 155 ° F - Well done for most meats . Most ( but not all ) bacteria killed in less than 30 seconds but spores can survive to much higher temps . High Connective Tissue Cuts When cuts are high in connective tissue , the same toughening and drying that occurs in low connective cuts happens as the internal temperature rises to about 165 F. However , starting at about 170-180 F , a new process begins to engage : the collagen ( the very protein that made these cuts tougher to start with ) begins to transform in the presense of water into gelatin , a different protein . The gelatin lubricates the meat , and gives it a newly unctuous and moist mouth-feel , despite being very well done . It takes time for gelatin conversion to occur : it is not enough to simply bring the internal temperature to 180 F . It has to stay there for several hours for the conversion to have enough time to take place . This gelatin conversion is what makes slow cooking methods like braising and barbecuing so effective for tough cuts of meat . They are cooked until quite well done ( when they would be extremely tough ) , but then the conversion of the collagen to gelatin makes them much softer , and unctuous , so that they are again perceived as moist and tender . Sadly , it will not work on cuts that were fairly tender to begin with , as there is little collagen to convert to gelatin . Slicing Against the Grain Additionally , while a minor factor , the way the meat is cut into bite sized portions also effects the perception of toughness . Muscles are bundles of cells that are aligned in the same direction , like a bundle of straws . They are very , very strong in the direction that the fibers align ( along the straws ) , but not as strong against that direction ( across the straws ) . If sliced against the direction of the grain of the meat , so that the straws are cut in half , the the impression is that the meat is more tender . For example , in fajitas , the traditional flank steak or skirt steak is cooked to no more than medium rare to medium ( to minimize the toughness

What 's the best way to defrost ice-cream/sorbet quickly ?
The best way ? Plan better . :) The microwave is rarely a good plan for quick defrosting , as you found out . I would suggest putting the container in warm to hot running tap water . The warmer the water is the faster it will melt , but it will also melt more unevenly - though nothing like the microwave . The important part is that the water is running , and is at least room temperature . It 's not going to be quick like a microwave , but it 'll be faster than just letting it sit . Edit I 've never tried this , but I imagine a hair dryer might work well too . It 'll just be noisier :) The concept is the same , just moving air instead of water .
Use a carbon-steel wok ! The shape works very well to keep the unpopped kernels in the hot oil , while the popped kernels end up on the cooler sides . I usually use about 2 T of oil and 1/3 c of popcorn to make enough for two people . If you want to keep with the Chinese theme , Szechuan peppercorn-salt goes extremely well on popcorn ! To make it , grind Szechuan peppercorns and kosher salt in a spice grinder .
If you just need the pulp ( for pie , ice cream , jam , etc. . . ) then cook them down and run them through a food strainer . If you need them raw , or halved/skins on , then find a good audiobook ...
The softness of ice cream is going to depend on a variety of factors : Use of gums and other binding agents , amount of sugar , the amount of fat , and especially the amount of " overrun " ( air ) that is churned into it during the freezing process . Less expensive ice creams will usually have a softer " chewier " texture than premium ice creams due to more gums and a great amount of air being churned into it to increase volume . More air = more volume = more yield for the same amount of ingredients used .
In the UK , single cream is a milk product with at least 18 % butterfat . Double cream has 48 % butterfat . Neither are common in the US . If you can find clotted cream , which is 55 % fat , then there is a chance of making double cream at home by diluting it . As some clotted creams have a cooked taste , there may be other solutions .
I have not tried <URL> myself , but it sounds reasonable . It involves filling a clean milk carton or juice container with water , freezing it and then bashing it against a wall to crush the ice . I guess the container has to be quite sturdy to take the beating without breaking . Could be worth a try .
Thank you very much for your help ! I eventually decided to get <URL> ( Genius Salad Chef Junior ) . Works like a charm . Here 's what I 've tried it with : Cucumbers - great Tomatoes - works , but a bit hard to push through completely Apples - great Cheese - very hard to push through , but works Carrots - great Smoked salmon - does n't work It should be sufficient for most salads . The bowl is sealable and can be used to store several portions .
Place on non-stick sprayed foil ; broil for ~ 4 minutes in oven with some source of moisture or a glaze over top ( ie , you might take salmon and add a soy/mustard glaze ) to protect hydration levels .
Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate . I 've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste , but because frankly , I like to play with fire . But lets assume that there is a taste difference , identify where the differences comes from , and how to address them : The smoke from charcoal . This is ( if you 've been using natural lump charcoal ) pretty much just wood smoke . If you 've been using briquettes you 'll also get the smoke of the filler and such , but generally this is n't desirable and we do n't want to replicate it . For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like <URL> . Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner , it should start smoking . Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals , and rising back up to flavor the food . This used to be a big advantage to charcoal , but its largely minimized by new gas grills with ' vapor bars ' . As long as your grill has one of these , you 're in luck . Otherwise , there 's not a good , safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it . Its a long bar usually running the length of burners . Lighter fluid taste . Another undesirable flavor if you 're doing a particular ( and not good IMO ) kind of charcoal grilling . Frankly , its not one you 're likely to miss . Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them . Nowadays the biggest is definitely # 1 , but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially ' porous ' . If you 're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts , I would n't bother if smoke . If you 're doing burgers - maybe/probably . If you 're doing thick steaks , thick pork chops , a whole chicken , or anything that 's going on awhile , then creating some smoke is definitely worth it . ( " Liquid smoke " definitely does n't taste like the real thing . )
The two main issues with ground coffee are : The coffee losing its aroma . The aroma/flavor of coffee is quite volatile , and will evaporate very easily . The solution to this is an airtight container , with as little head room in it as possible . The coffee soaking up moisture from the air . This makes the coffee ... unpleasant . The best solution I 've found ( in a hot humid climate ) is to put it in the freezer . It is the nature of refrigeration to leech all of the moisture from the freezer compartment . In summary , the best I 've found is a small airtight box in the freezer .
Yes , actually , there are two magic ingredients : <URL> and <URL> . Guar gum is a thickener , but in small quantities can also prevent the growth of ice crystals which would cause the ice cream to harden into icicles . Xanthan gum is a stabilizer which helps keep air ( called overrun ) in the mixture . Air is generally churned into ice cream by ice cream machines , but it wo n't stay that way without the stabilizer .
Well , yes and no . A lot of recipes for semifreddo are n't truly semifreddo because they are hard frozen . Recipes like that can be fried just like ice cream . The key to fried ice cream is to hard freeze the scoops of ice cream . By definition , that is n't semifreddo , but definitions do n't seem to matter much to writers of recipes . So , if the " stuff " is hard frozen , it can be coated and fried like fried ice cream . Perhaps after being deep fried , the name " semifreddo " is more apropos .
Clean it immediately , before anything has a chance to dry . As soon as I 'm done grating anything , I run the grater under water and wipe it with a sponge . Wipe with the direction of the blades , then run a little water inside it . Optional : put the grater in the dishwasher to clean fully .
This is what we figured out at Serious Eats : <URL> In sum , use more sugar , whip the cream , freeze in icecube trays and run through a Cuisinart at the end .
An oven is the way to go . Toasting on a frying pan is a pain because you have to stand there shaking it for so long and it is far to easy to scorch if you pause . I have seen some recipes call for low oven temps but I use 350F ( 175C ) for 10 to 15 minutes stirring a few times . Some sources online recommend as low as 5 minutes but I personally have not ever had them done that quickly . They still have to be checked or they will burn . I like to use my toaster oven because it heats up faster and is cheaper to run . I have used an air popcorn popper with good results . Do n't overfill it and remove them when they smell nutty . It goes very fast but you have to do them in batches if you have many . For a pie or other sweet applications , I like to toss the nuts in butter and brown sugar and let them candy in the oven . The fat makes it harder to burn them . Obviously this wo n't fit for all recipes . I personally have not had good results using the microwave . Some people swear by it but it seems to me to make them a little gummy .
The key is how you expect the person to eat it . Some garnishes are not for eating at all - the sprig of mint or entire stalk of rosemary that the eater is expected to just remove and set aside . I do n't do this - and plenty of judges on plenty of cooking shows have intoned " never put anything on the plate that I am not supposed to eat " - but if you do , make it as large as possible and just one piece so it 's easy to remove . Assuming I 'm supposed to eat it , am I supposed to get a little in each bite ? Cut it up small . Am I supposed to get rather a lot in each bite ? Leave it bigger . Is it a herb that tastes different chopped than whole ? If so , which way do you want it to taste ? If the item is picked up to eat ( eg an hors d'oeuvre ) then typically you leave the pieces larger so they 're less likely to cascade off . Search for images of chive garnish and you 'll see tons of teeny little pieces on a tomato salad , and single or double 2 " pieces draped across a devilled egg . Above all , practice and confidence . If you know why you 're putting parsley , mint , cilantro or chives on the plate at the last minute , you 'll also know what size , how many , and whether they are in one little pile or all over . And when you know all that you 'll bring out the plate with confidence .
Heating it up in the microwave will temporarily make it runnier , but then it will go back to its original consistency . Here are some ways that may work for you : Add some neutral flavored oil : just a bit though or it will get greasy Add chocolate syrup : chocolate syrup is very runny will thin it out while still keeping the chocolate flavor . Hershey 's is available in the US and UK , Tate and Lyle makes one in the UK . Not sure where you are but there will likely be something available If you ca n't find chocolate syrup try making a very thick chocolate milk with some cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder
I usually grate my jaggery block on a microplane grater although your standard cheese grater will work too . I have n't tried a food processor yet , although that would probably work . Next time I 'm going to get granulated palm sugar as I 've found working with a jaggery block too much hassle .
If corn syrup works , it seems to me that simple syrup ( i.e. a saturated solution of sugar and water ) ought to work , too .
In professional smoothie/frozen youghurt/fruit shake shops , you 'll usually see the fruit frozen in small pieces for easy portioning . So raspberrys and blueberrys are fine , but you 'd wnat to quarter strawberrys and cube mangoes or apples or kiwis or whatever before freezing them . The freezing process itself is important to the strucutral integrity of the fruit , and will affect its texture . However , if you only want them for smoothies/blended drinks , that is n't very important . As a usage note , remember that a home freezer compartment is usually at -4 degrees Celsius , whereas a chest freezer ( deep freeze ) would more commonly be at -18 degrees . A good blender wo n't mind either way , but your lips might find it a bit cold . Also , you might find you can buy the fruit pre-frozen from the same vendors the shops get them , in which case it will be prepared for you , and all you need is to defrost and blend . Aside from saving you the work of peeling and chopping , their freezing process may be better , and it 'll probably end up being cheaper too .

Difference between fermentation and leavening ?
Leavening is rising by any means , so baking soda and baking powder ( chemical leaveners ) both apply here , as does yeast ( fermentation ) . Chemical leaveners like baking soda and powder work by mixing an acid ( varies , depending on the recipe ) and base ( usually baking soda in some form ) to produce carbon dioxide gas . Fermentation is the process of yeast converting sugars to carbon dioxide and alcohol . In bread making , the carbon dioxide is the desired product . In beer or wine making , the exact opposite . In both cases ( beer/wine and bread ) , other byproducts produced by the yeast add flavour and are highly desirable . There are other types of fermentation by bacteria ( such as those used in yogurt-making , pickles , or sauerkraut ) that produce lactic acid ; but those are somewhat outside of the scope of this answer ( although lactic acid fermentation by bacteria is responsible for the taste of sourdough breads ) . To specifically answer your question - yes , yeast breads undergo fermentation ( which is also leavening ) . Quick breads like banana bread use chemical leaveners , which are not fermentation .
Normal double-acting baking powder makes CO2 ( thus giving a rising effect ) in two ways : when it gets wet , and when it is heated . Baking soda only makes CO2 when it gets wet . From Wikipedia : The acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting . [ 6 ] A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven . Baking powders that contain both fast - and slow-acting acids are double acting ; those that contain only one acid are single acting . By providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical , and this is the type most widely available to consumers today.to consumers today . See : <URL>
The difference between the two can be seen below ( the post it is from is an <URL> ) : The corn flour is the white , finer ingredient on the right . The first obvious difference is that the texture will differ between the two . The second is that it would have different uses . Both would be effective at displacing gluten-containing flours ( as in , neither would be helpful in gluten formation ) . In terms of substitution , however , corn meal is likelier substituted by something like semolina flour and corn flour is likelier better substituted by quinoa or garbanzo bean flour .
There is considerable overlap between cupcakes and muffins . Method From a technical point of view , muffins are made by the muffin method , making them small quickbreads . In the muffin method , the wet ingredients are combined in one bowl ; and the dry ingredients are combined in another bowl . Then the two are quickly incorporated together with minimal mixing to avoid gluten development . This gives muffins a somewhat coarse crumb . Cupcakes are small cakes , and are made by one of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method , the reverse creaming method , the genoise method , the chiffon method , and so on . They tend to have a finer crumb than muffins . Contrast While no single criterion distinguishes a muffin from a cupcake if you do not adopt the technical definition above , the following trends exist : Cupcakes tend to be sweeter than muffins ; there are savory muffins such as cornbread Cupcakes are often iced or frosted , whereas muffins tend to have no topping , or a simple crumb topping Cupcakes usually have a head or top no larger than the body of the cupcake ; muffins are often encouraged to overflow their baking cup , so that their top is larger in diameter , giving them somewhat of a mushroom shape Cupcakes are almost always , well , cupcake shaped ; muffins can be made as just muffin tops Cupcakes are almost never crispy or crunchy ; muffins are often encouraged to brown and develop texture , especially on the tops
Actually they recently came up with <URL> for civet coffee . Apparently a great deal of supposedly authentic stuff never actually traveled through the bowels of a cat . According to the <URL> , the levels of citric acid , malic acid , and the inositol/pyroglutamic acid are so much higher in kopi luwak that their ratios can be used to validate mixes with other beans where the proportion of kopi luwak is 50 % or greater .
This question has become blown out of proportion . I was just curious - then I started getting answers that quickbreads and cake are the same thing - which they " obviously " are n't . So I started doing my own research . <URL> says that the term quickbread was probably invented in the US after the discovery of chemical leavening . The Wikipedia references and some dictionaries corroborate this definition . Basically anything leavened with soda is quickbread . This does n't work . There are a great many things leavened with soda that ca n't be called quickbread . A good example is plain old <URL> . Obviously this is a semantic issue but one that needed solving . Two American cookbooks that I consider canonical recipe resources , The Joy of Cooking , and the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook , both have a separate quickbread section . In it are a variety of fruit breads as well as some biscuits and scones . On Food and Cooking muddied the water a bit by differentiating between quick breads such as biscuits and batter breads such as banana bread . These were grouped together , however , and contrasted against cakes . This book says that cakes are higher in fat and sugar and have a more delicate texture . Ratio , as linked <URL> , confused the terms a bit more also including a term " quick cake " but it differentiated between the different products with distinct ratios for the flour , fat , and sugar . With several competing definitions I decided to take an unscientific poll . I called 6 friends in Washington , Utah , Georgia , and Texas . I tried to find a variety of American cultures . Obviously it is biased by the fact that I know all of them . When asked " What is quickbread to you ? " without exception all of them replied " banana bread " When I followed up with : " What is the difference between that and cake " I received the following answers : " It is eaten at breakfast " " It has less sugar " " It is loaf shaped " " It is more dense " " It has a more open texture " My conclusion is that the historical definition of " anything with soda " is no longer useful . In cookbooks it seems to now be applied to chemically risen baked goods that : have as a rule of thumb a particular ratio of flour , fat , and sugar have less sugar than cake refers in particular to fruit breads , biscuits , and scones generally has an irregular vs uniform texture The popular definition ( among my extremely limited , unrandom sampling ) adds : tends to be loaf shaped And now I can sleep easily again .
They 're the same thing - convection ovens are also known as fan-assist ovens ( see for example <URL> ) , since they 're basically an oven with a fan . Maybe what you had previously was marketed as a fan-assisted oven , and threw out the phrase " conventional cooking " to emphasize that you can still do everything you conventionally could . But it sounds like you 're just talking about two different convection ovens here . More likely , the problems you 're having are to do with either the convection being more efficient in your new oven , or the temperature control being off on one of the two . Ovens are n't always perfect , so likely your new oven is hotter when you set it to a given temperature than the old one . It might also have a more efficient fan . You can probably learn to adjust by trial and error - reduce temperatures , and check things frequently until you figure out you 've gotten it right . It might also be helpful to grab a thermometer and see if your new oven is lying to you about the temperature . ( If you were previously using non-convection recipes in a convection oven , without adjustment , then your old oven was probably either too cool or its fan was n't doing much . If you were adjusting recipes for convection previously , then maybe your new oven is hotter than it should be . )
According to my local friendly butcher , Gammon is a type of bacon that is specifically from the hind quarters . Bacon is defined as any pork that has been cured through a process of salting , either as a dry-cure or a wet-cure where the meat is either packed in salts or brine respectively . With wet curing , other ingredients can be added to impart other flavours , such as beer or sugars . Typically , rashers are made from the body of the pig with streaky bacon coming from the belly , and back bacon coming from , well , the back ( so the same cut as a pork loin chop ) . Bacon joints are typically made by combining cuts of bacon from the shoulder and collar , whilst the hind quarters are sold as gammon with a premium on price . Traditionally ham referred to cooked gammon , although in modern uses , it is often extended to include other cooked bacon joints , which include moulded meats made from combining cuts together with other additives to help bind them .
Mincing produces smaller , more irregularly-shaped items than dicing . Dicing is generally uniform , usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch on all sides , kind of like a tiny cube . The best way to explain the size difference is visually , check out <URL> for a great picture near the top .
Pectin is a polysacharide found in the cell walls of plants . There are two main divisions of pectin used in cooking : high methoxyl ( HM ) and low methoxyl ( LM ) . The high methoxyl is used in most jam and jelly recipes . It requires sugar and acid to gel . When the pectin is dissolved out of the cell walls it is very dilute and picks up a negative charge that prevents the molecules from binding to each other and gelling . Adding sugar isolates the pectin molecules from some of the water while dding the acid removes their charge . Pectin HM is thermally reversible which means it can be set , melted , and set again . Instead of using sugar and acid to encourage gelling , low methoxyl pectin gels in the presence of calcium . It is used in glazes and reduced sugar jams . It is not thermally reversible . Pectin NH is a type of LM pectin that has been modified to be thermally reversible . The more calcium in a gel the less able that gel will be to melt . Pectin NH gels with calcium but unlike other LM pectins it requires less calcium . This would mean that it could still be melted and reshaped . The recipes that I have seen that use pectin NH both have less sugar and require remolding . From what I have seen pectin NH tends to be more expensive . It is typically used in low-sugar pastry fillings and glazes . <URL> <URL> <URL>
If I remember correctly , flautas are made with a softer flour tortilla while taquitos are made with a harder corn tortilla . Both are filled with similar fillings and then wrapped and deep fried . However , you can oftentimes find taquitos made from flour tortillas and flautas made from corn tortillas ... so what 's the deal ? There is another differentiation : size . Flautas are often longer than taquitos , as taquitos are made from taco sized tortillas , while flautas are made from burrito sized tortillas . Another little tidbit if you go to a fancier Mexican place : flautas are often narrower on one side to create a funnel shape . But this is not common in your standard places . TL ; DR ; They 're oftentimes the same thing
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .
Generally speaking , butter spreads have a water component to them . That 's what the emulsifier is for , as it keeps the fat and water from separating . The problem is that you ca n't fry/cook with it . If you place it in a pan it will separate , and sizzle in a very unpleasant manner . If I remember correctly , it actaully smells quite awful in the process . As for baking , I think it 'll be fine anywhere there needs to be fat as fat . Wherever you need fat as something to hold the structure , you had probably best not use it . Caveat emptor , as I do n't bake very much at all . Let it be aid , however , that margarine as opposed to butter spread , can be used anywhere that butter is used . It is n't as tasty , and has trans-fats . On the other hand , it has less cholesterol .
I had to consult my copy of Bread Baker 's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart to be sure , but here is a quote : There are two types of firm , or dry , pre-ferments and two types of wet pre-ferments . The firm pre-ferments are known as pâte fermentée and biga . The wet pre-ferments are called poolish and levain levure . ... Biga , an italian style of firm pre-ferment , differs from pâte fermentée in that it does n't have any salt in it . Also , rather than cutting off a piece of finished bread dough to hold back as an improver , a biga is made specifically to be used as a pre-ferment . So , it seems the main difference lies in the hydration of the dough , where a poolish is made with a ratio of equal water and flour . There also seems to be a few other differences . A biga apparently uses .5 percent yeast to flour , while a poolish uses .25 percent . Mr Reinhart does not say anything about a concrete difference in final result between these methods - just that a ' wet ' pre-ferment is faster . Faster in the sense that in the same time-frame a poolish will develop more flavor and character than a dry pre-ferment . Sadly I 've personally only used a wet pre-ferment , since it is easier to handle . Just whisk it prior to bed time with a wire whisk and mix in the rest of the ingredients the next day . Having a full blown dough makes it more difficult to incorporate the rest of the ingredients .
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
The pyramid teabag allows for more effective and faster extraction . This is because the tea bag retains its 3 dimensional shape , so there is plenty of space for the tea leaves , and more of their surface area is exposed for extraction . A conventional teabag actually becomes smaller , and there is less space and the tea leaves are pressed onto each other , creating a compressed little ball of tea . I think whoever invented the pyramid teabag had that in mind . I am not suggesting that the world was desperate for it though ;)
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
There are three major properties an edible fat ( I am assuming you are not asking about inedible oils like petroleum based products ) has that affect how it is best used : Flavor Saturation Smoke point Properties Flavor The flavor of the fat is very important . So called <URL> ( like canola oil or refined grapeseed oil , or refined peanut oil , among many others ) have very little flavor and so are suitable for almost any cooking task , as they will not interfere with or compete with the other flavors in the dish . Other oils such as sesame oil are primarily used for the delicious flavor that they provide , and are almost more of a condiment than an oil for culinary purposes . In between are oils like olive oil and coconut oil which have a distinctive flavor , but also have good qualities for cooking . Many non-oil fats used in cooking ( like butter , or bacon fat , lard , or suet ) also have distinctive flavors . Saturation The level of <URL> in the fat controls how hard the fat is at room temperature . Most oils are fairly low in saturation , and are so quite liquid even at room temperature . The major exceptions among the vegetable based lipids are coconut oil and cocoa butter . Coconut oil is solid at room temperature , and cocoa butter is actually quite hard at room temperature . Note that while you only asked about " oils " , many common cooking fats not usually called an oil are much more saturated , including butter , lard , and hydrogenated vegetable oil such as the US brand Crisco . The level of saturation can affect texture of baked goods made with a given oil , and whether the fat is suitable for the creaming method or in making laminated pastry in baking . Saturated fats also resist rancidity better over time better than non-saturated fats ( although they are still subject to rancidity ) . Smoke Point The smoke point of a fat or oil is temperature to which it can be heated before it begins smokng . Oils which have a high smoke point ( such as grapeseed oil or peanut oil among others ) are more suitable for high temperature searing , or deep frying . Applications The oil for a given application is based on the properties it has . Cooking For general cooking uses ( by which I am inferring general sauteeing , shallow frying , greasing of casserole dishes , and so on is meant ) , normally you want a fat which is either : Neutral in flavor so as not to interfere with the dish . The neutral oils are all useful for this . Complimentary in flavor , to enhance the dish . Many cuisines have traditional fats which are flavorful , but are integrated into their cuisine , such as olive oil or butter . Saturation matters less ( as the fat can be melted before greasing a pan , for example ) , and smoke point is not terribly relevant unless the application is searing , in which case you want a very high smoke point . Depending on the application and the cuisine from which a dish derives , almost any oil or fat may be used for general cooking purposes . The major exception is sesame oil , which is so flavorful that it is used as a condiment , not a fat , for culinary purposes . Deep Frying The most important aspect for deep frying is smoke point . A low smoke point oil would break down and add off flavors to the dish ( not to mention making the kitchen smoky and setting off smoke alarms ) . Secondarily , for oils that are going to be reused over time , saturated fats such as hydrogenated vegetable shortenings break down more slowly , and may be considered advantageous . Generally , flavorful oils are not indicated , as the same factors that give them good flavor often give them low smoke points . Some good oils for deep frying include peanut oil , canola oil , or hydrogenated vegetable shortening . Dressing For most dressings ( by which I infer you mean salad dressings as used in many Western style cuisines ) , the most important factors are flavor and saturation . You want an oil with good flavor ( such as olive oil ) or neutral flavor ( such as the many neutral oils like canola , refined peanut , corn oil , and so on ) . Most dressings also need an oil which is liquid at room temperature , and thus low in saturation . The major exception is the class of hot dressings made with bacon fat . Many dressings are made from olive oil , or one of the neutral oils . Baking While you did not ask about baking applications , there are two types of baking which require a fat with specific properties : cakes made by the creaming method , and laminated pastries like croissants or puff pastry . These applications require a fat which is solid at room temperature , but still plastic enough to be manipulated . Generally , only butter and hydrogenated vegetable oil are suitable . Bottom Line The oil or fat you choose for any particular purpose will be based on what is best for that application -- but a good neutral oil with a high smoke point such as refined peanut oil or canola oil can serve the vast majority of culinary purposes most of the time .

To boil vegetables , you add the vegetables to a pot of water , and boil the water for a short duration until the vegetables are sufficiently cooked . One may add salt or other flavorings ( such as broth , as you mentioned ) to the water prior to boiling . Steamed vegetables are cooked in a steamer basket , where the vegetables are not in the water , but are instead sitting above the water , and are thus cooked by steam . Salt must be added to steamed vegetables after they are cooked rather than to the water prior to cooking , since salt does not evaporate . Steamed vegetables can retain more of their original flavor and nutrients , since they do not leech out into the water during boiling . On the other hand , you can not add additional flavors to your vegetables during steaming -- since flavors can not soak into the vegetables from the water , either . Which taste/texture you prefer , of course , can be a matter of personal opinion . In my experience , boiled vegetables are often mistakenly referred to as steamed vegetables . And often , many restaurants will sell " steamed vegetables " which are really just microwaved frozen vegetables , which may strictly be steamed ( it certainly is n't boiled ! ) , but really bears little resemblance to the true steaming process ( and has relatively poor flavor , as well ) .

Making my first big batch of Kefir , the milk went bad . Why ?
I 've made kefir many times . When you first start using kefir grains , they take time to recover from not being in milk for a while ( ie , if they were sent to you by courier or post ) and to adjust to the conditions in your kitchen . It 's normal for the first few batches of kefir to smell and taste like the milk went bad . Instead of going with fermenting the kefir in 6 cups of milk over 48 hours , I would suggest your next batch be for something like 2 or 3 cups of milk over 24 hours . Shorter batch times combined with a smaller batch size means the ferment wo n't take as long , so there 's less time for the milk to go bad if that 's going to happen .
The lack of vent holes would have been a problem . Vent holes allow steam to escape , reducing the amount of internal moisture . This moisture will both prevent the crust from cooking fully through , and will cause the crust to soften as after it comes out of the oven . That 's not to say that there was n't also some other problem , just this is one thing that you should correct .
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
Puff pastry is a laminated dough , with very strong gluten development , so an extra couple of days in the refrigerator should not have caused problems . 450 F seems like a typical temperature , and the time seems in the normal range . The only thing you have mentioned is that is definitely outside the standard treatment is trimming the edges with a butter knife . Normally , you want to trim or cut puff pastry with a very sharp knife or pizza cutter , in order to cleanly cut through the layers . A blunt knife like a butter knife can mash the layers together , making it hard for them to separate at the edges of the pastry . Still , this should have lead to lopsided or strangely risen pastry , rather than a complete failure to rise , especially in the center . The other possibility is that the dough was too warm when you rolled and worked it , or that you rolled it too much , which would work the fat or butter layers into the dough phase , rather than keeping discrete layers of flour then fat , which is what allows the rise .

Wine will eventually turn into vinegar . So , other than having a really icky taste by itself ( unless you like drinking vinegar :) ) , it is n't bad for your health and you can cook with it .
Frying the chicken tends to set the muscle fibers by drawing moisture out . An example of this would be taking a thin ( 1cm ) cutlet and frying it until both sides start to turn golden . It will be pretty dry and hard . Pressure cooking it on the other hand tends to soften the muscle fibers without drawing moisture in ( if anything , its putting moisture in ) . So , ideally , you should boil/pressure cook your chicken prior to frying in oil ( though do make sure to drain the chicken first to prevent splatters ! ) . Additionally , you should undercook the chicken slightly in the pressure cooker since you 'll be finishing it in the fryer . If you are broasting the chicken , then you are going about the recipe incorrectly by frying then pressure cooking it . When broasting , you should pressure fry - if that makes sense .
The biggest reason to heat milk to almost boiling before fermenting is that it improves the texture of the yogurt . During fermentation the bacteria consume lactose and produce lactic acid which causes the milk proteins to denature and coagulate trapping most of the fat . The proteins involved are primarily the casein proteins . When this happens , there is still quite a bit of protein left that is n't bound up in the new casein mesh . All of the albumin proteins are water soluble and will not add to the structure of the yogurt . These albumin proteins denature when they are heated . For this reason recipes universally call for the milk to be heated to 190 and then cooled . The albumin is denatured and is able to tangle up with the casein during fermentation and add to the yogurt structure . Skipping this step will make a very profound difference to the structure of your yogurt . Without it your yogurt will be thinner and much more fragile . When you scoop it there will be more whey and all that albumin will wash out in it . According to Harold McGee ( On Food and Cooking pp 48 ) " These treatments improve the consistency of the yogurt by denaturing the whey protein lactoglobulin , whose otherwise unreactive molecules then participate by clustering on the surfaces of the casein particles . With the helpful interference of the lactoglobulins , the casein particles can only bond to each other at a few spots , and so gather not in clusters but in a fine matrix of chains that is much better at retaining liquid in its small interstices . "
More liquid will dilute the okra 's thickening tendency . But then your dish will be more liquid than perhaps you want . You could perhaps cook the okra separately and add it right before serving . Editing to add : your other option is to skip me .
Most of the kefir recipes I saw online use whole milk , not low-fat milk as a starter . One source mentioned that commercial low-fat kefir recipes use large amounts of <URL> to make them thick . This might be related to your homemade kefir tasting watery , or being grainy , I do n't know - but at least if you try and it does n't solve the problem , you 've eliminated one possible variable . Another possibility is if your kefir is left too long , it will finish fermenting and start to separate . This stage , of beginning to separate into <URL> , might match your description of grains and clear liquid at the bottom of your container , though it perhaps has n't curdled entirely yet . It may also explain the sharper taste , if the kefir has had enough time to ferment all the way through your milk . If your kefir was over-fermenting for whatever reason - perhaps it is sitting a little longer than it needs to , or if it 's a little warmer then it might ferment faster , or something about <URL> - then stopping the ferment a little early ( couple hours at a time ? ) , straining out the grains and putting the kefir in the fridge , might get you the results you want .
Eggs are already 3/4 water anyway ! By mixing in a small quantity of extra water before you cook the eggs , you are slowing down the cooking process by making more water available that has be evaporated . This keeps the cooking temperature to less than 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) for longer , therefore increasing the the time for the egg proteins to foam and expand before setting The amount of water you need to add depends on ; personal preference , the type of egg , and how old it is . Older eggs generally require a little more water Adding skim milk will enhance this process slightly too . Adding extra fat will generally not enhance this process BONUS TIP To make even more spectacular omelettes place a loose fitting lid over the pan to increase the steam exposure all around , and let the egg fully develop
If by going bad you mean becoming unsuitable for consumption due to toxicity , sugar , when stored properly , does not go bad for at least a few years . By storing properly I mean storing it in conditions of low humidity , as it absorbs humidity ( water ) from the air . This property is called hygroscopy . However , it may lose some of its mechanical properties , form " rocks " , or even solidify into your sugar container . Theoretically very wet sugar can get infested with mold , but I have not seen it happen .
I 'm not so lucky as to be able to get whole raw milk & hellip ; Wait , then there 's a flaw in your premise . Check the label . Any milk treated using high-heat processes like UHT , pasteurization or ultra-pasteurized milk does n't sour like it used to in your grandmother 's days ; it spoils & hellip ; goes rotten . Spoiled milk is not the same as soured milk . The ultra-pasturized milk sold in the supermarket is essentially a dead product , with little to no live bacteria . When it goes bad , it rots and should be thrown out ( or you can <URL> with it ) . Modern industrial pasteurization kills the " good " bacteria that once made sour milk a wonderful thing for cooking and making bread and cheese . Substituting " Sour Milk " If you have a recipe calling for sour milk , put a teaspoon of vinegar in a cup of fresh milk and let it sit for a few minutes . That 's about the best you can do if you do not have access to raw milk .
Most pestos use olive oil , which solidifies at around 6 degrees celsius - just over the temperature of the average fridge . The shop-bought pestos you buy probably adulterate the olive oil with other kinds of oils . In any case , you 'll be able to eat your pesto just by leaving it out at room temperature for a few hours , or by just scooping it out and adding to your hot pasta .
Adding milk works because <URL> . It might even work better , as it also contains sugar ( lactose ) which will be eaten by your starter 's yeasts and bacteria . But it also contains other stuff , such as fats . And fats , after some time , get rancid . You probably wo n't want that taste in bread or pancakes . I would stick to water ( which quite probably you 'll find cheaper than milk ) . Do n't worry about rotten milk : your starter is already rotten . And it 's a hostile environment for most microbes . It 's very very improbable new microbes would survive there . But if they do , they 'll be quite similar to the already existing ones .
Lemon juice thickens condensed milk in the same way it would " thicken " regular milk , i.e. , by curdling . Basically , milk has two general types of proteins : casein and whey . The casein is what forms the " curds " in " curds and whey . " Both proteins are somewhat unusual in that they do n't tend to coagulate with heat ( as eggs proteins do , for example ) . Thus , they will survive largely intact even with the processing of condensed milk . Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking explains what happens when they encounter acids , though : The casein family includes four different kinds of proteins that gather together into microscopic family units called micelles . Each casein micelle contains a few thousand individual protein molecules . . . . Around a tenth of the volume of milk is taken up by casein micelles . Much of the calcium in milk is in the micelles , where it acts as a kind of glue holding the protein molecules together . One portion of calcium binds individual protein molecules together into small clusters of 15 to 25 . Another portion then helps pull several hundred of the clusters together to form the micelle ... One member of the casein family is especially influential in these gatherings . That is kappa-casein which caps the micelles once they reach a certain size , prevents them from growing larger , and keeps them dispersed and separate . One end of the capping-casein molecule extends from the micelle out into the surrounding liquid , and forms a " hairy layer " with a negative electrical charge that repels other micelles ... If [ milk ] gets acid enough to approach pH 5.5 , the capping-casein 's negative charge is neutralized , the micelles no longer repel each other , and they therefore gather in loose clusters . At the same acidity , the calcium glue that holds the micelles together dissolves , the micelles begin to fall apart , and their individual proteins scatter . Beginning around pH 4.7 , the scattered casein proteins lose their negative charge , bond to each other again and form a continuous fine network : and the milk solidifies , or curdles . Thus , if you add lemon juice to regular milk , it will curdle and thicken , just as milk does when it sours naturally or when it is fermented into yogurt , kefir , cultured buttermilk , etc. ( which all involve bacteria that acidify the milk ) . The same process happens if you add acid to condensed milk .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
To add to Stephie 's answer , sometimes dairy is incorporated for a variety of reasons . In some cases , like a coffee cake , sour cream or yogurt can account for a good amount of the moisture and fat in the batter . Rich dairy products like cream and sour cream usually lead to very tender baked goods , due to helping to incorporate more fat ( the fact that it 's already emulsified helps too ) . Soured dairy , like yogurt , sour cream , and buttermilk are frequently used so that their acidity will react with baking soda in the recipe for leavening . Finally , yogurt and buttermilk often have stabilizers like guar gum , xanthan gum , and carrageenan . These will retain moisture after baking to help the finished product be more moist . Whether a substitution will work would depend on which functions the dairy ingredient is filling , and which characteristics the substitute matches .
Its going to depend on the type of packaging and also the freezer . Lightly wrapped in plastic wrap ( or worse , paper ) will freezer burn fairly quickly . Vacuum-sealed will last much longer . A self-defrost freezer with wide temperature swings will burn quicker . A manual defrost chest freezer much slower . Worst case is probably around a month or less ( not really sealed , freezer with wide temperature swings ) , best case ( vacuum sealed in stable temperature chest freezer ) over a year .
I ca n't say why you 'd want to do this in general for other types of sponge cakes . But in the linked recipe it 's very clear . The reason is because the milk/butter mixture is heated " to just under a boil " and according to the instructions should still be at least " hot ( about 150F ) " when added . In this case , you take out a small portion of the batter , then add this hot liquid mixture to it . If you do n't mix rapidly while doing so and if the temperature is a little off and too hot , you run the risk of coagulating the eggs in the batter ( which would obviously not result in a desirable texture to add back into the rest of the batter ) . Here , as the recipe notes , you 're using this portion of the batter as a liaison , which is a fancy word for a mixture the serves as an intermediary temperature between something hot and something cooler . By adding the hot milk/butter mixture to a small portion of the batter ( rather than the whole batter ) , you cool it enough so that it wo n't risk coagulating eggs in the whole batter . But in the process , you need to whisk rapidly to avoid small egg bits forming curds and becoming solid , so you 're sacrificing some of the bubbles in this portion of the batter to create an appropriate intermediary temperature mixture , which then is presumably supposed to be gently folded back into the rest of the batter . Now , the question is why you 're heating the milk in the first place . There is a whole genre of cakes called " hot milk cakes " or " hot milk sponge cakes , " which seem to have originated in the early 20th century . They use this rather unusual mixing method , where you beat the sugar and eggs for a long time first , then add flour and dry ingredients , and then add liquid and fat at the end . I 'd speculate that the hot milk serves two purposes : ( 1 ) it helps melt the butter , which both allows the liquid butter to combine easier with the existing mixture and causes it to coat the flour better which results in a tender crumb ( less gluten network formation ) , and ( 2 ) it raises the temperature of the batter above room temperature , thus shortening the time before the cake structure starts to solidify while baking . My guess is that this is helpful because the sugar/egg foam is less stable than , say , a sugar/butter " creamed " foam ( as in a pound cake ) , and if you do n't get the eggs to coagulate fast enough , the whole thing might collapse . ( Again , that last part is just a guess . ) The goal is to end up with a very light and tender cake .

How do I keep my bread pudding from collapsing ?
A souffle by any other name will fall as quick . ( Sorry , I could n't resist ) . But this is absolutely normal , there is nothing in this recipe to support the structural integrity of cooling air bubbles . You can reduce the amount of rising , which will result in a smaller collapse . To do this , beat the mixture less ( prepare it by hand instead with a mixer to be sure ) and ensure slower , more even heating in the oven . But of course , the collapse will occur . There is some advice floating around which is supposed to reduce the falling rate of souffles . You could try following it even if your recipe does n't involve whipping the eggwhites . It involves things like not crowding the oven and carefully buttering the form , usually with layers of butter and sugar ( or parmesan for savory souffles ) . It wo n't hurt to use them . But do n't expect a risen pudding after it has cooled . Update . I read Charlotte Farley 's answer and thought that it would be great if it works . I had a hunch that it might not , but it would be so awesome if it helps ! So I made the experiment . I made the bread pudding exactly per the recipe given here . I did n't separate the eggs , but took care to whip them for a long time before adding the milk , to ensure a good rise . I baked it in silicon muffin cups , exactly 5 gram of bread and 45 gram of egg mixture per cup . After 45 min at 150 ° C , I quickly removed three cups from the oven and left the remaining three cups there for another 45 min . As a control , I used a simple cheese souffle ( basically a mornay sauche with whipped egg whites ) and repeated the procedures , using 50 g mixture per cup and baking for 20 min at 175 ° C . The results : These are the bread puddings . The directly removed are in the lower row , the ones which remained in the oven are in the upper row . I did n't measure them , but they are nearly the same height . In the oven , all had risen maybe 1 cm over the cup edges , so they all lost ~ 50 % of their oven height . The first group collapsed the second they were out of the oven , the others deflated slowly in the oven , but were already low when I took them out . I weighed both groups after cooling . The " direct from the oven group " weighed 116 g , or 11.3 g average moisture loss per pudding . The " left in oven group " weighed 101 g , or 16.3 g average moisture loss per pudding . When I tried them , I liked the moister ones better , but both groups were OK . Neither was unacceptably dry or egg-white-rubbery . These are the cheese soufflés . They rose more in the oven , to maybe 2.5-3 cm above the cup edges . Again , directly removed ones are in the bottom row , the oven cooled ones are in the top row . There is no visible difference , they all seem deflated to the same size . The weight results are similar as in the bread pudding case : 122 g for the three directly removed souffles , 109 g for the oven cooled ones . Again , I felt that the moister ones tasted better , but this could be a subjective preference . I would n't consider the oven-cooled ones " bad " on their own . Conclusion : The slow oven cooling does n't work :( Estimated 5000 calories worth of egg dishes plus a small package of American bread ( opened ) available for free , collect in person only .
Black pudding freezes very well and should keep for a couple of months easily . It is not cured like salamis or other hard sausages , it 's just boiled in the skin , so it does not keep as well at ambient temperatures . When you do cook it , try it with pork tenderloin , mashed potato and fresh apple sauce . Just fry half-inch slices . Fantastic .
Probably find it easier to crack a raw egg and then peel the membrane from inside . Maybe use some tweezers to get started .
The dates you have are probably brahi , whereas the ones you remember eating before are medjhoul . These are different types of dates , and have slightly different flavour profiles . As for storage , they should be fine for a few days at room temperature . For anything longer than that , they should be kept in the fridge , particularly if you live somewhere hot/humid . I also vaguely remember an old Israeli habit of eating yellow dates frozen , or after a few minutes out of the freezer .
I suspect your sourdough starter is just too acidic . I have no similar problems with sourdough in the past , but my starter is n't particularly acidic . Have you tried discarding with a large refresh and then shortly ( in bakers terms ) trying a new loaf ? Trying to isolate just the yeast and not the sour part . The loaf may not taste sourdoughy , but it should determine if that 's the issue .
Did you let the meat cool completely before attempting to slice it ? Even meat that is completely-fall-apart tender straight out of the ( crock ) pot will firm up quite a bit when cooled .
I have used orange as an excellent flavor pairing with pistachio in cakes , biscottis , panna-cottas , custards , etc. . I always add the zest of orange and a few drops of orange essence . I 've also tried cardamom and saffron with pistachios specially in Indian desserts and it is a very popular pairing in India . Just use a few strands of saffron and powdered cardamom seeds in a bit of warm milk before mixing in the rest of the ingredients for color , aroma and flavor .
You can refrigerate all kinds of yeast-bread dough . Right after kneading , before the dough has had a chance to rise , oil the dough lightly , cover with plastic wrap or use a ziplock , and place in the refrigerator . As the dough cools in the refrigerator the action of the yeast will slow down until the dough has reached refrigeration temperature . At that point the yeast is still working , but at a snail 's pace . So , during the first few hours in the fridge it may require a punch down or two , as there may still be enough warmth in the dough for the yeast to show active signs of life . After the dough is completely cool , it may not need anything from you , but still check it at least every 12 hours or so - it may need another punch down . If at any point it grows to close to double it 's original size , go ahead and punch it down . Most doughs will be fine if babysat like this for up to 3 or 4 days . When you 're ready to bake , punch down the dough again ( if necessary ) , shape , and allow to rise as if it had never taken its little nap in the refrigerator . Of course this rise is going to take longer than non-refrigerated dough as it reaches room temperature , but it should be ready to bake when it looks like a non-refrigerated dough of the same type would look when it 's ready to bake . Bake as usual . I 'm sure there are exceptions to the basic rules I 've set out , but I 've never had a problem doing this with any yeast-bread dough .
Onions have a lot of sugar in them . All they want in the world is to burn and fill your kitchen with oniony smoke . The solution , as with all things heavy in sugar , is to turn down the heat and stir frequently . That said - if your olive oil was extra virgin then it might have been your oil that started burning before the onions did .
Many modern smoke/fire detectors have the ability to temporarily disable or decrease the sensitivity of the alarm for a short period of time , usually 15 or 20 minutes . At the end of the time period it returns to full sensitivity . You may want to look into replacing your smoke detector with one of these .
The way to ensue moist meat is to make sure that you do n't overcook it . It is really just that simple . Variations on cooking method are to achieve certain effects on the meat , i.e. searing to develop more flavor due to the maillard reaction , sous vide to allow you to cook to a specific temperature , ect . In the war against dry meat , a thermometer is your best foxhole buddy . That said , some cooking methods allow you to hit that temp mark easier than others . Typically , the slower heat enters the food , the closer to the specific temperature you will be able to get . Thus things like a braise more often result in a meat that is moist as the window between cooked and over-cooked is much larger than on something like a grill .
You absolutely do n't need a bread maker for good bread . They have been making bread for at least 22,000 years and I promise , in the vast majority of those , having a bread maker would have gotten you stoned as a witch ( if you had electricty to run it ) . However , a good bread maker will vastly cut down on the time you have to spend making bread . Basically , bread by hand requires a few hours and lot of physical kneading to develop the gluten that gives bread it 's structure and in a bread machine , you dump the ingredients in , turn it on and walk away , then come back and enjoy some fresh bread .
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .
For hard , chemical-resistant surfaces such as marble , bleach or peroxide cleaners will help . On things like counters , pots and pans , a Magic Eraser will often take off the stain . Sometimes a harsher abrasive like Comet or Barkeep 's Friend will be needed . Softer or porous materials , including cloth and many plastics often CAN NOT BE UNSTAINED . In my kitchen we treat turmeric like a dangerous chemical -- isolate , contain , and plan ahead to limit exposure . It 's just that destructive . You might as well tie-dye or bleach white any clothing you get turmeric on ; it India it is used as a dye for saris because it will semi-permanently tint cloth . You can brush off the dry powder harmessly , but when it is moistened and allowed to sit for a moment , the color is pretty much permanent . Edit : UV + peroxide : I saw a patent for removing turmeric stains from upholstery using UV light and hydrogen peroxide . You might try soaking fabrics in peroxide or Oxyclean ( which uses peroxide ) and leaving then out in the sun . Ca n't hurt right ? Edit : strategies to manage turmeric without making a mess Plan ahead where you 'll use it , and which utensils and vessels will hold it , so you do n't mess up anything you do n't need to . Re-use already turmeric-stained items so you do n't wreck anything new Mortars and pestles , tupperware , wooden and soft plastic utensils are a lost cause . At least the stain is purely cosmetic ? ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wear an apron . Keep spilt powder dry ( it wo n't stain ) and brush it off with a paper towel into the garbage . Brushing away promptly keeps you from inadvertently spilling liquid on it , or wiping it with a wet towel during cleanup . That is , unless you want a neon-green counter and towel ? Whenever you spill something containing turmeric , promptly wipe it off , to reduce staining . Hard ceramic and porcelain are immune to staining unless the surface is rough . Try to use these for storage . Glass will stain . Stainless steel is resistant but not immune . With these strategies , I find I can use turmeric regularly without problems .
I suggest using a brine . Lots of brining details can be found in the answers to this question : <URL> Alton Brown has a really great recipe for <URL> . You can watch the <URL> on YouTube in which he covers brining turkey . I also suggest reading <URL> ( PDF ) from Cook 's Illustrated .
Presumably you are experiencing rancidity , due to oxygen . While you have nitrogen flushed the bags at filling time , the bags are not impervious to oxygen diffusion . A different type of bag ( an " oxygen barrier " bag material ) or package ( glass jar , or metal can ) and , in addition , ( based on other packaging I have seen ) oxygen absorbing packets inside the bag may be required for long shelf life . Either alone would probably extend the shelf-life somewhat .
Usually when I 've made them I just put sauce on top , not on the bottom , and just down the middle so the edges are exposed . And I make the sauce on the thick side so it is not too watery . I bake them in the oven too , and they are never too soggy , but you could just grill to minimise the sauce absorption . I 've heard that corn tortillas are more resistant to going soggy than flour ones , but could n't comment from experience .
Let the dough rest in the bowl for a while after mixing . Time will not only improve the flavor ( insert autolyse proselytism here ) but will also give the flour time to hydrate , making the dough somewhat easier to handle . Dough will become less sticky as you work it -- witness the way dough kneaded in a mixer or food processor initially sticks to the sides but eventually forms a ball and leaves the bowl clean . So , one option is to work it a bit with a mixer first , or just with a wooden spoon in the bowl . Anil 's suggestion to oil your hands is a good one . If the kind of dough you 're making allows it , add some oil or butter to the dough during mixing , too . Flour helps , of course . Instead of trying to coat your hands in flour , throw a bit on the kneading surface and on the top of the dough . For very sticky dough , a <URL> can help you scrape the dough off the surface and fold it over onto itself until it becomes easier to handle . This is easiest if you 're working on a hard , smooth kneading surface like marble .
It 's definitely an unusually long-lasting melon , although sources list a few different timeframes . <URL> says if kept in a cool , dry , frost-free place , they keep very well for several months , and reportedly over a year . <URL> increases that : If kept dry after harvest , a fruit can last several years .
Replace your ladle with an ice cream scoop . You will be able to control the amount of dough for each waffle much easier . For my waffle iron and scoop I use two scoops . An additional advantage over a ladle , is that the dough releases much easier from a scoop , which reduces the probability of making a mess .

Use a boiled cornstarch wash for an in oven glue Egg wash is a great glue , but generally lets go again when heated in the oven . Best used after baking not before
Yes , it is possible , and in fact usually results in better bread , because the yeast has more time to work and develop flavour . It depends on the recipe , but you should usually reduce the amount of yeast being used to prevent overproofing . You can keep most doughs for a couple of days in the fridge , depending again on the amount of yeast and how often the fridge is opened . Simply mix and knead your dough as normal , cover it tightly with plastic wrap over the bowl , then put it straight in the fridge . You will usually need to allow a couple of hours the next morning for the dough to ' wake up ' and finish a full proof , but if your dough has fully risen in the fridge ( ie it has grown 1.5-2 times ) you can go straight to shaping .
Okay , I usually do n't answer my own questions but by the time I got done writing up my question the answer came to me : On day 1 take your one portion of starter and divide it in half . The other half can either be shared with a friend or thrown away . ( I promise I wo n't tell ! ) On day 5 , instead of adding 1 cup of milk/flour/sugar just add 1/2 a cup of each . On day 10 , instead of adding 1 cup of milk/flour/sugar just add 1/2 a cup of each . Do n't forget to mush/mix the bag each day . Now on day 10 you 'll have two regular sized portions of starter . You could use it to make two loaves of bread . Or you could use one portion to make one loaf , take the other portion and start again with step 1 above .
You can easily make your own anchovy paste from canned anchovies . This <URL> shows how : Chop the anchovies fairly finely Mash with a fork until smooth Some sites recommend adding a little oil for a smoother texture . I have never tried it , but I do n't see any reason this would not freeze exceptionally well , as neither whole anchovies nor the paste are used for their texture .
Graphics and quoted text from : <URL> Grains , by definition , have 3 major parts : the germ , the endosperm , and the bran . Whole grains are those that have all of the parts of the natural seed , or kernel ( not including an exterior husk that is generally inedible ) . To be called " Whole Grain " the product must still have all of the bran , endosperm and germ that it had when it was in the field , although it can milled , ground , cracked , natural , whatever ... as long as it still has all of its parts . If a food label states that the package contains whole grain , the " whole grain " part of the food inside the package is required to have the same proportions of bran , germ , and endosperm as the harvested kernel does before it is processed . Refining normally removes the bran and the germ , leaving only the endosperm . Without the bran and germ , about 25 % of a grain 's protein is lost , along with at least seventeen key nutrients . Processors add back some vitamins and minerals to enrich refined grains , so refined products still contribute valuable nutrients . This graphic shows what 's lost when wheat is refined , and what 's added back when it 's " enriched " : Durum is just a variety of wheat . Unless it specifically says " whole wheat " or " whole grain " , you can assume that it is refined .
No , you ca n't . You should always assume glass is not safe to use on the stovetop . Essentially none of it is , and while there are a very few exceptions , they 'll say so explicitly . ( For example <URL> says stovetop-safe in the description . ) That bowl is nothing special , definitely not stovetop-safe - it 'd shatter under the thermal stress . If you look carefully on the packaging , you might even find a warning that 's not for use on the stovetop .
Note that wheat is a type of grass , and is technically a grain . Grains without gluten Not all grains have gluten -- only those closely related to wheat do . Grains which do not have gluten include : Corn ( maize ) and its variants or derivatives such as cornmeal , polenta , hominy , or masa Rice ( all varieties ) A note on rice : some varieties are called " glutinous " . This just sounds similar to " gluten " , but is in fact used to indicate the rice 's stickiness . Glutinous rice does not have gluten , not even as traces , its stickiness comes from a special type of starch . Millet Sorghum Oats ( although many oat products are processed in plants that may have had wheat ) Sometimes confused for grains Note that the following gluten free seeds are not grains , although sometimes they are confused for grains : Wild rice Quinoa Buckwheat ( despite the name , not a wheat nor a grain ) Amaranth Non-grains used as gluten-free starches and flours Therefore , all grain-like , starchy , or flour-type foods which are not grasses are always gluten free , including wild rice , quinoa ( despite any other issues ) , and so on . Additionally , flours or seeds based on non-grain seeds , nuts , and legumes are always gluten free , although there may be other dietary sensitivities . These include : Almonds Soy beans Peanuts Chickpeas Mesquite flour Amaranth Quinoa Wild rice Finally , starches and flours based on roots , rhizomes , and so on are gluten free , including : Potato Sweet potato ( True ) yams Tapioca Grains containing gluten The following grains are all wheat relatives , and have gluten to a greater or lesser degree : Wheat Spelt Rye Tritical Barley Kamut Note that the following are all processed wheat products or specific wheat varieties , and should be avoided to maintain gluten free diets : Farina Durum Semolina Couscous See also : <URL> <URL>
A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread . If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads wo n't raise much . You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens . The more temperature you can give it the better . Another possible factor may be the yeast . Are you waiting enough ? Are you using enough ? Like temperature , more yeast and longer fermentation times ca n't go wrong .
The reasons people still roast whole birds are : Roasting a whole chicken is easier than butterflying it . While it 's not tough to butterfly a chicken many people do n't know how , or do n't want the cleanup It 's less prep time to roast a whole chicken . If you are busy you can have it from the fridge to the oven in less than a minute , while butterflying or jointing it is n't super-quick Aesthetics : some people like the look of a whole chicken on the table
Put the bag in front of an air conditioner for a few minutes . Worked like a champ for Oreos and chips that went stale over a humid weekend in a desk drawer . This was a window unit - I arranged to blow the cold air into the bag . Was amazed with the results .
Industrial breads use ' dough conditioners ' that soften the dough and make working with it easier . You can buy such mixes online , <URL> for instance , and I 've seen them for sale in natural food stores and the like . Other things that might work are adding a starch or a fat , or heat treating some of your flour in the microwave ( a minute for a cup , do n't do this to all the flour , it destroys some of the gluten ) . Guar gum or xanthan gum will help to keep things moist as well . I 've never used these techniques , so some experimentation might be necessary . Store bread in plastic bags as soon as it cools , and do n't slice right away .

After the dough is completely cool , it may not need anything from you , but still check it at least every 12 hours or so - it may need another punch down . If at any point it grows to close to double it 's original size , go ahead and punch it down . Most doughs will be fine if babysat like this for up to 3 or 4 days . When you 're ready to bake , punch down the dough again ( if necessary ) , shape , and allow to rise as if it had never taken its little nap in the refrigerator . Of course this rise is going to take longer than non-refrigerated dough as it reaches room temperature , but it should be ready to bake when it looks like a non-refrigerated dough of the same type would look when it 's ready to bake . Bake as usual . I 'm sure there are exceptions to the basic rules I 've set out , but I 've never had a problem doing this with any yeast-bread dough .
You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders . It 's just the cooking times are shorter , that 's all . Set your oven to 250-275F , and roast those ribs until they 're done . I 've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours , but as many as 5 . Optionally , you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook , with some liquid in the foil pack . Just be aware that they 'll cook faster if they 're foiled . And depending on your preference , you may want to take them out of the foil to finish them .
I used to remove the paddle before the second rising to avoid breaking the bread . Did not find any other good way of doing it .
The oil needs to be slowly added to the egg , vinegar , and lemon juice base while being vigorously whisked . Only add more when the previous amount has been fully incorporated . I generally add the oil 1/4 cup at a time , dripping it very slowly into the base . Once the initial 1/4 cup has been added and emulsified it becomes a lot easier to incorporate the rest , and you can add it slightly faster , but still 1/4 cup at a time . This is vastly simpler in a food processor . I have a <URL> which has a little white pusher piece with a drip-hole in it . You can simply add the oil into this 1/4 cup at a time , it will slowly drip into the mix . Use the metal blade attachment .
I use whole grains in my bread - wheat , oats , quinoa , etc. . There are a couple considerations : 1 - rehydration If the grain wo n't be adequately rehydrated from just sitting in water for an hour then it should be precooked . Wheat berries , for example , definitely need to be cooked . They just wo n't get enough water or time in the dough while it is rising . A little experimenting may need to be done to get the water ratio right . 2 - sharpness Adding hard ingredients will change the dynamic of your dough kneading . For example , if you knead in a mixer then you might have to go at a slower speed to keep from shredding the gluten . Sprouting grains is fantastic . Sprouted grains are very nutritious and have a completely different flavor that I find very interesting . Sprouts also have a lot of sugar in them . I sometimes replace some of the sugar in my recipes with sprouted , dried , and ground wheat berries .
Use a boiled cornstarch wash for an in oven glue Egg wash is a great glue , but generally lets go again when heated in the oven . Best used after baking not before
In baking , doubling sometimes is accurate , sometimes not . Yeah , that is a non-answer , but is true . It is not unsafe to double , or halve , but sometimes results will vary . You hit a point which could cause a slight issue , even distribution . Changing volume of a recipe with an ingredient which is distributed over the surface might affect the distribution ratio , though in this case I think it would likely be minor . Other issues can arise in doubling would be if the dough needs to breath . Thermal reactions can often affect results when doubling or halving recipes as well . The cooking time adjustments are often obvious , but cooling can be less obvious but disastrous at times , and any resting times needed may be skewed . All of that said , with allowing for baking time , and a little experimentation , most recipes can be safely doubled or halved , but tend to start breaking down beyond that , going for tripled , 4 times , etc tends to get progressively poor results without a lot of trial and error . It is certainly worth a try though . And alternate or fallback if you do not like the results of doubling is to make two separate batches , which you know will be correct .
Panko wo n't stick to chicken ( too dry ) , but will stick to egg . Egg wo n't stick to chicken ( too smooth and non-absorbant ) , but will stick to flour . Flour will stick to chicken . Dredge first through flour , then through ( well beaten ) egg , then through panko . It 's a tricky combination , but if you do it right the results are excellent . Any dry spices you want to put in can go in the flour . While I do n't know for sure , I would certainly would n't include any oils in the coating , as none of flour/egg/panko will stick to oils .
First of all , cooking times are always only guidelines . The rule is always , " Cook it until it 's done " . The <URL> suggests a finished internal temperature of 165 F ( 74 C ) . USDA recommends cooking whole duck or goose to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 ° F as measured using a food thermometer . Check the internal temperature in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast . When cooking pieces , the breast , drumsticks , thighs , and wings should be cooked until they reach a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 ° F. So , the answer to your question is that you cook it until enough time has past that the goose is 165 F. . . With the caveat that your target temperature may be lower than the USDA recommendations because we all love eating rare meat . From an <URL> of The Splendid Table , Hank Shaw mentions his recommended target temperatures for different parts of a goose : HS : The first thing you need to know is the sweet spot of cooking a goose breast is somewhere around 135 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature . LRK : It 's pink ? HS : It 's pink , yes -- medium-rare to medium . The sweet spot for the legs is somewhere around 175 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit , give or take , they 're pretty forgiving . That 's a huge spread in temperature . He achieves this temperature difference by removing the breasts half-way through cooking and returning the rest of the bird to the oven until the higher temperature is reached . Note , the temperature of the breasts is below the recommended temperature , so there is likely some amount of risk with eating it this cool . The entire method is explained in the link and it 's pretty fascinating . While he gives estimates of time ( 45 minutes for breasts plus 45 minutes more for the remainder ) which are quite a bit lower than your two recipes despite being for a lower oven temperature ( 325 F ) and a larger bird 12-16 lbs , it 's possibly due to the target temperature being so low for the breasts and , once they 're removed , the remainder of the bird would probably cook more quickly . To address the methods you 're looking at , I 'm going to convert the recipes to be in the same units : Ramsay - 450 F for 10 minutes followed by 9/15 min/lb at 375 F Food Network - 450 F preheat then 20-25 min/lb at 350 . Now , let 's look at your two recipes ... Ramsay : Stuff the zested fruit and the herb sprigs inside the bird and set aside for at least 15 mins . Can be done up to a day ahead and kept refrigerated . Food Network : Rub inside cavity with lemon juice . Place apple , potato , orange and celery inside the body cavity . Truss the bird like a turkey . I 'm going to guess that the apple , potato , orange and celery combo may be more dense than seven lemons/limes . If it is , it 's probably going to retard the cooking time a bit . This may explain some of your difference in cooking times , so you should keep that in mind . I do n't know how you 're planning to prepare your bird but the filling may change the cooking time . Also , that big 450 F burst for 10 minutes is a big difference over simply raising the oven to that temp and immediately lowering it . When you open the oven , a lot of the air will leave , causing the air temp to drop a bit . If you immediately lower the temperature , it will drop to 350 F pretty quickly . With Ramsay 's method you 're actively cooking the bird for 10 minutes at 450 F . This means that the oven will bring itself back up to 450 F and stay there for a few minutes before you drop the temperature to 375 F and it will take longer for the oven temperature to drop ( assuming you have a well-insulated oven ) . The goose will start warming up more quickly with this method , which is reflected in the shorter cooking time . Plus , when you 're talking about 2 hours or more , a 25 F temperature difference does change the cooking time . So , in the end , I think the methods are quite different but I think that ( if you follow the actual method including the filling ) both will give acceptable results ... but that does n't matter because you should at least <URL> a <URL> that tells you what temperature to aim for rather than what time to cook for and refer to those recipes ' internal temperature recommendations and use your meat thermometer to know when you 've reached them .

Is it safe to eat moldy cheese if you slice off the edges ?
I think it would depend on the cheese . For a reasonably hard cheese , like cheddar , I have done it , and never gotten sick ( your results may vary ) . If it 's pre-grated , then I would not touch it anymore . For a softer cheese , like a brie , I would not risk it .
A metal pan will not crack simply from cold liquid . If you heat it up to a very high temperature and submerge it in cold water , that 's not such a good idea . But deglazing is just a tiny amount of liquid . Now , aluminum is another story - if it 's hot enough and you pour cold water ( or cold anything ) on it , it can warp , even with a relatively small amount of liquid . And for Teflon and other " coated " cookware , you can ruin the coating that way . But heavier steel or cast iron - no way . If you 're really concerned , just keep the deglazing liquid at room temperature . Deglazing is usually done with vinegar and you keep that at room temperature anyway , right ? I deglaze my CI all the time with cider vinegar and have never experienced even the tiniest crack in 10 years . I 'm pretty sure it 's safe . It 's great , actually ; CI deglazes very easily , you just need a small splash of vinegar .
Speaking in generalizations , without knowing the details of content : Anything with a non-stick coating - I would n't put it in the oven . If you do n't know what the non-stick coating is made of , you ca n't be sure if it will melt . Additionally high temperatures and non-stick coating make for off-gassing . Anything with plastic handles , knobs or any other plastic parts - do n't put it in the oven at any temperature . No way to know how it will react . Cast iron - always oven safe to almost any temp that a non-commercial oven would reach Enameled cast iron ( like Le Crueset ) - oven safe to 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Uncoated stainless steel - oven safe to 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Uncoated anodized aluminum - I would say no more than 450 ° F ( 230 ° C ) , to be safe Copper - 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Glass - 450 ° F ( 230 ° C )
Here 's a neat list of plastics &amp; whether they 're supposed to be microwave-safe or not : <URL>
So <URL> and <URL> suggest that there are 3 kinds of rinds . Summary below : Bloomy : Appears white , soft , maybe fuzzy . Can also be reddish/brownish . Comes on softer cheeses that have a more custard-like flavor . Formed by a spray of penicillium candidum before aging . Edible , but the flavor changes and may taste ammoniated over time ( consume so long as it 's palatable ) Washed : Color ranges from pinkish red to orange or brown . Caused by bathing the cheese in some kind of solution , be it a salty brine , beer , brandy , wine or some other alcohol . Contributes to the flavor in some cheeses , and tastes unpleasant in others . Natural : Formed by letting the cheese age on its own , drying out and growing whatever molds might be present in the cheese or air . Tends to have a concentrated flavor of the cheese , but may not be palatable . Examples : Stilton , Montgomery Cheddar , Parmigiano-Reggiano . Sometimes comes under a cloth cover . Should be edible , minus the cloth . Additionally , there are two other possibilities No Rind : There should be no guessing here . You 've probably had cheeses with no rind ... because they might come in a container . Ricotta , fresh mozzarella , and creme fraiche come to mind . Wax/Twig/Cloth : Inedible . Should be discarded My personal takeaway from this quick research is that I should learn to distinguish artificial covers ( cloth/wax ) from rinds . It seems like those that separate from the cheese will either be an artificial cover or an old rind , both of which are undesirable . If it 's indeed a rind , then I 'd taste it , both alone and with the cheese , to determine if it 's palatable . For Parmigiano-Reggiano specifically , I 've read that it goes well in soup . Perhaps this is because it 's unpalatable-y hard , but still contains the concentrated flavor . TLDR : look for cloth/wax . If none , is it tasty ? Does it feel good in the mouth ?
The official answer from your health department is no , it 's not safe . After four hours at room temperature , you have to pitch it . That standard is a little on the paranoid side . Which is appropriate , since they have to protect people for whom a little salmonella is potentially life-threatening ( the infirm , babies , the elderly , etc. ) If you 're young and healthy , the odds are it will do you no harm whatsoever . Even a glass of milk out overnight is merely going to be sour rather than toxic . So , it 's up to you . I 'd say it 's a cup of tea and it will taste better if you make a fresh one , even if the risk to your health is small-but-not-zero .
Yes , it is perfectly safe ( as long as you continue to thaw the meat in a safe manner , as in the refrigerator ) . The marinade will not begin to have much effect until at least the outer layers of the meat are thawed , but it will not otherwise have any side effect . It may get slightly better penetration due to the changes in the texture of the meat from ice crystals , but the effect should be negligible at best . In fact , you can freeze the meat in its marinade if you so choose , and know what you are going to use it for when you thaw . It will get the benefit of marination time until the outer layers are frozen , and then again during the thawing .
There is n't really a " test " , per se , to tell if a bread is a " real sourdough " or not . Without getting overly technical , the tangy " sour " is created by a lactobacillus ( bacteria ) culture feeding on the byproducts of the yeast used to make the dough rise . The byproducts of the bacteria produce the lactic acids which give the resulting bread its sour taste . The taste of sourdough can be simulated by adding other acidic components to the bread dough . Practically speaking , the only way to tell the difference is if you have the experience of a refined palate that you recognize the taste difference . Ah , but here 's the tricky part . Once a baker has a stable culture of yeast and bacteria ( starter ) , they 'll save a bit of the fermented dough to add to the next batch , and so on for batch after batch . It is not unusual for bakers to continue their culture for years or even decades . So the problem of recognizing the authenticity of sourdough is that each bakers ' sourdough will have it 's own distinctive taste . Yikes . So much for the standard taste test . There is one test I can think of ; although , I do n't know how practical this is : A very " healthy " sour dough culture is the result of having reached a really stable and balanced , symbiotic relationship between the yeast and bacteria . This is desirable because it prevents other undesirable bacteria from setting up shop . Because of this inherent stability , real sourdough breads are very resistant to mold and other reactions that cause them to go bad . So , if your sourdough bread seems to last longer then you would expect from fresh bread , that might be a good indication of real sourdough . Of course , this can also be the result of preservatives added to the bread ; so & hellip ; no help there .
Try a <URL> . This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time ( weeks , not days ) .
Sterno is gelled denatured alcohol . It is denatured alcohol ( a combination of methanol and ethanol ) so that you ca n't , safely , drink it , but it is still mostly alcohol , which will dissolve in water and clean up just fine . While I would n't dump a lot of it down the sink , you should have no problem with cleanup . And while Sterno is n't safe to drink , it wo n't be a problem if you touch it in cleaning up . I just double checked the Sterno site and they confirm water cleanup and say , additionally , that it is biodegradable .
I discussed a similar subject in this question : <URL> Raw fish is n't safe to eat if it 's just been sitting around . However , the raw fish used in sushi/sashimi has been frozen ( typically flash-frozen ) in order to kill any parasites , making it as safe as any other food . Most distributors of sashimi also have their own methods and internal regulations to ensure food safety , but specifics are understandably hard to come by . Suffice it to say , it 's far safer to eat properly-prepared nigiri or sashimi than it is to eat an undercooked hamburger .
If we 're going to define " cheese dip " as " some substance made from cheese for the purpose of dipping other food in " - which seems like the only rational definition given no other context - then I 'd have to pinpoint its origin as being fondue . <URL> , the earliest known recipe for fondue comes from the Swiss cookbook , <URL> , first published in 1699 . That predates the Arkansas claim of 1935 by at least a few centuries , if we assume that Wikipedia does indeed list the earliest source . There 's also <URL> which was supposedly brought to Mexico by the Mennonites , which would place its origin in Mexico sometime in the 1920s - assuming that the Mennonites themselves did not simply adapt the recipe from something known even earlier . I 'd have to say that the Arkansas tourism board seems to be trying to pull a fast one on us , laying claim to this " invention " . Maybe they 're defining cheese dip as the specific kind of cheese dip they came up with , which would of course be a tautology .
Given that you have identified the oxygen scavenger as a <URL> , I believe the active ingredient is mainly iron oxide , rust , which is n't inherently harmful .

AGELESS ZPT-type : I did find some data on the <URL> , stating that some types are alright when microwaved , but there were no direct references to direct heating .

Having just returned from Hawaii , I actually have a possible answer for you . There is a type of ginger that you can get there ( though it 's not all that common , far as I could tell ) that 's called blue ginger . It 's just like regular ginger , only it has the blue layer inside as you describe . There was a guy selling it at a roadside fruit stand when we were there . It should be absolutely safe to use . edit : I found a link to somebody talking about it . <URL>
On another couple of sites ( <URL> for starters ) I found the answer to this . It appears that mould is expected sometimes in the Pancetta making process and as a general rule of thumb as long as it is n't too green and furry then it should be OK . I 've followed Ruhlman 's advice and dabbed the spots of mould with a vinegar soaked cloth and it wiped straight off and looks fine . My meat was coming up to the end of it 's hanging time anyway so rather than worry about it further I 've refrigerated it . I hope this helps anyone that stumbles across this with the same issue .
If it 's refrigerated , it 'll last for at least a week , as long as you did n't pre-dairy it . Unrefrigerated , I would n't trust it for more than a day . Coffee is a crappy growth medium and it should start out the next best thing to sterile , but , even covered , its going to start to get moldy . Obviously if you add dairy , then you 're dealing with that dairy shelf-life , and that is n't very long at all .
Butter can go bad . The oils will go rancid if exposed to too much light and heat for too long . This accelerates the process of oxidation , which happens even if you keep the butter in the fridge . Even in the fridge your butter will eventually go bad . Personally I follow the dates on all packages . I do so with an awareness that they usually tend to be conservative , which keeps me comfortable . Rancid butter in a taste test wo n't kill you , though . It 'll just taste bad . So you should be able to taste this butter to see if it is bad . While I recommend following the dates on packaging , here are signs that your butter has actually gone bad : discoloration melting ( which will happen outside of the fridge , you probably would n't see it ) sour smell sour and unusual taste
I 've heard of adding sugar to stir-fries , to make a caramel flavoured sauce/glaze in Vietnamese cooking , as in <URL> . Although I 've usually seen sugar used , I see no reason why a similar effect could not be obtained by using honey .
@niemiro , in your post does " go bad " mean food quality or food safety ? As for safety , you were no where near the " danger zone " either temperature-wise or time-wise . Initially safe , properly stored , frozen food that warms to -6 C ( or 22 F ) for 30 minutes will not render it unsafe to eat . In terms of food quality , freezers ( most of which these days are self-defrosting ) , go through temperature cycles regularly . The problem with this is not food safety , but the accumulation of ice crystals in foods , which degrades quality . Freezer burn is the extreme example . Of course , attention to packaging ( vacuum sealing , for example ) helps .
I think it would depend on the cheese . For a reasonably hard cheese , like cheddar , I have done it , and never gotten sick ( your results may vary ) . If it 's pre-grated , then I would not touch it anymore . For a softer cheese , like a brie , I would not risk it .

What is that gooey stuff from okra ?
The slime is called mucilage . It is around the seeds on the inside of the pod . It is made of protein and carbohydrates including fiber . The mucilage is ( as you alluded in your question ) used for thickening gumbos and similar stews . Besides this , I 've only ever seen it referred to as an annoyance and avoided by leaving the pod whole or dry cooking like frying . I imagine there could be some creative halloween uses of mucilage but those would be off topic for this site . :) EDIT I was embarrassed that this answer was the accepted answer . I do n't like answers that are ( as mine was ) " no that is n't possible because I 've never heard of it . " I was hoping someone else would shatter my world with some amazing new use of okra slime . My curiosity piqued I used some of my copious free time while code compiled to do some more research . I was able to find a couple of non traditional okra recipes that seemed interesting - such as candied okra slices or using the seeds from pickled okra as a caviar-like dish . But none of them took advantage of the mucilage - they all avoided it . Carbohydrate based mucilage is used in ice cream and for other reasons . I found the following study about food health that did experiments with replacing milk fat with specifically okra mucilage ( they refer to it as " okra gum " ) <URL> Two pertinent quotes : " Although not currently produced by food manufacturers , previous studies produced fat-free chocolate bar cookies with acceptable sensory characteristics using okra gum as a fat ingredient substitute . " " Specifically , color and smell of frozen dairy desserts containing okra gum replacement for milk fat did not significantly differ from the control product . Texture , flavor , aftertaste , and overall acceptability ratings also averaged five or higher ( neutral to like ) for all products . " The study was about replacing milk fat where I think it would be more interesting as an enhancer as you asked in your question . It seems perfectly reasonable that okra mucilage could find a place in more modern recipes . But I could n't find anyone doing it .
This depends on what you mean by a gelatin " substitute " . What you have to understand is that while most hydrocolloids have gelling and stabilizing properties , they are not simply interchangeable . You ca n't substitute one of them 1-for-1 where you need gelatin and expect everything to just work . A great place to start would be the <URL> which , despite its name , is almost more of a cookbook , because it has detailed information on the properties of each hydrocolloid . <URL> is actually a stronger gelling agent than gelatin in the sense of having to use less of it to get the same strength , but you need to use it properly . The most important property of agar is that unlike gelatin , which gives hydration at temperatures as low as 50 ° C , agar requires a temperature of 90 ° C . In other words , you need to heat the water all the way to a rapid boil before the agar will actually " activate " . A light simmer is not enough . The other notable property of agar is syneresis , which is the loss of moisture over time . Agar sets extremely fast compared to gelatin and above room temperature , but unless you combine it with a small amount of <URL> , it will actually dry out . Otherwise , though , you can absolutely , definitely substitute agar-agar for gelatin if you actually get pure agar ( I made the mistake of buying the " dessert agar " once , which is not the same thing ) and hydrate/set it properly . In fact , the biggest concern with using agar as a substitute for gelatin is that you might end up with something too stiff , since gelatin produces a much softer gel . Perhaps the closest hydrocolloid to gelatin in terms of its properties is iota type carrageenan . Here 's a side-by-side comparison of the most important characteristics ( this is all taken from the HRC ) : Property | Gelatin | Carrageenan | Agar ------------------ + ----------- + ------------- + --------- <URL> | Yes | Yes | Yes Strength | Soft | Soft | Hard Elasticity | Elastic | Elastic | Brittle <URL> | No | Yes | No Hydration | 50 ° C | 70 ° C | 90 ° C Setting Temp . | 15 ° C | 40-70 ° C | 35-45 ° C Setting Speed | Slow | Fast | Fast Melting Temp . | 25-40 ° C | 45-80 ° C * | 80-90 ° C Viscosity | Low | Medium | Low Gelling Conc . | 0.6-1 .7 % | 1.0-1 .5 % | 0.2 % Syneresis | No | No | Yes You should be able to see by this how much closer carrageenan is to gelatin ; trouble is , it 's difficult to find , and you have to get the right kind ( the kappa type and other types have very different properties ) . There 's actually an even better type of carrageenan to use a gelatin substitute , if you can find it : It 's called <URL> and it 's specifically designed to be a gelatin replacement . I 'd like to also note for the record that the answer in your <URL> is not really appropriate for gelatin desserts that need to hold their shape . Xanthan gum is a fantastic and versatile hydrocolloid but ( to the best of my knowledge ) it does not " set " the way that gelatin , agar , or carrageenan do . It 's more of a thickener/emulsifier/stabilizer , at its highest concentrations being used to produce foams ( but not gels ) . It 's often used to stabilize other gels/foams but I 've never heard of it being used to create a gel on its own . Guar gum is also largely just a thickener , that you could use a stabler replacement for corn starch or arrowroot , which is also mentioned in that answer . None of these are appropriate at all for gels ( desserts ) , they are only useful as thickeners .
I have n't been able to find any empirical data , but here are my theories : Most cookies contain butter which has similar proteins as milk and the combination of the two resonates on that level . Soy milk does not share those protein profiles , so there is no sensory resonance . Cookies are generally quite sweet and rich . Milk helps blunt that sweetness by washing away some of the sugar and coating the tongue . Many soy milks have sweeter taste than dairy milk which would make the overall sweetness of the combination excessive . ( For comparison 's sake does your roommate use soy milk on sweetened cereals or more neutral-tasting cereals ? I would suspect the latter . ) In addition to the natural " grassy " flavors that soy milks can have , they may also have other flavorants like vanilla that make them less neutral flavored than dairy milk which competes with the flavor of the cookies .
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
In the general case , it is not possible . As you cook meat past about 165 F , all of the proteins will have denatured and contracted , squeezing out moisture . This is what makes well done meat tough and stringy or rubbery . This process can not really be reversed , although you can try to mask it with a sauce . In the specific case of certain cuts -- the ones famous for braises or barbecue , the " low and slow " cooking techniques -- there is some hope , but it is a thin one depending on what you have been doing . These cuts , the most active working parts of the animal such as the shoulders ( chuck for beef or butt for pork ) have a great deal of intramuscular fat , as well as connective tissue made of a protein called collagen . Over time , when cooked slowly at temperatures of about 180 F , the collagen in the meat will turn into gelatin , which has a silky , smooth mouth feel , and the fat will lubricate the meat . They still have their proteins irreversibly dentures and tightened , but the gelatin and fat provide a new kind of moisture and unctuousness that is highly prized . The cooking techniques for this ( braising , barbecuing , slow roasting ) are rarely employed for chops or steaks that you would do in the frying pan . They also simply do n't have the collagen or the fat to make it possible . That is why they are better off with the higher temperature , faster cooking methods , but should not be overcooked , as you have discovered to your dismay . Your best option is not to try to recover from this situation , which is very difficult to do , but rather to learn to prevent it : Get a good instant read thermometer to check the internal temperature of your steaks or chops Learn what the safe temperature is for that type of meat . For example , poultry and pork should both be cooked to at least 155 F ( and for poultry , many people have learned to like even more done meat ) The FDA recommends 165 F for ground meat ( which is quite well done ) Measure the temperature of your meat and learn to recognize when it is done Assess what level of risk you are willing to accept Over time , you will learn to recognize when cuts are done to your liking by how they feel when you poke them with your finger ( which is a pretty good indication of how done they are , based on how resilient they are ) , but the thermometer will be your guide until you build that experience . Still , this will require that you adjust your expectations of what completely cooked meat looks like . Pork may still be a touch rosy , for example .
170 degrees is perfectly fine . To talk bacteria , you have to take into account two factors : temperature , and time . Anything between 40 and 140 is good for them , anything above 140 is bad . At the same time , food in the dangerzone that is eaten/cooked/frozen promptly , is fine , because it takes time to build up a colony of harmful proportions . In this case your temperature is 170 degrees , which is hot enough to kill most common bacteria instantly ( Milk is pasteurized in the 160s ) , and then you keep it at that temperature for hours ? The toughest common bacteria ( C. botulinum ) dies very quickly at 180 degrees ... It 's the only one I know off the top of my head that does n't immediately die in the 170 range . And keeping your stock at 170 for 10 minutes or so will kill any C. botulinum that may have somehow found it 's way inside it . You 've got nothing to worry about . ( <URL> )
The best way to get rid of the ants ? Toss the ants and the butter in the trash or a trash bag that you can quickly seal to prevent the ants from spreading around your house . Then , wash the container and check it for any holes or openings where the ants could have gotten in through ( can do a water test - fill it with water and see if any water escapes ) . Then , go out and buy fresh butter .
Unless there was sugar in your cream , there 's nothing particularly sweet about this combination . Did you salt the pasta water to roughly seawater saltiness ? If not , did you adjust salt before serving ? If your pasta water was under-salted , that would explain the sweetness , since the only significant source of salt otherwise was the parmesan . Heavy cream is equivalent to 36-40 % whipping cream . In the event that your cream was pre-sweetened , there 's not much you could do except add salt and hope the sugar does n't overwhelm . It 's a fairly common technique to add sugar to a salty dish to make it taste richer , or salt to a sweet dish for a similar purpose . But it would n't work very well if the cream was very sweet . Since I 've never seen sweetened whipped cream except in aerosol dispensers , I ca n't say for sure .
If you 're at all like me , you are reassured by hard numbers and measurables . This should help . In this situation one of the likely pathogens would be one of the Salmonella species . Salmonella is killed by temperatures in excess of 130 F ( 55 C ) . However , it 's not an instant death . The time to kill Salmonella decreases exponentially as the temperature increases . The following table represents all the temperature and duration to kill 99.9999 % of the most heat-resistant strain Salmonella senftenberg . This species is as much as 30x more heat resistant than a " normal " S. typhimurium . Temperature | Time --------------- | ------ 140 F ( 60 C ) | 60m 150 F ( 65 C ) | 10m 160 F ( 70 C ) | < 2m For any given temperature the proportion of bacteria killed is constant . 1/6th the time kills 90 % , 1/3rd kills 99 % , 1/2 kills 99.9 % etc. . USDA guidelines to kill Salmonella and E. Coli are as follows : Temperature | Time --------------- | ------ 135 F ( 57 C ) | 86.4 m 140 F ( 60 C ) | 8.6 m 145 F ( 63 C ) | 2.7 m 150 F ( 65 C ) | 51.9 s 160 F ( 70 C ) | < 6s 165 F ( 74 C ) | < 2s So , needless to say , re-searing your steak at a typically high stove top temperature ( at least 300 F [ 149 C ] ) for even a fraction of a second will result in utter devastation to whatever beastie population you may have picked up in recontaminating your meat . Chances are , if the steak came hot out of the pan , and you removed it from the plate quickly , the residual heat alone would be enough to kill it . The re-sear certainly does n't hurt though . A good rule of thumb is to wash plates as you go . If this is not possible or convenient you should minimally remove the plate from your vicinity by putting it in the sink or dishwasher as soon as you have taken the food off of it .
There actually does n't seem to be a special word for this as a technique - as common as it is ( to add an egg to the top of a dish and use the runny yolk as sauce ) , it is usually just the dish name " topped with an egg " or " topped with a fried egg " . Sometimes the egg is fried , occasioanlly poached , sometimes it is cracked on top of the dish and cooked in the residual heat - the goal of having the yolk serve as sauce remains the same , though . Some dish variations specify the egg on top - in some south American countries , a steak topped with an egg is called a " <URL> " or riding steak . I have heard of pancakes topped with a fried egg being called a " texas one-eye " , though i ca n't find a citation just now . Pasta with a raw egg added , which is supposed to be cooked in the residual heat and make a sauce of the yolk - is pasta " <URL> " . Its a little funny , but as common as it is to find a dish with topped with an egg , so the yolk will double as sauce - it does n't seem to have a name more specific . ( And it is really common , all sorts of cultures have <URL> ) . You can say " topped with an egg " , or use ElendilTheTall or ESultanik 's suggestions for how to specify the soft-cooked nature of the fried egg , and people will probably understand you . Edit : with the help of some comments from Andrew Mattson , Relaxed , and Chuu , we now have a potential term : steak " Au Cheval " ( French ) or beef " a cavalo " ( south American ) means a steak with an egg on top . The words look similar-ish enough to seem related in word appearance and meaning , yet from two different countries - which translate the term to horse riding or horseback steak , meaning the egg is on top of the dish . So with that commonality , we might take the term " Au Cheval " and take it to mean when an egg is laid on top of , or " riding " the dish . As a term it wo n't be too well known right now , someone may not be understood if you just ask for a sandwich or veggie hash " au cheval " ... but if enough people see this definition , or start using it , it may become the official term for the cooking technique !
The first thing I would suggest is finding a copy of " Food and Beverage Mycology , 2nd . Edition " by Larry R. Beuchat . There are two chapters that are directly pertinent to your question : " field and storage fungi " ( p211-232 ) and " mycotoxins " ( p517-570 ) . However , in order to specifically answer the question , one would need to be familiar with three additional chapters : 50 pages of classification of yeast and molds at the beginning of the book , and two equally substantial chapters on detection of mycotoxins and fungi . Without identifying the exact species of fungus on the wood , and therefore what particular toxins it may produce ( many produce toxins that are harmful to us , some produce ones that are only harmful to other fungi ) , it is impossible to say that it is safe to smoke with this wood . Some of the toxins may be degraded by heat , some may become even more hazardous . Even with all of my equipment in my " kitchen lab " ( including an incubator that I use for growing edible fungi ) , I would just use the mold-covered wood for a nice fire around which my neighbors could gather and share some barbecue smoked on clean , dry wood ( scientific studies show that soaking wood does not actually do anything but get the very outside layer wet ) .
This is just fancy sounding talk for the myriad of techniques in good cooking that create good flavor in dishes . It does n't refer to any one specific thing . Some examples of techniques used to develop flavor include : Seasoning ( properly salting ) Browning meats and other foods properly to bring out their flavor Creating pan sauces or other uses from fond to enhance the flavor of a dish Using herbs and spices skilfully to compliment the food Balancing flavors with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or tomatoes Cooking properly to allow the flavor of individual ingredients to shine through Blooming or toasting spices to bring out their more aromatic qualities Using alcohol to enhance certain flavors not soluble in water or fat There are no doubt many , many more things that could be included in a list like this . After all , it sounds far more professional to say " the flavor in this dish is not well developed " than to say " this dish is bad . "
First of all , the term " molecular gastronomy " is almost universally derided by those who practice it and " Modernist cuisine " seems to have become the accepted nomenclature . The book Modernist Cuisine has what I regard as an excellent introduction to the movement and drawing the analogy with other Modernist movements in other artforms . The Modernist movement was about rejecting the lineage of everything that had come before and re-examining basic questions such as " what is perception " . Similarly , we can trace a direct lineage from Escoffier to Nouvelle Cuisine and Modernist cuisine seeks to break that lineage . The best way I 've come up with to describe the Modernist philosophy is " the use of technology to gain direct , precise control over temperature , humidity , pressure and texture " . When you 're poaching fish in a simmering stock , you want to bring the fish up to 45C by putting it in 80C stock that 's heated by a 600C flame . You control point in this scenario is the knob of the stove which is the second derivative of the temperature of this fish . What 's more , your feedback loop is entirely perceptual and based on human sensing and control . Modernist cuisine starts with the goal of bringing a fish up to 45C and determines the optimal way of accomplishing that goal which is sous vide . With Sous Vide , you are directly controlling the temperature of the fish and you 're doing it precisely because you replace humans with automated feedback loops . Another example might be reducing a sauce . In this case , you manipulate the vapor pressure of the liquid through the indirect application of heat . What you really want is to drive water off but you end up causing many inadvertent changes as well . With Modernist cuisine , you use a rotovap to control pressure directly and vacuum evaporate liquids without heating . Same with using a roux or cornstarch to thicken a gravy . Instead of indirectly controlling the texture of a sauce by picking from one of the dozen common , natural thickeners , Modernist cuisine starts from asking exactly what textural qualities you want from a sauce and then figuring out the right combination of starches , hydrocolloids and proteins that accomplish that task . Modernist cuisine may seem complicated on the surface because so much of it is new and unfamiliar but I find it actually to be radically more simple than traditional cooking once you understand this ethos . Rather than a hodgepodge of tradition built up over millennia , Modernist cooking is simply about starting first from your desired goals of flavor , temperature , pressure &amp; texture and then figuring out the appropriate use of technology to accomplish that goal .
I have done this before and it has worked for me . It should work , but if it does n't , I know what will . My aunt sold Jam for a while and when the pectin did n't work she reheated and added a small amount of gelatin , I helped her stir it in , and that was the final fix for her bad mix .
Yep , that 'll be fine . For other purposes , it might not be your favorite - sometimes it can get a little more of the " slimy " coating that people do n't like - but since you 're cooking it in gumbo , it 's all just going to get taken up into the stew ( where it 'll provide some thickening , as intended ) , so no worries . A little more , if you 're curious : okra contains mucilage , which is thick and slimy or gluey . If it 's cooked quickly , it does n't have time to release much . But when it 's cooked long and slow , like in gumbo , plenty is released and dissolved in the soup , where it acts as a thickener . Frozen okra sometimes releases the mucilage more readily , presumably because the structure of the plant has been disrupted by the ice crystals formed during freezing . This might make it unappealing when eaten on its own , but if you 're making stewed okra or gumbo , where it would all have come out anyway , it does n't make any difference . ( I suspect that good quality frozen okra , which has been flash-frozen , might fare better , but I do n't have the experience to say for sure , and it wo n't make any difference to you ! )
Ground pork is simply that , pork . Pork sausage is ground pork that has been seasoned . You can substitute , but you 'll have to bring your own seasoning .
This information should be indicated on the label : sweet , sweet &amp; sour , spicy , smoked ... Generic paprika is sweet and will probably not have much flavor ( that is why paprika can be used in paella together with saffron - see <URL> )
Cleanliness , as pTerry reminds us , is only next to godliness in a very sternly abridged dictionary . However , working clean has three main things going for it : order ! when you 're trying to bang out a couple hundred dishes as fast as possible , being orderly and methodical in your work is not just important , it is absolutely vital . safety ! see above . if your area is a mess , you 're more likely to injure yourself or others . Bear in mind that we play with sharper knives and hotter burners than you do at home health ! a clean work area is one that is free of cross-contamination . Per calumbrodie 's answer below , I 'd like to expand a bit on the need for order . I 'll do this by telling you about my day today . We 've just rotated the kitchen ; chef does this from time to time to make sure everyone is cross-trained on all stations . So right now for the restaurant I 'm responsible for sandwiches ( one hot menu sandwich , one daily special ) , prepping one of our appetizers , one hot appetizer , soup daily , and one of our main courses ( crepe stuffed with pan-roasted wild mushrooms , caramelized shallots , and barre boulard cheese which is just heavenly ) . In addition to that , we also have a takeout counter and a satellite location elsewhere in the building ; for those I am responsible for sixteen sandwiches daily ( different from the restaurant sandwiches ! ) as well as stuffed chicken which goes with a salad . We start work at 9:30 AM , everything for the takeout must be ready by 11:15 , and restaurant service runs from 11:30 until 3PM . You should be able to see the time constraints this imposes . When I walked in this morning , here is what I had to do just to get the counter stuff out , and be ready for service : Bake bread ( parbaked , frozen , from a local artisanal baker ; we simply do not have the room to bake our own , although chef is open to the idea of tasking me with that ) Bread , par-fry , stuff , and bake chicken breasts . Deep-fry onions until crispy ( garnish for the menu sandwich ) Make crepes ( must be done fresh daily ) Make sandwiches for the counters ( today I was lucky ; I had some of the mise ready from some free time on Saturday ) Oops , mayonnaise did n't come in Friday 's delivery , better make some ... Make garnish for the soup I made Saturday Double check all my mise en place in case I forgot something . Chef has slimmed down the menu somewhat , but I still have roughly fifteen to twenty different components which must all be ready , all the time . With backups in case we get slammed . I have 1h 45m to do all of these things . And while I work best in a situation that looks like chaos to the outside observer , everything is carefully organized and planned . For example , crepes are something that -- if you 've made enough of them -- you can interweave with another task : make the batter first . Ladle batter into pan , spin around , put back on the heat . Good , now I have a minute or two to work on another task ; make a sandwich . Flip crepe , cut and wrap sandwich . Remove crepe from pan , repeat . And this was a slow day . On a busy day , this list could easily be twice as long , including some things that will simply take time and require undivided attention . So that took right up until service . During service I 'm still prepping : everything I need for tomorrow that can possibly be done today , I do . So ... roasting turkey for tomorrow 's sandwich , making a cranberry aioli , making crab croquettes for the entremetier station ( so : mashed potatoes , chilled -- oh dear that 's going to take two hours to come down in temp , better get started now -- then folded around a crab mixture ) , some sort of stuffing for tomorrow 's chicken ... and on top of that I 've got to be planning for Wednesday , for which I will need a new soup ( and garnish ) , got ta roast another lamb leg -- and that needs to chill too so I can slice it carefully , make sure I 've got enough bread in stock , and oh wait -- we have a catering function Thursday for which I need to make about a dozen things , best figure out when I 'm going to do that ... And all of this is being done while chits are coming out of the printer , so I need to be organized in such a way that I can not only stop whatever project I 'm working on , but that having those ingredients/tools on my station wo n't impede my ability to serve food in a timely manner . ... you get the point . ( There 's a much better treatment of this , from an exec 's POV , in Bourdain 's Kitchen Confidential ) . Without some order to my workspace ( which is thankfully large ) , I would quickly be dans la merde and everything would go a bit pear-shaped . I 've had those days , and it is difficult for me to convey how much it sucks to look at the clock , know you have five minutes left , and know that you have fifteen minutes of work still to go . The thing about working in a kitchen is that , apart from a very few places which run with military precision ( Alinea , Fat Duck , elBulli , Moto , the Laundry , etc ) , there is never enough time . Ever . And when there is enough time , well , there 's
I 'll attempt to expand upon daniel 's answer above . Boudin describes a sausage that is generally created from a blend of beef , rice , and/or pork ( <URL> ) . Sometimes other types of proteins are added to create variations : Gator , Shrimp , crawfish , etc. . Boudin is widely known to be used in Cajun cooking . Other various types of Boudin exists . As wikipedia defines various different types of boudin : Boudin blanc : A white sausage made of pork without the blood . Pork liver and heart meat are typically included . In Cajun versions , the sausage is made from a pork rice dressing [ ... ] In French/Belgian cuisine , the sausage is sauteed or grilled . The Louisiana version is normally simmered or braised , although coating with oil and slow grilling for tailgating is becoming a popular option in New Orleans and Baton Rouge . Boudin noir : A dark-hued blood sausage , containing pork , pig blood , and other ingredients . Variants of the boudin noir occur in French , Belgian , Cajun and Catalan cuisine [ ... ] Shrimp Boudin : Similar to crawfish boudin , it is made by adding the shrimp to rice [ ... ] [ 4 ] Boudin rouge : In Louisiana cuisine , a sausage similar to boudin blanc , but with pork blood added to it . This originated from the French boudin noir . Brown Rice Boudin : Taste is very similar to traditional pork boudin , except this boudin > is made with a brown-rice substitute for those looking to cut down on white rice intake .
It is almost impossible to reduce the sweetness of cookie dough once made , without further reducing the quality . The closest you could come would be to create a second batch of cookie dough ingredients with reduced sugar , and combine it with your existing dough . However , it will be difficult to achieve good integration of the two batches , and even if you do , the extra working of the first batch from the mixing will create additional gluten , making tougher cookies . In this case , you might want to try some sort of tart lemon glaze or perhaps a very bittersweet chocolate icing to compliment your cookies and reduce the impression of sweetness . On the other hand , except for butter , sugar cookies contain no expensive ingredients . It may not be worth trying to salvage this batch . In the end , this is probably a lesson learned that your particular recipe is not to your liking as is . Next time , you will want to either reduce the sugar , or use another recipe .

How to mix pasta and sauce evenly ?
Do n't put the shrimp etc in the sauce in the first place and cook it separately , that way you do n't have to take it out . Then just top your pasta with it and if say you are cooking meatballs and want a little sauce on them mix a little sauce in with your meatballs and then put them on top . If you want that mixed in with the pasta look then do the same thing I said above and mix the pasta in your individual serving bowls or plates if you are using one after you have dressed your pasta . Your just not going to get an even distribution with random variables , all you can do is pick and count if you want everything evens .
Traditionally , for almost all of my recipes , the vanilla is added as soon as you remove the pot from the heat . You definitely want the heat to meld the vanilla flavor with the fats , but you do n't want to cook it . I would highly recommend splitting the bean lengthwise and either adding them that way to allow milk access to the flavorful seeds , or simply add the seeds alone . I 'd opt for the former , and fish out the husks after the sauce/pudding has cooled . Or , as you say , use ground vanilla bean as-is and you 're all set .
Your question makes me think of demi-glace . From your question , I would say that you 're trying to get a nice shiny thick sauce for your duck , one that tastes of red wine . If that 's your goal , I would recommend you Reduce your stock down until it 's about the total volume of liquid that you 're going to want . The stock reduction should be roughly the consistency you want your final sauce to be . Add an equal volume of wine Reduce down to desired consistency ( so about by half ) . This will give you a lovely sauce , with lots of that sticky goodness that reduced stocks deliver so nicely . You might do this with all of your stock , then freeze cubes of unused sauce for later ; they make a great addition to other bases . Left-over alcohol is not going to be an issue here , by the way , you 'll have long since boiled/simmered it off .
After a bunch of Googling and reading I found that there are several ways to improve the noodles : Rinse and drain them very , very well Boil them for an extended amount of time to reduce the crunch Dry them out in a pan ( they 'll shrivel a bit ) before adding them to recipes where they either remain crunchy ( in dryer dishes ) or absorb sauce and flavor ( saucier dishes ) Here are some my sources : <URL> <URL> <URL>
You need 1.1 x as much water as pasta for al dente ! I measured this myself , cooking penne rigate ( in water , not sauce ) - 200g of pasta weighed 420g after being cooked and thoroughly drained . The estimate below from the nutrition facts is 1.4 x , which probably corresponds to typical American overcooked pasta - a surprisingly large difference from mine . I 'm guessing you 'll be somewhere between , maybe 1.25 x . You can also ballpark it from nutrition facts . <URL> has 31g carbs per 100g pasta , and <URL> has 75g carbs per 100g pasta . So 100g dry pasta turns into 100g * 75/31 = 242g of cooked pasta , meaning the added water was ~ 1.4 x the weight of the pasta . So for a pound of pasta , that 's 1.4 pounds or about 2 2/3 cups of water . Given people 's tastes , this might be a little past al dente , so I would personally start with maybe 1.25 cups of water then add a little more if necessary . ( I 'll also try cooking pasta normally and weighing it if I get a chance . ) Note : if you have a significantly different variety of pasta , it will obviously behave differently . This is for pasta that 's 13 % protein and 75 % carbohydrates . For the standard 2oz/56g ( dry ) serving on the package , it 'll say 7g protein and 41-42g carbohydrates . I checked Barilla , De Cecco , Ronzonni , Garofalo , Safeway store brand , Trader Joe 's store brand , and those nutrition facts , and they all matched . If you 're branching out to other styles like whole grains or egg noodles , things will obviously change , but things are very uniform in the US .
American versions of Mongolian BBQ are often pretty sweet ( this does n't sound like an authentic recipe ) . More soy sauce ( or more of everything but the sugar ) would cut the sweetness . Chili oil would certainly give it heat , but is n't going to temper the sweetness much . Any of the following would offset the sweetness and be appropriate for this type of dish : Any tart apple ( a common ingredient in the Japanese version of Mongolian BBQ ) Onions ( not caramelized ) Rice wine vinegar
A 9 " round pan that is 1 1/2 " deep takes 6 cups of batter , while one that is 2 " deep takes 8 . That 's for totally full to the brim . This <URL> says about the amount of batter from a box : An average 2-layer cake mix yields 4 to 5 1/2 cups of batter . and should have a bunch of helpful guides to using batter for non-standard pans .
To get a shiny , flaky , crackly , light-colored crust on the top of your brownies , there are two effective changes you can make : Beat the brownie batter for longer after adding the eggs . Doing this increases the crust , which is actually meringue . This is what you should try with your box mix , since the sugar is already included in box . Use white sugar ( granulated sugar ) with a from-scratch brownie recipe . Brown sugar and corn syrup contain more moisture than white sugar , which will reduce the shiny crackly crust .
Your technique is going to be critical here . Leaning scones are n't necessarily indicative of improper technique , but flat ones are . Keeping your ingredients cold is important when creating scones in every recipe I 've read or tried . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> as to grate the butter and then freeze the grated pieces and use a <URL> to provide layers . Many other recipes use cold butter ( frozen or simply very cold out of the freezer ) in chunks and a pastry blender to cut them in . Your milk should also be cold , not room temperature . You may also want to chill your work bowl and utensils . You do n't want your butter melting before those scones hit the oven . When your scones hit the oven and the butter does begin to soften and melt , it will leave behind layers of air in your scone which will help it to rise . You do n't want to handle finished scone dough very much . Use a light touch and minimal work . I 'd also check the date on your self-raising flour . The ingredients will lose their activity over time , causing the flour not to rise as well any more .
You might try reducing the cooking heat a little , say on medium heat . That way , the middle will finish cooking without the outside being overcooked . And usually when you flip a pancake it should be almost entirely cooked through anyway . You want to flip when the bubbles are pretty set on the top .
Separating the eggs and whipping the egg whites before folding into the batter could assist in this . At home it 's not a problem , but if it 's a very busy that you had them in they 're not likely to be doing this due to the fact that this will need to be done in batches . Adding a bit of baking soda in addition to the baking powder could assist as well , but only if you 're using buttermilk . If you 're using regular milk the baking soda is going to create a soapy taste . In the case of buttermilk and baking soda , the primary leavening would be coming from the baking powder and then the acidity of the buttermilk would provide the reaction for the soda to give that extra " oomph " . If you 're using baking soda then you 'll have to use the batter right away otherwise those bubble will rise to the surface and pop , releasing their CO2 to the air . Same goes with adding seltzer water ... add just before cooking the pancakes . As for replacing milk with seltzer water ... this will add bubbles to the batter but having less fat in the batter ( presuming you 're using whole milk ) will increase the gluten development . If you 're using low-fat or nonfat buttermilk or regular milk it may not be as much of a difference . The benefit of buttermilk ( besides flavor ) is the acidity that it provides . Acidic doughs do n't allow gluten to develop as easily and therefore create a more tender texture . Overmixing pancake batter is a MAJOR issue with most people . Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients , add the liquid ingredients which have already been beaten together and then carefuly fold just until combined so there are n't major pockets of dry ingredients but by no means should the batter be smooth . Mixing to a smooth consistency will develop gluten and create tough pancakes . A few lumps are fine as they will hydrate upon sitting . If you 're not using baking soda and seltzer water you can improve tenderness by letting your pancake batter sit after mixing for 30-60 minutes . This is the idea behind chilling pastry crusts . It not only allows gluten to relax but mainly it allows the starch granules of the flour to absorb moisture , hydrate , and expand ( bloom ) . This is could likely be part of what contributed to the pancakes you enjoyed at the restaurant . If it 's a very busy place , most likely they produce their pancake batter in large batches a day ahead for the next day 's service . This extended resting time would allow for maximum hydration of the starch which will make a thicker batter . The thicker the batter the less spread you 'll have on the griddle . Obviously this provides limitations if you wake up with an appetite for pancakes !
The simple answer is : You reduce a cream sauce the same way you reduce any other sauce , by simmering it until a certain amount of liquid is gone , just like the instructions said . You have to be careful about temperature though , because milk ( or cream ) can burn at high temperatures , and then your sauce is ruined . You should keep it to a low or at most medium simmer . Cream sauces normally tend to thicken extremely fast , so the long cooking time is almost certainly due to watering it down . I do n't think the water was necessary at all ; the chicken broth was probably for flavouring , and although " broth " is a somewhat nebulous term , one would normally expect a broth to contain at least some amount of gelatin , which will cause the sauce to thicken substantially when it cools if you reduce it a lot . Water does n't , so you 've added no flavour and thinned out the sauce . Basically , you ( or your wife ) added water for no other purpose than to try to evaporate it later . Water generally does n't go in a cream sauce . If you do n't have chicken broth or ca n't use it , I would either substitute more wine or just leave it out completely . Usually the only time you substitute water for broth is if it 's actually the base of your sauce .
<URL> is as good advice as any I 'd give . In my experience , it gets some slimy mold stuff on it . If it feels slimy , its probably not good to eat , although the mold might taste delicious , you never know ...
If I plan on storing my pasta in the fridge with the sauce , I take the pasta out of the boiling water and immediately rinse it in cold water . I rinse until the pasta has cooled completely . Make sure to drain it well . Afterwards , I either mix a little sauce in the pasta to help keep it from sticking or just put the sauce on top . Basically I 'm trying to stop the pasta from continuing to " Cook " in the sauce .
After washing them , fill them with a mild bleach solution ( one tablespoon for each cup of water ) and let them out in the sun exposing the stain for a whole day . Make sure children and animals can not reach the containers with bleach . There used to be a product called Cascade Plastic Booster that you could add to your dishwasher that would remove the stains . It 's no longer sold but its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide at 5 % , which you may buy in most drugstores .
It will be slight variations in the recepies , slight variations in how you cookied it or it will be your mind playing tricks . Shape will not affect the taste of pasta . One shape however may be thicker than others , and if not cooked taking that into account , you may have a different taste , but cooked to the same level , no difference .
White pizza sauce is n't nearly as defined as red sauce . It 's largely whatever you want it to be . It 's literally any sauce you top a pizza with that is white . It is often dairy based ( cream or cheese added ) , but it could also be a thin parsnip puree . It may contain herbs , it may contain butter , its up to you . Again , thickness is up to you and whatever works for your dish .
Cook the pancetta on a large pan , so that it fries in its own fat . It must turn red , but do n't cook it too much as you are going to cook it a bit more later on . Open two eggs . If you like the color of the carbonara intense , throw one white away , and keep one white and two yolks . Put them in a bowl , then add grated parmigiano and mix with a fork . The amount of parmesan should be at least the same volume of the eggs , maybe even more ( twice does not hurt ) . This will give you a rather firm but still flowing compound . Firm is better than too liquid . Cook the pasta . Spaghetti is the norm for carbonara , but also penne is a good choice . Get them " al dente " or some second later , as you prefer . Drain the pasta and put it in the pan you used to cook the pancetta ( where the pancetta still is ) . Pour the egg/cheese mix on top of the pasta and put the pan on gentle heat , while you continue moving and mixing . Detach any layer of cooked egg from the bottom of the pan while you mix . The perfect carbonara must not be liquid , and it must not be clumpy solid , so keep mixing or you will get a pasta omelette . Once you are done , turn off the heat , and take spaghetti up with a large fork , so to disentangle them while you transfer them on the dishes . move them in the dish with a small oscillating movement to disentangle a bit more . Continue like this for all the dishes you have to serve . At the end you will have the pancetta remaining in the pan , and you put it on top of each dish . Add more grated parmigiano and some ground black pepper and eat as soon and hot as possible ! Additional notes : try to stay a bit scarce on salt in the pasta water , and do not add salt to the egg . The fact is that the pancetta is already pretty salted , and you risk to obtain a very salted final result . Carbonara should be salty , but not too salty . I heard about modification with butter and cream , but I have never seen them used , at least in my family and circle of friends .
Your typical Tamari is , to my understanding , going to be closer to dark than light soy sauce . So you 'd want light as a second soy sauce . Inside Japan , there are five kinds of soy sauce : Koikuchi , which is your most typical soy sauce Usukuchi , which is lighter because it has fermented rice in it Tamari , which has more soy than wheat and thus is a bit darker Shiro , which has more wheat than soy and thus is a bit lighter Saishikomi , which is " twice-brewed " and thus twice as dark In China , you have two : regular " light " soy sauce , and " dark " , which is the light stuff processed further and aged . Therefore , " sashikomi " is the Japanese equivalent to dark soy sauce , if you want to stick with Japanese classifications . If your recipes are aimed at english-speaking audiences , however , the terms are likely to be used a lot looser and less precisely than in Japan or China . Kikkoman , which is the biggest name brand I 've seen in the US , brews a regular , a Tamari , and a gluten-free ( Tamari can have some gluten in it ) . Therefore , I would normally assume that to an American chef , " dark soy sauce " is Tamari . " Light soy sauce " might mean the low-sodium stuff , or it might mean Shiro or Usukuchi . Your basic unqualified " soy sauce " is Koikuchi .
If you let it sit in the sauce overnight then it 's no longer a sauce , it 's a marinade . That 's fine , but marinating is something you generally do with tough , cheap , and/or dry cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or top rounds ( beef ) . For a full chicken , especially the wings , drumsticks and thighs , a marinade is entirely unnecessary and in my humble opinion simply dilutes the deliciously moist interior and often makes the whole thing soggy and depressing . Generally the goal ( or at least my goal and that of the majority of restaurants I 've been to ) for chicken wings or even a traditional roasted whole chicken is a nice crispy , golden-brown , well-seasoned skin with juicy meat on the inside . You ca n't get that if you douse it in sauce before grilling it . The water in the sauce will inhibit the Maillard reaction that causes browning ( and crisping ) , and as Mike points out , the sauce may even burn . In fact , it almost certainly will burn ; most store-bought BBQ sauces only last a few minutes exposed to direct heat . With that in mind , the best time to sauce a grilled ( BBQ ) chicken is after it 's cooked , or more precisely , when it 's nearly cooked . Go ahead and season it liberally and coat it in butter or oil beforehand , but wait until it is no more than a few minutes away from being done before you sauce it . You 're not trying to cook the sauce , and it takes no more than a few minutes to get the sauce to bind to the skin - i.e. a few coats with 30-60 seconds each to reduce and form a sort of glaze . This is true for almost any meat and any cooking method as long as you 're not marinating - BBQ chicken , fried or convection-baked wings , smoked or oven-braised ribs - you almost always want to sauce it right at the end . If your technique and ingredients are good then the meat , not the sauce , should be your main attraction .

How to make dry bulgur wheat ?
When you refer to cooking Bulgur wheat , do you boil it in a pot of water ? Admittedly the only thing I have ever done with Bulgur wheat was Tabbouleh , where you just reconstitute the dry Bulgur wheat by pouring boiling water on it and letting it soak that way until it softens and fluffs up real nice &amp; golden with every grain separate from the others . I.e. not sticky or gluey . One time , on bad advice , I bought " cracked wheat " which is , I gather now from Wikipedia , not the same , even though some people think the two are identical . On that occasion , my " Bulgur " wheat did soften but was grayish in color and the individual grains stuck together kind of like oatmeal . Wikipedia says that Bulgur wheat has been parboiled already , so you would n't need to boil it a lot to cook it , but merely re-hydrate with just the right amount of boiling water . So ... if possibly you are using " cracked wheat " like I did , maybe this info can help with the stickiness problem .
My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well . It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily " broken " . I 've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it does n't take to cookie cutters , but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz ( or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle , sprinkle with your finger tips ) cold water on it . ( Like adding water to pie dough ) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in . Repeat until it just stops breaking . Do n't go overboard and make it gooey . I 'd use water over oil or milk because it 's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process . Such minuscule amounts of water should n't yield a detectable change in the end product . If this is a consistent problem with the recipe , in the future I 'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps .
Firstly consider a lower temprature but do start with a very hot pan , and turn down the heat and make sure you baste your fish correctly ; cook skin side for a longer time , untill you have the desired colour . Add your butter and let it foam , and only then turn your fish . Once you have turned your fish you can take your pan off the heat . Start basting with foamy butter . For plaice , It should be done in under 1 minute . If your not serving straight away remove from pan for hot holding . If you keep to do this method , its hard to end up with a dry fish .
Mark Bittman actually includes a very handy quick-reference flour substitution table in <URL> ( mine is the 10th anniversary edition , not sure if it 's in previous editions ) . This assumes that the bread recipe calls for all-purpose flour and tells you how much you can substitute for the quantity the recipe calls for : Whole wheat : use up to 50 % in recipes Rye : light : up to 40 % medium : up to 30 % dark/pumpernickle : up to 20 % Cornmeal : up to 10 % Buckwheat : up to 20 % Rice : up to 25-30 % Nut : up to 25-30 % Soy : up to 25 % Spelt : up to 100 % ; then either decrease water by 25 % or increase flour by 25 % Oat : up to 25-30 % The reason that different types of flours substitute at different ratios is primarily due to gluten content . Breads ( both quick and yeast ) made with alternative flours , especially non-wheat flours , will be heavier , denser , and less elastic ; the substitution ratios above are meant to provide a nice balance between the nutritional and flavor advantages of the alternative flours with the texture qualities of all-purpose flour . For more information about the specific properties of each type of flour listed here , see the section called " The Basics of Flour " in How to Cook Everything ( p. 835-838 in the 10th Anniversary ed . ) Note : These substitutions are specifically for breads , where you want a sturdy , elastic structure . Low-protein or low-gluten flours may substitute at different ratios in other types of baked goods like desserts where you want a finer , more tender crumb . But I did n't get into that since the question was specifically about bread .
What you are looking for is called wholemeal flour . Here 's a quick US to UK baking translation guide . US on the left , UK on the right : All-purpose flour = plain flour bread flour = strong flour ( both have extra gluten ) whole wheat flour = wholemeal flour 1 stick of butter is 113g ( get a scale , trust me ) 1 large egg = 1 medium egg
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
None of the answers so far mention collagen -- specifically , using a stock made from roasted and cracked poultry bones . You do n't have to roast the bones , but you do need to crack them -- use a large , heavy knife or cleaver ( not a chinese vegetable cleaver , you 'll screw up the edge ) to chop the bones up into about 2 " to 3 " pieces ( 5 to 7cm ) . Put them in cold water , and slowly bring it up to a simmer , and just leave it simmering for a few hours . You can add vegetables , too , but you 'll want to pitch them , as they 'll have been overcooked by the time the simmering 's done . Then strain everything , and use that as the base of your soup . If your refrigerate stock that has enough collagen in it , it 'll set up like jello , and hold its own shape . Starches can work , but they 're not ideal for soup -- flour ( unless cooked as a roux ) leaves a raw flour taste and cloudy soup ; tapioca leaves little granules in there ; corn starch will break down if you cook it too long .

You 'll want to temper the melted chocolate . This means holding it at 88 ° F ( 31 ° C ) while it cools until it is completely hardened , then finally allowing it to return to room temperature ( or lower ) afterward . If you temper the chocolate this way , it will be much harder and last indefinitely at room temperature . The easiest way to temper chocolate is the " seed method " , which means adding a piece of solid ( never-melted ) chocolate to the fully-melted chocolate after removing it from the heat source and stirring thoroughly until the temperature reaches 88 ° F / 31 ° C , and then keeping it at that temperature until you 're ready to use it . ( Note that this is for dark chocolate ; for temperatures for other types of chocolate and for a more detailed guide to tempering , I suggest you check out the <URL> . ) The technical explanation for this is that the temperature at which melted chocolate hardens determines its final consistency as a solid . If chocolate hardens at room temperature , it ends up forming a very weak crystalline structure that begins to melt at even the slightest rise in temperature ( i.e. in your hand ) . Allowing it to solidify at the highest possible temperature below the actual melting point ensures that it forms a denser crystalline structure and will not melt at room temperature .
Indeed , Mr. Zable actually applied for a patent -- US application no . <URL> , filed Sept 13 , 2010 . ( Of course , just because he applied does n't mean the US Patent Office will issue a patent on it . ) His process is , in essence : ( 1 ) gelling a liquid beverage ; and ( 2 ) wraping an aliquot of the gel in a raw " farinaceous dough " , selected from the group of pretzel , pizza , bread , and pasta doughs . The application says he used gelatin as his gelling agent , but the patent ( if it issues ) would not be limited to gelatin . Once wrapped , the raw snack could be fried immediately or frozen for later use .
This is what we figured out at Serious Eats : <URL> In sum , use more sugar , whip the cream , freeze in icecube trays and run through a Cuisinart at the end .
It will double in size when it is cooked , however the longer it is kept in the liquid the bigger it will grow until ultimately all liquid has been absorbed . A trick is to cook it separately , drain it , and toss with olive oil so it does n't clump . Then , add it to the rest of the soup , stirring well just before serving .
For a start , any Asian dish will be effected if the chicken stock is not good . Make quality chicken stock from whole chicken carcases , and take your time with it In the case of Laksa , the key flavours are mostly in the Laksa paste ( shrimp paste and lemon grass ) . If you do n't have an equivalent of the one used at To 's you will have an entirely different dish . A lot of effort can go into a Laksa paste ( or for that matter curry pastes in general ) , in terms of exact ingredient ratios , roasting times etc , quality and freshness of ingredients etc Laksa is often made with prawn stock , not chicken stock . Save the prawn heads and other fish bits , and boil them up for a very stinky prawn stock Do n't overdo the coconut milk/cream . Stick to one brand , and start with a lot less and see how it goes , if it is lacking , add more . Record what the magic amount for your favourite brand is Getting quality and fresh ingredients for Asian dishes is often a major stumbling block for truly authentic tastes . Making your own decent Laksa paste is near impossible outside of Asia . Western grown lemon grass , tastes like , well grass ! When you 're next at To 's have a peek in the kitchen , ask if you have too . And check what they use for Laksa paste . If it 's out of a branded jar you 're in luck , if it 's homemade , it 's back to the grindstone , literally The recipe linked , does not seem like a very good Laksa recipe to me . Also a good Laksa is topped with chilli oil . This is an import part . It consists of a lot of chilli and a little garlic cocked in a cup of oil . Float a couple of spoons of this on each bowl as you serve it
Round popcorn is just made from a different variety of popcorn , called mushroom popcorn . The " normal " kind is called butterfly popcorn , or sometimes snowflake popcorn . The two are mentioned in <URL> ( last paragraph of the linked section ) , along with a photo . It looks like it 's pretty easy to buy online , if you prefer it . Mushroom popcorn kernels are a little sturdier and easier to coat , so it 's well-suited for prepackaged popcorn and especially things like caramel corn , but at least to me that sturdiness is also a slight toughness , so I prefer the butterfly-style popcorn most of us are used to .
Typically dry beans expand 2-3 times their original volume when soaked , depending on their age ( fresher beans have more moisture left than older ones and expand less ) . I usually put them in a large pot and cover them with at least 5-6cm of water above .
The second easiest way to get stiff , but still edible mashed potatoes is to bake the potatoes whole , then put them through a ricer . The easiest way is to use potato flakes ... and then you can make them as thick as you want , and even thicken them further if they came out not to your liking initially . You can still mash potatoes that have been baked ( although you 'll probably want to peel them ) , but if you use a wet cooking method , after they 're done cooking , drain them and put them back into the pot ( still warm , but with the heat off ) with the lid off for a minute or two . Once you do n't see any more steam coming off them , check to see if the bottom of the pot is dry . . if it is n't , move the potatoes to another pot ( lift them out , to avoid moving the water with them ) , and drain the water . I 'd personally then dump them back into the now dried pot ... I just find that when you 're limiting the amount of moisture going into the potatoes , making sure they stay warm as you 're mashing helps the process . You 'll still need some liquid , but making sure that the water is out gives you more control of what liquid is added back in ( and you can make sure it 's a flavorful liquid ... dairy , olive oil , chicken stock , etc. )
Though I 've never dried extruded pasta . I regularly make and dry out cut pastas like fettuccine . I prefer egg based pastas , as they 're richer . I dry mine at room temperature in nests . Even with the egg I 've never gotten ill . This is how my great grandparents had done it . So I 'm fairly certain its very uncommon to become ill from the conditions you dry the pasta in . Especially since you are n't using eggs , I doubt you 'll have a problem when it comes to food safety . Most drying methods are done at room temperature . I 'm assuming extruded pastas take a bit longer to dry , but I do n't think this is going to be an issue . The only time I have trouble with pasta is when I put it in a ziplock without properly drying it . This pasta will mold , and its pretty easy to spot . I 'll leave pasta to dry for more than 24 hours before I put it in a plastic bag . Even then I keep the bag only half sealed for the first couple days just to be sure . Really the drying period is what would worry me . I 'd be worried about it being dry enough before storing , than I would be worried about it molding or spoiling while drying . Which you do n't really need to do . Small insects tend to enjoy flour , so storing in a tuperware container with some cheese cloth over the top might be a better approach , as it allows moisture to escape . I would n't be so much overly worried about bacteria , as these will be killed in the cooking process . However , mold , even when killed , is still dangerous . Throw out any moldy pasta . It wo n't go moldy unless you store it airtight while its still damp . Simply put , dry it thoroughly , and you do n't need to worry about spoilage . The dried pasta will easily last for months . If you 're going to cook it the next day , you can even just refrigerate it without drying . As drying thoroughly might take longer than the period of time between prepping and cooking . If you 're prepping a few days or more ahead , drying would make sense . It 's very common to dry pastas at room temperature , and there is n't any safety regulation against doing so even if your pasta has egg in it . Doing so in a cooled environment is just an added precaution . However , I 've made and dried pasta for years without any ill effects of doing so at room temperature . So some simple rules : Dry it thoroughly , it should be bone dry . At least 15 hours ( it 's humid here , so I do at least 24hrs in summer ) . Use your best judgement . It takes a long time to dry , so making in larger quantities less often is often prefered if you 're prepping for short order . Do n't store it in an airtight container , but something that can breath but does n't allow insects/debris to come in contact . Store in a cool , dark place . Remove any excess flour that could trap moisture .
I think the thing boils down to how much you need to get from the lettuce . If you demand the best of the best performance for your salad , you want to blot it dry with paper towels , so that the texture is best preserved and the appearance is undisturbed . For my purpose , in my kitchen , a salad spinner saves money ( the paper towels ) , time ( my time ) , and allows me to do something more interesting than blotting it dry , and the time saved can be used to better decorate the dishes I love better than the salad . In essence , there is nothing wrong with any method of cooking if you enjoy the result , and it does n't involve health problems . Spinning it dry is fine for me , and if you accept the result , there is little to hesitate using one . Thomas Keller also told us that after vegetables release the flavors in the soup we should discard them , and replace them with fresh cooked vegetables with better colors and better flavor for better presentation . In my kitchen , I am not serving a Michelin 3-star soup to my family , and thus it is fine having those vegetables in the soup for some more fibres in our diet . It is a matter of fine dining , it is not a matter of home kitchen . Insist if you have to , but relax if you actually can .
It is possible , whether it fits your definition of easily is questionable , though . Whole grain flour is made by grinding whole wheat/rye / ... berries until you get a fine flour , a technique used since the neolithic age . The method that is still in use today is basically " rubbing the grains between a firm base stone and a moving upper stone " , either shaped like a rolling pin or round and flat like a millstone . ( Increase the scale and you get a classic mill . ) So your mortar and pestle will work , even if they are not made of the types of sandstone , basalt or limestone that have the " right " mixture of coarseness and durability to make good millstones . The drawback ? Scale and time . You will probably need a lot of time , to get enough flour for a bread . For a starter , it should be ok , though . If you think about buying a mill because you decide your super-fresh flour is worth the effort and cost , note that good manual mills with ceramic stones are almost as expensive as electric ones , but are way less comfortable . I make a lot of things myself and by hand in my kitchen , but I would draw the line at cranking a mill for half an hour just to get flour for one bread . For a very " kitchen hack " style of grinding flour ( but obviously not " stone ground " ) , consider your food processor ( but check the manual first ! ) : Pulse a cup or two of wheat berries untill you see " flour " and " grits " forming . Sieve off the finer parts , return the coarser to the food processor , add more grains and continue . You can even use the coarser parts for some kinds of wholegrain bread - a question of taste and recipe .
There are many " natural " or " clean label " ingredients that work as mold inhibitors . Most of them work by adding some acid and thereby creating a more inhospitable environment for mold . Some of the popular mold inhibitors ( at least is some U.S. bakeries ) are : cultured whey , vinegar , and raisin juice . I think vinegar and raisin juice are good options for home use . Vinegar Works by adding Acetic acid . The white vinegar you buy in the grocery store is typically 5 % acetic acid ( at least in the U.S. ) . To inhibit mold , the recommended amount is 0.5-2 .0 % of the flour weight of 5 % acetic acid vinegar . Add with your other liquids . Raisin Juice Concentrate Raisin juice concentrate has been shown to be effective at retarding mold and bacteria growth in bread . It works by adding Propionic acid and Tartaric acid . Further , it seems that a home baker should be able to purchase this in reasonable quantities and at a reasonable price . The recommended amount is 5-10 % of flour weight , by weight . Add with your other liquids . My personal experience is positive : I used to purchase a whole-wheat bread with raisin juice concentrate and it lasted forever . This study from the Journal of Food Science , <URL> , found very dramatic increase in shelf life . The mean mold-free shelf life of the bread containing 7.5 % water extract [ of raisins ] was 18.1 + / - 3.3 d at room temperature while the negative control was mold free for 9.4 + / - 2.4 d . The antifungal efficacy of the extracts in bread was equivalent to 0.24 % calcium propionate in 21 d of storage . Doubling the concentration of the extract did not improve the mold-retarding property in bread . The bread containing raisin paste , the percentage of which in dough was equivalent to 15 % raisin extract , exhibited a stronger antifungal activity than did the extracts in bread . Notes Both of these can inhibit yeast activity which you may need to compensate for by increasing yeast or proofing time .

What are the signs that indicate that raw honey has spoilt ?
Honey might go bad in two ways - one involves stuff growing on the surface of the honey , the other involves the honey itself fermenting . In both cases , the spoilage is connected to exceedingly poor storage - as other answers mentioned , honey is difficult to spoil ... but difficult is not the same thing as impossible , right :) Honey that ferments is usually linked to high water content - some honeys have a higher water content naturally , some might have water added at some point ( for example , to deter crystallization ) , some might have water leaked into a container and puddled on top or along the edges , and honey will absorb moisture from the air if left unsealed , and eventually reach a saturation where the water is no longer a limiting factor to yeasts . In any case , part of honey 's preservative qualities is the lack of available water and too high concentration of sugars inhibits most spoiling organisms - so when that extra water becomes available , honey turns from " never goes bad " to " potent food source for yeasts " , especially since as the yeast eat the sugars , they also lower the concentrations from something inhospitable to yeasts , to something that can support more yeast growth - so the fermentation will continue progressing . A small puddle of water can gradually lead to a whole container fermenting because the local dilution is much greater than the total water percentage , and once given a foothold the yeasts will keep eating the concentrations further down into yeast-inhabitable ranges . Some fermentation is more problematic than others - for example , mead probably originates from a spontaneous fermentation of honey that was enjoyable , on the other hand , different yeasts may give off bad odors and off flavors . If your honey <URL> to the point of spoilage , it will smell bad , look cloudy , and taste terrible . It will also foam ( carbon dioxide production ) , may separate , may bulge if the container permits , all that good stuff that warns if any foodstuff in fermenting . There is some stuff on that page about natural beneficial fermentation and typical crystallization patterns , but that is n't relevant to the question of spoilage The other way honey might go bad , is having some debris accumulate on the surface of honey ( cross contamination ) , that gives some mold or other bacteria enough food to get a foothold . Again , honey itself is a poor source of food if properly stored - not enough water , not enough available food to get a foothold - but add debris , crumbs , or whatever that can spoil more easily right on the surface , and that can give mold or whatever enough of a toehold to build a floating colony , as you envisioned . If there 's enough debris or moisture on the surface , the mold might start nibbling at the surface of the honey - which will start lowering the sugar content to something mold can find hospitable , much the same way fermentation can progress . You might be able to simply remove the colony or even the top layer to salvage the honey , if you are willing to risk it , since honey is known to be rather inhospitable to dangerous organisms . And if the honey is properly stored afterwards , any critters left should n't be able to re-colonize since they needed the crumbs to get a toehold in the first place - but only you can decide what you will risk .
It 's not quite as effective as xanthan gum but I find arrowroot flour works wonders . You can also try locust bean gum or psyllium husk ( soak it in water before mixing so that it can dissolve ) Those are more starchey than the gums and are meant to be mixed with amaranth , rice , quinoa , or other more coarse flours it gives you that same " slimey " start that hold the bubbles as the bread cooks . That 's generally gone by the time it 's cooked . When you 're using guar gum , try to keep the quantity down to about 1 % by weight of the dry ingredients . Also give it time to fully hydrate before adding the rest of the ingredients . I normally mix mine in dry with the flour and then add milk or water to get things wet and then leave it for a couple minutes before continuing . If the gum ( or even the arrowroot flour ) is properly hydrated it will be more effective in baking . Plus you can use less liquid overall which is good because it 's easy to overdo the liquid in GF bread .
Double-yolked eggs are the result of an anomaly in the egg generation process in the hen . They can happen in any breed of hen , on any feed . It is a result of two ova being generated at the same time , and then encapsulated in a single shell . According to <URL> , it happens more often with younger hens . I am not aware of any process to intentionally foster double yolked eggs , but that does n't mean such a thing does n't exist . They are safe to eat , although they may be visually startling .
The slime is called mucilage . It is around the seeds on the inside of the pod . It is made of protein and carbohydrates including fiber . The mucilage is ( as you alluded in your question ) used for thickening gumbos and similar stews . Besides this , I 've only ever seen it referred to as an annoyance and avoided by leaving the pod whole or dry cooking like frying . I imagine there could be some creative halloween uses of mucilage but those would be off topic for this site . :) EDIT I was embarrassed that this answer was the accepted answer . I do n't like answers that are ( as mine was ) " no that is n't possible because I 've never heard of it . " I was hoping someone else would shatter my world with some amazing new use of okra slime . My curiosity piqued I used some of my copious free time while code compiled to do some more research . I was able to find a couple of non traditional okra recipes that seemed interesting - such as candied okra slices or using the seeds from pickled okra as a caviar-like dish . But none of them took advantage of the mucilage - they all avoided it . Carbohydrate based mucilage is used in ice cream and for other reasons . I found the following study about food health that did experiments with replacing milk fat with specifically okra mucilage ( they refer to it as " okra gum " ) <URL> Two pertinent quotes : " Although not currently produced by food manufacturers , previous studies produced fat-free chocolate bar cookies with acceptable sensory characteristics using okra gum as a fat ingredient substitute . " " Specifically , color and smell of frozen dairy desserts containing okra gum replacement for milk fat did not significantly differ from the control product . Texture , flavor , aftertaste , and overall acceptability ratings also averaged five or higher ( neutral to like ) for all products . " The study was about replacing milk fat where I think it would be more interesting as an enhancer as you asked in your question . It seems perfectly reasonable that okra mucilage could find a place in more modern recipes . But I could n't find anyone doing it .
It is probably a <URL> ( possibly regarding crystallization of the honey or other cosmetic changes ) , and should still be edible afterwards . Most honey has historically been stored raw , it is still sold in the comb in places , and has still been known for having a long shelf life if left in a closed container . Honey has mild antiseptic qualities , and too little water , for most anything nasty to grow in - usually the heating and other processing has more to do with appearance and texture ( crystallization and cloudiness , and also batch consistency and efficiency ) , rather than specific safety concerns . And if it does go bad , from exceedingly poor storage , too much moisture , or something of the sort - it should be very apparent , and on the surface only . That being said , if you have concerns about your honey specifically or believe that its raw nature poses more risk - you should act as it seems safe for you . Putting the honey in the fridge should double the shelf life , at least , though it will also encourage crystallization .
just a cinnamon or cinnamon blend with nutmeg and other spices will make sparks when tossed into the fire . You do need a big flame for this ; I typically use a camp chef stove with a modified propane regulator to get the big flame needed .
Cleanliness , as pTerry reminds us , is only next to godliness in a very sternly abridged dictionary . However , working clean has three main things going for it : order ! when you 're trying to bang out a couple hundred dishes as fast as possible , being orderly and methodical in your work is not just important , it is absolutely vital . safety ! see above . if your area is a mess , you 're more likely to injure yourself or others . Bear in mind that we play with sharper knives and hotter burners than you do at home health ! a clean work area is one that is free of cross-contamination . Per calumbrodie 's answer below , I 'd like to expand a bit on the need for order . I 'll do this by telling you about my day today . We 've just rotated the kitchen ; chef does this from time to time to make sure everyone is cross-trained on all stations . So right now for the restaurant I 'm responsible for sandwiches ( one hot menu sandwich , one daily special ) , prepping one of our appetizers , one hot appetizer , soup daily , and one of our main courses ( crepe stuffed with pan-roasted wild mushrooms , caramelized shallots , and barre boulard cheese which is just heavenly ) . In addition to that , we also have a takeout counter and a satellite location elsewhere in the building ; for those I am responsible for sixteen sandwiches daily ( different from the restaurant sandwiches ! ) as well as stuffed chicken which goes with a salad . We start work at 9:30 AM , everything for the takeout must be ready by 11:15 , and restaurant service runs from 11:30 until 3PM . You should be able to see the time constraints this imposes . When I walked in this morning , here is what I had to do just to get the counter stuff out , and be ready for service : Bake bread ( parbaked , frozen , from a local artisanal baker ; we simply do not have the room to bake our own , although chef is open to the idea of tasking me with that ) Bread , par-fry , stuff , and bake chicken breasts . Deep-fry onions until crispy ( garnish for the menu sandwich ) Make crepes ( must be done fresh daily ) Make sandwiches for the counters ( today I was lucky ; I had some of the mise ready from some free time on Saturday ) Oops , mayonnaise did n't come in Friday 's delivery , better make some ... Make garnish for the soup I made Saturday Double check all my mise en place in case I forgot something . Chef has slimmed down the menu somewhat , but I still have roughly fifteen to twenty different components which must all be ready , all the time . With backups in case we get slammed . I have 1h 45m to do all of these things . And while I work best in a situation that looks like chaos to the outside observer , everything is carefully organized and planned . For example , crepes are something that -- if you 've made enough of them -- you can interweave with another task : make the batter first . Ladle batter into pan , spin around , put back on the heat . Good , now I have a minute or two to work on another task ; make a sandwich . Flip crepe , cut and wrap sandwich . Remove crepe from pan , repeat . And this was a slow day . On a busy day , this list could easily be twice as long , including some things that will simply take time and require undivided attention . So that took right up until service . During service I 'm still prepping : everything I need for tomorrow that can possibly be done today , I do . So ... roasting turkey for tomorrow 's sandwich , making a cranberry aioli , making crab croquettes for the entremetier station ( so : mashed potatoes , chilled -- oh dear that 's going to take two hours to come down in temp , better get started now -- then folded around a crab mixture ) , some sort of stuffing for tomorrow 's chicken ... and on top of that I 've got to be planning for Wednesday , for which I will need a new soup ( and garnish ) , got ta roast another lamb leg -- and that needs to chill too so I can slice it carefully , make sure I 've got enough bread in stock , and oh wait -- we have a catering function Thursday for which I need to make about a dozen things , best figure out when I 'm going to do that ... And all of this is being done while chits are coming out of the printer , so I need to be organized in such a way that I can not only stop whatever project I 'm working on , but that having those ingredients/tools on my station wo n't impede my ability to serve food in a timely manner . ... you get the point . ( There 's a much better treatment of this , from an exec 's POV , in Bourdain 's Kitchen Confidential ) . Without some order to my workspace ( which is thankfully large ) , I would quickly be dans la merde and everything would go a bit pear-shaped . I 've had those days , and it is difficult for me to convey how much it sucks to look at the clock , know you have five minutes left , and know that you have fifteen minutes of work still to go . The thing about working in a kitchen is that , apart from a very few places which run with military precision ( Alinea , Fat Duck , elBulli , Moto , the Laundry , etc ) , there is never enough time . Ever . And when there is enough time , well , there 's
Actually , I think " the Internet " is wrong on this one , assuming that we are talking about proper caramel sauce . In most of candy making , you are very careful of crystalization . You are working with a supersaturated sugar solution , and it is looking for the slightest excuse to precipitate . Stirring will clump the sugar out of the solution into crystals . Some candy types need to be perfectly smooth , while others ( like fudge ) get their characteristic texture from careful management of crystal size . You should n't be stirring there at all . But once you have reached caramelization , you can stir . What you have in the pan is no longer a supersaturated sugar solution , but caramelization products mixed in a less-concentrated sugar solution . In other words , you have caramel , which is a substance quite different from sugar syrup . And it does not clump into crystals . It is amorphous in its structure , not a crystal , and it 's actually got some viscosity ( if you leave a clump a solid caramel around for years , it will flow a few centimeters ) . And you are not just dealing with pure caramel , but with caramel sauce , which also has lots of liquid added in the form of cream . So much liquid would have also prevented the sugar syrup from crystalizing if it had been added earlier . So , to summarize , you should n't stir a sugar solution during candy making , but you can stir both caramel and caramel sauce . It seems that somebody learned the rule about hot sugar solutions and decided that it applies in all kinds of candy making , without exceptions . But in fact , it does n't apply to caramel sauce .
Nuts can go rancid . I 've also had stale nuts , pecans or peanuts that were exposed to too much humidity . This adversely affects the texture . They need to be fresher than that . Cashews , however , are in a slightly different boat . <URL> Cashews have a toxin in their shells that resembles poison ivy . When harvested , cashews are roasted in their shells to reduce the toxin and make the shells brittle and easy to remove . If these cashews were harvested by an amateur this process might have not been done correctly and you may be reacting to the toxin .
Unless there was sugar in your cream , there 's nothing particularly sweet about this combination . Did you salt the pasta water to roughly seawater saltiness ? If not , did you adjust salt before serving ? If your pasta water was under-salted , that would explain the sweetness , since the only significant source of salt otherwise was the parmesan . Heavy cream is equivalent to 36-40 % whipping cream . In the event that your cream was pre-sweetened , there 's not much you could do except add salt and hope the sugar does n't overwhelm . It 's a fairly common technique to add sugar to a salty dish to make it taste richer , or salt to a sweet dish for a similar purpose . But it would n't work very well if the cream was very sweet . Since I 've never seen sweetened whipped cream except in aerosol dispensers , I ca n't say for sure .
There are three ( to the best of my knowledge ) main factors at work here : <URL> . This is a gelling agent , a bit like gelatin . Fruits such as apples and plums are very high in pectin ; citrus fruits are not that high in pectin but citrus peels are incredibly high , so if you 're using any of the peel , you 're getting tons of great pectin . Obviously , the more pectin , the faster and firmer it 's going to gel . If the fruit does n't contain much pectin then you 're going to have to cook it down a lot or just add actual pectin ( you can buy it in stores ) . Acidity , as you suspect , makes a big difference . It 's not just acidity , it 's the relationship of acidity to pectin as above . For more details read <URL> . Basically , pectin gels best at a pH of 2.5 ( almost exactly the pH of lemon juice ) to 4.5 ( about the pH of sweet grapes ) . It 's best to hit the sweet spot in the middle rather than the extreme ends , so you wo n't generally be using pure lemon juice , you 'll be adding some sugar and other ingredients . Which leads me to the final factor : Sugar . As described in <URL> , sugar precipitates the pectin , basically making the pectin molecules less soluble which mimics the effect of a higher concentration . Therefore , more sugar makes the jelly set faster . So : Pectin-rich fruits + high acidity + high sugar content = fast setting . There are actually various other factors that affect the pectin ( which is pretty much the only gelling agent at work when working with natural fruit jellies ) like salts and even alcohol , but in the vast majority of recipes , it 's acidity and sugar that are your primary concerns as well as the actual pectin content of the fruit itself .
Generally speaking , maple syrup will work fine in any recipe that calls for honey . They may have slightly different viscosities and water content , but that could be true between two honeys as well , so I would n't worry about it a lot . The only thing I think you really have to consider is whether the flavor of maple syrup is appealing in the dish you would substitute it in . In most cases , I think it will be fine , especially if the dish would have worked well with a dark , fully flavored honey . You might also like to try sorghum syrup , molasses , or agave nectar as other possible replacements .
In theory you could thaw and refreeze as many times as you like , though the changes in temperature would definitely alter the quality of the meat 's taste and texture . What matters most is how long the meat has been in the so-called " danger zone " speaking from a temperature perspective . The " danger zone " is defined as being between 41 to 135 ° F ( 5 to 57 ° C ) . Here is an excerpt from <URL> : Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than four hours are considered adulterated . Additionally , one should be fully aware that the four-hour period is cumulative , meaning that the meter starts running again every time the food enters the danger zone . Therefore , once the four-hour period has been exceeded , heating , cooling , or any other cooking method can not recover foods .
Commercial kitchens use a few methods that are hidden from the camera during kitchen shows . First , there are cutting boards for meats , and separate cutting boards for vegetables . These are often color coded so they are n't mixed up . If there is room , raw meats use an entirely different table . Any possibly contaminated board is sanitized before reuse . Second , the cloths you see are stored in a bucket of sanitizing fluid which kills microbes on contact . When a surface is wiped down , or hands are cleaned , they are being sanitized by the liquid on the cloth . Finally , there is usually more than one person working behind the scenes and labor is divided so the raw meat people are not the same as the green salad people . At home , planning is the key . Try to do all of your non-meat prep first . Then you can contaminate your cutting board without having to wash it again . Then try to take care of all of your meat prep , so you only have to wash your hands once . And remember that if you drop a vegetable on your raw chicken , it 's not a big deal if it 's all going to be cooked .
It sounds like your water melon simply spoiled in the refrigerator . It is a very perishable food , once the rind is cut off , as it is basically a sugar syrup waiting to be eaten by whatever comes along -- people , dogs , bacteria , yeasts , molds , whatever . The milky liquid would be waste from the metabolization processes of whatever colonized the water melon . You are probably wise not to eat it ; just discard it . Some signs of past-prime watermelon include -- but all of these border on signs of spoiled , because it is a continuous process : Aroma : If you detect an alcoholic , winy , or boozy smell , it is a sign the flesh has started to ferment . Another sign is when the rind is not taught and firm . The melon is light for its size , indicating it may have lost moisture
Basically everything at all normal is safe . There is a mushroom that gets toxic if combined with alcohol , but alcohol itself is n't 100 % safe and if you 're gathering wild mushrooms you need to be safety conscious , so it 's not really something you could run into by accident or with storebought ingredients . Relevant paragraph from <URL> Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a " disulfiram syndrome " . This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century . Symptoms include facial reddening , nausea , vomiting , malaise , agitation , palpitations and tingling in limbs , and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol . If no more alcohol is consumed , they will generally subside over two or three hours . Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed , becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dL , and prominent at concentrations of 50 -- 100 mg/dL . Disulfiram has , however , been known to cause myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms , although they are milder as more time passes . Rarely , a cardiac arrhythmia , such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia , may develop .
For your situation I would recommend packing the burritos individually ( or 2 at once ) so this does not happen . You can achieve this by using foil , plastic wrap , or bags . Alternatively , you may try putting a sheet of wax paper ( or foil/plastic wrap - but remove before microwaving ) between each layer of burritos . If this does not work for you , try the following : Here are two methods that can be used to try to preserve expected consistency : The easiest , and most sure to actually work : Store the components that are wet and going to leak liquid in a different container . Unfortunately , this may involve you having to build your burrito when you want to eat it , yet this is sure to prevent a soggy burrito . To do this you can use separate containers , bags , or however you normally package a burrito . One can also purchase plastic food containers with multiple compartments specifically made for this purpose ( separation of different food items ) . For an example , <URL> The second way : This is n't a long-term fix nor is it as efficient as a multi-compartment food container . One can strategically build certain food items so that they are less likely to make bread or tortillas soggy . You have to place a food item , that will not let the bread absorb the liquid as quickly , next to the bread . The best example I can give you is that when I make a BLT sandwich that I am not going to eat immediately , I place the lettuce right next to the bread instead of putting the tomato right next to the bread . The lettuce provides a barrier between the two . Like I said though , it will not be as efficient as multi-compartment food containers .
Before steaming the clams , they should all be closed . If any of your clams are open , give them a tap and if they stay open , then it is bad and you should take it out of your batch to prevent it from ruining the other clams . After you have steamed the clams , most of them should be open . The few clams that stay closed does n't necessarily mean they are bad . Take a thin knife and pry it apart . It 's very easy to tell if the clam is bad just by smell . Edit : After being called out on my fallacy to believe certain kitchen myths without further research , I learned that indeed it is a myth that clam/mussel that refuse to open after being cooked is unsafe to eat . A clam/mussel has a shell with two halves . These shells have elastic ligaments that naturally want to be open . To keep the shells closed , they have adductor muscles to hold the shells together . Most of the time the heat will denature the proteins in the adductor muscles causing it to release the shells . But sometimes it can cause the muscle to " seize " and hold firm . This article gives a background of how this kitchen myth started : <URL> Clam or Mussels that refuse to open after they have been cooked IS NOT an indicator that they are bad . Pry them open and it can easily be determined whether they are bad by the smell .
This probably depends a great deal on regional and political circumstances , but where I live ( Toronto ) , there are dozens of Kosher and Halal grocery stores ( or stores with Kosher or Halal sections ) , and in my experience , the meat is actually generally of worse quality . Halal , as it applies to meat , refers to which animals are allowed and the required method of slaughter ( an incision across the neck , cutting the jugular vein and carotid artery in a single motion - Kashrut requires the esophagus and trachea to be cut as well ) . Kosher meat also has be koshered , which means soaking and salting the meat in order to draw out the blood . As you might expect , the method of slaughter has no tangible effect on the quality of the meat , but the koshering process does , and the effect is not positive - it dries it out and makes it salty , and most kosher meat sold in supermarkets ( and even the majority of butchers ) is quite tough compared to its non-kosher counterparts . That said , some people do prefer Kosher ( not Halal ) meat for health reasons , because the blood may carry uric acid and other compounds that some people do not wish to eat . I 've never seen any specific scientific evidence that these compounds are harmful as far as meat consumption goes , and any reports of this leading to better flavour are anecdotal at best , but I am not an expert on the biological factors , so do n't take my word for it . Various Halal/Kosher laws also govern the facilities in which the meats ( or other foods ) have to be prepared , but it is important to note that these laws do not actually govern general sanitization ! In fact , a number of butchers have been closed down by municipal health inspectors at various times for unsanitary conditions and other improper food handling practices ( such as adding food colouring to meat to make it look fresher ) . Note that I am not trying to impugn the Kosher or Halal industries . These practices are every bit as common in the mainstream food industry . I am simply saying that being kosher or halal does not have any real preventative value when it comes to shady/sloppy practices . Another factor to consider is that supermarkets and butchers are a competitive industry , but being subject to Kosher/Halal laws greatly reduces the competition and raises the processing cost by sometimes astonishing amounts . These simple economic factors would lower the quality of any food being produced because parties collude and cut corners . Again , I can not speak for every single region of the world , but here , you can not find a kosher ribeye or prime rib steak . They simply do not exist . Whether it 's because the butchers all prefer to make cheaper cuts or because they figure that a choice cut would simply end up being too expensive for anyone to consider buying , I 'm not sure . I know that several TV chefs in recent years have recommended buying kosher meat ( and possibly halal , although I have n't personally heard that ) , but assuming that halal/kosher is optional for you ( i.e. you are not Muslim or Jewish ) then always do your own research before spending a lot of money on what may often turn out to be an inferior product .
There are substitutes , but eggs have very important effects on the texture of dough and are therefore hard to substitute . You will need to experiment a great deal until you hit on the correct texture , because you 'll need to tweak all other ingredients and maybe include new ones , e.g. substitute part of the butter and use cream instead to account for moisture loss from egg substitutes . Mien 's link already includes some substitute ideas , like applesauce and commercial imitations . I ca n't give you more suggestions , because I always put eggs in my cakes ;) . But when tweaking , keep following in mind : Egg whites provide a resilient mesh which traps small air bubbles , so they make a cake more airy . You may need to adjust the baking powder upwards a bit . If it is a soda recipe , you 'll need to raise the acidity too . But the whole effect ca n't be approximated just with baking powder , because its bubbles are too big . For that , you need better emulsification ( covered below ) . Egg whites also have a binding quality . This should n't need compensation in a cake , as you need a dough without too much binding ( as opposed to bread ) , but if your cake starts falling apart , consider using a flour with higher gluten content ( all purpose flour instead of cake flour ) . Gluten binds too . If , on the other hand , your cake is too bread-like , then you may need less binding . The egg yolks are a source of fat , which prevents the dough gluten from forming a strong mesh by covering the particles . You will miss this with egg substitutes , especially if they are pectin-based ( like applesauce ) because pectin enhances binding . Use the lower gluten dough ( it it does n't cause the cake to fall apart ) or add more fat . Then there is the importance of emulsifiers . Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lecithin in the kitchen . An emulsifier helps your wet ingredients bind in an emulsion , instead of staying in two separate phases with the watery phase soaking the flour through and the fatty phase making the whole thing greasy . It also helps the trapping of very tiny air bubbles in the wet part of the dough ( this is what happens when you beat eggs with sugar on high speed until the colour lightens ) which provides a very fine leavening . Maybe commercial egg imitates contain emulsifiers - check the list - but if they do n't , you must buy pure lecithin . It is usually soy derived , but maybe you need to check with the manufacturer that your brand is suitable for vegetarians . Also , consider including cream , the fat in it is already emulsified in water , unlike butter ( which is water emulsified in fat ) . You must calculate precisely and tweak other ingredients to ensure that the total amount of fat and moisture do n't change ( except if you are compensating for the changes caused by the egg substitute ) . If it is a chocolate cake , consider reducing the fat and the flour and adding some cocoa powder ( the regular-fat variety ) . Cocoa has binding and thickening properties , and will help with the more even fat distribution . Melted chocolate tastes good in cakes , but makes them very dense , so do n't use it . The easiest way would be to find a recipe published by someone who has already done all the work . But just from paging through a cookbook , you ca n't tell if they did it right , or just slapped a spoon of applesauce instead of an egg and called it a vegan cake . Edit : I just had an idea when I saw Mien 's gelatine question and yours together in the list . I have n't heard of anybody using it , and do n't know if it will work , but it does , it will be great . So try it . I already said that using cream would help . As you need a foam full of very tiny bubbles for the perfect leavening , you could try whipped cream instead of whipped eggs . The trouble is that the air will get out of the batter very quickly while and after folding the cream . So you 'll need to stabilize it . Gelatine in unusually small quantities will make for a very nice experiment , but obviously not one you 'll want to do . But plant-derived gelling agents could help . Carrageenan is commonly used with dairy products , and you can buy it online . So try folding stabilized whipped cream into the batter .

What is the best material for a cooking spoon ?
Personally , I 've switched almost entirely to <URL> for all types of stirring and scraping spoons . They do n't stain , they are fine up to quite high temperatures , they clean up easily and can go in the dishwasher . They are also wo n't scratch the surface of non-stick cookware . It is true that they do n't feel quite so nice as a good wooden spoon , but the convenience is outstanding . ( On the other hand , I stick with metal for the type of spatula one uses to flip a fritter , because silicone ca n't have a thin enough leading edge , it is too flexible . )
Short and sweet ... Use cake / pastry flour . At 5-7 % protein vs. 11 % for AP vs. 13 % + for bread flour , that means a lot less gluten formation . This protein , when mixed with water and subjected to mechanical working is what produces gluten . The higher the protein percentage , the ' tougher ' ( due to the gluten ) the final product . Always use cake or pastry flour when making any type of cake , even brownies . And a little extra egg wo n't hurt , either .
Half fill it with water , then put in on the stove top over a medium heat . Work the burnt-on bits with a wooden spoon or spatula as the water starts to boil . You should be able to soften it up and be able to get it off then .
There are two main types of provolone : piccante ( sharp ) and dolce ( sweet ) . Most braciola recipes I 've seen call for the sharp version . Sharp provolone tastes very similar to cheddar , which I assume is abundant in the UK . The issue is that " real " cheddar is a hard cheese and provolone is only semi-hard . Here in the US , we have a softer version of sharp cheddar-style cheese that is made in Wisconsin . If a similar semi-hard sharp cheddar variant is available in the UK , I would recommend that . It should also be noted that the term " braciola " ( or sometimes " braciole " ) means a lot of different things to different people . <URL> , likely including the author of your book , it takes on the Sicilian meaning of an involtino . Sometimes the meat will be filled with a soft cheese mixture like mozzarella mixed with grated pecorino romano . However , if the recipe calls for a harder cheese like provolone , it is likely referring to a variant that is very popular in the US in which the provolone is cut into thin slices ( usually using a deli slicer ) and layered on the meat before the meat is rolled . Therefore , any substitute for the provolone should ideally be thinly sliced .
Hydraulic press juices such as the Norwalk first grind the produce into a pulp , then press the juice out of the pulp . The theory is that malic acid in green apple pulp can release more vitamins and minerals from the other vegetables and fruit . The hydraulic press action squeezes more juice out than other types of juicers . But you 're looking at $ 2500 for a Norwalk . Macerating juicers would be next , up around the $ 400 + mark . Gear crushing action , leafy vegetables no problem . Not as much juice extraction as the hydraulic press machines . Then would come auger style juicers , they easily handle leafy vegetables and wheatgrass , but give a little less juice than the macerating juicers . Finally the cheapest powered juicers , the centrifugal juicers . I 've had trouble using them for leafy greens as there are not solid enough to be forced chopping blades . Usually more solid vegetables are required to follow them to force them through . Here 's a paragraph from the popular Breville centrifugal juicer seen in the movie Fat , Sick and Nearly Dead : " If you are juicing herbs , sprouts or leafy green vegetables either wrap then together to form a bundle or juice them in the middle of a combination of ingredients to obtain the best extraction . If juicing herbs or leafy green vegetables on their own , the juice yield will be low due to the nature of centrifugal juicing , it is advised to juice them as with a combination of other fruit and vegetables " Carrots are fine in all the juicers .
My favourite oil for basting is none : I just put a glass lid on the pan , add a teaspon of water and let the top of the eggs cook in the steam . The few times I have basted , the olive oil I 've used for cooking the eggs has not seemed to run off very well .
Yes , it is called a toque . I do n't have a copy of CIA Pro Chef handy at the moment , but it was in the first chapter IIRC . Wikipedia and a casual googling will confirm this .
It depends on the meat and how it 's cut . A ' solid ' uncut piece like a pork loin will take longer to marinade properly than if it was cut into thin strips for stir frying , for example - I 'd want to marinade the former at least 7-8 hours , while the latter could probably get away with 1 .
I 'm a fan of prepping some vegetables for the week on a day off . I 'm much more likely to eat salad if I have the fixings ready in my fridge . I 'm no expert , this is just what I 've found works best for me . Certainly some vegetables are more suited to cutting and storing than others . I find controlling humidity and condensation in storage to be the most important factor . I store almost everything in covered pyrex , unless it needs to breath ( and those go in the humid compartment ) . Veggies with less water can be kept humid with a lightly moist paper towel on top . Wetter veggies can cause condensation and lead to sliminess . A dry paper towel and/or an open container can help with that . A veggie should either be submerged in water , or not in water at all . Sitting in condensation is that biggest problem in storage . Cut carrots keep in water for a week with no change in quality . Out of water , they can dry out a bit . I do n't find the dryness to be a problem . Sliced bell peppers keep pretty well with a moist paper towel in the container . I find onions to be pretty indestructible , though the flavor gets a bit milder over time . Broccoli and cauliflower are also pretty hardy . A dry paper towel or two will deal with water from washing them , which is the biggest problem I 've had . Mushrooms and leafy greens need to breath . Cucumbers and tomatoes do n't store as well as others .
There are two main types of charcoal , briquettes and hard lump . The first comes in preformed pieces , so they are all the same size and include a filler material . They will sometimes also have lighter fluid in them already and be " easy start " or something similar . Hard lump is just charcoal from hardwoods with no filler . These will usually be in all kinds of shapes and look like " natural " pieces of wood ( albeit in charcoal form ) . Hard lump is easy to light , burns hotter , and leaves much less ash than briquettes . It also has a better flavor . I strongly recommend hard lump charcoal . Wood is usually used to provide smoke as a primary function rather than heat . Smoking on your grill gives a lovely smokey flavor ( d'uh ) . The standard way to use wood is to soak it in water for a period of time prior to cooking . Packages will often say to soak for an hour , and that 's ok with wood chips which are very small ( but I recommend longer ) , but it is n't good for anything larger . I generally soak wood for at least 18 hours . Wood also comes in various sizes , from very small chips ( slightly larger than a coin ) to large chunks bigger than a fist . The smaller the chips , the less heat they provide and the faster they burn up . These are generally better for shorter smoking times . Large chunks can smoke for 12 + hours if they are properly soaked . In both cases , I put the wood on to already burning coals to get them going . You can also use just wood to create your heat , in which case you do not soak the wood . When you hear about woodfire ovens , this is what they do . However , I think this is a hassle as it 's harder to get the wood lit than charcoal and does n't provide as much smoke since you have n't soaked the wood . So it 's really sub-par in my view . The exception is if you are doing low and slow smoking on some types of charcoal grill , you can use a small bed of coals to light large chunks of soaked wood . Once they get smoldering , this becomes the only source of heat as the coals go out . They smolder hot enough to get new wood going if you find you need more . Great for 12 hour smoking at 200F for Boston Butt or Brisket . In terms of wood , you want hard woods with low amounts of resin / sap . No glue , nails , etc. . It wants to be natural . This is a <URL> of types of wood and the smoke they produce . Common woods for BBQ in the SE US are hickory , mesquite , and cedar . I 've used old wine barrel chunks which have a really nice flavor , and also bits of rosemary branch ( thick from a large plant ) which did n't turn out as well as I 'd hoped . You can even use the shells of nuts like pecans . This is really a question of seeing what 's readily available and experimenting with your own personal taste . You can also use wood with a gas grill by putting it in a smoking box or tin foil with holes in it , and placing directly on the heating element . Wood chips work best for this . I 've never had much luck with this though . It 's hard to get the chips smoking and , more importantly , gas grills do n't have the airflow through them to properly move smoke over the food . I switched to charcoal pretty quickly and a <URL> about two years ago , and I 've never looked back .
If you mean cleaning in terms of getting rid of the ' beard ' , use clean pliers and a lot of elbow grease . It 's hard to pull that out . If you mean just cleaning the shells , use a stiff bristled brush and scrub . If you mean cleaning the sand from the inside of the mussels , put the live mussels in a large container full of water and cornmeal and leave overnight in the refrigerator . The mussels should flush the sand out and replace it with cornmeal ( never tried this method , but I 've heard it works well . )
Honey should be stored at 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit Honey is similar in to olive oil and should be storaged between 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit according to <URL> : Similar to olive oil , honey should be stored at a cool temperature between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit . So , it 's best to store it away from your oven or stove . Also , it should not be refrigerated . Extreme changes in temperature will spoil the flavor of honey . Looks like this confirms that you may want to keep it in a cool place and away from hot temperature where it would cause honey to degrade in quality . <URL> continues : Remember Do not store honey in a refrigerator or near a stove or oven . Store it in an air-tight container . Thus , choosing an appropriate container is an important part of the equation . <URL> has a great article germane to this topic . Refrigerating Honey In the <URL> , it talks mentions the crystallizing state of honey if it is refrigerated in no way it harms the honey at all . Restoring honey from a crystalized form I know this is not related to your question . But something you asked in the comments . Apparently , honey can be <URL> : placing it in the microwave for 20 seconds can restore it from a crystallized form . Therefore , you can store it in the refrigerator and heat it afterwards .

The two main issues with ground coffee are : The coffee losing its aroma . The aroma/flavor of coffee is quite volatile , and will evaporate very easily . The solution to this is an airtight container , with as little head room in it as possible . The coffee soaking up moisture from the air . This makes the coffee ... unpleasant . The best solution I 've found ( in a hot humid climate ) is to put it in the freezer . It is the nature of refrigeration to leech all of the moisture from the freezer compartment . In summary , the best I 've found is a small airtight box in the freezer .
<URL> 160 ° F ( 71 ° C ) for dishes containing eggs . If you 're scrambling eggs or making an omelette , as long as they 're coagulated/solidified , they 'll be safe . The easiest way to confirm this is with sous vide eggs . For example , this <URL> has 155 ° F , 160 ° F , and 165 ° F eggs : <URL> <URL> <URL> which clearly show that the white wo n't be totally solidified until 160 ° F or even 165 ° F , even when cooked for an extended period of time . ( To be clear , those lower-temperature eggs are actually safe if cooked for sufficient time . The point here is just to show coagulation versus temperature , to demonstrate that when eggs cooking in a pan , you can use the solidity as a temperature indicator . )
French presses work pretty well for cold brewed coffee . Just put the coffee and the water in and let it " brew " for a long period of time , then press it down to remove the grounds . <URL> .
Generally , slow-cooking means any food preparation method which relies on using low-heat for a long amount of time . Barbecues , smokers , luau pits , and low-heat ovens could all qualify . The benefit of slow-cooking , generally , is that food becomes incredibly tender , as all of its connective tissues break down . Also , flavor can infuse over time and provide deeper results than with virtually any other method . Lastly , long-cooking times create a celebratory atmosphere where food is the focal point of a social gathering . Specifically , slow-cooking refers to the ' slow-cooker ' a counter-top set-up which has a large , electronically heated ceramic bowl and a glass lid . It usually has only a few settings , such as ' low ' , ' medium ' , and ' high ' . The benefit of slow-cooking in a slow-cooker is mainly convenience . These units are safe enough to turn on before work and return to before dinner , with fully-cooked , piping hot food ready to go . The slow-cooker is geared towards ' one-pot ' recipes , which means they require minimal food preparation . You simply cut up the ingredients in fairly large chunks , add seasoning , and liquid , and that 's it . They are a favorite of working parents , but increasingly , also a device for more advanced experimentation .
Instead of dousing the coals , in a primitive setup , you would be better served to manipulate distance from heat source as your form of temperature control . It can be as simple as adding or removing bricks to space your grill from your flame , or as complicated as a pulley-based system to raise or lower your grate . Using water will cause your coals to smolder , which can give off creosote ( less likely with charcoal than wood , but still a possibility ) . This can impart a rather nasty flavor into your food . If you are unable to or uncomfortable with changing your grate distance , then salt or some other dry smothering agent would be viable .
Your clarification means a lot -- " baked " potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own , where the insides become fluffy and creamy , and is done with larger starchy white potatoes , or sweet potatoes work well , too . Roasted potatoes , on the other hand , tends to be ( in the U.S. ) be smaller " new " potatoes , waxy potatoes , or even larger starchy potatoes cut up ( eg , ' oven fries ' ) . The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it 's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you 're going to be cooking them with the roast as there 's going to be moisture in there , I 'd go for a waxy potato ( eg , Red Bliss ) . As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil , and if they 're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast , as you 're going to have to rest it anyway , drain the meat juices , crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F ( 230C ) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes . ps . yes , I know a sweet potato is n't a potato . And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything , as it makes great baked potatoes , and roasted potatoes ( although , not sure how well with a roast at the same time ) and they 're good in pot roast and stews if you do n't add them too early .
Store them unwashed . Take out any " bad " ones . I 've had decent luck adding some paper towels to wick away extra moisture that seems to speed up the spoilage . <URL> .

I 've never tried this , but <URL> . * shrug * Then of course , wash and freeze them spread out on a sheet pan ( to make it easier to separate later ) . I assume this is n't what you want to do , but it is very effective , depending on how you plan to use them .

How can I tell if bell peppers have gone bad ?
Here are a few things to be wary of when buying peppers : Wrinkled skin -- it 's a sign that they 're drying out . It should be firm and smooth . Soft areas -- it 's a sign that it 's starting to rot in areas . It should be firm all over . Fuzz near the stem or blossom end -- you ca n't always see outward signs of the fuzzy mold , but if you do , it 'll be right around where the stem attaches , or in the crevice on the other side . Cracks -- it 's a sign that someone 's dropped it , and opens up the possibility of rotting faster Spots -- besides the soft areas , you can get small dots in an area ... it 's a sign of disease . ( I 'm not sure which ; I typically get this when growing my own , do n't see it in the store ) . Holes -- a sign that there 's an insect that 's eaten its way inside . ( again , I see this more on home grown ones ) Things that are n't always a problem : Discoloration : if it 's a green pepper , it might start turning red , yellow or orange . Red peppers might have an area that looks black or brown . So long as that area is n't soft , and the color changes look blended in ( not where it 's an obvious line between colors ) , it 's fine . Weight : you typically want heavier specimens , but some varieties are thinner skinned , and wo n't be as heavy . If you find one that seems abnormally light , compare it to similar sized ones in the display . If they 're all the same , and do n't have wrinkled skin , they 're probably okay . White lines : you typically see this more on hot peppers , but it can happen on bell peppers , too . They 'll be roughly parallel to each other , along the line from stem to blossom . It 's a sign that they got a sudden burst of water while growing , which caused the skin to crack ( but then heal ) . Folds : some varieties of peppers are more balloon-like , while others may have a few folds ; so long as it 's still smooth skin ( not wrinkled ) , relatively heavy for its size , and you do n't see fuzz in the folds , it 's not an issue .
An avocado will keep a few days in the refrigerator after it has been cut . The cut portion will turn brown/black due to oxidation , you can just cut that off , it is not harmful . From <URL> to keep the avocado from discoloring sprinkle it with lemon/lime juice or vinegar and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or place in an airtight container . From <URL> storing a cut avocado with a piece of cut onion in an airtight container will stop the oxidation . I do n't know why this is , but I suspect that it has to do with the sulfur compounds that the onion releases . This is the same sulfur that makes you cry when you chop onions , but it is also used as a preservative . The onion 's smell and taste do n't seem to transfer to the avocado , as far as I can tell . But I 'm not overly sensitive to onions , so you may want to check this out first if you are . When not to use , from WebMD if your avocado 's flesh has become very dark or the flesh has become stringy you should avoid eating it , particularly if there is any sign of mold . Avocados have a very high fat content , so they oxidize and become rancid very quickly at room temperature and will need to be thrown away .
If by going bad you mean becoming unsuitable for consumption due to toxicity , sugar , when stored properly , does not go bad for at least a few years . By storing properly I mean storing it in conditions of low humidity , as it absorbs humidity ( water ) from the air . This property is called hygroscopy . However , it may lose some of its mechanical properties , form " rocks " , or even solidify into your sugar container . Theoretically very wet sugar can get infested with mold , but I have not seen it happen .
It depends on what you plan to use them for . They wo n't ever be crisp again after freezing , but if you 're cooking them anyway , they will be fine . I do this all the time with leftover peppers . You should certainly remove stems and seeds and cut them into whatever size you will need for cooking .
A quick and dirty way of achieving this is to microwave them for a bit . Microwave oven powers vary , so try 10 seconds first and add time as necessary . You 'll find the right time for the right amount to bring your chips to nearly what they were prior to sitting out .
No <URL> : " There are no outward characteristics that all poisonous mushrooms have in common , so picking and eating wild mushrooms requires the utmost caution . To be absolutely safe , the only mushrooms you should eat are those found at supermarkets and restaurants !

There 's a saying that there 's no such thing as an old , bold mushroom hunter . "
If it has a shiny/reflective surface and does n't melt or bloom ( much ) at room temperature or hand temperature , then it 's already tempered . Virtually every packaged chocolate is already tempered . Untempered chocolate generally needs to be refrigerated for longer-term storage , so if a package does n't specify refrigeration ( and I 've never seen one that does ) , you can assume that it is tempered .
A quick google brought <URL> : In this case , the brown ones may have been closest to mature or viable . When fully ripe , most peppers seeds are supposed to be brown or tan . not white . In my experience , peppers with brown are just old and withered . They are safe , just not as tasty . Unless the brown thing is mold , in which case they may be poisonous .
Red bell peppers freeze really well after being roasted . This is the method I would recommend for you . The problem with freezing first is that it can degrade the peppers ( breaks the firm cell walls ) and would likely make them more difficult to roast afterwards . If you roast them first , the cooking starts the cell collapse itself and the peppers do n't tend to degrade more afterwards , plus your peppers are already roasted , so you 've saved yourself that step in your pasta making process . The process is pretty simple ... roast as usual , parcel into recipe-sized portions in small zip top bags ( do n't forget to date the bags ) and freeze or roast , put on a cookie sheet ( if you have one that fits in the freezer ) , and freeze in a single layer . Once frozen , they can all go in one big bag and they should n't stick to each other too badly . <URL> that explains the process with some roasting tips . And another <URL> .
You could try using arrowroot . This is a widely available alternative to cornstarch - it is used in cookery because it does n't turn liquids cloudy like cornstarch does . In your case , it might work better as it also has a more neutral flavour . Substitute 2 tbsps of arrowroot for 1 tbsp cornstarch , and make a slurry with cool water as you would cornstarch . One issue is that overheating can break down the arrowroot , preventing it from thickening , so you are probably better off adding it to the tea after removing it from the heat .
Usually you can tell when Pineapples are ripen , which will be sweet , when Leaves are loose and can easily be picked from the top The shell has golden colour ( but not dark brown , these are getting rotten ) The aroma even from out of the shell is strong A typical pineapple that is bought green and unripen , takes one to two days to ripe well . Do n't put them in the fridge if you want to ripe them . Keep them out on the counter . As a street food vendor , we always keep them in the truck for one night prior to selling , that ensure the pineapples ripe enough and the juice comes out of it . Hope it helps .
Absolutely . Look to <URL> , or <URL> , for a common example of something similar . Poblanos are admittedly a much firmer and more flavorful pepper , but you can definitely stuff bell peppers with the same process . By charring the peppers first - either directly on a flame ( e.g. on a gas stove or grill ) or under a broiler , you can quickly blacken the skin , making it easy to remove . Doing this quickly enough can help avoid making the flesh of the pepper too soft and fragile . You can then ( carefully ) stuff the pepper with the filling of your choice , and finish in the oven . If you 're really good , you can get it all in through the top where you remove the stem , but it 's much easier to split it down the side in just one place , and carefully tuck it back together after stuffing . I 've often seen stuffed bell peppers sitting upright , with the top removed ; if you 've roasted them first you 'll probably have better luck with them whole , lying on their sides .
There are quite a few different <URL> It 'd be surprising if farmers did n't change which ones they plant in response to changing climatic and economic factors . Size and taste changes when they do that .
Roasting I use direct heat , medium-high to high , specifically I use my grill but I 've seen people set them directly on a gas stove burner ( this seems like a fire hazard , so do n't walk away ) . You could also broil them very close to the broiler , or roast them , but roasting will take longer than direct heat methods . To easily peel them , you want to go until they 're as black as possible . The blacker , the easier they are to peel . On my propane grill on medium-high flame , this takes about 4 minutes per side , my grill burns a little hot so you might need 5-6 minutes per side depending on how your grill works . edit : I also keep the lid closed so the flame climbs a bit more , especially important on a windy day . You can find a picture on the top of <URL> , I actually let mine get significantly darker than that , but it 's not required . There are some great general roasting tips in <URL> as well as peeling tips in <URL> . Grilling For grilling peppers , instead of keeping them whole , seed them and then cut them into quarters and lightly coat them with a little oil . I still use a higher , direct heat , but I flip the peppers more often so they will char a little without completely blackening . Since you 're just going for a light char , this will take a little less time than roasted peppers would , about 8 minutes compared to 12 . There is a good step by step guide with pictures <URL> .
Bacon cooks to safe very quickly . Once it 's opaque it is safe to eat . Raw bacon is itself pretty low risk , provided it has been properly cured . Even if it was n't cooked through , you are unlikely to come to harm .
On another couple of sites ( <URL> for starters ) I found the answer to this . It appears that mould is expected sometimes in the Pancetta making process and as a general rule of thumb as long as it is n't too green and furry then it should be OK . I 've followed Ruhlman 's advice and dabbed the spots of mould with a vinegar soaked cloth and it wiped straight off and looks fine . My meat was coming up to the end of it 's hanging time anyway so rather than worry about it further I 've refrigerated it . I hope this helps anyone that stumbles across this with the same issue .
It 's not going to be nice to drink a day later , no matter what . I 'd use it in baking a chocolate cake or something like that instead , if you ca n't bear to throw it out . The problem is not just the reheating , which will further cook the coffee and affect flavour , but that it 's been losing aroma and oxidizing for a day first . If you 're serving it to anyone you like even a little bit , serve them fresh coffee !!
For protection against heat , you can stabalize the milk with starches . ( eg , a white sauce made with milk wo n't curdle , even if you boil it ) . I unfortunately do n't know how much you 'd have to add , and of course , it 'll end up affecting the texture of your soup ) . For soups , you 're likely better off making a corn starch/milk slurry before adding the milk , so you do n't have to cook it like you would flour to get rid of the raw flour taste . You may also want to consider the heat that you 're cooking the soup at -- you likely want a low simmer , not a full boil .
Unbaked lumps probably mean you are n't mixing it enough . Try starting with a little less flour and knead in more as you go . Another issue is you may not be kneading it enough . Next time try using the <URL> . You do n't have to do this every time , but if you 're having trouble with a specific recipe this will help you figure out how the dough should " feel " when its ready by giving you a visual indicator . I 've found that when I have dough rising problems , it 's usually because I did n't knead long enough . This should also help fix your mixing issue . That being said , there are two good methods to see if dough has risen enough . One is to let it rise in a marked container ( though this does n't work well for shaped loaves or if you are n't supposed to let it double ) . The other is the poke test . From a <URL> : To test for doneness , use the finger test : Poke it with 2 fingers ; it holds the indentation , it 's ready . Generally I poke it and if it pops right back out , it 's not ready . For sourdough , if it holds its shape for a moment and then slowly starts to expand back , it 's perfect . For other breads , holding the indentation is a good indicator . This is n't necessarily advisable for delicate doughs . If you 're working with a delicate dough , try the test on one loaf that you do n't " need " to be perfect . You can use this as a relative time measurement for the future .
' You should n't eat mussels that do n't open ' is an unfounded myth . It was first mentioned in a book by the British food writer Jane Grigson in the 1970s and grew through repetition to the point that 90 % of cook books mentioned it in the 1990s . The fact is , mussels that do n't open after cooking are more likely to be safe than those that do . You should , however , be careful to remove any mussels that have opened before cooking , as they 'll be dead and likely to make you ill .

Should I make my own Hoisin Sauce ?
Are there different qualities in prepared Hoisin sauces ? Think of it like barbecue sauce or chili powder : every company has their own recipe , and it 's always hard to know the precise justification for a specific price . The high price on one may be part of their premium brand image , and have nothing to do with the quality of the ingredients . Ultimately , you just have to try a few brands and decide which flavor appeals to you , and whether you find the price reasonable . If so , would I be better served by making my own ? As far as I can tell , hoisin sauce does not need to be fermented , so it 's going to be much easier to make authentic hoisin sauce at home than something like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce . It 's more like making your own barbecue sauce . A few different websites have minor variations on this recipe : <URL> Is it worth the effort ? That 's a matter of personal opinion . It 's probably hard to justify on purely economic terms ; do you really use more than a few cents worth of hoisin sauce in any given meal , and are the ingredients that much cheaper than the product itself ? But of course , there are other reasons to cook than just to save money . I think you 've just inspired me to try making my own hoisin sauce :) If I make my own , how long will it keep for ? Each of those ingredients can last months on its own , often without any refrigeration , and together would create a highly acidic and antimicrobial environment . The worst that might happen to homemade hoisin sauce in several months of refrigerated storage is it might separate a bit and have to be remixed .
Short version : If it 's only overnight , and you seal the containers reasonably well , you 'll be okay prepping any of those ingredients ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator overnight . I often leave onions in the fridge when preparing a recipe that calls for only half an onion , or if I 've decided to use less than I prepped , or if I 'm making a salsa and I chop the onions before realizing I do n't have as many tomatoes as I thought , etc. . If you do n't cover them they will dry out a bit , but overnight does n't do much harm ; I find if they 're tightly covered , whether in a glass bowl with plastic wrap or a sealed plastic storage container , they 're just as good the next day . The same goes for carrots and celery . I 'm sure there 's been a time when I prepped too much mirepoix ; but generally speaking , if you have a cut carrot or stalk of celery in the fridge , it does n't suffer too much overnight . More than a day and it starts to dry out ; the cut surface of the carrot will start to look like the end near the tops , and possibly split . The celery dries out more quickly , as it 's got higher water content and more fragile structure to begin with ; more than a day and it 'll lose its color , eventually turning limp and yellow , starting from the cut end . For the veggies , the way to keep them freshest is with a tight seal and as little air as possible . You could put them in a zipper bag and squeeze out any extra air but I think a reasonably-sized glass bowl , covered tightly with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge , is good enough for 12-24 hours . If you do n't have room in the fridge , you 'll probably still be okay , and they may even be less prone to drying out ( the air in your fridge is very low-humidity ; sometimes you have a special compartment for which the humidity can be adjusted , for fruits and vegetables ) . I have less experience prepping meat ahead of time , unless I 'm brining or marinading it ; in those situations , the meat 's covered by a liquid that contains preservatives ( salt , acid ) that help prevent it from spoiling , and it 's always refrigerated . Keeping it cool and minimizing the contact with air or contaminants is the main thing . If you only have enough room in the fridge to store some of your prepped ingredients , use it for the meat . In this case I 'd say a zipper bag with the air squeezed out is the clear way to go ; meat is malleable and you 'll be able to get nearly all of the air out , which means it 'll store almost as well as it did before you chopped it into pieces . The thing to remember about ground , chopped or cubed meat is that anything that contaminated the outside surface of the original cut is now mixed evenly throughout . This is why it 's generally safer to order a steak rare than it is to order a hamburger rare ; the center of the steak has n't been exposed to as much of its environment as the center of the burger , during handling and storage . So even if you refrigerate your prepped meat in a sealed container with the air evacuated , effectively storing it just as well as when it was in the original packaging and in one piece , I would n't expect it to keep the same effective " use by " date because it 's been disturbed and mixed and exposed to the environment of your prep area . You 're better off doing this with a cut that you purchased recently , which has n't been refrozen and is n't nearing expiration .
Soft bread is soft because CO2 produced by yeast and water that gets turned to steam by the baking process gets trapped into pockets by a mesh of gluten , causing the dough to expand . The dough then solidifies , keeping its shape . If your bread is not soft then it has n't expanded enough for one or more reasons : Dough too dry : as much as the yeast , water is responsible for getting a good rise in your bread . Gluten requires moisture to relax and stretch , forming the structure that traps the air that causes a rise , dough that is too dry wo n't form good gluten . Also , dough that is too dry wo n't have the elasticity to rise . Yeast needs water to do its work , dough that is too dry will inhibit the yeast . Also , the expansion of water into steam is as important for a good rise as yeast . If there 's one mistake many bakers make ( including myself for years ) it is making dough too dry . Yeast inactive or inhibited : if your yeast is old , came into contact with salt , or does n't have enough water to work then your yeast wo n't work well for you . Yeast does several things for you : it converts sugar into CO2 causing a rise , it improves the structure of your dough , and it adds flavor . Put the salt on the opposite side of the bowl from the yeast to avoid inhibiting it . Also , adding the yeast to sugary water does n't work well , especially with more modern yeasts . Just get quick acting yeast and add it to the flour bowl , then add water to that . The dough is not worked ( kneaded ) enough : Kneading improves the structure of your dough by stretching gluten molecules and getting them to link together , making your dough stretchy and pliable , and forming a structure that will trap air for a rise . Under-worked dough wo n't have enough structure the dough has been worked too much : as a home baker using hands this is unlikely , but still possible . Once you have the structure of the dough you need , stop and let it rise as any further working will form too much of a structure , making it too strong to expand Dough under-risen : the times in baking recipes are just guidelines , you need to go for a result rather than a time . I 've had books say 45 minutes but it takes 3 hours , especially if my yeast was old Dough over-risen : if your dough rises too long the yeast will exhaust the sugars in the dough and die out , leading to the loss of all the air . This will make the dough dense . For a nice soft sandwich bread I start with a really sticky dough . I then use it 's stickiness to stretch the dough , smearing it all over the countertop and using a pastry scraper to bring it back together . This is a really quick way to build some gluten . Then I knead in flour bit by bit , kneading for at least 1 minute between adding flour until I have a soft dough that still sticks a bit to the counter . That stickiness means that there 's enough moisture in the dough . I 'll add a bit more flour to that and then stop adding flour to avoid drying the dough . If I want to knead it more I 'll knead with a bit of vegetable oil instead to keep it from sticking . It 's consistency you 're looking for , not time . Time is relative depending on your strength and kneading technique , 5 minutes for a skilled and strong baker may translate to 15 minutes for normal humans , so knead until you have the consistency you want . When you start kneading the dough it will pull into pieces easily , and have a rough texture . As you knead that roughness disappears and it will stretch longer without breaking . For a sandwich loaf I 'll knead until I can stretch the dough from the middle of my torso to my knee without it breaking . Next , rising your dough may take much longer than recipes say as it all depends on the ambient temperature of the room , humidity , the activity of the yeast , and other factors . Again , make this results driven , not time driven . A good sandwich bread dough should rise a lot , not the " doubled " many recipes say . For me tripled is more like it . Make sure you put it in a big enough bowl ! This advice goes for the initial as well as the secondary rise in the pans . Let it rise enough in the pans until it looks like the recipe picture , that 's about right . Ideally your oven will have been pre-heating for 30 minutes by now . Now , slash your loaves the long way with a razor blade like a carpet knife , about 1/2 an inch down . Do it quick and avoid punching down the dough . Slashing will split the top skin and allow the dough to rise efficiently after you put it into the oven . Once you put it in the oven it 's going to rise a lot as the yeast goes crazy before the heat kills it , and the moisture in the dough is going to vaporize into steam . If you do n't slash you wo n't get as good a rise .
You will need to be careful about extra liquid in your sauce . Your base recipe should be adaptable . Go ahead and use the garlic and onion , but I would omit the white wine . If you are using canned whole tomatoes , drain liquid before using them . Simmer it to reduce it down until it is " spreadable " rather than " pour-able " . We make a lot of home-made pizza sauce with canned whole San Marzano tomatoes , drained and puree 'd in blender . Salt , pepper , garlic and a few spices . My husband loves bright red color in the sauce so a bit of citric acid does the trick . Enjoy your pizza .
The dates you have are probably brahi , whereas the ones you remember eating before are medjhoul . These are different types of dates , and have slightly different flavour profiles . As for storage , they should be fine for a few days at room temperature . For anything longer than that , they should be kept in the fridge , particularly if you live somewhere hot/humid . I also vaguely remember an old Israeli habit of eating yellow dates frozen , or after a few minutes out of the freezer .
I 'll try to answer this . Concerning the first recipe you linked , it does n't matter at all whether you add it first or not , since there is no extraction going on . Theres no fresh coffee , no fresh vanilla . Just extract , which of course is already extracted , so no extended wait time is needed ! There might still be room for improvement , letting flavors ' marry ' and so , but I 'd say a day should be enough . The second recipe is different . It steeps fresh coffee in alcohol , and here it 's going to need time . One month is however an extreme amount of time . Usually , hot water and coffee is steeped for seconds , and cold water and coffee is often steeped for 12 hours . Consider that alcohol is a stronger solvent than water . But if going for a true alcoholic extraction , pure is better / faster , so you should steep before adding water , and the sugar probably does n't make much difference . This said , I 'm not sure you should actually let it steep in alcohol at all , and I 'm not sure you should dilute it either . If I was doing this , I would go for water cold extraction . I 'd be concerned that alcohol would extract too much , the same as too long hot water steeping leads to bitter , sour , pungent coffee . I 'm not sure why you would want to dilute it with alot of water either . Water adds nothing to the party . Dilute it when using it instead , this leaves you free to choose each time . Perhaps you 'd like to mix it with milk instead , sometime ? Do you have a french press ? Let 1 part coursely ground coffee steep in 3 parts cold water over night . Use the filter / top to filter it , and pour it into your vodka . I 'm not completely sure , but I think 1 part extract to 4 parts vodka would be fine . Use the same ratio of sugar as in the recipes you linked , or after taste . UPDATE : I did n't completely read the second recipe before I answered . It says to boil the vodka-mixture . Sure , the alcohol does n't vanish in an hour , but I 'd still say it 's an unacceptable waste ( spirits are expensive where I 'm from ! ) . Also , the effect is the inverse of destillation , so you are left with a weaker , but sweeter , drink . I 'm not sure why it says to boil it . It says that it 's to ' thicken the liqueur ' , but they could just use less water instead . Good luck !
You 've got a few things to consider -- cost of the ingredients shrinkage energy costs time costs wastage So , in our decision making tree , we have to consider the real costs of each option . Say for instance that whole roasts are on sale , so the cost of a roast is 1/2 the cost of buying the deli meat . The roast is going to lose weight as it cooks ... it 's just part of the cooking process . It could be anywhere from 10 to 25 % , depending on the cut of meat and how hot you cook it . Obviously , there will be other spices and such , but we 'll assume they 're mostly negligible . There will be the cost to power your oven ... and that 'd be a function of where you live , if it 's gas or electric ( or solar ) , etc ... and if you make too much , and ca n't eat it before it spoils , then there 's waste . ... but then we get to the most important part in my opinion -- time , and slicing . Even if we assume our time costs nothing ( and when you 're throwing something in the oven and leave it for a few hours , that part 's negligible ) . Our real time comes in slicing it -- and I do n't have a professional slicing machine , just a bunch of knives , so it 's going to take me quite a long time , and I 'm not going to get it as thin as the deli can . And in my opinion , it 's the shaving of the meat that matters ; there 's a big difference between large chunks of meat vs. thick slices vs. thinly shaved . ... So , in my opinion -- is it cost effective ? maybe a little bit , if you assume your time is free . Is it worth it ? Maybe if you want to spice it special , or make it lower salt , stay away from sulfides / sulfates , or do something else special ... but as you likely ca n't slice it the same , it 's more likely to come out as an inferior product . That 's not to say that I wo n't ever do it , but I doubt I 'd do it anytime soon , and it wo n't be because I think it 's a cost savings .
The exterior coating on an egg is known as the " cuticle " . It helps to protect the ( porous ) shell and minimize moisture loss , but it eventually breaks down as the chick matures and prepares to hatch . The reason that eggs in the US are typically sold under refrigeration is because they are washed with warm water and detergent to remove the large amount of bacteria that are deposited on the shell while being laid . Once the cuticle is removed the egg becomes more porous . Most bakeries that are using whole eggs will typically keep several flats out at all times to have them at room temperature . Eggs will store better and longer in the refrigerator but if being used frequently and fairly quickly , they can also be left at room temperature . Howard McGee in On Food &amp; Cooking says that egg quality deteriorates as much in one day at room temperature as it does four days under refrigeration .
Once my starter was established ( started with organic whole wheat flour ) I 've been feeding it with unbleached AP flour ( King Arthur ) and that 's worked fine . I do this simply because it 's the flour I buy in large quantities to stock my pantry , and so it 's generally the cheapest flour I have on hand . If you want to " switch over " to a different flour you can always scoop out a bit of starter a couple days before you bake , and feed it with the different flour . Start with a small amount so you do n't have to throw any away ; just double the volume with each feeding . I do n't usually bother , though .
In the accepted answer to <URL> , it says that you can try wringing the pumpkin purée out in cheese cloth ; or in a comment , that you can let it drain in a colander .
It really depends on what your goal is ; that is , what you are doing with the pasta . If you are making most authentic Italian pasta dishes , the slightly under cooked pasta is transferred to the pan in which the condiment was prepared . It is then tossed with some water from the pot that that the pasta was cooked in , along with some butter or olive oil ( depending on the region of the dish ) . This finishes the cooking , emulsifies the sauce , and mixes in the the condiment . The final dish is not about pasta or the condiment in isolation , but rather the combination . Just like a salad is not about the lettuce , per se , but the combination of lettuce and dressing . It is true that pasta will potentially absorb the sauce and get mushy if stored in fridge . This is less of a problem if sauced appropriately , but still , it is possible . First choice , prepare only enough pasta for the meal . Depending on the type of pasta , you are only looking at a maximum of 10 - 12 minutes of cooking and often less . So , it 's not really about convenience . If you find you have cooked more than you need , you could always chill and reserve non-sauced pasta , then reheat it in condiment at another time . But , in my opinion , this would be inferior to freshly cooked , and take almost as much time . If your goal is a cold pasta salad , by all means , cook , chill , then mix with dressing whenever you need it .
Assuming your roux is flour based , the original recipe mixture was able to be a sauce because the proteins in the flour formed gluten and created that lovely thickness we enjoy ( your seasonings sound like a nice combo ) . The water from the other ingredients are trapped in the gluten . Unfortunately , when you freeze it , the water molecules form sharp shapes like knives and cut your gluten strands . This is n't a noticeble problem until your defrost it . It does n't matter how quickly or slowing you defrost . The damage was done when it was frozen . To work around this issue , you have to freeze it faster ! Professional establishments can super freeze things super fast . Freezing faster will make smaller knife-shaped ice crystals and that reduces the damage . TIPS : freeze in smaller portions and shallower depth on a pre-frozen metal cookie sheet . Defrost and strain the sauce . Make a new roux and add the defrosted &amp; strained sauce . The flavor comes from the frozen sauce and the new roux recreates the gluten .
The problem could be the recipe . If you 're using a lot of lemon juice , then a lot of sugar to cover up all that acidity , you 're guaranteed to end up with something pretty soft . Have a look around at other lemon sorbet recipes , and see if you 're using relatively more . But if your recipe is sane , then it could be your process . Here 's how it could mess things up . Sorbet is basically sugar water with a bit of flavor . When it freezes all the way , unless it was churned as it froze , there 's going to be a tendency for it to separate into ice crystals and even stronger sugar water . Some of this may happen in your first freezing step . Then you 're pulverizing it in a food processor , probably giving it a chance to melt a bit . This is much worse than just leaving it out , since once it 's in tiny bits , there 's a lot more surface area exposed to air , and you 're continuously mixing it , bringing in warm air , and so on . Then finally , it refreezes . The part that managed to melt in the meantime is going to repeat the earlier process , except now there 's lots of space , so it 's even easier for ice crystals to form and force out the sugar . So I 'd definitely expect a tendency to end up with a runny sugar syrup component to your " sorbet " . ( If it 's at all grainy , this is probably what 's happening . ) If you 're determined to do this without any kind of ice cream maker , it 's going to be hard to avoid problems . You can certainly try to correct for it by using less sugar , though . You could also just make a granita - freeze it on a sheet , and scrape it off to serve .
To prevent this from happening , apart from what <URL> , check the temperature with a thermometer . Eggs start coagulating around 60ºC . If you keep the temperature around 55ºC you are pasteurizing the eggs at the same time .
Although this is partially personal preference , in general you should have the uncut ingredients on the side of your non-cutting hand . This will set up a logical flow of material which keeps you from having to reach over your cutting hand . If you chop with your right then you 'd have the uncut ingredients on your left , as after knife work your chopped ingredients will be on the right of the knife . Everything else comes from this . If you are chopping a lot of ingredients it makes sense to have a few bowls handy to put the chopped ingredients into so you can keep your board clear . My workflow is based on the assembly line principle - that is do all of one type of task before moving onto another to limit the amount you have to move : before chopping I get bowls for each of the chopped ingredients ( stackable stainless steel bowls from a kitchen supply store are great for this as they clean easy and take up little space ) , and array the bowls to the right of the board . Then I wash all the ingredients , peel them , and prep them at once rather than doing it individually per ingredient and place them to the left of the board , so I have all my ingredients ready to chop . Then I take each type of ingredient and chop them one at a time , saving any messy ( tomatoes , cheeses ) or possibly contaminating ones ( meat , seafood ) for last , as I will have to clean the board , my hands , and the knife after possible contaminators to prevent cross-contamination . As the board fills for each ingredient I will transfer the chopped ingredients to the bowls , but I wait until I need the space to continue cutting - if you move the chopped ingredients each time you finish chopping one of them then you waste time moving your arms and body around . This is the fastest way I have found to get a lot of ingredients processed . If you wash , prep , peel , chop and move each ingredient individually you spend a lot of extra time moving around the kitchen .
In general , it is a good idea to go light on spices when trying a new recipe , if you 're not intimately familiar with the flavor and spice combinations in question . It 's a great deal easier to add spice later than it is to mask it once you 've added too much . Assuming you are reading this because you did n't do that , and have now ended up with a sauce that 's far too spicy , then read on . The pertinent question here is where is the spiciness coming from ? There are actually several kinds of compounds that can produce that general aroma and/or sensation . In most dishes they 'll tend to fall loosely into one or more of the following : <URL> , which is the active alkaloid in black pepper . This has poor solubility in water , however , it has better solubility in alcohol . If you can incorporate wine or better yet , brandy or vodka or some other strong alcohol , this can go a long way toward reducing the heat from pepper . <URL> , the heat-producing compound in most types of hot peppers , is the highest on the <URL> ; extremely piquant and can produce a " burning " sensation in very small quantities . It is also poorly soluble in water , but is far more soluble in fat , especially oils . Adding some olive oil or a good quantity of butter to your recipe is a good bet for reducing capsaicin/capsicum heat . Garlic , onion , and other members of the <URL> family put out a volatile sulfur compound called <URL> . Although this is not " spicy " in the same sense as pepper , many people perceive it as such . Like piperine , it is more soluble in alcohol than in water . However , and here 's the catch : That allicin breaks down into various <URL> when cooked , and those polysulfides are fat soluble . So if you 're trying to mask a strong garlic or onion flavour , it 's best if you can add alcohol and fat to cover all your bases . If you 've added too much Ginger - another ingredient often perceived as spicy - then you 're dealing with <URL> and <URL> , the latter of which pack a much bigger punch . One of the things you can actually do with ginger is <URL> which converts those into much milder <URL> . In other words , add some water to the sauce and then boil it to reduce the sauce again - you 'll lose some flavour but in the process you 'll break down the ginger spice . Alternatively ( for ginger ) , all of the above compounds are alkali soluble , so if you add a buffering agent - say , <URL> ( additive E331 ) , it will improve the solubility a great deal . If , like most people , you do n't happen to keep food additives in your kitchen , you can try using something like baking soda , but too much of that will completely ruin the taste , so be careful . In fact , do n't add too much of any buffer because the acidity of most sauces is an integral part of their flavor . I think that about covers it for common " spicy stuff " that goes in sauces . If you want to fix a dish that 's too spicy , you need to know where the spice is coming from and choose what 's most appropriate for that particular sauce . You can also try to mask or balance the spice with something sweet , for example roasted vegetables or plain old sugar . That will not eliminate the heat at all , but does seem to make it more tolerable for many .
I use beer a LOT for my cooking . As the others have said , you need to watch out for the bitterness , which can intensify when you cook and reduce it down . As such , I often cook with different beers than I drink . You can use the IBU ( International Bitterness Unit ) rating for a beer to get an idea of whether your favorite beer will be a problem . Personally , I use Guinness and other dark beers when red wine is called for in a recipe . The flavors are definitely different than the red wine version , but it usually comes out good . I also cook quite a bit with wheat beers and the kind of beers that people describe as " nutty " , like porters . America 's Test Kitchen looked at beers for cooking at one point and a " non-alcoholic " beer actually did really well : O'Doul 's Amber . I agree with them and tend to keep it on hand for cooking , even though I never drink it . It stays mellow and away from the bitter flavors when used for cooking . So , what do I cook with it ? Like most of the others , cooking bratwurst before grilling and cheese fondue , but I also use it for lots of other stuff . I have a baked bean version that uses 4 cans of beer and a couple of shots of whiskey and sits in a crock pot on low for 24 hours . I 've made this with all different kinds of beer and each brings something different to the results . ( <URL> ) I also like using beer in most of my stews . Throw beef chunks , veggies and beer in the crock pot in the morning and it 's a tasty stew when you get home . It works well as the liquid for braising pork or beef . In the winter , I 'll often throw a pork shoulder roast into the crock pot with a bottle of beer and let it slow cook all day . When it 's completely falling apart , I pull it out , shred it and add back as much of the beer as the shredded mess will hold ( which turns out to be far more than you thought ) . What results is a juicy sandwich option , which is really good , topped with mustard or bbq sauce . It comforts me when it 's too cold to deal with slow smoking pork ( I live in MN ) . I 'll also often take some of that shredded " drunk " pork to my baked beans and give the beans some extra dimension . We do a version of " bangers and mash " that I use beer in the gravy/sauce that I like . Beer and self-rising flour make for a really quick quickbread that has an interesting flavor profile . I particularly like using wheat beers like Leinenkugel 's Sunset Wheat , as the wheat flavors work well in a bread . Beers ( and hard ciders , which I actually REALLY like ) work well for marinades . Beyond that , I tend to find myself just tossing a few ounces of it into a lot of other liquids/sauces to add some flavor .
If you have oven safe noodle bowls ( ceramic , not plastic ) then line them , as you describe with the foil , but do not remove them from the bowls . Bake your pie in the lined bowls , then remove the finished pies , with their aluminum " pan " intact . Or just make pasties ... no pan required . As you indicate you do n't have oven safe bowls and it must be a pie , I decided to experiment , using the double foil idea . I have heavy duty foil . I used a double layer and lined a noodle bowl making sure that there was plenty of foil out past the edge . I then pressed another noodle bowl on top of the two sheets of foil to make sure all is acting as a unit . While the top bowl is still in place , crumple up the excess foil , making a rim . This is what will give you the strength you need . I would then take the top bowl out , and line the now stable foil pie tin with your pie pastry . Fill the pie and if there is a top crust , finish the pie . You can now take the pie out of the noodle bowl and bake it as usual , although I would certainly do it on a baking sheet . The double foil is much stronger than you 'd expect , but the stability comes from the rim you build with the excess foil hanging over the edge . Here 's the finished bowl with the two molding bowls .
Cheap cheese is , as others have explained , cheap for a reason . You should be able to find old/extra old ( AKA " sharp " / " extra sharp " ) cheddar cheese in the cheap section , which makes a reasonably good starting point - this cheese does have some flavour . Daniel says he simmers the milk ; I generally start with evaporated milk , which is even more economical than regular milk and keeps in the pantry forever . Although I would not use evaporated milk in just any recipe calling for milk , it happens to work quite well for Mac 'n Cheese . Other common additions to help offset the lack of flavour in poorly-aged cheeses are : Salt . Remember , salt is essentially a flavour enhancer and will bring out the natural taste of any other ingredient . Mustard . Prepared mustard is OK , but concentrated mustard made from dry mustard and a small amount of water is even better , so you can avoid having to add too much liquid . This does n't enhance the flavour of the cheese , but it does share some of the " sharpness " associated with cheddar and makes a good complement . As a bonus , it also acts as a natural emulsifier for the sauce , helping to minimize separation and curdling . Ground cayenne or red pepper . Although most people probably do n't associate Mac 'n Cheese with piquant , a small amount of this wo n't make the sauce noticeably spicy , but it will add a bit of the same " kick " you get with very old cheese . If all else fails , my " secret weapon " for Mac 'n Cheese is - not kidding - the sauce base from Kraft Dinner ( AKA Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner for you Yankees ) , especially if you can get the " extra sharp " version . This stuff is dirt cheap ( often just 99 cents for a package ) and before you dismiss this as heresy , keep in mind that the idea is not to use the whole thing . Just a teaspoon or two to enhance your homemade sauce . If you do n't approve of such shortcuts then you should n't be buying cheap cheese in the first place , right ? So there you have it . Try some or all of the above ; I 'm sure you 'll end up with something that 's at least acceptable , if not great .
I think you may reach the point of diminishing returns if you try and fix your oven because there 's lots that could be going wrong . It could be that your oven design is just bad , in which case you ca n't fix it anyway . It could be a faulty temperature sensor , or a bad gas valve , or a faulty burner . Your gas supply pressure could be inconsistent . By the time you replace all these you 'll have spent more than a new oven would cost . I 'd first clean it really well . Get all the dust and gunk out and see if that helps . Then you should see if you can find a pro who can have a look at it , test the gas supply , see if there 's any quick wins . One suggestion I 'd make would be to post this on the <URL> forum , the home improvement site . As this is more a question about mechanics and repair you 're likely to get a better answer there .

When making french press coffee , what is the purpose of blooming the grounds ?
I found a quote from <URL> One thing you may not want to do with a press pot , especially a larger model , is use beans roasted less than 2 or 3 days before . What , am I crazy ? Nope . There 's a problem with ultra fresh beans and it is called " bloom " . When beans are only a day or two off the roast , they contain heaps of Co2 . Heaps of it , I tell you . That Co2 will translate into a massive bloom of brown suds on top of your press pot , possibly overflowing , but also making it easier for big particulate matter ( your ground coffee ) to hop and skip over the top of the filter portion when you first apply it . Bloom looks cool , but can make using a press pot more difficult . The poor filtering part sounds questionable to me , so I googled it and found a few bloom-related comments <URL> . It seems like some people start timing their soak time only after they see bloom . This seems like the real reason to me . I know for sure that the air content in ground substances can vary significantly : one cup of flour can contain double the volume of another if one is loosely sifted and the other is compacted . The above quote is accurate about that in my opinion . Apply this logic to coffee and in order to produce an accurate , general recipe for how long some compounds take to come out of coffee grounds , you need to factor out a variable between coffee grounds : how much air is in the grindings . Maybe the first small pour will saturate with coffee compounds , or drop in temperature quickly , reducing how much it can extract from the grounds . Once it squeezes out all the air , the rest of the water is poured in to do the real extraction work .
The reason is that butter can inhibit gluten formation . It ' coats ' the proteins that would form gluten . You knead the dough first to get gluten , and then add the butter afterward around the already formed gluten . You can add it earlier , you just end up with less gluten and a more tender dough . Creaming is n't usually done with bread , as its purpose is air bubble formation .
It is coagulated albumin leaked from the flesh of the fish . Not terribly inviting , but not harmful either .
The primary purpose is for flavor . If it 's the expense of a large bottle for a few tablespoons here and there you should be able to buy the mini bottles ( as are served on airplanes ) from a local liquor store . If you do n't want to use or have it around due to issues with alcohol then look for other items that have as similar flavor to substitute . Sherry has a sweet nutty flavor to it and apple juice can often work suitably well . Keep in mind you 'll probably not find an exact flavor match but it can be close . A small amount of orange extract could be used in place of grand marnier . Depending on the item , you might also try flavored syrups that are used for coffee drinks . Remember that these have a lot of sugar in them so you 'll need to compensate by cutting back on sugar elsewhere in the recipe and obviously do n't use them where the sweet flavor would n't be welcome .
Yes there is a significant difference between the two . I would put them at pretty close to opposite ends of the coffee spectrum . French Press : Generally made with a coarse grind , longer steeping time . Result is a weaker ( less concentrated ) more typical American style coffee . This will likely be consumed in the same way as a typical filtered , drip coffee would . Moka Pot : Made with a much finer grind . And while many will argue it 's not true espresso . It is much closer to being an espresso . I do n't really care what you call it , but it 'll be a much stronger more robust coffee . The same amount of coffee will be extracted to a smaller quantity of water . This would be consumed in the same way as an espresso would . You can water it down to make an Americano , etc. . .
This really depends on your freezer and your icecream bowl . Usually the instructions will have a suggested freeze time on them ... In my experience , however , it 's usually 6-8 hours at a minimum . If you need to make multiple batches , it is ABSOLUTELY worth your money to get another bowl .
Custard should taste eggy . This is a feature , not a bug . However , from your mention of flour , I think what you 're talking about is a souffle , not something like a creme brulee or along those lines . Would that be correct ? Edited based on subsequent clarifications : Ah . Your method is sorely lacking , and your ingredients are off . You need to temper the yolks first , you need to use yolks only , and use cream instead of milk . Here is a smaller version of what I use at work for creme brulee : - 1L 35 % cream - 11 egg yolks - 1C sugar - 1 vanilla bean , scraped Bring cream to a simmer with the vanilla seeds and pod ( you can use approx 1.5 tsp vanilla extract , pure not artificial , instead ) . While it is heating , beat the yolks and sugar together until just incorporated . Pour the cream into the eggs whisking briskly to prevent curdling . Pour mixture through a fine chinois . Skim off foam , pour into ramekins . Place ramekins in a pan , add water to 1/2way up the sides . Cover pan with foil . Bake at 275 ( convection ) or 325 ( non convection ) for approx 40 minutes , until wobbly in the centre but set . Chill until set , eat . The deflation is caused by a souffle effect coming from including the egg whites , which are never used in a custard -- custards , creme anglaise , etc , are always yolks only . When you include the whites , air will be trapped inside temporarily , and will escape/collapse when the mixture cools . If you bake until fully stiff with my method , you will get hard and rubbery custard by the time it is set in the fridge . Also , save the whites -- they freeze well -- for meringues or souffles .
There is one reason I might do this . If the core is green , that is starting to form a sprout . I cut that out as it can be bitter . Otherwise I do n't know why one would do that .
Mozzarella comes in different variations ... There are a few things to look and smell for to determine it they are " off " . Aged or drier varieties may have visible mold on the exterior . Pre-grated mozzarella can also exhibit visible mold as well as a sour or yeasty smell . Brined varieties may have a musty , sour , or smelly-foot odor or an excessively cloudy brine . If you see visible mold on a drier variety , you can just cut it off and use the remaining cheese as normal as long as it does n't smell . If you plan on cooking or melting the cheese , it would likely be safe to eat , but may not taste normal . Moist cheeses like mozzarella can harbor Listeria , E coli , brucella , and salmonella so if you are in doubt and not interested in a bout of food poisoning , it 's best just to throw it out . To keep brined varieties fresh longer keep it refrigerated and replace the brine daily , the replacement brine should taste salty like the ocean . Even so , it should really be eaten within 2-3 days .
It 's an issue of thermodynamics . When you 're cooking food , the food cools itself off through evaporative cooling and the energy being used to cause chemical changes in the food ( eg , caramelizing sugars ) . If you have too much food in the pan , the balance is overwhelmed by evaporative cooling , and thus you can only get to the boiling point of water . To change the equation , you need to do one of the following : Use a more powerful heat source . Cook less food at a time Reduce the amount of moisture in the food before cooking it . You 'll often see advice for # 3 -- such as patting dry steak or chicken before grilling it , as without it , you wo n't get good browning . You ca n't do that when you 're dealing with sauces . You can try cooking less , but with sauces you cause more problems -- if the pan size is the same , the area for evaporation is the same , so you do n't really improve the balance . With a sufficiently sized burner , you can actually heat sauces above the boiling point , as you 're putting in energy faster than evaporation can cool it . This which will change the chemical reactions that occur , thus the resulting chemical compounds and the resulting flavor of the food .
If you mean the little paper frills on the ends of the bones on a Frenched rack of lamb , those are purely decorative .
Remember that veal is merely very young beef ; the chuck ( which is the beef equivalent to the pork shoulder ) is probably your best choices . The chuck naturally has that best proportion of muscle to fat for sausage making . That said I would actually discourage you from choosing veal as a meat for sausage making , ground veal is [ IMHO ] really ' nothing special ' in terms of flavor . Veal 's ' specialness ' is in its tenderness , which is irrelevant in a sausage . You would be better served to use an mature beef chuck from an angus or longhorn . Lamb would also be a nice ancient flavor .
Broiling involves high heat coming from a source very close to the surface of the food . It is appropriate for thin food , or for adding color ( via caramelization/Maillard reaction ) to already ( or mostly ) cooked items . I could n't say what the temperature of the heating element itself is , but the resulting air temperature is usually upwards of 550 ˚ F ( 288 ˚ C ) . In baking , although the heating element is usually on one side or the other of the oven , * the idea is that heat is being transferred to the food more or less evenly from all sides . This is part of the reason thorough pre-heating is important -- to make the air in the box all the same temperature before the food goes in . There 's no real " default temperature " -- you use whatever will produce the desired results in your food . With lower heat , coming from all sides , baking will allow the interior of a thick piece of food to cook before the exterior has over-cooked . Putting cake batter under a broiler will likely result in a dried-out or burnt top , perhaps a layer of reasonably well-cooked cake , and a raw bottom . The heat simply wo n't transfer through the cake fast enough to allow the entire thing to cook . The appropriate technique for meat depends on the size of the meat . Steaks can do very well under a broiler -- the intense heat allows the exterior to brown and become flavorful without the interior over-cooking . A roast cut or a whole bird , on the other hand , would need to be baked ( or " roasted " ) so that the interior has time to come to the proper temperature . A very thick chop or steak might be started in the oven , then finished under the broiler to give it color . * Your oven probably has just the one heating element , used for both baking and broiling . There 's no reason that an oven could n't have multiple elements for baking -- and it might produce more even cooking -- but broiling always means heat from above .
Some answers to your questions , based on my experience with wild sourdough starter in San Francisco : 70-80F is the ideal temperature range . Below that the yeast incubates very slowly ; above it , the starter will tend to ferment alcoholically . Do not leave the starter in direct sun . UV light is a powerful sterilizing agent . An organic , cold-processed ( i.e. stone milled ) flour works best , because it will retain the maximum amount of its own wild yeast on it . Cheeseboard : Collective Works likes to start with rye flour and gradually add bread flour , but they do n't give a tested reason for this . I have never heard of using fruit juice in a sourdough starter . I would be dubious about it ; you 'd be likely to end up with vinegar . Sugar is unnecessary for sourdough starters . Use purified water ; chlorine/chloramine/ozone in tap water can kill your starter . Finally , starters incorporating milk are fridge-only starters ( as opposed to flour-and-water starters , which can be kept at room temperature if split frequently ) which depend on the bacteria and lactic acid from the fermenting milk for part of their sourness . They can be effective , and actually a good choice if you live somewhere with weak/poor wild yeast . Note that you can not transform a milk sourdough into a water sourdough , and using up 2 cups of milk every 2 weeks is more expensive than 2 cups of filtered water .
Taste the meat and if it still seems edible to you then there is no reason to throw it out . When I make stock , I keep it on a simmer for much longer than three hours and any meat is completely tasteless by the time I 'm done . Three hours , however , is about how long you would cook meat to make a stew , so it 's quite possible that you could eat it . On the other hand , not all cuts of meat stew well and I 'm not familiar with this cut . If the meat has plenty of connective tissues ( i.e. collagen ) to gelatinise it should n't dry out too much . But the proof is in the pudding : taste it .
My understanding is that the ratio shifts from 10:1 ( liquid to roux ) for a pale roux , up to about 5:1 for a nutty brown roux , with a somewhat linear relationship between the two extremes . A dark brown roux has very little thickening power , mostly they are used for flavor more than actual work-a-day thickening . The problem may not so much in the roux ratios , but in other ingredient variations . For instance , if you are using a traditional 3:2 flour : fat roux , and your fat is butter , make sure you are using clarified butter , or that you are allowing most of the water to cook out of the butter before adding the flour - excess water in the roux will break down some of the starches and reduce the thickening strength . Finally , there will be some variation no matter what - you can always make a little extra roux in a second pan to integrate if necessary .
I do n't know if there 's an ideal ratio since this is really about how strong you want the coffee to be . It depends on the strength of the roast you 're using , the grind , and how strong you like the coffee . I generally use 2 tbs / 6 oz , but vary it to taste .
This product is new to me , but it looks interesting . The flavour of <URL> is described in Wikipedia : Nutritional yeast has a strong flavor that is described as nutty , cheesy , or creamy , which makes it popular as an ingredient in cheese substitutes . It is often used by vegans in place of parmesan cheese . Nutritional yeast is a so called <URL> . A complete protein ( or whole protein ) is a source of protein that contains an adequate proportion of all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for the dietary needs of humans or other animals . This also explains why it is popular among vegans , that needs to replace the amino acids in meat with alternative food sources .
Yes , you can roast the beans some more . However the results will probably not be great . Roasting results in quite a bit of smoke . If you are going low tech , I would do it in a wok in a very well ventilated area . It 's pretty easy to set off smoke detectors . A stove top with a range hood might be good enough if you have a particularly good range hood . Outside with the wok on a BBQ is probably best . Roast over a low heat and stir continuously . You want to get the beans as even as possible , trying not to burn them . The beans will continue to roast after taking them off the heat . So stop one or two roast levels before the desired colour and tip your beans out into a colander and continue stirring to cool . The residual heat will cook the bean some more . To aim for a desired roast level , compare the current roast colour to your desired roast colour and maybe to a roast level chart . Google image search " coffee roast level chart " . Guesstimate the roast level that is one or two levels below your desired colour to stop at . Once again there will be a lot of smoke .
Breads get their structure from glutens -- a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten . Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens -- I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around , this increases the odds of bindings occurring . Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions , so fats -- oils and butter -- definitely play a role in the texture control . It prevents the dough from getting too elastic , which controls texture . This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size . Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these , but trading off for a different flavor . Oil may play other roles , but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head . Yes , it does contribute to flavor as well .

Alternative for shake and bake ?
The way restaurants do it is simple , straightforward , and also very easy to make organic by using organic ingredients . Standard 3-bowl breading 1 ) Bowl One : Seasoned flour -- flour , salt , pepper , and seasonings ( for me : thyme , paprika , cayenne , garlic powder , onion powder , and parsley flakes ) 2 ) Bowl Two : Egg wash -- Beaten egg with a 1-2 TBSP milk per egg yolk added 3 ) Bowl Three : Panko ( or other bread crumbs ) -- alternately , add some salt , pepper , and seasonings to them Procedure : Dredge the item to bread through the bowls in order , then repeat if desired to build up a thicker layer . You only need to change your seasonings to switch from breading chicken , fish , or even doing fried green tomatoes . If you make your own bread and breadcrumbs , the ingredient list will read : flour , water , milk , eggs , yeast , salt , and spices . Hard to get more straightforward than that ! It 's simple , fast , and works beautifully every time . Here 's why it 's the best way : the flour sticks to the wet surface of your item , leaving a dry , starchy surface for the egg wash to adhere to . The egg wash allows the panko to stick . For the next layer , the flour fills in the gaps between bread crumbs and absorbs residual moisture from the egg wash .
To make sweetened condensed milk : The best make-your-own version is to mix 1 cup of evaporated milk with 1-1/4 cups of sugar in a saucepan , heat and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved , and let cool . If you do n't have evaporated milk on hand either , you can make your own by slowly simmering any quantity of milk in a pan until it reduced by 60 % , and then adding the sugar . Source : <URL> Another recipe that sounds like a lot more work and uses powdered milk : <URL>
Generally that sort of treatment is to get rid of any moisture the stone may have taken on during storage/handling -- if it were n't kept dry , there could be moisture deep in the stone that would not be an issue in normal home use . I would expect the instructions were also that you should put the stone in the cold oven then turn it on -- that would be the safest way to do the whole process , avoiding thermal shock , etc. . There might be some proprietary reason to do this also , but my vote goes to driving out deeply absorbed moisture .
You likely wo n't find a definitive answer out there , as there 's a range of times for the lentils . To summarize <URL> : Red , orange or yellow split lentils : 15 to 25 minutes Black beluga lentils : 20 to 25 minutes French du Puy lentils : 25 to 30 minutes Brown or green lentils : 30 to 40 minutes ... suggesting that you 'd need to add the brown lentils 15 minutes before the red lentils ... but you mentioned that you cook the red lentils for 25-30 minutes , suggesting that either you like them to fall apart , or you 're cooking over lower heat . If it 's lower heat , I 'd give the brown lentils a 20 minute head start . If that 's going to put a crimp in your timing , I 'd suggest starting the brown lentils in water ( or some flavorful liquid ) , and cooking for 15 minutes while you 're getting everything else together , then draining and adding them at the same time ( or shortly after ) the red lentils .
It depends on the artichoke 's size . The Birds Eye brand common in the US will take about half an hour at 475 & deg ; F ( I have never timed them , so it 's a guess ) . I just watch them until they start getting brown spots . If they are big , lower the temperature .
It sounds like it 's fermented , and more harmful bacteria or mold could definitely have grown without being visible . So it 's not safe , in that there 's definitely some risk . It 's hard to evaluate exactly how risky it is . It sounds like you 're already routinely taking risks by eating iffy food that 's not obviously rotten or moldy , so you certainly could choose to take that risk here . I 'd really advise against it , though . Remember , food poisoning is n't just about stomachaches . If you end up in the hospital , it 's going to cost you a lot more than a replacement jar of applesauce . As a side note , applesauce generally requires refrigeration . The jar you have almost certainly says " refrigerate after opening . " So it may not be a good choice for an egg substitute . You might want to look into actually shelf-stable substitutes . If applesauce is working for you , <URL> ( or chia ) or mashed banana might be good options . Flax and chia are totally shelf-stable , and while bananas do n't last forever you can at least buy them as you need them .
So I waited about 3 weeks because I was on vacation since I put my loaf in the freezer . Some notes on the dough structure The dough was fully proofed , but that meant that the structure very much resembled a cracker . It would be stiff until you broke into it , at which point it would break &amp; collapse into itself irreparably <URL> The dough was frozen into the container , so I waited about 1.5 hours for it to thaw out . That meant that the core of the dough was frozen while the outside was thawed <URL> Fortunately , the thawed dough was still just as moist as it had been went into the freezer I could not score the loaf because the interior was too frozen . The loaf therefore came out without any perforations in the top . This , along with the frozen interior , likely severely limited oven spring . I expected the non-frozen version of this loaf to have double the volume . <URL> The flavor is pretty bland , unfortunately . Overall , would not recommend unless in an emergency !
Quinoa . I only recently discovered it as part of doing P90X , and man , it 's so , so delicious . It 's kind of a nutty flavour that goes really well with sauces . It 's also pretty high in protein , which is good . Note that this is n't " no-carb " , though it is lower in carbs than rice . It 's important that you wash quinoa before you prepare it . Otherwise , it 's prepared in a very similar way , 2-1 water-to-quinoa , boiled and simmered .
The answer is almost certainly yes . The almost is because I have n't made pita bread this way - but I have seen chapati made on a skillet , and under the right conditions it will puff up , even into one big pocket - so pan cooking does n't specifically preclude that kind of development . Beyond the need for it to puff up into the pocket , I do n't imagine pan-cooking pita bread is that much different form other kinds of pan-cooked flat-breads . it looks like <URL> is preferred , since it can be heated very hot and has the thermal mass to hold the heat steady while the pitas are cooking - but I honestly expect you can make them with any skillet you have on hand . Stove-top pitas may be a touch drier , slightly <URL> ( and toasty-flavor ) than oven-baked pitas , because they 're in direct contact with the heat , instead of being cooked by radiant heat . You can press the surface gently with a clean towel to <URL> if it is n't forming quickly or fully enough for your tastes .
Broiling involves high heat coming from a source very close to the surface of the food . It is appropriate for thin food , or for adding color ( via caramelization/Maillard reaction ) to already ( or mostly ) cooked items . I could n't say what the temperature of the heating element itself is , but the resulting air temperature is usually upwards of 550 ˚ F ( 288 ˚ C ) . In baking , although the heating element is usually on one side or the other of the oven , * the idea is that heat is being transferred to the food more or less evenly from all sides . This is part of the reason thorough pre-heating is important -- to make the air in the box all the same temperature before the food goes in . There 's no real " default temperature " -- you use whatever will produce the desired results in your food . With lower heat , coming from all sides , baking will allow the interior of a thick piece of food to cook before the exterior has over-cooked . Putting cake batter under a broiler will likely result in a dried-out or burnt top , perhaps a layer of reasonably well-cooked cake , and a raw bottom . The heat simply wo n't transfer through the cake fast enough to allow the entire thing to cook . The appropriate technique for meat depends on the size of the meat . Steaks can do very well under a broiler -- the intense heat allows the exterior to brown and become flavorful without the interior over-cooking . A roast cut or a whole bird , on the other hand , would need to be baked ( or " roasted " ) so that the interior has time to come to the proper temperature . A very thick chop or steak might be started in the oven , then finished under the broiler to give it color . * Your oven probably has just the one heating element , used for both baking and broiling . There 's no reason that an oven could n't have multiple elements for baking -- and it might produce more even cooking -- but broiling always means heat from above .
My friend makes coconut crusts all the time and she bakes them at 350 degrees . But AllRecipes.com bakes their crust at 325 degrees for 15 minutes .
To achieve " done " pork ribs should reach an internal temp of 160 ° F ( 71ºC ) . The longer it takes to get there be more tender they will be . I would not recommend going any lower than 200 ° F ( 93ºC ) for your cooking temp , even if that means turning the heat up a little at the end to reach your internal temp of 160 ° F. Put a good rub on , wrap the racks of ribs ( individually ) in aluminum foil , with some beer or cola in there ( or other braising liquid ) and let them go . For a video of how to do this watch this episode of " <URL> " All of that said , I have never tried to let the ribs go 7 hours unattended , so I would try it when you have the time to hang around and monitor the internal temp , again looking for 160 ° F internal temp and that will give you a means to determine what is " done " .
Nothing else is going to taste like extra-virgin olive oil , but extra-virgin is n't necessary for cooking at all . As a matter of fact , the smoke point of extra-virgin olive oil is so low that it 's not often used for cooking . For cooking with olive oil , usually the choice would be " refined " or " pure " olive oil . Honestly , those do n't taste like much . So whatever neutral oil you usually use ( soybean , canola , peanut and vegetable are a few options ) will work just fine .
Your refrigerator should be set at a temperature below 4 Celsius . If it is n't , then you are exposing yourself to danger from eating the other things stored there . At this temperature , the cheesecake will keep perfectly without the icing deforming . Indeed , it will probably even keep well if the fridge temeprature is slightly high . Under no circumstances should you increase the temperature of your freezer . The cake risks texture change if it freezes . A freezer should always be kept below freezing , or else the other food stored in there will take large hits to both quality and safety .
You can make your own crème fraîche . Just inoculate heavy cream with buttermilk . From <URL> : Ingredients 1 to 2 tablespoons cultured buttermilk 2 cups heavy cream ( pasteurized , not ultra pasteurized or sterilized , and with no additives ) Instructions Combine the buttermilk and cream in a saucepan and heat only to tepid ( not more than 85F degrees on an instant reading thermometer ) . Pour into a clean glass jar . Partially cover and let stand at room temperature ( between 65F and 75F degrees ) for 8 to 24 hours , or until thickened . Stir and refrigerate at least 24 hours before using . The cream will keep about 2 weeks in the refrigerator . The results from doing that are so close to " real " crème fraîche that I ca n't tell the difference unless I 'm tasting them side by side . If you want absolute authenticity , you can order the <URL> , follow their instructions , then use that crème fraîche to culture many further batches of real Crème fraîche . EDIT : HA ! :) Here 's Kenji 's $ .02 on the subject : <URL>
From a food safety perspective , the most important thing is that you get your leftovers cooled as quickly as possible , so that they do n't spend too long in the <URL> . This can be tricky , because you essentially have to move from cooking temperatures to refrigerated temperatures within two hours ( generally less because the time is cumulative , and includes time that the ingredients spent in the danger zone before you cooked them ) . Here 's what I do at home : Separate into smaller portions . For me , this usually means individual servings , but you can package 2-3 servings together ; the point is to avoid having a single large mass of food . I do this for a couple of reasons . First , it makes reheating convenient ; rather than heating up more portions than you 're going to be eating , or scooping out a single portion for separate reheating ( dirtying some extra dishware in the process ) you can simply grab as many portions as desired and go . Second , by separating the portions you are increasing their surface area , and therefore how quickly they will cool ( another reason I like individual servings is that it maximizes this effect ) . This is a basic trick from my restaurant days ; experienced professional cooks will know that to cool a large batch of soup safely , you need to either get the whole thing into an ice bath , or break it down into smaller portions . ( A thrifty tip here : you can use dedicated plastic or Pyrex food storage containers , but commercial containers are cheap and effective as well . There are all kinds of <URL> and <URL> containers intended for food service that are microwave-safe and which can be safely cleaned in the dishwasher . You 'll often have to buy them in bulk , but per piece they 're very inexpensive , they tend to stack very well , and if you 're lucky you can find a decent local takeaway or delivery place that uses them instead of styrofoam . Save whatever you get , wash them , and reuse . It 's possible to ruin these with excessive heat , but they 're so cheap that it 's not too much of a loss . ) Allow to cool on the counter , uncovered , for 10-20 minutes . The goal here is simply to let steam escape ; water carries a lot of thermal energy with it ( which is why you can easily burn yourself over a pot of boiling water ) and letting it get away will cool your food rapidly . The portions do n't need to cool completely at this point ; if they 're warm but no longer actively steaming , that 's fine . Put the portions in the refrigerator . As @Jefromi notes in comments , <URL> , and a lower external temperature will help your portions cool quickly and safely . Where possible , it 's ideal to leave these uncovered and spread out into a single layer so that they will cool quickly . Quite honestly , this is n't always practical , so if you need to cover and stack the portions due to space constraints , cool them a little longer on the counter before putting them into the fridge . Freeze the portions if you 'll be storing them for more than a couple of days . <URL> ; if you need to keep them beyond that , the freezer is your friend . This does n't work well for everything , but hearty foods like pastas will often freeze reasonably well . Reheat thoroughly in the microwave . For all that serious cooks might discount the microwave , it 's a very effective and efficient reheating device . ( Especially if you follow my advice about using microwave-safe plastic containers ; if you use something like Pyrex that 's oven-safe , you could certainly use that too . ) Make sure you heat everything so that it 's evenly hot ; this may mean stirring a couple of times . Overall , it 's most definitely possible to safely store leftovers , so long as you cool them quickly and reheat them thoroughly . Not only that , but I heartily endorse the practice . Leftovers can be practical , tasty , and a serious time saver . There 's no reason to be paranoid about them if you embrace a few simple rules .

The difference between red wines and white wines are that red wines are fermented with some of the skins , while white wines are not . Tannins come from the skins , and make people 's mouth feel dry , hence more tannins mean a wine is called dry . So you can not have a low tannin dry wine , as dry means tannic by definition . Much of a wine 's characteristics come from the properties of the earth , water , and climate that the grapes are grown in ( the french call the sum of these characteristics terroir ) , so you can get a dry wine from most grapes depending these factors . However , some grapes produce less tannic skins , and therefore overall produce less tannic , ie fruitier wines . Common fruitier red varieties are pinot noir , garancha ( granache ) , primitivo ( Zinfandel ) , and pinotage . All these varieties should be available in US supermarkets . If you can find an Oregon pinot noir then that would be my choice , they are very good value and great tasting wines . California zinfandel used to be considered cheap plonk ( because it was ) , but lately has had a resurgence and there are some fantastic wines from this grape .
Flaky pie pastry works beautifully for quiche . You can improve the texture with two techniques . The first is " blind-baking , " or a partial pre-bake to toast the crust lightly . The other is to brush a wash of egg white onto the crust before blind-baking .
I 'd avoid the whole reheating issue altogether and simply keep the uncooked pie in the fridge , covered in plastic wrap , then bake it as normal when ready . The only issue you might have is if your filling is very runny , in which case you could par-bake it a little before filling to help it ' seal ' .

How to remove commercial seasoning from skillet ?
How to remove old seasoning and start over from scratch ? Very few cases actually require a full stripping of cast iron and restarting your seasoning from scratch . If you ruined your seasoning somehow , it can usually just be fixed by scrubbing and baking on a fresh layer of oil or two . However here are a few real reasons : 1 ) The pan is new , and you do n't trust the manufacturer 's pre-seasoning for whatever reason , is it really food grade , is it clean is it toxic , is it ... whatever ... 2 ) you got your cast iron from an antique store or other source where the seasoning is just unknown or otherwise not trustworthy ( IOW , is that black paint ? ) , same as # 1 , just not a brand new pan . 3 ) you are a purist and want to manage every layer of the seasoning from how the iron is treated prior to being coated with oil , or which choice of oil and how many coats to season with before the pan goes into production . To begin , first you really want to scrub the heck out of your pan to break off loose dirt , burned food and anything that will just come free with a scotch brite . The next step does the real cleaning , but scrubbing off whatever you can first will reduce the amount of smell and smoke . if you have a number of pans you want to strip , it might be best to have a few of them ready to go at once to save your time . This is a time consuming process . After you have scrubbed your pans clean , put them in your oven , and run the the oven through a clean cycel . At minimum thise should be two hours , but many ovens let you run it 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 hours . Depending on how hot your own gets during cleaning , 2 hours may not be enough , I personally run a 4 or 6 hour cleaning cycle . Do NOT leave your home during an oven cleaning cycle . The temperature of your oven will exceed 800 Degreed F . These temps are more than twice as hot as ordinary cooking temps , and you should never leave your house with the oven on anyway , but the cleaning cycle should absolutely never be left unattended . The heat will burn everything off of your pan , once the oven has had a chance to cool off and you are able to look inside you will see your cast iron has turned a much brighter but dull grey . This is the natural color of iron when it is bare . As the iron cools , it will start to turn orange . That is caused from the iron oxidizing a fine layer of rust on it 's surface , a process that is accelerated by the iron being so hot and exposed to cool air as it cools . Once the pan is cool enough to pick up with your base hands , we are going to return to the sink , and we are going to scrub the rust away with a new clean scotch brite pad . Turn the oven on and set to 385 degrees F. Becareful , in contrast to seasoned cast iron , bare cast iron is VERY abrasive , and you can skin your knuckles if you are n't careful . Rinse it very well again , toss back into the oven and let the heat drive away the moisture . This time , because you are n't leaving the pan in their to get to full heat , it wo n't reoxidize so quickly . While it 's hot , grab a clean unused dishtowel fresh from your laundry stack , and pickup the pan and put on your stove . Pour about a tablespoon or two of your favorite seasoning oil or fat . Despite what the science says , it doesn ; t matter so much which one you choose . This is not because there is no difference . There IS a big difference , but from a practical standpoint , unless you are super super careful , you are going to ruin your seasoning from time to time and will have to fix it . So going with the super expensive flax seed oil really does n't make any difference from a practicality point of view . I prefer Peanut Oil . It has a high smoke point , which means I can bake it on longer/hotter , making it more durable than other lower smoke point oils . Flaxseed oil is actually the most durable during the way the polymers develop along with the smoking , but again it does n't matter for practical purposes because you will ruin it now and again . So I use a durable high smoke point oil that 's cheaper . Peanut Oil . With a paper towel folded over a few times until it 's 2 inches x 2 inches , start smoothing that oil all around the inside of the pan . Once the paper towel has taken up all the oil and spread it around the inside , flip the pan over and coat the entire outside of the pan . Take special care to get oil into all the cracks , and dimples , and rings , and especially inside the eye of the handle . Get under and inside the front guard that lets you stack your pans . You want to make sure there is not one tiny iota of the pan left dry . Do n't worry if the paper towel starts to break apart and leave lint behind . It makes no difference whatsoever . Done ? Good . Now grab a fresh dry paper towel and remove all the oil , make it so the metal looks dry . If you touch it and you can feel the oil , then it 's too much . Get it all off . Once that 's done , place a large cookie sheet on the bottom rack of your oven to catch drips ... do not use aluminum foil as is often recommended , you 'll regret that decision
MSG is the primary ingredient in Accent . The full ingredient list for Accent " original flavor " is as follows : Monosodium Glutamate , Salt , Chili Pepper , Tricalcium Phosphate ( As Anticaking Agent ) , Spice ( Cumin , Oregano ) , Paprika Extractives ( color ) , Garlic Extractives , Onion Extractives , Yellow No. 6 Lake , Yellow No. 5 Lake .
Standard tips for browning/frying/grilling tofu ; Ensure that you press the tofu sufficiently to remove its own moisture , marinate if desired Lightly dust with flour Brush oil on the grilling surface The same advice applies for pan frying . I prefer to work at a high temperature , others have had very good results using only medium . Use a very thin , flat metal spatula to turn . Specific to the case of grilling , be mindful of the gap the tofu will stretch across on the grate ; it may be crumbling because it is n't strong enough or thick enough to sustain wide gaps . Additionally you can pre-bake the tofu to dry it out further . I have heard tell that salting lightly with finely ground sea salt helps prevent sticking but have no experience with this , and have had good results without the added sodium . Typically the moisture in the surface of the bean curd is causing the sticking . Prevent or inhibit this and you should be good .
There 'll be a lot of variation depending on temperature , humidity , the exact nature of the jam , and pure dumb luck , but I would n't be surprised if it started growing mold within a week , if not within a day or two . When things say to refrigerate after opening , they tend to mean it .
You can add quite a lot of tomato paste/puree but this will mask the fresh flavour of your tomatoes . I think I 'd just reduce the soup down once it was made or add carrots . Carrot flavour really complements tomato soup and many tomato soups recipes require carrots . The starch will then help you thicken the soup .
Cooking is not as effective at removing alcohol as many people think ; the alcohol and water evaporate or boil together . At a simmer , it might only take 10-15 minutes to get rid of half of the alcohol , but getting rid of 90 % of it takes more like two hours . See this <URL> for more detail . In any case , a microwave can certainly simmer or boil liquids , and the alcohol/water evaporation does n't care about what equipment you used to cook it , so you certainly could do use a microwave to reduce the amount of alcohol in wine . However , it does n't give you nearly as much control as a stove ; even if you use a reduced power , it 'll tend to boil on and off as it cycles the power . And microwaving for extended time periods is a pretty awkward method . So in general , I 'd suggest doing this kind of thing with conventional cooking methods , especially if it 's as part of a dish . You can use the cooking time of a stew to help reduce the alcohol , for example . And even if you want to remove more alcohol than the cooking time of your dish permits , a pot on the stove gives you much better control .
Yes , you do n't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things , but it also means that you do n't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink , which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans , as they 'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly ( at least , compared to something of the same material , such as a cast iron skillet ) More importantly , in my opinion , is that without the sides , you do n't hold in moist air , so when cooking things like hash browns , you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them .
My first instinct was no way , remembering that the branches and leaves contain a high amount of <URL> , which is a neurotoxin and not without risks , especially if used over a long time or while pregnant . This is the same stuff that caused absinthe to be discredited for decades . But Thuja oils typically contain 40 % α-thujon , sage ( salvia officinalis ) up to 60 % . Thuja 's pungent smell would prevent ingesting too much . So my conclusion would be : do not use for a long time or when pregnant ( most midwives caution against using sage , too , btw . ) use sparingly for health reasons , a limited amount is considered safe by health agencies world wide , <URL> for example . use very sparingly for culinary reasons , because the taste is quite " pronounced " . I had to take a herbal medicine with thuja decades ago and still shudder to think of it . ( It did work , though ... ) When thinking of potential culinary uses , think of uses for sage or juniper - you will want to use it as a spice in foods that can " handle " the woody , bitter tinge . Dark red meat or even game perhaps ? Complement with a generous amount of pepper and perhaps a good red wine . Another approach that might be worth a try is sweetening it up - like " fir syrup " ( is this known in American cuisine ? ) .
Skillets are not designed to hold much liquid ; as you point out , the curved sides are optimized for easy flipping and turning ( i.e. with a spatula ) . They also normally do not come with lids ; I 'm sure there are some out there , but even my All-Clad skillets did n't . You can really only use a skillet for high-heat searing or frying due to their low profile . Do n't bother trying to poach or even shallow-fry in one . Sauté pans , on the other hand , have more height , and usually do come with lids . They 're a little heavier , and do n't make it as easy to turn , but they can also be used for shallow-frying and moist-heat cooking methods like braising or poaching . I 've seen people make sauce or chili in sauté pans as well ; sometimes they 're more convenient if you 're only going to make a small quantity , since the large exposed surface area ( relative to a saucepan ) makes it easier to reduce sauces . It 's a no-brainer if your recipe starts out with sautéing garlic , onions , vegetables , etc. , and then has you adding the liquid ingredients ; if you have a large enough sauté pan then you do n't need to bother transferring to a saucepan afterward . I think you 've got it backwards ; of the two options , a sauté pan is definitely the more versatile option . I use both , but if I only had the space or budget for one , I 'd choose the sauté pan , because it can do everything a skillet can do ( just not quite as well ) and many more things a skillet is useless for . A skillet is really only necessary for people who do a lot of pan-searing . Note that as commenter Owen suggests , there are " French skillets " sold which have higher bases ; these are not really skillets , and are not normally sold with lids , but assuming you can find or improvise one , they would make semi-decent multi-taskers . I maintain that cast-iron skillets , while taller , are not nearly as versatile due to their reactive material and weight - I only ever use mine for searing/grilling .
The only number I 've ever heard was 4-6 teaspoons of salt per gallon of water , but that 's just something a friend told me , they might 've made it up . I 've never actually seen any bugs on broccoli - organic or otherwise - so when I wash it I usually just shake in about 1/2 tsp into the bowl . EDIT : <URL>
The biggest thing you can do is peel it . If a cucumber 's bitter , it 's much more in the peel than in the flesh . It 's also usually more bitter at the stem end , so you might want to start from the other end , and possibly ultimately discard an inch from the stem end if it really is too bitter for you . Unless you 're unusually sensitive to the bitterness , that ought to cover it . Bitterness is also fairly variable from cucumber to cucumber , so it 's possible that you could shop for less bitter ones - maybe a different variety - or buy them only during more favorable seasons .
You can not find the correct final internal temperature for a whole duck , because it does n't exist . If you stop the cooking when the white meat is tender , you 'll have very tough red meat . If you cook until the collagen is melted , you 'll get very tough white meat . With whole birds , it is more popular to go the collagen route . Especially a duck , with its darker meat overall and sufficient fat in the breast area to insulate the breast meat during smoking and then lubricate it , is a very good candidate for it . To melt the collagen , wait until the duck thigh has gone up to 70 Celsius ( 160 Fahrenheit ) and from then on smoke for 2-4 hours . In this case , the lower part of the range ( 2 hours ) is probably better , to have a chance of a little bit of juiciness to remain in the breast .
Texture is the main reason , but if you 're going to be blending the sauce , there can be off-flavors from cracking open the seeds . Even if you do n't blend it , they can be these slippery little things that I never much liked growing up . To reduce the amount of waste , you can : cook the sauce , then put it through a food mill to strip out the seeds and skins , thus keeping you from wasting the gel around the seeds . freeze the peeled skins , to save for when you 're next going to be making vegetable stock . collect the seeds and gel , then put it into a muslin bag and hang to let drip to extract ' tomato water ' . ( you typically use crushed tomatoes for this ... I do n't know for sure if the gel will go through the muslin ) . Tomato water is strange as it gives good tomato flavor , without the red color .
I have n't tried this before but I found <URL> that shows you how . Cut into the mango , starting where the stem was and going around the long way , just in to the pit . Reach in with a spoon and scoop around the pit , separating one half of the mango from the pit . Then scoop the pit out of the other side .
After washing them , fill them with a mild bleach solution ( one tablespoon for each cup of water ) and let them out in the sun exposing the stain for a whole day . Make sure children and animals can not reach the containers with bleach . There used to be a product called Cascade Plastic Booster that you could add to your dishwasher that would remove the stains . It 's no longer sold but its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide at 5 % , which you may buy in most drugstores .
If it 's properly seasoned , and affixed well to the pan , there should n't be any problem . In fact , it 's what I typically use to <URL> even if I 'm not making a sauce . If you 're reducing a sauce that 's highly acidic , you might have cause for concern , as you do n't want to have acids in the pan for long periods .
Topside is quite a tough cut , so I 'd tend towards a longer cooking time ; as ' low and slow ' as possible , really . With other meats , escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts , like chicken breast or pork tenderloin , which would be cooked relatively quickly , so I 'm surprised your recipes call for topside .
I do n't think you will hurt the pan , cast iron skillets can take a lot of heat . I think the biggest risk is that you are building a kind of dangerous tower . If you were to somehow knock it over you could hurt yourself badly .
If you have raw milk and let it sit , the cream will indeed rise to the top . To separate , you can just wait and skim off the cream as you did . However , if you store the raw milk in the refrigerator , it will take longer for the cream to rise . Perhaps that is why you are having difficulties . Alternatively , you can use a spigot jar to drain the " skimmed " milk from the raw milk , leaving the cream behind . I think you end up with about 1/10th of your raw milk that is cream .
One thing we have found that helps in adding flavor during the steaming process is to slice garlic thinly , and line the bottom of the steamer basket with the garlic . Then afterwards , toss the garlic in with the potatoes and add salt/pepper/etc . ( I 'd probably add paprika , onion powder , and a pinch of cayenne . ) I would imagine orange or lemon peel might work the same as garlic when steamed , although you might get better results tossing the steamed veggies with some zest . You can also toss the steamed potatoes with vinegar or lemon juice ( whether or not it 's combined with oil is up to you ) along with the spices . Another option would be to bake your potatoes rather than steam them . Just wash , poke , and bake at 350F for 1 hour . There 's no more fat , but the flavor and texture are VERY different . Just make sure not to wrap them in foil , since you wo n't get the same results . ( Wrapping potatoes in foil is essentially steaming them , and the crust wo n't get crisp . )

What is Black Vinegar ?
Black Vinegar is basically what it 's called , and has a smoky and mellow flavor . It is made from rice , sometimes from glutinous rice and is sometimes used as a full-flavored but much cheaper balsamic vinegar . Hope this helps ! :)
When I was a kid , we used to run over them with the car . Put a bunch in the driveway and drive over them so they got a single pass from a tire . That usually crushed a few beyond help , but just split the majority open nicely . They were still a lot of trouble to pick from the hulls , and ultimately not very nice to eat , IMO .
Poolish is a type of <URL> . You prepare it before mixing your dough . As in 16 hours before . Then , you mix it with the rest of the ingredients . What I usually do is mix 150g of flour and 150g of water with a pinch of yeast ( less than 1g ) and no salt at all the night before the day I 'm going to use it . The idea is to use the same amount , in weight , of flour and water , and the least amount possible of yeast and let it work as slow as possible . This will depend on many factors . I 'm giving you my quantities , but it changes from winter to summer , you will have to experiment . That 's half of the fun . For the mixing I use a fork and a 1 litter/quarter container and 30 seconds of work , it should n't take you more . The poolish usually gets almost to the top in 14-18 hours . Once I put 5g of yeast and got to the top in 1 hour . This is not bad but defies the purpose of the poolish taking a lot of time . Some people even put in the refrigerator to make it take longer . Why would you want it to take time ? This is what I was told and makes sense to me : when you mix water , flour and yeast two things happen : the yeast transform the sugars and some good bacteria starts creating acids that will determine flavour . The yeast work depends on the temperature and amount of yeast ( among other things , like water , salt , fat , etc ) . The bacteria does n't . Also , the bacteria and the acids help preserve the bread . Once it has reached the top you have 1 hour approx to use it . If not , it will collapse and you better start with a new one . If you think you are not going to use it in 1 hour , use a fork to degass it before it collapses and let it rise again . It will rise faster this time , but that will buy you some time . You can <URL> If you have a recipe you like , try replacing 150g flour and 150g water with the poolish and see what happens . You may replace between 10 % and 50 % of the final dough . You 'll see changes in color and flavor .
Throw them away . I would not expect potatoes to go black in the dehydration process , and although they may be safe to eat I would not expect them to be palatable , or inviting in any way . You can not be sure they are n't toxic , and you would n't put them on a guest 's plate , so chuck them .
I do n't remember the exact science behind the potatoes not turning to mush ... I know it was discussed on an episode of America 's Test Kitchen , and they even discussed the amount of vinegar and how it affected the window for cooking times . ( I want to say it was on an episode where they were making an Austrian potato salad ) ... and it 's not specifically vinegar , and not solely potatoes . Acids will stop quite a few items from softening when cooking . I know the list inclues onions ( pre-cook onions before adding acids if you want them to disolve into a sauce ) , potatoes , apples ... I 'm guessing there 's others . For potatoes and apples , most recipes claim it 's to slow down browning . You see it in potato salad , but not mashed potatoes . You 'll see it in apple pies , but not in applesauce ... because they 'll come out lumpy . Matt already mentioned three uses for vingear : as half of a chemical leavener tenderizing / marinades preservation / picking coagulation ( eg , when poaching eggs ) But also : stabalizing eggwhite foams ( might just be a variation of coagulation ? ) denaturing / " cooking " ( eg . in the case of ceviche ; a variation of marinating ? ) flavor ( might not be a ' science case ' ... but sour is one of the primary tastes ; especially helps to balance out fatty dishes ) cleaning / disinfection ( might not be a ' cooking ' use )
Golden Syrup improves with age according to Heston Blumenthal 's " In Search of Perfection " . Here he analyses a 70 year old glass jar of Tate and Lyle Gold in the lab finding that the " older treacle contained the same flavour compounds as the normal stuff , but each was intensified " . In his recipe he fakes the ageing process by baking the tin at 70ºC ( 158ºF ) for 24 hours noting that the flavour will continue to improve up to 100 hours .
It 's an indication that the fruit has started to rot : When dark spots start appearing on the side of a mango , it 's starting to rot . A mango can rot from the pit , the skin , or from the non-stem end . Any black fibers also indicate that the fruit has started to rot , and at that point , you need to toss it into the trash . From : <URL> Edit : Yes , the above is probably being overcautious in stating " any black fibers ? → trash ! " It 's from a " Dummies " book after all . ;) I could n't really find another good reference . But I 'm sure you can make the distinction between a piece of fruit that has a small brown spot and one that 's black and shriveled . Still , the color of the fibers is a result of the late ripening/rotting process of the mango , rather than a result of an earlier stage in its growth . But having eaten this mango with the one , tiny black fiber shown in her picture , I do n't really expect to read Mien 's obituary on this site tomorrow . ;)
A traditional Manhattan is two shots of rye or bourbon , one shot of sweet vermouth , a dash of bitters and a cherry , shaken and strained into a martini glass . I prefer on the rocks in a rocks glass , myself . A perfect Manhattan is similar , but uses a half shot each of sweet and dry vermouth . They tend to be more interesting when paired with a higher quality whiskey . I 'm also a big fan of <URL> ( aka , high quality moonshine ) in Manhattans .
Olives are basically cured in salt , so they will last a very long time . They will last even longer if kept in an air-sealed container in a refrigerator . They will last even longer than that if kept in a salty brine which covers them with liquid and minimizes exposure to air .
When carrots turn black , it is almost always caused by rot . I would definitely not eat them .
Sourdough bread is bread that has been all or partially risen with the help of wild yeast . It is made sour because of wild lactobacilli that are picked up with the wild yeast . Where the yeast eat sugar and produce CO2 for rising - the bacteria create acid and other compounds that make the bread sour and distinctly flavored . Because of the wild nature of the microbes , the bread will taste a little different in every place that it is made . The lactobacillus that gives San Fransisco sourdough bread its characteristic flavor is actually named Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis . The starter can be a hassle to make and to keep . It requires almost daily attention to feed it and can waste a fair amount of flour unless you bake bread frequently . You can freeze the starter but it will require a few days of feeding before it can be used again . Many baked recipes besides bread are also delicious with sourdough starter . Sourdough waffles or coffeecake are fantastic . Whether it is worth the effort is a personal decision . Many people do n't like the flavor and you would have to love the flavor enough to make almost every bread with that flavor to justify the starter upkeep . Personally - I used to keep a starter but my kids do n't like the flavor and I got tired of all my bread tasting the same . I just buy a loaf for the 2-3 times a year that I am craving a Reuben sandwich .
Whole leaf black tea is available , but because it has to be processed by hand it is expensive . Twinings whole leaf black tea is roughly 50 cents per teabag as opposed to the equivalent processed tea bags at about 8 cents . To make black tea , the leaves are wilted and processed by various methods - none of the mechanical methods will produce whole leaf tea .
Open it up . If it 's soft and pale brown or darker inside too , it 's overripe and no longer good for eating straight ; however , it can be used in baking , banana bread , or smoothies . Once it 's black , the banana is garbage .
According to a quick search on Google , there are two other types of vinegar served in fish and chips shops along with malt vinegar . The first ( and my best guess ) is onion vinegar -- which is white vinegar that has been used to <URL> . This is clear , but at minimum contains onions and salt , and perhaps sugar and other pickling spices . ( I should note that the recipe I linked to uses malt vinegar to pickle the onions , but you could certainly achieve the same result with white vinegar . ) The second vinegar is actually called non brewed condiment , and is n't actually vinegar . It 's ascetic acid , water , and a bit of caramel coloring . The coloring would make it brown , but it would n't have the malt flavor .
Despite the fashion of using " processed " as if it is a derogatory term , and processed foods are dangerous , almost all foods are processed in some way ( s ) . Most of us , for example , do not chew wheat berries directly off the stalks , but prefer them threshed , hulled , ground into flour , and then baked into breads or other foods . What is that , if not processing ? Of course , cooking itself is a form of processing , since most of us no longer eat our meat raw from the carcass . There are a number of common ways that meat is processed , after being butchered , some of which are more extreme than others . Some foods have several of these processes applied . Among the more common are : Cooking Grinding ( as in hamburger , and many sausages ) Curing with salt or other curing agents ( as in bacon ) Canning ( as in the infamous Spam , or Vienna sausages ) Drying or dehydrating ( jerky ) Pickling ( pickled pigs feet ) Smoking ( which is often combined with curing , cooking , or drying , such as Virginia ham ) Freezing Injection of brine or other flavorings or enhancements ( many ham products ) I do n't think there is any universal measure by which you can consider processing good or bad . You have to consider each within the context of the particular food product , and its outcome .
Rice wine vinegar and rice vinegar are the same thing , so that 's easy . For additional pantry-stocking : Seasoned rice vinegar is just rice vinegar with a little salt &amp; sugar added . It 's intended to be the right mixture for a number of recipes , not the least of which is sushi rice , although in my experience you 're better off seasoning plain rice vinegar to the correct balance . Rice wine is , of course , sake . Generally if you 're cooking with rice wine you want a moderately priced , clear filtered sake like Gekkeikan . The same advice about cooking with regular wine applies here ; do n't try to cook with anything undrinkable . Mirin is a specific kind of light , sweet rice wine used in braised dishes , dipping sauces , steamed fish , etc. . If you ca n't find it , buy a drinkable sake and add around two teaspoons of sugar per 1/4 cup of sake .
Vinegar would n't be harmful . The resulting reaction would create a ferrous salt which would be easily washed away . However , it was probably the vinegar and other acids in your food that cause the rust in the first place . Steel items stored in a acidic environment rust faster than those in plain water . Washing and storing dry is the best way to prevent rust .
Generally , slow-cooking means any food preparation method which relies on using low-heat for a long amount of time . Barbecues , smokers , luau pits , and low-heat ovens could all qualify . The benefit of slow-cooking , generally , is that food becomes incredibly tender , as all of its connective tissues break down . Also , flavor can infuse over time and provide deeper results than with virtually any other method . Lastly , long-cooking times create a celebratory atmosphere where food is the focal point of a social gathering . Specifically , slow-cooking refers to the ' slow-cooker ' a counter-top set-up which has a large , electronically heated ceramic bowl and a glass lid . It usually has only a few settings , such as ' low ' , ' medium ' , and ' high ' . The benefit of slow-cooking in a slow-cooker is mainly convenience . These units are safe enough to turn on before work and return to before dinner , with fully-cooked , piping hot food ready to go . The slow-cooker is geared towards ' one-pot ' recipes , which means they require minimal food preparation . You simply cut up the ingredients in fairly large chunks , add seasoning , and liquid , and that 's it . They are a favorite of working parents , but increasingly , also a device for more advanced experimentation .
In the US the closest thing you could ( easily ) get would be " <URL> " though this is n't quite correct since chitterlings are the small intestine , and tripa gorda is the large intestine .
The advantage would be cutting some sodium out of your diet . If you are like many in the western part of the world , you probably get more than your daily allotment of sodium regularly . By making sure to cut sodium where you can , you gain the health benefits of a well-balanced diet . Since salt is a flavor enhancer , a low-sodium diet can often seem bland . Many look for alternatives . Vinegar brings out flavors in a different way and adds a significant flavor of its own . I 'd start small , using just a bit of vinegar .

Are there food combinations that are dangerous ?
Basically everything at all normal is safe . There is a mushroom that gets toxic if combined with alcohol , but alcohol itself is n't 100 % safe and if you 're gathering wild mushrooms you need to be safety conscious , so it 's not really something you could run into by accident or with storebought ingredients . Relevant paragraph from <URL> Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a " disulfiram syndrome " . This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century . Symptoms include facial reddening , nausea , vomiting , malaise , agitation , palpitations and tingling in limbs , and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol . If no more alcohol is consumed , they will generally subside over two or three hours . Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed , becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dL , and prominent at concentrations of 50 -- 100 mg/dL . Disulfiram has , however , been known to cause myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms , although they are milder as more time passes . Rarely , a cardiac arrhythmia , such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia , may develop .
Toasted almonds match well with hazelnuts , cumin , nutmeg , rosemary , vanilla and cinnamon . Cranberries do match well with garlic , lime , chili and onion . So from a flavor-pairing point of view , if you want a spicy dip , it would be better to make a cranberry dip in itself with cranberries , sugar , chili , pineapple and coriander , like a chutney . Mustard is a gamble . Cranberries do match well with some acidity , like lime or pineapples . I would be worried about the vinegar to be too stingy . If it 's a garlic-based dip , I would focus on garlic , onions , rosemary and cumin .
One trend I 've seen recently is making tea broths/sauces for meats , fishes , etc. . . Besides being a good use for tea , this has the double effect of giving off the tea 's natural aroma when presented to the eater as opposed to simply using the tea to crust a meat - where you would n't really get any tea flavor until you actually bit in . I 've also seen people smoking meats with tea leaves and such . I have n't tried this myself to see if the results are worth the trouble ( aka - if you can actually taste the tea flavor ) . I would also try poaching various items in a matcha tea poaching liquid . For example : Water Sugar + salt Matcha tea powder Peppercorns Bay leaves Whatever else sounds good to you . You could use this to poach chicken and fish . Lastly , do n't be afraid to add it to soups ! Carrot-ginger soup would benefit from the addition of some matcha powder .
Wash the shrimp and remove only the head . Insert a bamboo skewer along the shrimp from head to tail , running along the legs without touching flesh Drop into boiling , salted water for 3-5 minutes ( do not put a lid on ) ; after this period , they 'll change color and rise to the top . If they feel firm , they are cooked . Quickly place them into ice water , which helps them have good color and stops the flesh from shrinking and becoming hard . When shrimp are cold , remove from ice water and drain in a colander . To remove the skewer , use a screwing motion . For nigiri-sushi : Remove shell from around body , but not the tail . Butterfly cut open , cutting from head to tail along the belly with the knife only going halfway in . Use the knife or your fingers to open it up and flatten it carefully , without further breaking the flesh . Remove vein and rinse with lightly salted water . Lay on papertowels to drain . If using for sushi rolls , remove tail and cut in half lengthwise .
According to <URL> , industrial and food grade CO2 generally come from the same plants : The slight difference between industrial-grade CO2 and food-grade CO2 is the type of tests that are done to qualify CO2 as beverage or beer gas-grade compared to industrial-grade . Currently , the FDA 's requirement for food-grade CO2 a 99.90 % purity rating . The other .09 % is made up of impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . Industrial grade CO2 is 99 % pure CO2 , also containing impurities such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen . However , the nature of those impurities extremely important . They go on to suggest : One impurity that all homebrewers should be aware of is benzene . Benzene is a no-no for homebrewers . If the CO2 that you are purchasing has high benzene levels , it will leave you and fellow drinkers with terrible headaches . When I say high levels , we are not talking about much . Benzene is usually an impurity that is referred to in PPB . The benzene level should be around 20 PPB . They suggest you ask for a profile of the impurities , although I suspect that Dick 's will be unable to comply . You will have to assess your own tolerance for risk , but you may better off seeking a more appropriate local vendor .
You can use any neutral flavored oil , such as vegetable or canola oil . You can also use butter , but you may have to adjust for the amount of water present in the butter ( about 20 % ) , unless you 're using clarified butter which is a 1:1 substitution .
I 'm a coeliac from Australia and so my tips come from my experience here , but they should hopefully be useful regardless . The first thing I suggest is joining your local society which can be invaluable in terms of support , information and even training . The training covers for example how to read ingredient lists to determine whether something is gluten free by ingredient . As a general rule you need to avoid products containing [ wheat , barley , rye , malts and triticale ] [ 1 ] . There are a few exceptions such as glucose syrup , caramel colour and dextrose derived from wheat where the ingredients are so highly processed that they contain no detectable [ gluten ] [ 2 ] . Cross contamination and hidden sources of gluten can make it hard to ensure a gluten free diet . In my experience the hardest replacements are the bread based ones . They generally do not come close to the texture and taste of traditional breads . Baking your own bread may be the best option using gluten free bread mixes . Eating out can become a bit of chore because many restaurants use gluten containing products such as sauces and fillers . I recommend contacting the restaurant beforehand . The following products are some of the better gluten free alternatives I 've found ( could n't post links because I do n't have enough rep ) : Zehnder Bread San Remo Pasta BuonTempo Pasta Schar Products Neumarkter Lammsbräu beer References : [ 1 ] <URL> [ 2 ] <URL>
Probably generated some <URL> by reaction between the hot bleach and proteins on the stove surfaces . There 's no telling exactly which chloramines you created , as we have no idea what amines were on your stove top . However , <URL> . Open windows if possible , and leave home for several hours . Your eyes and lungs are giving you important warnings . Heed them .
To some extent , this is a question to which the answers are necessarily quite subjective . However , as a general guideline , I would suggest that you look at the bread as just another ingredient in the dish -- not as somehow distinct from the filling choices . Like any other ingredient pairing , you can evaluate the characteristics and choose things to complement each other . So if you pick your bread first , evaluate if it 's rich or mild , savoury or sweet , dense or light , crusty or soft , thin or thick , etc , and then choose fillings to complement those properties . For your fillings , there 's not only the flavour pairing of the filling and the bread to consider , but also the texture/properties of the filling . A dry filling might not be as pleasant on a dense bread because the texture would be too much the same . Similarly , a saucy filling needs an appropriate bread selection to contain it and make it easy to eat . Many pairings that are considered standard will just taste " good " to us because of tradition and familiarity , but originally , someone probably put them together for a reason . That does n't mean it 's not worth trying something different , though . With the globalization of cuisine , we have many more filling/bread choices available and you might find a new favourite by pairing a bread from one culture with a filling from another , based on their complementary qualities .
The best resource I 've seen is here at <URL> . Egg yolk produces a shiny and dark look but remains soft . Egg white is still soft but less shiny . Milk and water only darken it slightly and produce what the article calls a ' satin ' look . Butter makes it shiny , smooth , rich , and well , buttery !
Have you tried using a candy thermometer and testing the jam when it 's at 220 ° F ? An alternative to the method that you use is to use a spoon and do the ' two drop test ' . If you dip a cold metal spoon into your jam mix and then lift it . When the mixture is only just boiling it will drip off and be light . As the mixture continues to heat the drops that fall from the spoon will be heavier When the two drops form and fall off the spoon it should be ready . I 'll be honest though I much prefer the method you use and this is just an alternative .
The generic term for sugar-water pastes used to decorate food is <URL> . Rollfondant sounds like ready-to-roll icing , but it could be <URL> , which contains egg white . Modellierfondant sounds like modelling paste . There are various recipes which use different additives to the core ingredients of sugar and water in order to obtain a suitable consistency and to dry without cracking .
Any knife that has a symetrical blade profile should be ambidexterous in use . Santoku and chef knives typically come with a symmetrical profile1 , so you should be able to get a decent choice , whichever of the types you finally choose . Whether you chose a V-shaped or double-bevel , a hollow cut or a convex blade is ultimately up to you , your intended uses and your honing skills . Some knifes feature an asymmetrical edge , but as these are often intended for special uses and for left - or righthanded use ( depending on the orientation of the sides ) , a good manufacturer should point this out . If in doubt , either ask your sales person or simply look closely at the blade . Another option is laying the blade flat on the table ( or on a wooden block , if the hilt gets in the way ) and pressing along the cutting edge . The angle of the sharp edge will " lift " the spine . If it behaves the same way on both sides , you should be fine , whichever is your dominant hand . And a big thanks to a ESultanik below who reminded me : Knife handles are not necessarily designed ambidexterously , even if the blade is . In fact , I suggest " trying on " every knife you are willing to spend more than a few dollars on - it should feel safe and comfortable and fit your hand size and grip well . A handle that does n't fit your hand is uncomfortable at best , dangerous at worst . 1 <URL> discusses various styles , including pictures .
There is no reason to worry . The worst thing which can happen is that a piece of bay leaf , being somewhat hard , can lodge somewhere in your digestive system , necessitating a trip to ER . But a medical paper on the topic starts its discussion section with the sentence " Reports discussing ingestion of bay leaves have been exceedingly scant " . They only cite 10 references in the period 1950-1990 , and most of these are general studies of foreign bodies in the esophagus , not specific studies of bay leaf ingestion . Given how often bay leafs must find their ways into people 's digestive systems ( they feature in our food ) , it is safe to conclude that only a tiny fraction of ingested bay leafes cause problems , else there would be more studies mentioning such cases . The same is true for side effects different from mechanical obstruction : if this had happened , somebody would have published it . The paper I mentioned is " Bay Leaf Impaction in the Esophagus and Hypopharynx " by Stephen K. Buto , MD ; Tat-Kin Tsang , MD ; Gerald W. Sielaff , MD ; Laurie L. Gutstein , MD ; and Mick S. Meiselman , MD. . Sadly , it is n't freely available ( I could read the full text because my uni has a subscription ) . I guess that if you are working as a cook , your workplace may decide that even if the chance for a customer choking on a bay leaf is something like one in a million , they 'd rather instill removing bay leaves from dishes as a policy . Probably prudent , although there are more important risks to care about .
I think there 's probably a bigger difference between types of zesters than between brands . No matter what type you choose , look for one that limits how deeply you can cut into the fruit 's peel . You want to get only the colored layer , and as little of the white pith ( the bitter under-layer ) as possible . The most common kind that I 've seen -- a series of little loops at the end of a metal scraper thing ( hard to describe , I guess ) -- are too small in my estimation . They work OK , but they are usually kind of dull , so they release a lot of the oils as you use them , and it takes a long time to get a lot of zest . Some also have a second slot to allow you to cut a fat piece of zest , appropriate for a martini or the like . Even on the fine side , the zest they make is n't really very fine , and might wind up as a texture in the final dish . ( I think of these as more of a bar tool than kitchen tool , and would n't purchase one of these of any brand ) Microplane graters are quite popular for zesting , and they 're what I use the most . They do n't dig deep , and are crazy sharp so they do n't bruise/mash the zest much -- less fragrant oil on the tool , more in the dish . They also work really fast -- it takes very little time to get the zest from an entire orange . The zest produced is very fine and will disappear in most cooking applications . Because they 're sharp it 's easy to grate your fingers by accident , so they require some care in use . There are lots of styles out there , from the classic that looks almost like a wood rasp to ones that look more like a grater . I think these are great to have on hand anyway , since they 're really good with parmesan cheese and other hard items , and they 're killer for zesting . Another option is a standard vegetable peeler . These take bigger slabs of skin off , and take some practice not to cut too deep . If you do cut too deep you can use a sharp paring knife to remove the excess pith from the backside . Kind of a lot of trouble , but with practice you can get good enough that you do n't need the second step . You can get a lot of zest in a hurry this way , but the pieces are huge . You 'd either need to cut them down or only use them in a recipe where you wanted to take the pieces of peel back out before serving . Since you probably already have one of these , this is your most economical option .
<URL> says it 's not air and water : the squeakiness is caused by rubbing against the network of protein strands in the curds , and the squeakiness fades over time because the protein network deteriorates . With respect to microwaving , it says : The reason microwaving helps reinvigorate some of the squeakiness is that the heat starts to alter the amount of moisture trapped inside the curds and creates another bout of hydrolysis , dropping more negatively charged hydrogen ions from casein proteins while they bind to the internal heating water . I 'm inclined to believe this because it explains why cheese curds are different from , say , cheese , and it 's a more detailed explanation consistent with the article cited in Laura 's answer ( saying the protein networks are more elastic when fresh ) , which also explains the effect of the microwave !
This depends partially on the cooking technique and the shrimp variety/size ( = > thickness of the shell ) . If the shrimp is deep fried the shell can turn crispy and is super fun to eat . However , if boiled , the shells are chewy and extremely unpleasant - in this case you have to peel them . I am not familiar with the spicy garlic shrimp , but you can just try if the shell is crunchy , is pleasant to eat , and does not require excessive painful chewing - go for it , if not return to your old practice of pealing it and just licking the flavoring of the shells .
There 's nothing magical about garlic that causes it to be especially prone to botulism - it 's just commonly found as an example because it 's commonly used to prepare flavoured oils . All low-acid foods must be acidified or pressure-canned before long-term storage . Storage in oil creates an anaerobic environment which further promotes botulism , and room-temperature storage is even more risky . Chili peppers are low acid , like all peppers , so yes , they 're a risk .
I like the first answer , but feel the need to clarify the ' pepperoni ' reference . Yes , they are slices of bagels . However , if you cut a bagel vertically in half as it rests flat and treat each half as if you were slicing a curved salumi , all of your chips will be inconsistently thick on one edge and thin on the other ( thanks to the properties of a torus ) . While that leaves them all consistently round , their thickness varies , which makes evenly toasting them a problem . The more conventional approach : take the whole bagel as it lies flat on the cutting board , and slice it vertically but thinly from one side to the other . There will be much more variation in chip shape , but it 's much easier to maintain the right thickness for even toasting . This is also why most ( if not all ) bags of chips are sliced in this manner , and you see such wild variation of circles , ovals , etc in chip shape . A Gildy 's Blade or a tightly serrated bread knife will do the job . Along with a bit of patience .
These days , mostly software . In the good/bad old days , by actually burning it ( or having a laboratory do that for them ) . Software is much simpler ( unless you are writing it , though it is probably more tedious than complex . ) Input ingredients and quantities , out comes calories . For a restaurant that assumes that the recipe used for calculation matches the actual recipe used . Here is a USDA database , for instance . Tedious to use , but gives the idea . <URL>

Using a wooden spoon to prevent pots from boiling over ?
There is an excellent answer to this question on the Physics SE : <URL> I will summarise what I think is the most cogent part here . This does work up to a point . The bubbles formed by boiling water are filled with steam , so if anything colder than the steam ( ie < 100 ° C ) touches a bubble the steam will immediately condense and the bubble will collapse . Therefore provided the surface of your spoon is cold , it will help to prevent boiling over . If it 's a long boil and the spoon heats up to 100 ° C it will no longer work . This is why a wooden spoon is recommended : metal would heat up too quickly .
Chickpea puree with sesame paste would be hummus . Hummus can be served warm or cold , so you could serve it straight out of the can if you wanted . To warm it up , I 'd avoid heating it with any kind of direct heat , but it should be fine microwaved briefly . When it is served warm , it 's not hot by any means , so a gentle heating is all that 's needed .
This can be a hard one to get right . There are three important phases of baking these : An brief initial high heat phase A longer lower heat phase A brief slow cooling phase For the initial phase I go with 400 ℉ for 15 minutes . The high heat provides a rapid rise with a hollow center . For the second phase I reduce the heat to 350 ℉ for 30-40 minutes . This phase allows the shells to firm up and dries out the center . At this point you should cut one of them in half and see how moist the center is . It 's important that the center of the dough be as dry as possible here , having an undercooked center is what causes the dough to deflate . A little bit of moisture is ok . For the final phase , turn the oven off and let them cool with the door ajar for 10-15 minutes . With the door fully open the rapid cooling can also trigger deflation .
Salt is a good means to control/suppress flames and flareups without having a cooling effect on the coals .
A glass of water in the microwave will result in less microwave energy reaching the popcorn . I use a large glass of water ( 8 - 12 oz . ) when I 'm softening butter because I want the water to absorb most of the energy . For popcorn , you may get by with 2-4 ounces of water . I 've also found that the amount of oil makes a huge difference . I sometimes pop popcorn in a paper lunch bag . If I do n't use any oil , I get the combination of burnt and unpopped you described . With a teaspoon of oil added to 1/3 cup of popcorn , results are a lot better . Perhaps you just need a little more oil to get great popcorn .
Silly , silly me . As Jefromi suggested earlier , the largest contributor to the fact it takes that much longer is probably the fact that the eggs are at a different themselves at the moment I put them in . I used to store eggs in a cupboard ; now I store them in the refrigerator . That is not to say the other factors mentioned by Martha and Sklivvz do n't add to that -- they most likely do -- but this seems the most reasonable , if unanticipated , explanation . Thank you all for your answers and suggestions !
Pretty much everything I 've read ( <URL> ) says not to use wood , because the oils from the peppers will penetrate the board and transfer , and hold there indefinitely , even after thorough washings . <URL> is full of people with personal experience transferring the heat to later meals . That said , as with Jefromi , I 've cut hot peppers on wood before and not noticed any transfer . Specifically , home grown habaneros and jalapenos on maple boards . Maybe I 'm just acclimated to the heat and do n't notice , but those recommendations are not in line with my personal experience . I do thoroughly scrub my boards after use , but that probably is n't washing away any residual oils . If you really want to be safe , for example if someone in your house is heat sensitive or you have small children helping in the kitchen , you can dedicate a board to cutting peppers , or just cut peppers on a small plastic board and wash thoroughly after each use .
If a wine maker loves their wine , and their customers , they will use screw caps . All the studies have come back positive for screw caps . See <URL> for starters . Some main points are : Corks taint the wine Corks , real or synthetic , have a very high failure rate . Screw caps are basically 100 % effective ( <URL> ) Wine ages better with a screw cap , as there is no chance of seal failure or tainting Screw caps have been physically tested for over 30 years , and are designed to last longer than that You can cellar wine bottles at any angle The energy used in making a recyclable ( aluminium ) screw cap is significantly less than used in making a cork Most corks are n't made in ethical plantations No special tools are required to open and recap a bottle ( cork knives can be a serious health hazard later in the evening ) . Wines age more safely . Corks do not breathe , but they may shrink and let wine out ( bottles stored on side ) . Good vineyards will <URL> , or when corks start failing . The wine is topped up to the correct level , and often the wine/cork gap is flooded with nitrogen to avoid oxygen contamination which will " soften " the wine . All in all , some pretty convincing reasons to go with screw caps .
I have seen pot roast of Shitake . Pot roast = over-cooked obviously . There were pot roast for : duck roast , chicken roast , pork trotters , buddhist faux meat , Buddha jumped over the wall roast . All of them amply roasted with shitakes . Okay , for what I have tried , I encountered two kinds of shitake pot roast sweet and sour sweet and salted soy-sauced The Buddhist faux meat : I saw the usual buddhist faux meat the permutations of which I think are due to diverse combination of various flours , soy and other beans . The thick gravy is dark brown with obvious scent of dark sweet soy sauce and black vinegar . And the over-cooked shitakes are chewy juicy with the wonderful gravy . Chicken pot roast : Then there was another time , the chicken pot roast . The gravy was thinner but not sour . It was a whole chicken that was boiled in sauce with the shitake . From what I understand , the shitake roast was done first and then the chicken submerged in the boiling cauldron at the end of the roast . At the last 10 minutes may be . Shitake juiced up with gravy enriched with chicken taste/flavour . Chewing on the shitake You should try overcooked shitake that has absorbed the juicy gravies . Chocolate mousse cake is nowhere in comparison just as you sink your teeth into it and the juice runs down your chin . And then you lick your fingers after you had them wipe your chin . Slow cooked shitake pot roast . I am sure there were spices involved . I also believe they used shitakes that had been stabilised by drying ( i.e. dried shitakes ) . Otherwise , I doubt fresh shitakes could take the strain of being overcooked .
I used the method here before with good success : <URL> Basically you start with the eggs in the pan with cold water and bring the water to temperature , right when it reaches boiling you pull the heat back and let the eggs cook for 10 minutes . You do n't need a full on boil to hard boil the eggs .
In November 2007 a recipe was published in Cooks Illustrated for a Foolproof Pie dough with vodka . That recipe was created by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt who was one of the chefs on America 's Test Kitchen and writer for Cooks Illustrated . He has an article about the recipe here <URL> . As far as I know this was not a well-known trick and Lopez-Alt came up with it originally .
You would use the flat bottom spoon as you would use a regular spoon . The main different between the flat-bottom spoon and western spoons is as you can see the flat bottom and the fact that the flat bottom spoons are usually bigger and can hold more liquid . I 'm not sure why it would be awkward to use it compared to a regular spoon . You do n't need to stick the whole spoon in your mouth . There is a rounded edge around the spoon before it is flat . You put just the rounded portion of the spoon into your mouth and drink from it . The reason for the larger spoon probably stems from the fact that many Asian soups have noodles and large chuncks of vegetables and meats in it . Using a western spoon , you would get some of the noodle or meat and have little room for the broth . But with the larger flat bottom spoon you can get the noodle , meat and still fit an appropriate amount of broth on the spoon . EDIT : Also note that it is common practice to use the flat bottom spoon and the chopsticks simulataneously while eating a bowl of noodle soup . One would use the chopsticks in their dominant hand ( right hand lets assume ) . They would then use their left hand to use the spoon . As you have probably experienced in your life unless you are ambidexterous , using the left hand to do thing you normally do with the right can be hard . With the flat bottom , there is less chance of spilling than with a traditional rounded spoon .
One tablespoon is three teaspoons , so no , it ca n't be considered half a tablespoon because it 's one-third instead :) You can use three teaspoons to measure out one tablespoon , but it might be tricky to measure the other way : as Rumstacio said below , the 1/3 is by volume , and it can be difficult to eyeball the volume of a semi-sphere ( 1.3 the height of the spoon is not 1/3 the volume because it 's wider at the top ) .
Metal Advantages : durable , no risk of absorbing flavours Disadvantages : may scratch certain cookware Wood Advantages : does n't scratch , looks nice Disadvantages : can wear down over time , can sometimes absorb flavours Plastic Does n't find a place in my kitchen other than a rubber spatula for baking . Silicone You did n't mention this , but I like it , because it works like rubber but can withstand high temps ( brushes , spatulas ) I think the answer really depends on what you cook . If you have a basic set ( wooden spoon , spatula that can handle heat , good ladle , chopsticks ) , you can make do without the rest as you start . You 'll quickly learn what you wish you had to make it a little easier .
They do go above 550F , it 's a question of design and the type of wiring used in an oven . <URL> is commonly used to wire up home ovens , which has a maximum surrounding ambient temperature rating of 105 degrees celsius . So , oven makers need to design ovens where the ambient temperature of things outside of the insulated oven cavity do n't reach a temperature above 220 degrees fahrenheit ( that 's where the wiring lives ) , and not exceed the insulation around the door of the oven , and not burn anyone coming in contact with the sides . So it 's both safety and technical cost reasons . Hotter home ovens are possible , and available , but they 're made a bit differently and the cost to produce them is a bit higher . Since most people cooking at home do n't need something that goes north of 500 degrees , there is n't a big market for them - and the market that does exist is mostly in the commercial space . A residential implementation would have some pretty specific insulation requirements , be slightly larger than most home builders anticipated ( making them harder to install ) and naturally quite a bit more expensive and scarce .
I finally found the answer to this question : I was in the supermarket yesterday and on a can of lentils the ingredients listed on the side of the tin had the phrase ' firming agent ' in brackets beside the entry for calcium chloride .
Food in general spoils when bacteria , fungus , and other little bugs eat the food , multiply into more , create waste , and then die . I would imagine that the increased population of " bugs " found on a old , used , not washed spoon would cause the decomposition of new creme fraiche to accelerate , but if you wash the spoon , then no-problem .
There are a couple of things you can do to prevent sugar crystallising . You can add some glucose syrup , or you can ' invert ' the sugar by adding some acid , namely cream of tartar . Both should be readily available , online if not at your supermarket . Cream of tartar is also useful when making meringue .
There are only three advantages that I can think of for a brasier : The lower sides result in faster evaporation when cooking on the stove top , as it does n't hold in the steam . It 's typically not as heavy for the same surface area . You should be able to fit two of them in your oven ( on different racks ) , which is unlikely for a dutch oven . Personally , I do n't have any of that shape pan in cast iron , and the ones that I do have , I do n't use for braising ; I use them for pilaf-type dishes or casseroles where you want a wide but shallow covered dish . I do n't know if a cast iron vessel would work as well for those dishes , as the thermal mass could make it more difficult to cook the middle sufficiently without overcooking the outside , unless is n't something that you can serve immediately after coming out of the oven .
Ceramic will - if preheated - prevent some cooling of your water , but plastic filter-holders do n't have much heat capacity so you do n't lose much with them , either . Plastic filter-holders and paper filters have the advantage of not costing much so you can have one at home , one at work , one anywhere else you want ... As with most coffee preparation , a good grinder is paramount and getting freshly roasted coffee is also extremely important .

How do I cook chips ( french fries ) in the oven ?
There are a couple tricks I 've learned from Cook 's Illustrated about making oven fries : Soak your cut potatoes in warm water to rinse off excess surface starch . Drain them and dry them very well ( I use a salad spinner and paper towels ) . Use a heavy duty sheet pan on the bottom rack of a hot oven to focus the heat on crisping the bottoms of the potatoes . Oil your sheet pan well , and sprinkle salt on it . This will act kind of like ball bearings under the potatoes to prevent them from sticking too hard . For the first 5-10 minutes , tightly wrap the sheet pan ( with the potatoes ) with aluminum foil . This will essentially steam the potatoes and help get a really nice creamy interior . After that , remove the foil and flip the potatoes halfway through . Make sure you use a thin metal spatula when you flip them . These techniques work well for potatoes in general , and really do turn out some fantastic spuds .
Do you like your noodles swimming in water ? If not , drain them .
I actually debated asking a similar question last month , as I managed to set mine on fire the day after Christmas , and based on the new one I got , differences I 've noticed ( mostly features I miss from the old one ; also a few things I 've noticed at my neighbors and mom 's house . Insulated top ; If you frequently run out of space in your kitchen , and need to keep stuff on top of the toaster oven , it comes in handy . ( and some allow the top to open up so you can expose the top so it could be a bread or plate warmer ) Is the rack connected to the door so , when you open the door , the rack pushes out a couple of inches , so you do n't have to reach in to extract things and risk burning yourself ? ( okay , I admit , there 's a few drawbacks to this ; it means the rack is n't easily removable to be cleaned or if you need to pull it all the way out because there 's something that got pushed to the back , and the next item ) Multiple racks or rack heights . The different positions might be useful for the broiler , but the multiple racks really are n't that useful ; things wo n't toast right when they 're blocked by another level , and they do n't tend to cook evenly when in oven mode , either . ( maybe if it 's a convection ... it 's my neighbor 's toaster oven , so I have n't played enough with it ) If you leave both racks in there , then you 've barely got any space in between to grab things out , so you 're risking burning yourself . ( and well , they do n't have that last feature where the rack pops out when you open the door ) Location of the controls ; some are on the side , some are on the bottom . Controls on the bottom are more prone to getting damaged by things getting pushed around on the counter , but I prefer it for a few reasons -- ( 1 ) the toaster oven 's narrower , as there 's no wasted space to the side ; ( 2 ) the door opens higher up ; this means you can have a large plate on the counter without it getting in the way when you want to open the toaster . Convection ; some have it , some do n't . Broiler ; not all can do broil ( top element ) only . Depth of the unit ; some of them bump out so they can fit a round pizza ; if they also have a little bracket so you do n't accidentally push it up against the wall , there 's hardly any space left on the counter . How exposed the elements are ; some of the newer ones have grills over the elements , I have n't had mine long enough to see if that 'll protect it from melted cheese dripping on 'em , which I think was the cause of my toaster fire . Turn-dial vs. brown-ness setting . I do n't know how to explain this one . All of the toaster ovens in the stores I looked in have a dial , where you have to turn the dial past 10 min , then back to the little reference marks for the darkness that you like your toast ; My old one just had a setting at the bottom , you set it to toast , and hit the button . If you wanted to shut it off , you opened the door . Of course , with this style , there was n't a timer on the oven , either . Turn-off-via opening the door : Some do , some stay on . I 'm used to it , but of course , if that 's the only way to shut it off , that also means you have to open the door to shut it off when there 's a fire inside , which means better airflow . ( or unplug it , but when the plug 's on the other side of the toaster , that one 's not a great option , either ) . Electronic controls : I personally view it as something else to break , but they might be able to do something special ; I 've never bought one , myself . Cord length ; only really a problem when you 've got an old kitchen that does n't have a plug every 12 " or whatever the new standards seem to be ; but you really do n't want to plug a toaster into a power strip if you can help it , so if you know you 're going to need to run it 3 ' down the counter , check the cord length . ( and which side it attaches , just in case you 're then going in the wrong direction with it ) Crumb tray . I hear other people use 'em . They 're supposedly important so you do n't catch the thing on fire . Accessories . Some come with a little tray to use ; some of them also have a little insert to turn it into a broiler pan ( so you lift it out of the pan a little bit , so it wo n't stew in whatever drips off ) . And I understand that you need some air flow around the pan , but in my opinion , something 's wrong when the tray that comes with the toaster is 1/2 the area of the rack ; it 's like they were n't even trying , they just tossed in a tray from some other oven . Others come with a little tool so you can pull the rack out so you do n't burn yourself ( which then gets lost or broken and thus sucks ) Size . If you tend to make toast for lots of people at a time , then some of the larger toasters might be worth it ; If you 're single , the 6 or 8 slices of bread at the same time ( but not the size of bread you like ; you can only fit two of those ) toasters might be a bit overkill ) And they now seem to measure themselves by ' size of a pizza I can fit ' , which makes no sense to me , as everyone knows the correct way to size toaster
You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders . It 's just the cooking times are shorter , that 's all . Set your oven to 250-275F , and roast those ribs until they 're done . I 've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours , but as many as 5 . Optionally , you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook , with some liquid in the foil pack . Just be aware that they 'll cook faster if they 're foiled . And depending on your preference , you may want to take them out of the foil to finish them .
Ideally , the water level should be just as , or a bit above , the egg level . So , you fill the ramekin to maybe 1.5 cm below the rim , place it in the dish , and fill the dish until it is 1 cm below the ramekin rim . You can deviate a bit , if you must - if you had a bit too much custard and filled the ramekins more , you should n't get the water too high , because you do n't want to get water splashed onto the custard if it should start boiling ( actually , you want to avoid a roiling boil in your bain marie , but it can happen ) . Even if the egg is slightly higher than the water , it will still be OK . If you have the water level too low , you risk to overheat the upper portions of your custards . This assumes the souffle-cup-like ramekins usually sold to home bakers . If you have very flat ones , like crema catalana dishes , it gets more complicated . You have to have the water close to the rim , and bake at lower settings . It can help to put them high in the bain marie , e.g. on a cake cooling rack , so that they are cooled from below rather than the sides .
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .
Good Eats ( Alton Brown ) has some good descriptions of the various difference 's between potatos . He has an <URL> Main thing is the starch content in them . He has an example of each of the three groups ( High , Medium , Low ) , includign a brief description and sample application . He mentions mentions frying in the High Starch content group , specifically Russets . He then has another <URL> , where he actually talks about French Fries and again mentions the Russet ( High Starch ) . While you can make fries out of different types of potatoes ( some of the more " all purpose " potatoes ) , if you want a really good classic french fry , you 're going to want to look for a Russet , with a similar starch content . Here 's a <URL> . Maybe you can look to see what you bought ? The age will probably affect it . A younger potato will in fact be sweeter So , to answer your specific questions . I 'm betting you did in fact buy a potato . It 's probably just a sweeter variety . If it does n't say at the market where you bought it what kind they are , I 'd ask the people who work there . Also , look at the third link I have above , it does have a few pictures as well as good descriptions on what they look like .
<URL> The point of leaving the cookies to sit on the pan is to dry out the skin so it 'll solidify better . I 'd suggest resting longer ( up to 50 minutes ) or using a hotter oven .
I do n't know how you would describe the flavor of bay -- I would call it a subtle savoriness , with a complex aroma . Bay is very tough -- almost sharp . It is generally not eaten directly . Instead , the whole leaf ( or several whole leaves ) are put into a dish or sauce to cook with it , then removed prior to service . The shortest recipe I have for using bay is in a rice pilaf while it cooks , which is 15-30 minutes depending . I am not aware of an upper time limit . Here is a Miami Herald article offering some other perspectives on using bay leaves : <URL> As they Herald points out , many folks prefer Turkish bay rather than California bay , because it has a more complex , subtle flavor . ... I believe custard in Britain had bay as a traditional ingredient -- you might make a custard with a single bay leaf to get some sense of what it tastes like without lots of competing strong flavors . ... Update : Serious Eats Food Lab has just published an article , <URL> with lots of good information that may be of interest .
First , buy a thermometer , they 're cheap . This one topped America 's Test Kitchen testing : <URL> Barring taking the plunge and spending $ 6 on an oven thermometer , this method comes straight from an online class I 'm taking from Harvard through edX.org . <URL> To test the oven , you can either use an oven thermometer , or you can find a material that has a transition at some critical temperature , and then tune your oven near the critical temperature where the transition occurs -- to find out if it actually happens . Jeff Potters has suggested a wonderful idea in his excellent book Cooking for Geeks . Namely , he suggests that oven testing can be done with melting sugar . His protocol is here . The calibration is based on the idea that the melting point of table sugar ( sucrose ) is 366 F ( 186 ˚C ) , [ google " melting point sucrose " ] and so if you put the temperature just above 366 , the sugar should melt . And if you put it just below 366 F it should not melt . It is important when doing this procedure to not use a lot of sugar , as otherwise the heating time for the sugar could be too long . Materials : ~ 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar Procedure : 1 ) Preheat your oven to 350F ( 177 ˚C ) . ( 2 ) Place the granulated sugar in an oven proof dish or on aluminum foil ( 3 ) Place in oven for 15 minutes ( 4 ) If the sugar does n't melt , raise the temperature of the oven by 10F ( 5 ˚C ) and repeat the experiment . ( 5 ) Continue raising the temperature until you find the temperature setting where your sugar melts . Let 's call this temperature Tmelt . ( 6 ) You have thus found that the sugar melts somewhere in the interval Tmelt-10 , Tmelt . ( i.e. , if you found that the sugar melted at 400F , but not 390F , the melting temperature is between 390 and 400 . ) ( 7 ) Your measurement suggests that your oven has the approximate calibration curve T = Tdial + 366 - Tmelt ( if you use degrees Fahrenheit ) T = Tdial + 186 - Tmelt ( if you use degrees Celsius ) where Tdial is the temperature of the dial . Note that if your dial says that sugar melts at 400 , this formula states that the actual temperature in the oven is the temperature that the sugar melts ( 366F ) . " Here is another method , this one is from Cook 's Illustrated , AKA America 's Test Kitchen . I copied and pasted the technique from <URL> Preheat oven to 350F . Start with 1 cup of room temperature water and check its temperature with an immersion thermometer . Adjust the temperature with either warm or cold water to make it 70F . place in oven for 15 minutes . Check temperature again and it should read 150F . Adjust oven temperature accordingly . Another way to check oven temp is to simply boil water . Put a couple of cups of water in an oven proof pan and set the oven temp to 200F or 90C , the water should n't boil no matter how long you leave it in the oven . Set the temp to 225F or 110C . Eventually , the water should boil . All that said , buy a thermometer .
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling . This lets the husk soak lots of water . Then place the corn , still in husk , on a hot grill for about 10 minutes , ~ 1/4 turn , 10 minutes , turn ... until the husk gets brown , even burnt . You should be able to tell when the corn is cooked by the smell . The sugars in the corn will start to caramelize and brown in the husk and it will give off a delicious caramel smell . You can check them by peeling down the husk to make sure that they are cooking well . Times will depend on your grill and how much patience you have . In general , it is difficult to overcook . You want to watch out for drying , but that usually takes a while if you soak the ears beforehand . Foil is a poor substitute for the natural wrapper . The husk both protects the cob from too much direct heat as well as holding water close to the cob to gently steam the kernels . And its just prettier with the browned and burnt husk , au natural .
Just treat them as you would corned beef . I like the pressure cooker method
There are lots of recipes for oven - " fried " sweet potato chips ( crisps ) and fries ( chips ) and I 'll let you search that part . I 've noticed a wide variation in recommended oven temperatures , from as low as 350 to as high as 450 . Though I 've never had great success with crispiness , my overall best results were with a temp of 425 . Crispiness with sweet potatoes is notoriously difficult due to the high water and sugar content ( which will caramelize and make them appear and to some extent taste burnt , usually long before they crisp up ) . There 's some discussion of this on <URL> . Key points seem to be : remove as much surface moisture as possible prior to cooking avoid overcrowding the pans , especially when cooking thicker cuts use a convection oven if possible If you have success please report back and tell us what worked !

Putting the pan on the burner will deliver too much heat in too little time - aka a burnt layer . You want constant heat from the bottom during the whole cooking time . In an oven , your pizza stone is an excellent start , supplying a thermal mass . I recommend increasing the heat from the bottom compared to the heat from the top , even if this could slightly increase the total cooking time : Set your oven to " bottom heat " and / or put the pan on the lowest rack possible . A sheet of foil can also shield the pan from top heat .
The lower ( first ) temperature actually cooks the potato so that it is tender , the hotter temperature ( second ) is what gives the crispy golden coating . If you just did the lower temperature , your fries might be too soft . If you just did the hotter temperature they would be too too tough .
There are a few questions on this site about French fries , I 'd suggest you take a look . But I think the best answer is : baked sticks of potato do not French fries make . French fries are deep fried . You can never get the same results in air , although air fryers do come close . A normal oven bakes , not fries . Here are some sites that experiment with fries and crispiness <URL> <URL> .
Also , I would add that I tend to cook in batches , rather than overfilling the pan . So using a large deep skillet put enough in to cover about 2/3 of the base , and cook on high heat til browned etc. . Then I put it into a warmed bowl as I cook the next batch , until I have a full bowl of cooked mince , which I can then put back into the pan to simmer and turn into whatever the end dish is .
Yes , with any kind of ' stewing ' sauce , the flavour improves the longer you cook it ( provided it 's a slow , gentle process ) . The longer you leave it , the more chance the flavours have to ' marry ' . I have a recipe for a pasta sauce that calls for 6 hours of slow simmering ! You may also have noticed in the past that left over pasta sauce that you eat the next day is really good , for the same reason as above . Any stew , in fact , like bolognese , casserole , chilli , bourgignon etc , is really delicious when left overnight and reheated .

How to Rescue Too-Soft Cookie Dough Made with Butter Substitute ?
I do n't believe you will be satisfied with any cookies you roll out and cut from this dough . That said , there are three options that may allow the dough to find a tasty future . Make a ' Mega Cookie ' : roll the dough out and fit it onto a pizza tin and bake . This can be decorated as one large cookie/pizza . Make ' Brownies ' : work the dough into an 8 " x8 " or 9 " x13 " pan and bake . ' Cupcakes ' : scoop a spoonful of dough into each compartment of muffin tin and bake . Of course you will have to watch to get them done enough as the standard bake time probably wo n't apply . If your recipe does n't include eggs ( or you are not concerned with the risk that raw eggs may pose ) adding it to homemade ice cream would be a fourth option . Good luck .
( Disregard previous version : I did not notice this recipe had no wheat flour . ) This recipe gets all of its structure from oats . Instant oats are pre-hydrolized , so that they cook faster . Regular oats are just the natural oat , perhaps cut , and rolled flat . They need more moisture and time to hydrolize . The recipe will probably work , perhaps with a slightly different texture . They may bake faster due to the fact that the oats are already hydrolyzed . If you choose recipe where the structure comes from wheat flour , the type of oats will matter less .
The shells are not used in making peanut butter . You would need to shell these peanuts ( and remove the papery skins from the individual peanuts ) before grinding them to make the peanut butter . It does n't matter whether they are roasted in the shell or not -- what matters is that they are roasted , to give the deeper , richer flavor . I have to assume your peanut vendor did not mislead you , and therefore the peanuts you bought are already roasted . You would just shell them and grind them . Note : if they are roasted , they will be somewhat crunchy , with a toasty complex aroma , and light medium beige to brown color , whereas raw ( or " green " ) peanuts will be closer to very pale yellowish beige , like unfinished lumber . Due to the large number of peanuts that may be used in making a reasonable quality of peanut butter , and the inconvenience of shelling those peanuts , one might choose to purchase already shelled , roasted , preferably unsalted peanuts for the purpose . Edit : in response to the second question , I defer to the mighty <URL> whose recipe indicates to roast peanuts at 350 F for 30-35 minutes . Since he does n't give us a test or indicator to know when they are done , and a careful and meticulous recipe writer such as Brown would not omit this if one exists , I infer no good test for doneness of the in-shell peanuts exists . However , since the individual peanuts within the shells are very uniform in size , the time and temperature guideline is likely to be quite effective . You should almost certainly be smelling roasty peanut aromas as the peanuts close in to being done , but there is no way to describe that . Its like knowing when a cake is done by the aroma -- its certainly possible , but you have to have experience with the recipe to know .
Gnocchi shaped ? I am pretty sure they are Turdilli ! . It 's a <URL> : They are deep-fried : And hot-soaked in honey too : Same biscotti , slightly different shapes : Bear in mind that fried cookies soaked in honey are a traditional treat for carnival and Christmas seasons all over Italy , so you may find many , many similar recipes . From <URL> : Evviva i Dolci di Carnevale rigorosamente fritti , che ricevono nomi diversi secondo i luoghi . In Toscana chiacchiere o trecce , e poi frappe laziali , castagnole romane , frittelle di riso molisane , fritole triestine , nigelan altoatesini , sfincitelle siciliane , tortelli romagnoli , bomboloni fiorentini , cicerchiata umbra e chi più ne ha più ne metta ! At left with figs syrup , at right with honey : A full blown italian fritti feast : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> ( hold your envy )
They should be quite a bit softer than a standard Eureka lemon , because the skin is much thinner . That said , it should n't be like a gentle squeeze causes your finger to sink in 1/2 an inch . If that happens , I think you 've found a batch that are too old and have started to get mushy or lose moisture . Keep looking for good ones - Meyer lemons are terrifically fragrant , floral and mild .
Mustard is one of those simple condiments to make , and is fun to experiment with . At it 's most basic mustard is two ingredients : Mustard Seed Liquid There are endless variations from there . Mustard seed comes in white , yellow , brown and black variations . I suggest buying whole and grinding them yourself using either a mortar &amp; pestle or coffee/spice grinder . ( Do n't use a coffee grinder that you use for grinding coffee ! You 'll end up with mustard flavored coffee ) . Liquids can be water , vinegar , wine , or even beer . Using vinegar/wine will help it last longer than water or beer would . Once you 've fine ground ( of course there are coarse ground varieties too ) your mustard simply mix it with the liquid until it is the desired consistency . Additional ingredients can be added to taste . Honey , turmeric ( gives yellow mustard its color ) , sugar , etc. are all possibilities . Update : I forgot to mention that mustard needs time for the flavors to mix . This can take anywhere from a few hours to weeks . A fresher mustard tends to be hotter , but an aged mustard can often taste " better " with a slight loss of that initial heat . Refrigerated mustard will keep it 's heat longer . Also note , mustard made with water should definitely be refrigerated and consumed quicker than others .
Well , that 's basically where ice machines come into the game . Often ice recipes tell you to stir the ice during the freezing process every 5 to 10 minutes or so , so the ice will stay softer . That 's what ice machines are taking care of : While freezing the ice they constantly stir the mass , so in the end you will get the perfect soft ice . Anyway if you then place this ice in the freezer , it will become hard nevertheless , since finally it 's all a question of temperature . So you might either go invest in an ice machine or get the ice out of the freezer ( and into the fridge ) some 15 to 30 minutes before serving it . There 's definitely no other way around it .
Two things - If the marinade is very strong or salty then the meat could simply become over flavored . If the marinade includes a meat digesting enzyme such as papain then leaving it too long could turn the meat to mush .
Most of the things in this are very easy to substitute . Roses lime juice is sweet and non-alcoholic ( and can be found in most supermarkets ) . You can easily sub in heavy cream for Baileys : they do n't taste the same , but chemically they react about the same . Grenadine is just a pomegranate juice simple syrup . No alcohol there at all . The only question is what you want to sub for the strawberry vodka . Some kind of soda , most likely . It 's a question of taste . It wo n't be easy to get something that is both fruity and clear , but you might try white cranberry juice , or white grape juice .
How to throw dough , a basic step by step guide . Make sure you have a dough that can stand up to being airborne . This means that you need a high gluten dough . You can throw wetter doughs as you get more experienced but they require much more precise hand placement and are much less forgiving . Make sure your dough is fully risen with out being " blown " . It should be elastic and soft to the touch . Coat dough in flour . This step is necessary to allow free spinning on your hands and to get good , clean releases . Create crust . You can use the method that daniel describes , you can use the Papa John 's fold and tuck method , you can do it like this <URL> , it does n't matter as long as you end up with a piece of dough that is flat over the interior with a ridge going around the outside . You should be comfortable with in-air hand stretching before you get to the actual throwing . This is when you place the dough on the backs of your hands , support it with your knuckles and stretch it out . This position is a great way to start a basic toss that wo n't rip your dough as you will be catching with the backs of your hands and not your fingers . You want to release the dough by having your right hand provide upward thrust as your left hand provides spin . This will provide a straight up toss that is very easy to catch . The way to do the more advanced throws is learn to release from your finger tips . This involves having your fingers rest along the ridge that we made in step four . You can check out a quick tutorial starting at 2:17 on this <URL> . Feel free to ignore the rest of it , but it was the best explanation I found online . Basically , you want the dough to hang in such a way as to allow you to impart spin and momentum with just one hand , while other is occasionally used as a stabilizer . This allows tricks like the <URL> and the through the legs and all the others . Important tips that will help you be successful at learning this skill . Cold dough is more elastic than warm dough . That means its terrible for pizza but great for practicing . It also resists puncture a little better , so less holes . A damp kitchen towel has about the same aerodynamics as a piece of dough . It 's what I used to train the guys at my restaurant on for extra practice , and it 's way cheaper than one of those rubber doughs . The dough should always be spinning in the air . If it 's not , you are n't doing it right . Throwing dough can result in a very thin middle . You want to make sure that you are stretching evenly and keeping an eye on that if you intend to use the dough for it 's actual purpose of delicious pizza . Practice , Practice ! Throwing dough is a physical skill and you have to train your muscles a little to be good at it . It can be a little frustrating at first but stick with it , it 's a lot of fun . If you have any additional concerns leave a comment and I 'll do my best answer them .
For very high hydration loaves , you want to create your gluten development without adding an excess of flour which would reduce the relative hydration . <URL> shows the classic stretch , slap and fold method , using a 70 % hydration dough . Basically , you lift the entire dough from the work surface , allow it to stretch under its own weight , then slam it down again . Rinse and repeat . A somewhat less labor instensive method is described at <URL> ( the article has a lot of introductory material , keep reading and there are really clear instructions with lots of photos ) : Initially stir the dough together until it is is a thick and cohesive liquid , which the author describes as " like porridge . " Use the stretch and fold method of kneading to create some development : Flour your work surface moderately Pour the dough out onto the surface Use your bench knife knife ( also called a dough scraper ) to lift and drop the dough back on itself , stretching it . Images from the Fresh Loaf Allow the dough to rest and autolyse , that is , develop gluten from the reaction of the water and precursor proteins in the presence of enzymes naturally in the flour . This limits the amount of hand kneading you have to do . Repeat the stretch and fold method a couple of times to get the final development Finally , note that very wet doughs can also be kneaded entirely in a stand mixer simply by beating them for a couple of minutes . These doughs are wet enough to be nearly pourable , and do not climb and clump onto the paddle ; if they do , the hydration is not high enough for this method , and you need to use the dough hook instead .
Yes , the original recipes involved an enormous amount of trial and error . People baked , swapped recipes , and the good ones were desirable and became widespread , while the bad ones died out . The advanced knowledge of food chemistry was n't even available at the time - Hannah Glasse published her cookbook more then 100 years before Mendeleev published the periodic table . Luckily , you do n't have to go through the same process if you want to invent a good recipe now . There are only a few basic ingredients in baking - eggs , sugar , flour , water - and you can be sure that all possible ways to combine them , as well as most secondary additions and substitutions , have been thoroughly explored . People have distilled the knowledge of this exploration in books , and you can use this basic knowledge to build new recipes which will function with a high probability . Before you develop a baking recipe , there are four things you have to know . Technique . If you want to create a cookie recipe , you will have to use creaming . If you want to make a new kind of eclair , you have to know how to prepare a basic pate a choux . There are cookbooks teaching these techniques , some of them are explained in questions here on SA . Base ratio . For most baked goods , there are ratios which give you the best results . For example , for a crepe you want 1 part flour , two parts egg and two parts liquid . As long as you keep that , you can let your imagination run free by using different liquids , or adding spices , or even plopping pieces of fruit in the pan and pouring the batter over them . You can learn about this from Ruhlman 's book Ratio , or use a known-good recipe for a plain variant of the good you are trying to make as your starting point . Flavor combinations . You can add any ingredients you want , but there is no guarantee they will work well together . Choosing the right ones is a combination of talent ( being able to imagine what a combination will taste like before you have had it ) and experience . You should try to be more analytical about the flavors of things you eat - which tastes can you distinguish ? Which aromas ? What makes them go well together ? Is it their similarity , or the contrast ? - and when you have done that long enough , you will be able to predict the goodness of a combination . A book to help you along is The Flavor Bible , which describes good combinations . You can also take popular combinations and transfer them across types of food . For example , if you like apple-cinnamon pie , you can try to make cinnamon cookies glued in pairs with apple butter . Ingredients ' structure and their role in the baked good . This knowledge is maybe the least usual among home cooks . When you create new recipes , you will always dilute the base formula , or use substitutions . If you do n't have this knowledge , it will be hit-or-miss whether your new recipe will work or not . It is a bit like rebuilding a house 's interior without knowing which walls are load-bearing and which are n't . If you know what each ingredient does in a recipe , you will know when a substitution is possible and when it is n't . For example , many people will tell you that applesauce is a substitute for eggs . And you can indeed bake a cake with applesauce instead of eggs , but do n't try to whip a mayonnaise with it . This is because eggs have a different role in cake and mayonnaise . Learning about these roles requires a lot of effort , and a curiosity about these things . Most people will find it easier to just try whatever they feel like , and live with the occasional failed new-recipe attempt . If you would rather learn about them , I can recommend two sources . One is Cooking for geeks by Jeff Potter , which is short and does n't go into the depth of things , but offers lots of useful information and is easy to read , or the really exhaustive book called On Food and Cooking by Harold McGee , which runs to about 800 pages and goes into detail most people do n't want to know about , but is a must-read if you are fascinated by food science . And , of course you can always just run into the kitchen and experiment . Do n't forget to document along the way so you can reproduce your results ! Basically , you can always have luck and hit a good new recipe , the knowledge I listed above ( combined with some baking experience ) helps you increase your first-try success rate from about 2-3 % as a full amateur to somewhere about 80 % or more . It is your decision how to divide your time between reading and baking , any combination can function , depending on your learning style .
Yes , it depends on brand , humidity , etc. . My local variety is 1:4 to 1:4.5 ( polenta : water ) to get to that softness level Add nothing else until you have the polenta at the desired consistency and softness
There are a few questions on this site about French fries , I 'd suggest you take a look . But I think the best answer is : baked sticks of potato do not French fries make . French fries are deep fried . You can never get the same results in air , although air fryers do come close . A normal oven bakes , not fries . Here are some sites that experiment with fries and crispiness <URL> <URL> .
I admit , I 've never attempted making stroop ( apple or otherwise ) on my own ... but some <URL> mentioned that there 's something called ' <URL> ' which sounds like it might be quite similar , based on the description of the end consistency and the amount of sugar used .
Add baking powder to the mixture , if needed , as it will cause them to puff up and lighten when cooked . Adding a little cream may also help . I have a Gulab Jamun recipe from " Dance of Spices " by Laxmi Hiremath , pg 412 , which lists the following for the dough : 0.5 cup ( 120 mL ) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 cups ( around 470 mL ) powdered nonfat dry milk 1 tsp ( 5 mL ) baking powder 1 cup ( 236 mL ) heavy whipping cream ( probably listed as " double cream " where you live , see <URL> ) about 1 TBSP water ( 15 mL ) The dry ingredients are mixed , then the cream is gradually mixed in , and the water is added to make a smooth , pliable dough .
Butter and cooking oil are not interchangeable in every recipe . Butter actually has water in it , while oil is a pure lipid . This can cause problems with water-sensitive preparations , for example a choux paste ( where the proper ratio of water to flour is extremely important ) or anything using melted chocolate ( where the water in butter can cause it to seize ) . Butter can also be whipped ; oil definitely can not ( except coconut oil ) . You normally would n't use olive or sunflower oil in , for example , an icing . Butter is a solid at room temperature , while oil is a liquid . When making something that needs to be relatively solid - for example , bread or pie dough or anything requiring a <URL> - you do not want to substitute butter for oil . Shortening is a better substitute . Butter has a much lower smoke point and will scorch at temperatures that oils are often subjected to . You have to be very careful when frying anything in butter , and you 'll need to watch carefully if baking with butter at very high temperatures . You have to understand the recipe you are making if you want to know how to do the conversion ( or if a conversion is even possible ) . If the recipe is fat-dependent , you need to use more butter than oil . If it is water-dependent , you generally should use less butter . If it is both , you likely ca n't do a direct substitution and will have to add or remove something else . And if the recipe relies on the solid/liquid state of the fat , then you simply can not substitute . Muffins just happen to be one of those things where it really does n't matter much . Like all quickbreads , you can vary the amount of fat substantially and all it will do is change the texture of the final dish ; quickbreads with more fat tend to be richer , more moist , and less dense . The Joy of Cooking recipe for waffle batter recommends anywhere from 1/4 cup to 1 cup of butter , which is a pretty wide margin of error ; in recipes like that , you can usually play fast and loose with the substitutions .
For what it 's worth , I read once that you should briefly soak seitan in a bowl , covered in boiled water , to soften it up before using it . I have tried this , and it really does make a difference in the final texture . I typically cut it into cubes , soak it for about 10-15 minutes , then drain it and proceeded as normal for the recipe .
It 's probably OK but there are a lot of variables here so from where I sit , it 's difficult to be certain . Cooking will kill most bacteria . If the soup went from the pot , hot , to the container and capped immediately , the risk of airborne bacteria getting in is reduced . It takes more than a couple bacteria to get you sick but when conditions are right , bacteria multiply exponentially in a short period of time . If the container was at 72F , that 's better than if it was at 90F ... as if it was outside in the sun . You can give it a sniff to check if it smells OK . Reheating to a boil will kill most bacteria , but depending on the specific bacteria , not all . What 's more , certain bacteria leave behind toxins that are not easily destroyed . If you have a pressure cooker , that 's the best way to kill whatever bacteria might be in there . You would need to keep it in the cooker for a period of time ... 30 minutes perhaps . Seems like a lot of trouble to go to . Dry bouillon cubes should not have any bacteria ... assuming a clean manufacturing plant . Same goes if you used dehydrated chicken . It 's more likely bacteria got in if fresh uncooked chicken was used . Unwashed hands , contaminated utensils , used hand towels , unclean work area ... all that stuff comes into play . You probably already know about cross contamination . But here 's the thing ? Why risk it ? Salmonella will not likely kill you but your stomach will be churning and you 'll be spending some time in the bathroom . There are other bad actors out there and they are worse than Mr. Sal Minella ... Staphlococcus , E. Coli , Botulinum . My answer is , to be safe , toss it .
Looking at this recipe I do n't see any reason why you could n't use puff pastry as the container . The only ways that the preparation would be different is : puff pastry does n't dry out as fast as filo so you do n't have to worry about the wet towel in the instructions . You would n't want to do multiple layers of puff pastry as the recipe calls for . You would just form a single pouch to hold your filling and seal it well . Know that the texture will be different of course . The filo will be a bit more crisp and the layers larger and more distinct - filo is also a lot more work . You may find that the baking time needs to be adjusted a little but I do n't think it will be very different if at all . Cook them until they 're golden using the recipe 's time as a starting point . This recipe is in a Mediterranean style and filo would be more traditional but puff pastry would produce something tasty .

What are safe , effective practices for smoking salmon in a commercial smoker ?
I am projecting here , perhaps , but I think the question you 're asking is " why does n't my salmon come out moist and succulent like what I get at the store ? " A couple reasons . First : you want to properly cure the salmon for at least 24 hours beforehand . 36 is better . To cure , you will need two whole sides of salmon ( or one cut in half ) , with the skin on . Rub your cure into the flesh -- so 2:1 salt : sugar , plus whatever other spices you care to use . The addition of brandy sounds lovely ; I like tequila or a nice peaty/smoky Scotch myself , or maple syrup ( but obviously nix the sugar if you 're doing that ) . Place the two pieces together , flesh to flesh , optionally including herbs between . Wrap very tightly in plastic , completely sealed , bung into your fridge to let it cure . Second : when the fish is cured , remove from the wrap , rinse off the cure . Third : time to smoke . If you want dry and flaky , hot smoke -- this seems to be what you 're doing and what you do n't like . Therefore , it 's cold smoke time . The two basic ways to do this are either to add LOTS of trays of ice to the smoker itself , or to route the smoke through a cooler filled with ice and then back into your smoking chamber . A quick Google should provide you with diagrams for doing so . Do not over-smoke . Fish picks up flavours quite readily , and will dry out if oversmoked , even if cold . Really for salmon I do n't think you need much more than 20 minutes of cold smoke .
I think a bread knife would shred the skin and flesh . I would place skin side down and , ideally , use a sharp slicing knife . Sharp is the key . I have also used a chef 's knife and a fillet knife for this task . The goal is to achieve a clean cut .
I have been told that cedar , white and yellow pine , and many other variaties are safe in normal quantities and have high vitamin content . Some have supposed medicinal effect for headaches , such as cedar . My advice is to look up " tea " or " infusion " with each type of needle you want to try so you can avoid a poisonous concoction . As for white pine , I have made delicious tea for breakfast and for the canteen with it while camping and have survived so far . It goes quite well with wild mint .
Let 's start with the assumption that Safety is never in the balance . Safety has to be taken into account for any method that we use and that means that we want to keep any food that is time and temperature sensitive out of the danger zone . The danger zone is the temperature range from 40 degrees F to 140 degrees F . If you have plenty of time , letting the turkey defrost in the refrigerator is safest and easiest , since there is little that you have to do . The turkey is always out of the danger zone and all you have to do is put it in the refrigerator . However , it can take a very long time , 24 hours for each 5 pounds of turkey weight ... 4 days for a 20 pound turkey . Assuming you have n't planned that far ahead , the other safe method is to defrost in the sink with cold running water . The water does n't need to be pouring out , just a steady stream so the water turns over regularly . Water is a better conductor of heat than air , so the turkey will defrost more rapidly than in the refrigerator . The danger zone is why you do n't want to defrost the turkey using warm water , or just sitting on the counter . In either of those cases , the outside meat is warmed into the danger zone before the inside defrosts , so you have some of the meat ( the part that is most likely to have come into contact with contaminants ) in a temperature range that promotes bacterial growth .
The vanilla chapter of Ian Hemphill 's " Spice and Herb Bible " says , Vanilla is also delicious in savory cooking because it is not overtly sweet . An innovative Mauritian restaurant in Sydney served a delicious vanilla chicken [ ... ] It was aromatic delicate and beautifully balanced . The same book has a recipe for Vanilla Salmon Salad where vanilla seeds are scraped into the dressing . I did a quick taste test using vanilla extract with various savory things from my fridge . Here are the results : Cheese : tasted fine , but I would n't call it a taste sensation ; Vegeburger : nasty combination ; I think the leeks in the burger were a problem ; Avocado : actually quite a nice combination ; Roasted aubergine : not bad ; Tomato : fine ; Savory omelet : not good ; onions do n't seem to work with vanilla extract ; Baked beans in tomato sauce : very nice . Note that using vanilla extract and a vanilla bean to flavor a dish are not the same thing . There is an amount of alcohol in the vanilla extract I used ( bourbon ) and this may completely invalidate the test . Having said that , the first indications are that alliums ( onions , leeks , garlic etc ) do n't go with vanilla . So onion soup may not be a good plan . And since curry generally contains plenty of onion and garlic , I 'm skeptical about using it there too . Turning to the question of whether vanilla and vanillin become dangerous when heated , the answer is almost certainly no . That does n't mean that heating vanilla is inconsequential . Harold McGee 's " On Food and Cooking " mentions that vanilla beans contain more than 200 volatile compounds and notes , Prepared vanilla extracts [ ... ] are best added toward the end of cooking ; any period of time spent at a high temperature causes aroma loss . On the other hand , heating vanillin at normal cooking temperatures ( i.e. normal for soup and curry ) is not a problem . Its <URL> . As another answer mentions , vanilla has a more complex taste to pure vanillin . Most of what you will read comparing the two will be very much in favor of using real vanilla beans in cooking . Instead of repeating this advice , I 'm reminded of having read that in a Cook 's Illustrated <URL> to synthetic vanillin , the artificial flavoring came out on top . It 's probably not be enough to conclude that vanillin tastes better than vanilla but may encourage you to forge ahead if vanillin is all you can afford . Update : Having read @papin 's suggestion that you may need to caramelize the onions , I just did a quick taste test with rostad lök ( not sure how it translates from Swedish , the literal translation is toasted onion ) . It tasted slightly better but still not great . Again , I 'm using vanilla extract so my taste test is not necessarily valid .
I found the following information in <URL> : Because it is EU-designated external use only , [ mustard oil ] is therefore exempt from shipping regulations that would apply to foods . Thus , it can be shipped in a container truck that had previously contained , say , motor oil , or even something worse . This probably was the cause of the poisonings , because people have been consuming mustard oil for millennia without ill effect despite the current EU designation -- which seems to be causing greater problems than it is trying to save us from . I have n't personally verified this statement , but if true , it 's best to avoid the " for external use " oil .
Naan traditionally is plain flat bread made using <URL> , Yeast , salt and water . Its cooked in tandoor . Salt could be optional if you are having naan with a curry . ( Cause curry usually has salt and the bread might not need it ) . Variations like milk or yogurt is used instead of water to make dough soft and fluffy . This would change the texture and flavor of the bread . It is possible to use baking powder instead of yeast , because they both act as a leavening agent . Do n't use them together . IMHO eggs are not part of the traditional naan ingredients .
They are okay to eat . The sprouts on the other hand can be very acidic and SHOULD NOT be eaten . As long as you make sure you wash the potato thoroughly you should n't have to worry .
My first instinct was no way , remembering that the branches and leaves contain a high amount of <URL> , which is a neurotoxin and not without risks , especially if used over a long time or while pregnant . This is the same stuff that caused absinthe to be discredited for decades . But Thuja oils typically contain 40 % α-thujon , sage ( salvia officinalis ) up to 60 % . Thuja 's pungent smell would prevent ingesting too much . So my conclusion would be : do not use for a long time or when pregnant ( most midwives caution against using sage , too , btw . ) use sparingly for health reasons , a limited amount is considered safe by health agencies world wide , <URL> for example . use very sparingly for culinary reasons , because the taste is quite " pronounced " . I had to take a herbal medicine with thuja decades ago and still shudder to think of it . ( It did work , though ... ) When thinking of potential culinary uses , think of uses for sage or juniper - you will want to use it as a spice in foods that can " handle " the woody , bitter tinge . Dark red meat or even game perhaps ? Complement with a generous amount of pepper and perhaps a good red wine . Another approach that might be worth a try is sweetening it up - like " fir syrup " ( is this known in American cuisine ? ) .
The main goal with temperature is to kill anything nasty . Those nasties die based on temperature and exposure . Much like a human could live forever at 95 degrees , for a long while at 110 , shorter while at 150 , and would die instantly at 750 , so for all the stuff in Pork . 160 is considered a safe temperature because at 160 , everything dies instantly . The FDA has a chart for all this , <URL> . You 'll see that even 120 degrees is safe IF you cook it for 21 hours ! I cook a lot of sous vide , so these temperatures and times are easy to get and be precise about . The thing you need to be careful about is that the time table shows the amount of time that the whole piece of meat needs to be at a given temperature , so make sure you heat it through before you start counting . I 'll regularly do pork chops in the 135 range , and it 's lovely and moist without the stringy overcooked texture you get when well done .
There is one very different issue to be kept in mind - water in a microwave can overheat and " explode " once it is disturbed . Another poster had exactly this problem a short while ago : <URL> So follow the usual precautions , e.g. putting a wooden toothpick or a small , very clean stone ( chemists have them in their labs ) in your vessel . In a pinch , a spoon will do , but not all microwaves handle metal objects well . If you are worried that heating your water in a microwave might not be sufficient to kill all " nasties " , remember that killing bacteria is a function of time and temperature , so you might feel safer if you not only bring your water to a boil , but continue boiling it for another minute or so . I would assume that this is mostly for your psychological benefit , but it certainly wo n't hurt . The temperature reached is identical for different heating devices as physics dictates the boiling point of water and it ca n't exceed that as long as it 's liquid .

In between freezings it is wisest to cook it . So if you take out raw meat , and then cook it , you can freeze it again . If you take out cooked stuff , you should get it piping hot throughout , cool it quickly , and then freeze it again . It may not have a super pleasant texture - if you do n't ave an emotional attachment to it , you might want to just toss it .
At a bare minimum , you 'll want at least one " flavoured " and one " unflavoured " oil . Olive oil is definitely the most common choice for a flavoured oil , and sunflower/peanut/canola oil all have pretty neutral flavours ( not to mention similar smoke points ) . Note that for good flavour you 'll want extra virgin olive oil , which also makes it unsuitable for frying/saut éing at high temperatures . So I would say that you already have the minimum requirement . That said , even the " unflavoured " oils have subtly different flavour characteristics due to their different fat contents , and you 'll want to take this into consideration if you like to cook in ethnic cuisines . A short list ( and keep in mind that this is partially subjective ) : Peanut oil : Asian cuisine , Mexican cuisine ( high-temperature frying ) Sesame oil : Asian cuisine ( stir-fry or deep-fry [ refined only ] ) Olive oil : Italian cuisine , French cuisine ( low-temp ) Sunflower or Canola oil : American cuisine , esp . deep-frying Grape seed oil : Decent substitute for any of the other oils Walnut/almond oil : Great for fried desserts ( watch the smoke point though ) .
I 've found a <URL> on Walmart.com that has some interesting tidbits . For functionality alone , looks like a glass jar should do the job well . Something like this would have an advantageous shape to make cookies easier to reach , and the jar less prone to falling . One feature you may want to look for specifically would be an hermetic sealing lid , which would help keep moisture in the jar and slow down the drying . Same kind of jar that is often used to store flour , sugar , coffee , beans , etc. . Is light sensitivity a factor ? I do n't think it would be , in most cases , unless you kept your cookies in an area that is heavily lit by the sun .
I use mine as a heat shield in my grill to create indirect heat for slow smoked BBQ . I also use it to cook pizza on my grill , but that 's not really a different use .
I 've got one of the professional series Kitchen Aids ( and my parents have the traditional version to compare and contrast ) . If money is n't a huge deal , then getting the professional series comes with a more powerful motor and a heavier base that will stop the mixer from " walking " around the counter if you put dough or something dense in the mixer . One odd thing that I did n't expect is that the mixer is really inconvenient for small things . It can whip up like a triple batch of whipped potatoes , but it has the darnest time whipping up a little bit of whip cream or a little merangue . Kitchen Aide 's attachments are pretty rock solid ... One of our more " fun " attachments that we have is the ice cream bowl . Freeze the bowl , dump the ingredients and set the paddle on low . Again , with the professional model , the motor is strong enough to churn a bit longer than traditional other ice cream churns ... IMO , if you 're a big dough cook , go w / the stronger model , otherwise the smaller models should be great . EDIT In an interesting note , my sister has one of the smaller models and it did infact " walk " off the counter a few weeks ago ... The whole machine went crashing to the ground ... She picked it up , dusted it off , but the only damage was a small piece of plastic broke off ... Got ta give it to Kitchen Aide
Given the source ( Michael Ruhlman ) and that it was linked by Seriouseats , I am willing to bet cash money that not only does it work exactly as stated , it will provide spectacular results .
For burgers I buy 2-3 different cuts - usually some sirloin and the end of a tenderloin ( fattier and cheaper ) and whatever else looks good . Slice thinly and stick in the freezer for 20 mins or so before you start grinding . I then mix in some finely minced onion and garlic , salt , pepper and a little Worcestershire sauce ( all optional and to taste ) before grilling .
DO I has to ? Nobody learned it ? Garum , a fermented sauce made with anchovies as the principal ingredient , was the Romans ' legacy to Britain when they left GB for home . They put the stuff in everything - Roman Fricassee of Dormouse would be naturally adorned with garum , Roman asparagus would have to be served with garum ... There was a sauce , Worcester sauce , that had disputed origins - but was obviously based on an English version of garum , . So there was a historic Dickensian precedent a la Jarndyce v Jarndyce between Lea and Perrins , who sold Worcestershire sauce to avoid argument , and Hammonds of Bradford who sold something very similar marked " Yorkshire Relish " , which they acquired when they bought Goodall , Backhouse of Leeds . What happened was that Hammonds won , in that for a brief period they sold WORCESTER sauce without dispute about the name , instead of calling it Yorkshire Relish . Just after that they were taken over by some multinational who did n't give a tinker 's cuss about that valuable TM , just the market share . Some brands , including Yorkshire Relish , were sold to an Irish company who are still making the " thick " Yorkshire Relish brown sauce in Ireland , but not the " thin " version we are discussing here . Lea and Perrins are still selling Worcestershire sauce . The Hammonds Sauceworks brass band are still performing , although the factory produces no Yorkshire Relish . There is a factory somewhere producing Henderson 's Relish , which is very similar to Worcester sauce , but made in Sheffield with no Garum - never seen an anchovy . At least Lea and Perrins still produce the closest thing to a traditional product which goes back 2,000 years . Whatever they do with the anchovies , that component is said to be left for three years to mature .

What uses are there for basil flowers ?
If you pinch off the basil flowers as they start to grow , the plant will produce more leaves . ( Yes , this is a horticultural answer , but it will help you make more yummy dishes with the leaves . )
The weight of flour varies immensely depending on how densely it 's packed and the humidity . If you 've started with a weight-based recipe , I 'd try to find a scale . If that 's absolutely not an option , I tend to approximate 100g = 1 cup . Be warned , I 've found some recipes that are really sensitive to the amount of flour and the difference between a lightly sifted cup and a scooped cup can really throw off the results . You might do better to try to divide another kg package of flour evenly and use the approximation that 0.6 lb is about 0.25 kg ( i.e. one quarter of the bag ) .
I have made Asian coleslaws multiple times , and they work very well . My main suggestion would be to heat the dressing before adding it to the slaw . Particularly if you 're using scallions , the heated dressing wilts it just enough to cut some of the sharpness of the raw veggies . I 'd probably make my own dressing from rice vinegar , neutral oil ( such as canola ) and a touch of sesame oil . Add in spices such as garlic , ginger , etc. . You can also vary recipes such as <URL> . You could also try using unexpected ingredients . I make a salad from cubed jicama , apple , and ripe avocado , topped with lemon juice , olive oil , and a touch of chili powder or cayenne . You get the crisp sweetness and some creaminess from the avocado . If they 're not fans of cucumbers , how do they feel about pickles ? Those could also be a nice addition to a coleslaw . Or you could try marinated mushrooms . Either of those would add a vinegary sharpness that would cut nicely through the creaminess of the rice and the satay . This also brings to mind a preparation I 've seen for vegetables in a prepared salad . Blanch your veggies and shock them in an ice bath . Then give them a vinegary dressing and lay them on the plate in attractive ways . This could include green beans , carrots , beets , broccoli , cauliflower , asparagus , potatoes , etc. . You could achieve similar effects by serving roasted vegetables . ( Either from the grill or oven-roasted . ) These are quite good cold or warm .
For burgers I buy 2-3 different cuts - usually some sirloin and the end of a tenderloin ( fattier and cheaper ) and whatever else looks good . Slice thinly and stick in the freezer for 20 mins or so before you start grinding .

I always just give fresh basil a chop and toss it in . You can use fresh herbs raw or cooked in any fashion you wish and find delicious . They are fairly forgiving as long as you do n't let them spoil or burn them .
I have noticed that basil changes its taste as it ages , but not as to get bitter . On the other side , I like a bitter taste , so I often overlook ( overtaste ? ) bitter notes to which other people show a strong reaction . Try getting some fresh basil and comparing the taste/aroma of the fresh and the old one , maybe it is really just the aging difference you perceive as unpleasant . I regularly use the stems when I have fresh basil . Generally speaking , you can not deceive your brain to not perceive bitterness ( unlike sourness , which is counteracted by sweetness - the pH value of Coca Cola ( 2.6 ) is lower than that of tomato juice ( 4.1 ) , but the soft drink is perceived as sweet , not sour ) . But if you mix it with another basic taste , the combination might feel much better than the pure bitter taste . The other strategy would be to just dilute with something bland , in order to reduce the bitterness intensity . Most adults actually like some bitterness if it is not too intense . The third option would be to use something with a very strong flavour to mask everything , e.g. add lots of raw onions and/or garlic , or just make it so hot you do n't actually pick up much of a taste . I am not a fan of this solution , but your mileage may vary . As for a taste combination , which taste should you pick ? Strangely , people tend to think that a sweet taste is well suited to somehow " mask " bitterness , which I can not confirm . For me , both tastes , bitter and sweet , stay there , and one does n't mask the other , they just create a specifically unharmonious combination . In my experience , bitter + sour is a much better combination ( think grapefruit , cranberries , or tonic water ) which can even allow for a small amount of sweetness , without making it clash . But it is also good to make a combination of bitter + salty taste . While umami can be combined with bitter too , it does n't diminish the unpleasant sensation of the too bitter . As for your specific problem , I often eat basil dips , only I tend to base them on feta cheese . I sometimes add sour cream or other dairy products , but usually less sour cream than cheese . I think that it will be a good solution for your problem , as it will both complement the bitterness with a strong salty taste , and dilute the bitterness concentration as you will be using lots of it . I also almost always add lemon juice ( should help for the bitterness too ) and a dash of olive oil ( which should n't affect the taste , only the aroma ) . Another ingredient which does well in a basil dip are green or blonde olives , if their salt level is not too high . For a basil dip , I usually throw everything in a bowl and smooth it with the immersion blender . If you are n't sure that you 'll like the taste , try tasting a spoon of your current dip with a small piece of feta and/or an olive before committing more ingredients to something you 'll ultimately throw out .
Pickled ginger is the proper palate cleanser to use with sushi , which helps keep flavors from mixing when you 're trying several different kinds of rolls . So at least with sushi there 's a specific palate cleanser , and I imagine there are others for other types of food .
If you want something storebought , just get pumpkin puree - it is squash puree , not really even a substitute . Pumpkins are squash , and " pumpkin " is a pretty broad term , covering a lot of winter squash . In fact canned pumpkin is often made with things more similar to butternut squash than what you 'd think of as pumpkin ( jack-o ' - lanterns and all ) . Just make sure you do n't accidentally get some kind of pumpkin pie mix that has spices and maybe other things added . I suppose if you ca n't find that either , you could also look at baby food , since squash is fairly common there . If you really ca n't find anything in the store , though , do n't just give up on the recipe . It really is incredibly easy to make - just cut squash in half , throw in the oven cut side down , bake until it 's soft , scoop it out and mash up a bit . The actual active working time is only a couple minutes , and you 'll probably get much better flavor than you would from canned goods .
You can use any neutral flavored oil , such as vegetable or canola oil . You can also use butter , but you may have to adjust for the amount of water present in the butter ( about 20 % ) , unless you 're using clarified butter which is a 1:1 substitution .
The term " double " is not specific to pork - it 's also used with lamb - but it means something different in each case . A lamb double chop or loin double chop differs from a regular loin chop by including both the top loin and tenderloin , but not the flank . It has n't actually been cut twice . A pork butterfly chop is sometimes called a " double chop " because , as the name implies , it 's been <URL> . A very thick cut is taken from the loin eye and then cut again to make the butterfly . Of course , if you cut a butterflied pork chop in half , and served just one half , it would basically be a regular pork chop . So if you that 's what you actually got , I 'd call it a marketing gimmick . I 've never actually heard the term " double-cut chop " - there are some vague references to it on Google , but as far as I know , it 's not a proper butchering term . Perhaps the term got relayed through several people and mutated somewhere along the way .

Naan traditionally is plain flat bread made using <URL> , Yeast , salt and water . Its cooked in tandoor . Salt could be optional if you are having naan with a curry . ( Cause curry usually has salt and the bread might not need it ) . Variations like milk or yogurt is used instead of water to make dough soft and fluffy . This would change the texture and flavor of the bread . It is possible to use baking powder instead of yeast , because they both act as a leavening agent . Do n't use them together . IMHO eggs are not part of the traditional naan ingredients .
<URL> seeds in rye bread is - in some parts of the world - a tradition . Generally speaking , certain flavour profiles are traditional in different cuisines , not ubiquitous ( see your baguette counter example ) , for many types of food . For rye bread , taking European areas into account where there is a " rye bread tradition " , Northern Europe ( Scandinavia , Northern Germany ) uses caraway , Central Europe is undecided and Southern Tyrol ( the German-speaking parts of Italy ) would use <URL> instead , other regional cuisines leave their rye breads plain . The reason why particularly rye breads tend to be " spiced " - as opposed to wheat-dominant breads - is that rye breads can be harder to digest and needs a sourdough step to be baked into proper bread . And seeds like caraway , <URL> or the blue fenugreek mentioned above have traditionally been used to aid digestion . If you are buying rye bread in other parts of the world , especially the US , the predominant group of immigrants from Europe may as well have brought their specific " rye bread flavour profile " with them .
You can eat even shell . Ground shell is used in French <URL> to thicken the soup and make it more flavored .

According to <URL> , which is one of the few references I could find : They are essentially fully cooked beans that have then been dehydrated for long term storage . Therefore , they will " cook " again quickly as they are already cooked , and are essentially just being rehydrated . If you listen to the video ( it is mostly narration , and a few still pictures , and are very , very , very patient in listening ) , the narrator will describe how she creates them which comes down to : Pre-soak the beans Pressure cook them Dehydrate them Note that the first two steps are probably not that critical -- you could cook the beans by whichever method you prefer .
Salt that is used for food consumption is always meant to be sodium chloride ( and may or may not contain other things such as iodine ) . Other " salts " ( to use the term in the chemistry sense ) such as potassium chloride are not generally used by themselves for human consumption or specified in food preparation , even though they are potentially safe to eat . <URL> is still 85 % sodium chloride but because it has additional chemicals/elements/compounds in it , does have a different taste . For best results when baking , use plain table salt , sodium chloride , with or without iodine ( which is added to provide a necessary nutrient for those not living near a salt-water source of fish or not eating enough salt-water fish ) . Note from the link that sea salt does not contain enough iodine to supply a nutritionally adequate amount .
Good question @mfg . I hope I can help a little bit . The basics behind the egg wash are to provide for a couple different thing . These being shine , crispness , and color . Shine The shine is primarily provided by the egg yolk . The higher concentration of yolk the more shine . Crispness This come from the egg whites . The whites make things a little crispy and sometimes can crackle a little bit ( mainly when usually by themselves ) . Color This comes from the fat and protein . Leaving the yoke in along with the shine will add color . You can add water to lighten the color a bit . I find that using the white also dilutes the color a bit but not as much ( but the white also makes it crisp ) . Add cream or milk to get it a little bit darker . Salt I often find people adding salt to an egg wash . I does provide some flavor to the crust , but I have noticed that for some reason ( when using a whole egg ) it does allow it to get a little darker than it would normally . Sugar Like salt it adds flavor ( sweetness ) to the crust . And it will also add some color . Especially if baking at a higher temp and using a raw or brown type sugar . Alcohol I have seen the use of alcohol quite a number of times . From the results I have seen it behaves like water . Although not the the same degree . My guess is that it has to do with how fast the alcohol evaporates . As far as flavor , I ca n't say that it added much at the levels used . I did once definitely get a hint of a bourbon being used in the wash on a pretty plain white loaf . But they did mix in quite a good amount of bourbon to just an egg yolk . That is all I have really used myself or seen . I am sure that you can use other liquids although I do n't know what vinegar would do . Just keep in mind if they are high in fat , protein , or sugar they will add color . Otherwise they will lighten the color . I have also seen melted butter just used as a wash . It adds a nice color and buttery flavor . I have n't seen it added to egg wash but I would assume you could add to egg yolk to get a shine and probably darker color than cream/milk . Another important thing to remember is to beat your wash well when using for a bread coating . Unlike if your just using the was was to seal say a ravioli . If your egg was is spotty not one nice fully incorporated mixture your crust can also be spotty .
Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it ( it 's not quite vinegar , not quite wine ) . I 'd probably try a blend of some other mustard + a little white wine vinegar ( not white vinegar ; white wine vinegar ) or champaigne vinegar or apple cider vinegar . ( Maybe even a dry white wine , if you have that on hand ) . If you have dry mustard powder , and some time to let it sit , you could also try making your own ; most of the recipes online seem to use a dry white wine as their base , a few use white wine vinegar .

Can I leave the okara in when making tofu ?
The okara has some unextracted protein and sugar but it also has a large quantity of fiber . That fiber will prevent the protein from properly coagulating . If you leave in all the okara you get soybean porridge . I imagine you could leave in a portion of the okara and you would get a fragile but hearty tofu . The problem with this is that , with most tofu recipes , the beans are not cooked long enough for the okara to be palatable . With all that sugar it would also give rise to much more flatulence . You do n't have to throw the okara out . There are many recipes that make use of the okara for its fiber . It is pretty straight forward to use it in baked goods . Toasting it gives it more interesting flavor . If you want to look into tofu-like products that use the entire bean you could research tempeh . The whole beans are fermented so you get a meaty product with all the nutrition of the whole soy bean .
tl ; dr Either way is fine . When making ice cream - your quest is to bind up water . Water crystallizes and makes ice cream icy instead of creamy . There are a lot of ways to keep water from freezing in ice cream from reducing the volume of water in the mix , to using natural antifreezes , to binding the water up with gums or starches . Sugar loves water . The water will eagerly hook up with sugar and wo n't be able to freeze . If you macerate your cherries two things will happen - 1 - Water will be drawn out of the cherries and 2 - The water that is left in them will be saturated with sugar and slower to freeze . The result is that the cherries will be softer , sweeter ( of course ) , be slightly more concentrated , and not freeze solid . If you do n't macerate them then they will be little chunks for cherry ice . Both ways are perfectly tasty and I 've had ice creams that do it either way . It just depends what you want to make .
You are better off making the crumpets in advance and then reheating them . The rising agent in crumpets is usually bicarbonate of soda or baking powder , and so the batter ca n't be ' held ' in the fridge like a yeasted batter - it would be very dense if you left it too long . So , make the crumpets , then reheat them . I 'd suggest using the toaster - this is how crumpets are sold and prepared in the UK . Make sure you have plenty of salted butter on hand too !
Eggs are already 3/4 water anyway ! By mixing in a small quantity of extra water before you cook the eggs , you are slowing down the cooking process by making more water available that has be evaporated . This keeps the cooking temperature to less than 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) for longer , therefore increasing the the time for the egg proteins to foam and expand before setting The amount of water you need to add depends on ; personal preference , the type of egg , and how old it is . Older eggs generally require a little more water Adding skim milk will enhance this process slightly too . Adding extra fat will generally not enhance this process BONUS TIP To make even more spectacular omelettes place a loose fitting lid over the pan to increase the steam exposure all around , and let the egg fully develop
Its been a while but I found this thread as I was wondering the same thing ... Not much info on raw okara but I just googled raw soybeans ... " For human consumption , soybeans must be cooked with " wet " heat to destroy the trypsin inhibitors ( serine protease inhibitors ) . Raw soybeans , including the immature green form , are toxic to humans , swine , chickens , and in fact , all monogastric animals . " From wikipedia <URL>
I happen to have watched a TV show the other day about this very problem and they suggested making a big batch of whatever filling or fillings you are thinking of using ( presently or in the future ) and go ahead and make them all up and freeze them ready to cook . They were making several kinds of ravioli that day . They made them all up and placed them on cookie sheets to freeze and then placed them in ZipLock bags and they had a nice supply to pull out of the freezer whenever they were ready to cook them . They did n't have a problem with brittle wontons once they were filled . They used beaten egg to seal the edges so the filling would n't ooze out . You can use this same method for any shape or filling ... does n't have to be ravioli , of course .
I usually do n't buy crumbled tofu , but since you have that , I would suggest making tofu burgers . Add another hearty ingredient , like lightly roasted finely chopped walnuts , or baked eggplant cubes . Combine with chopped onions , garlic , grated carrots , and breadcrumbs . Bind with beaten egg . Season with your choice of herbs or spices , such as thyme , oregano , basil . Form into patties , fry lightly in olive oil and sprinkle with tamari ( or soy sauce ) until both sides are browned . Bake until fully cooked in the oven at 375 degrees . Serve on a bun just like a beef patty .
The reason is that butter can inhibit gluten formation . It ' coats ' the proteins that would form gluten . You knead the dough first to get gluten , and then add the butter afterward around the already formed gluten . You can add it earlier , you just end up with less gluten and a more tender dough . Creaming is n't usually done with bread , as its purpose is air bubble formation .
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .
Citrus zest is where most citrus flavour in a sauce or baked good actually comes from because it remains in solid form , like herbs and spices . The juice adds some flavour but it turns into solution and gets spread out over a very large surface area/volume . I do n't know why you decided not to use the zest - are you using commercial orange juice ? If so , that may be part of the problem too - processed juices are not going to be as flavourful as homemade , in part because of the mechanical separation of pulp ( even if it is subsequently re-incorporated to make a juice " with pulp " ) . Orange juice is effectively your water in this recipe so doubling it means you need to double everything else . In other words you 'll have exactly the same ratios and therefore exactly the same taste . If it came out too dry then that means you either ( a ) baked too long , ( b ) overworked the batter , ( c ) <URL> or ( d ) <URL> . Nothing to do with the OJ content . If you really want to add more orange flavour beyond what the original recipe would give you , use <URL> , it 's a highly concentrated orange flavour and is usually derived from ( surprise ! ) the zest , or made to taste like one . But I would suggest to try following the recipe correctly before doing this .
You can refrigerate all kinds of yeast-bread dough . Right after kneading , before the dough has had a chance to rise , oil the dough lightly , cover with plastic wrap or use a ziplock , and place in the refrigerator . As the dough cools in the refrigerator the action of the yeast will slow down until the dough has reached refrigeration temperature . At that point the yeast is still working , but at a snail 's pace . So , during the first few hours in the fridge it may require a punch down or two , as there may still be enough warmth in the dough for the yeast to show active signs of life . After the dough is completely cool , it may not need anything from you , but still check it at least every 12 hours or so - it may need another punch down . If at any point it grows to close to double it 's original size , go ahead and punch it down . Most doughs will be fine if babysat like this for up to 3 or 4 days . When you 're ready to bake , punch down the dough again ( if necessary ) , shape , and allow to rise as if it had never taken its little nap in the refrigerator . Of course this rise is going to take longer than non-refrigerated dough as it reaches room temperature , but it should be ready to bake when it looks like a non-refrigerated dough of the same type would look when it 's ready to bake . Bake as usual . I 'm sure there are exceptions to the basic rules I 've set out , but I 've never had a problem doing this with any yeast-bread dough .
Since I 'm not an expert in Indian cuisine , I ca n't say this for certain , but I agree with the comments so far that this seems basically equivalent to the separation of the oil from the curry . To my mind , the wording makes perfect sense , because in some cases with a lot of oil/butter , you can get separation happening early on the pan 's edges . Oil tends to float on top , and usually the center of a pan is heated more strongly over a burner . Thus , you tend to get boiling/bubbling in the center , which tends to push any floating oil toward the edges . But these recipes are not looking for that small amount of oil along the edge ( which , depending on stirring and the thickness of the curry , can stay there through much of the cooking process ) . They are specifically waiting for the time when separation increases and fat appears floating on the surface even away from the edges of the pan .
You could always blend before you strain . I find that when making soup of all kinds that a few minutes with my immersion blender does wonders for the final product . Not only does it puree all the solids into much smaller chunks , but it also makes sure that all the liquid is a homogeneous whole . After blending , I also tend to strain just to get out anything that I might have missed . I use a fine mesh strainer and a spatula to force the liquid through quickly . I also own an old flour sifter that I have used quite a few times instead of the strainer , but it does n't offer any real benefits over the other .
Replace your ladle with an ice cream scoop . You will be able to control the amount of dough for each waffle much easier . For my waffle iron and scoop I use two scoops . An additional advantage over a ladle , is that the dough releases much easier from a scoop , which reduces the probability of making a mess .
Dude you said you have cast iron . Cast iron rules . And it performs very well in the oven . No contest against glass and you can make pan sauce on the stove-top after the roasting is finished . My favorite pan to make roast chicken with is my 12 " Lodge cast iron skillet . Glass is probably better at roasting than cheap cookie style sheets , because it keeps the heat distribution fairly smooth . But glass will not hold up well to heavy roasting use and will eventually ruin your dinner when it cracks or shatters . All Clad makes a great roasting pan with wire rack . But for most roasting a simple cast iron skillet works well and is indestructible .
We have a convection oven and almost always use it . I ca n't remember the last time we did n't use convection . Our model automatically decreases the temperature , so if you set it for 300 , then it will heat to 275 . Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number , but it seems to work . Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven . Our also has a single and multi-rack mode , and it circulates the air differently in that case . We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative . I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven , but in our case , we always use it ( except for broiling of course ) .
I would store them outside , not inside the fridge . Fridge temperatures make anything containing flour go stale quickly . Of course , sometimes people have to live with it , such as when they have made a cake with perishable icing or filling . But cookies are not perishable , so they are better stored outside of the fridge . As to whether to put them in a sealed container or not , it depends on the cookie . The harder type does all right in the air , and can get flaccid in a sealed container . If they are soft , they are probably better off covered . It is still preferable to not isolate them completely , a canvas bag or a bread box with ventilation slits does better .
They do change color , just not so obviously as normal bananas . There 's a slight greenish tint that disappears as they ripen , and the red becomes a bit deeper ( some people say purplish ) . They also get softer - including the skin getting more tender , just like yellow banana skin . Just think about how bananas feel when ripe , feel your red bananas , and ( perhaps with a tiny bit of trial and error ) you can figure it out .
Why actually , I have just the link for you . <URL> Is exactly what you are looking for . And <URL> for supplies .
Good question ! Corn is very versatile . I 've found that fresh and frozen whole kernel corn are very interchangeable when used in casseroles . Most casseroles cook long enough that you could use either without making any adjustments . However , canned corn is a different animal . Because it is more processed I would use it in recipes that call for it but I would not consider it a substitute for fresh or frozen .

How do you get ' ears ' when baking bread ?
In my somewhat limited experience you have two things that affect growth of the crispy ears . As Caleb mentions using a lame to score your bread means you can cut with a bit of an angle that will promote a little flap . The second is ensuring a rapid oven spring , which will cause the flap to open as much as possible before the starches on the surface set . The key to good oven spring is having a hot enough oven ( preheat longer than you think you need to if you are using a stone or other heat-storing vessel in the oven ) , and a source of steam injection . A few ways to do get some steam : When you put the dough in , pour a 1/2 cup of boiling water into a small cast iron skillet pre-heated in the oven . Spritz the walls of the oven with water when you put the dough in . My favorite - preheat a large dutch oven , and put the dough inside the dutch oven ( lid on ) to bake . For the last 10 minutes of the bake , remove the lid . The dutch oven stores some of the initial steam release and makes for much nicer spring and crusts . Of course , only round bread fits .
Ok so you said salmon fillet . So my first question is how big is the filet . Fish do n't develop protein chains to hold together the same way red meat has . So the flakes do n't really hold together if pulled too hard , so I wonder if your fillets are too big . When I cook fish , especially salmon I try cut the fillet into serving sizes portions , maybe 2 inches across ( assuming a full sized fish here ) . This helps keep the fish to a manageable size . There is also a tool that is very aptly named because it was designed for this use and it 's called a fish turner . This is a thin and springy or turner that would better with fish because when scooping up the fish it does n't force the fish to reshape itself to the more rigid spatula and therefore you get less fish breaking apart . Do not turn the fish too many times . Leave it on one side and let it do all the cooking on that side that it needs , flip it once and let it finish . This will produce a nice crusty finish . As far as getting it to cook through the center , well that takes patience . Cook on a medium low heat but cook it for longer , like 8 minutes on each side ( experiment , do n't rely on my telling you 8 minutes ) . Then when you take the fish off the pan , put it on the plate and let it rest for a few more minutes . The fish will still be cooking on the inside and will finish up if you do n't serve it too early , but of course do n't wait so long that the fish cools . You want to serve it while it 's still hot , but not scalding hot .
Given that the frying of a cube of bread is a test for oil temperature , I suspect one or both of two things are happening here - 1 The oil is not at the correct temperature when the cubes of bread are dropped in it ; and 2 The oil temperature drops when you add too many cubes in at the same time so some get burnt and some end up soggy for the single time duration you 're cooking them for . Suggested solutions - 1 Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature for the level of browness you want the cubes of bread to be fried to . 2 Do n't over-crowd the pan . Fry them in batches , ensuring the oil temperature rises back to the correct one before the next batch is fried .
Do n't wrap the chicken in foil . Instead you can use a steamer basket inserted in a pot with the lid on ( making sure your liquid does not touch the chicken ) and steam it that way . If you do n't have a steamer basket and what you are trying to do is replace one , instead of wrapping the chicken roll that foil into balls or strips and use it to elevate the chicken above the cooking liquid in your pot . If you wrap in foil , the chicken will be cooking via the heat transfer from the foil rather than from the steam .
So I waited about 3 weeks because I was on vacation since I put my loaf in the freezer . Some notes on the dough structure The dough was fully proofed , but that meant that the structure very much resembled a cracker . It would be stiff until you broke into it , at which point it would break &amp; collapse into itself irreparably <URL> The dough was frozen into the container , so I waited about 1.5 hours for it to thaw out . That meant that the core of the dough was frozen while the outside was thawed <URL> Fortunately , the thawed dough was still just as moist as it had been went into the freezer I could not score the loaf because the interior was too frozen . The loaf therefore came out without any perforations in the top . This , along with the frozen interior , likely severely limited oven spring . I expected the non-frozen version of this loaf to have double the volume . <URL> The flavor is pretty bland , unfortunately . Overall , would not recommend unless in an emergency !
Yes , it is true that we do n't add oil to the boiling water . I 'm not aware of any good reason to waste extra-virgin olive oil that way ! Some oil is always added at the end , over the sauce , when the pasta is already in the plate ! It has to be raw , so that it retains its fruit nuances and texture . If you are doing cold pasta salad and want to avoid sticky pasta , adding oil in advance wo n't help . You have instead to wash pasta under cold water to wash the starch away ( you can put the pasta in the colander directly under the running cold tap ) .
There are two main base recipes for ice cream . French style ice cream contains egg yolks , which help make it soft , rich , smooth , creamy , custardy . Philadelphia style ice cream ( sometimes called American style ) has no eggs , and relies on the fat in the cream to keep it soft , but will still never be as rich and smooth as French style , and will still tend to freeze harder . You can make pretty much any ice cream in either style , including the pistachio-almond you want to make . You can look around for recipes without eggs ; I would n't be surprised if you manage to find one one . Or you can simply use a Philadelphia style base , and look at one of the recipes you found to see how to add the pistachio and almond . Depending on how rich you want it , you 'll want 2-3 cups of heavy cream for each 1 cup of milk ; about 3/4 cup of sugar should work , depending on how sweet you want it . If that 's not rich enough for you , you can even replace the milk with cream . ( You could also just go find a recipe for Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream and use that as a base - it does n't get much simpler than that . ) ( P.S. . You could also try gelato , something like <URL> - it uses corn starch as a stabilizer instead . )
Another physics digression . All cooked food gets hot , and everything in any given dish will have the same temperature { * } . The tomatoes do n't get hotter than the other ingredients . But they do have a tendency to burn more than certain other substances , so the question is " Why ? " . You get burned when a portion of your flesh reaches a high enough temperature { + } . The food warms your tongue , lips , etc. by heat conduction until either you move the food or your mouth parts and the food reach the same temperature ( a condition known as thermal equilibrium ) . What that common temperature is depends on the amount of heat ( i.e. thermal energy ) in the system . Some of the factors that come into play are : How much ( mass of ) food there is . How much ( mass of ) your mouth is involved ( see below ) . The initial temperature of the food . The " heat capacity " of both the food and your mouth parts , which is a property of each substance that appears as a coefficient in the thermal equilibrium equation . ( Do n't worry , I 'm not going to make you read any math . ) Water has a ( very ! ) high heat capacity , so watery foods tend to drive high final temperature and thus to burn you more easily . There is an added complication for the extra heat needed to establish a phase change ( i.e. melt solids or vaporize liquids ) called the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization . Again water has a high value for both of these numbers . How fast the common temperature is reached depends on The area of contact between the food and the mouth . Another coefficient called the thermal conductivity . This one is complicated , but liquids tend to have a high thermal conductivity and solids less so . This is where soups , sauces , and melted cheese really get you . Note that your mouth parts has a pretty low thermal conductivity , so you only get to count the surface layers in finding the equilibrium temperature . Sorry . Some consequences of all this : This is why you can peel the aluminum foil off of a pan that has just come out of a 400 degree ( F ) oven without trouble , but if you get your hand stuck in the steam plume ( which is only around 212 degrees F ) you get scalded : Aluminum has a low heat capacity , and steam has a ( very , very ! ) high one . Small bites help in two ways : less total heat means a lower common temperature , and may allow you to move the food around in your mouth , reducing the temperature of any one part . Some foods are just dangerous this way . You know what they are from experience : steam , hot soups and sauces , melted cheese , etc. . { * } Well , sort of . But take that as true for any particular region of any particular dish . { + } What temperature is that ? Good question . Maybe there is a medical professional around , 'cause I do n't know . I 'd guess around 140 -- 150 degrees F ( call it 60 -- 65 degrees C ) , but do n't quote me .
Quinoa naturally contains a bitter compound on the outside of the seed . Usually you have to rinse the quinoa to remove the bitterness but most commercial quinoa seems to have already been rinsed . So , I no longer rinse my quinoa . If you have time , it 's nice to heat a pan and add the quinoa and toast it a little ( for a nutty flavor and fluffier texture ) , then add water and salt . I typically bring the water to a boil ( 2 cups water to 1 cup quinoa plus 1/4 tsp salt ) , cover and reduce the heat to a simmer for 10-20 minutes ( or until the little tails release ) . Lately I 've found that using a rice cooker is a no-fuss way to prepare quinoa . I usually just do quinoa , water and sea salt but you can add spices while cooking it if you want to enhance the flavor . I would add vegetables afterwards . Quinoa is so quick-cooking I would n't see the need for a pressure cooker .
Perfect . Sounds like your pizza stone is nicely seasoned . Scrub it with your stiffest brush , rinse with water , no soap , done . If you 're paranoid about germs , cook it before cooking on it . Throw it in the oven at a few hundred degrees , for 15 minutes or so . Ideally , you 're supposed to heat the stone ( thus sterilizing it ) before slapping the pizza upon it anyway ( although that requires a <URL> ) .
I 'm with KatieK . That said , this ' how hot ' can be mysterious for Professionals as well . In " Seven Fires , the Argentine way of Grilling , " a book about cooking on open flame heat ( outside mostly ) , the author mentions traveling around to a bunch of Argentine steak places to time and measure what the chefs did mostly by touch and feel . So , even for a pro , getting it just right takes a lot of time and experience . If you 're persnickety , maybe you should get an infra-red thermometer .
If you are using a additional containers or surfaces in the oven for baking , you should absolutely pre-heat it with the oven . Use an IR thermometer to measure the actual temperature of the container - a dutch oven or heavy stone will take longer to come up to temperature than the air in the oven will , so the oven will claim to be preheated sooner than it is actually ready . Remember that temperature and heat are two different things - one of the benefits of using a baking stone or dutch oven or other " heavy " thing is that it stores a lot of HEAT . Air at 450F and Cast Iron at 450F contain very different amounts of heat , and it is heat that will bake your bread . You can tell that they have soaked up as much heat as they can when their temperature is close to your oven set-point , which will take a while . The only possible exception to this would be if you are just using a thin sheet metal steam tray to cover your pizza stone to trap steam , since it has so little thermal mass . A thin tray could probably be put over the bread without preheating the tray since it wo n't absorb or store much thermal energy . To prevent burning , choose containers with a good , solid handle , and get quality oven mitts , preferably with long-ish sleeves to protect your forearms .
The primary coloring agents in a traditional black Russian loaf are molasses and dark rye flour .
As you mentioned it is all about how the crystals form . Some of the factors off the top of my head : How saturated is the solution - The more sugar packed into the syrup the more easily it will crystallize . How quickly it cools - The slower the bigger the crystals Interference - Do you have a starch or other sugar molecules gumming up the works ? Obviously you already knew this from your question . Not using other sugars will help . You might also try adding more sugar to the recipe at the beginning to fully saturate your solution . The fact that you add sugar at the end and it still dissolves in makes me think your solution could take a bit more . Letting the solution cool slowly with your seed sugar at the end should help . You would think it would be easier to get it wrong . Perhaps you simply have too much experience doing it right . Ask an amateur to try out your recipe and see if they fail properly .
Standard prep for beef tongue seems to be : scrub it well and rinse , then soak it in cold water for 2-3 hours . Heat water to a low simmer ( about 200F ) and cook slowly for at least an hour per pound . Preferably cook as long as you can ( 5-6 hours ) to get a more tender result . When meat is tender and cooked , remove meat and save the broth . Cool the tongue and peel off the outer skin . The broth may be reduced and added to vegetables and meat to create a richer , meatier taco . I also found a tongue taco ( how is that NOT slang for some sexual act ? ) <URL> . Personally , I 'm also a big fan of cold boiled beef tongue with horseradish sauce . You can go from the cooked tongue straight to that just by slicing it up . Now I really want to make tongue tacos .
I spoke with the farm that sold me the kohlrabi ; they have seen people make something akin to mashed rutabaga by boiling kohlrabi for ages and ages , so it gets about that soft . Note that mashed rutabaga is apparently still firmer than mashed potatoes , but obviously soft enough to mash into a pulp . For a stir-fry , they suggested a match-stick shape rather than medallions ; my second such stir-fry found them to have about the texture of halfway-cooked onions , soft enough not to crunch anymore but firm enough to hold their shape on a fork .
I went to the farmers ' market last week and bought a variety of apples . After cooking , here 's the order from softest to firmest : McIntosh , Cortland , Winesap , Yellow Delicious . The McIntosh of course practically dissolve . If you want to make quick apple sauce , or if you like really squishy pie , they 're the best . I typically prefer Cortlands for pie , b/c they do n't totally dissolve but neither do they keep their shape . I think I 'm going to try Winesap , though ; I think they 'd work great for pie . The Winesap apples I used got very soft , but they still held their shape . Think of it like a ripe banana or pear - it has shape , but you can squish it really easily . After 30 minutes in the oven ( making apple crisp ) , they got soft enough that lightly pressing with a fork would squish them down . They did not stay as firm as the Yellow Delicious did and definitely not as firm as Granny Smith would .
The strongest smells in mayonnaise should be vinegar and egg . There should n't be any yeast , and therefore any yeast smell , so that is a bit concerning . I am not sure what might imitate a yeast smell . I do n't know how to counter the smell since I am not sure what the origination of the smell is . Does it taste okay ? Is the texture okay ? I do find that homemade and store brand mayonnaises have pretty different smells in general .
There are two safe ways to defrost , one more rapid than the other . First method is to defrost in the refrigerator . This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F , in the safe zone . This will , also , take a while . Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water . The water does n't have to run rapidly , but it should change regularly . This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air ( water is a better conductor of heat than air ) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time . If you are not going to cook it immediately , then return to the refrigerator . If you are deep frying , there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried , but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong .
Hot gasses such as steam and CO2 trapped inside the dough by the crust are important to help properly bake the bread , as well as to give it form and structure . If you cut a slice off the end of the bread before the bread has finished baking , you completely change the conditions under which the bread finishes baking : steam will escape rather than building up , the internal temperature probably wo n't rise as much , and the bread will tend to dry out rather than cook . If you 're not sure whether your bread is done , you should take its temperature . An instant-read , digital thermometer with as fine a probe as possible is best because it compromises the crust the least . For the same reasons , you should let bread cool as @justkt suggests before cutting into the loaf . Bread smells great when it 's hot , but it tastes best when it has cooled somewhat .

How many cups of flour are there in a pound ?
The weight of flour varies immensely depending on how densely it 's packed and the humidity . If you 've started with a weight-based recipe , I 'd try to find a scale . If that 's absolutely not an option , I tend to approximate 100g = 1 cup . Be warned , I 've found some recipes that are really sensitive to the amount of flour and the difference between a lightly sifted cup and a scooped cup can really throw off the results . You might do better to try to divide another kg package of flour evenly and use the approximation that 0.6 lb is about 0.25 kg ( i.e. one quarter of the bag ) .
Toasted almonds match well with hazelnuts , cumin , nutmeg , rosemary , vanilla and cinnamon . Cranberries do match well with garlic , lime , chili and onion . So from a flavor-pairing point of view , if you want a spicy dip , it would be better to make a cranberry dip in itself with cranberries , sugar , chili , pineapple and coriander , like a chutney . Mustard is a gamble . Cranberries do match well with some acidity , like lime or pineapples . I would be worried about the vinegar to be too stingy . If it 's a garlic-based dip , I would focus on garlic , onions , rosemary and cumin .
You can eat even shell . Ground shell is used in French <URL> to thicken the soup and make it more flavored .
Basically everything at all normal is safe . There is a mushroom that gets toxic if combined with alcohol , but alcohol itself is n't 100 % safe and if you 're gathering wild mushrooms you need to be safety conscious , so it 's not really something you could run into by accident or with storebought ingredients . Relevant paragraph from <URL> Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a " disulfiram syndrome " . This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century . Symptoms include facial reddening , nausea , vomiting , malaise , agitation , palpitations and tingling in limbs , and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol . If no more alcohol is consumed , they will generally subside over two or three hours . Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed , becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dL , and prominent at concentrations of 50 -- 100 mg/dL . Disulfiram has , however , been known to cause myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms , although they are milder as more time passes . Rarely , a cardiac arrhythmia , such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia , may develop .
There is no official standard . The USDA uses 125g/cup , but labels on packages claim different weights for one cup : Gold Medal brand : 130g King Arthur brand : 113g <URL> : 137g superpacked : 165g I always convert my recipes to weights using 140g/cup .
Recipe complexity is certainly a factor ( as the other answers mention ) , but there 's possibly a bigger reason : masalas often contain a very large number of spices that most western home cooks do n't frequently use . While some people ( generally more adventurous cooks ) are willing to purchase a dozen or two spices and make good use of them , that 's a bit much to expect of most home cooks . And if you do n't use the spices much , you 'd end up spending quite a bit on spices , and not even use them all before they go stale . A lot more people will be willing to make a recipe if they can just buy a jar of premade garam masala and be done with it .
Yes , ceramic knives are the " new thing , " but that does n't make them superior . The problem with ceramic knives is that you can never sharpen them , and , as mentioned in the comments , they may chip . Do n't get a ceramic chef 's knife or paring knife ; the answer to your question is zero . If you really want a ceramic knife , then buy a ceramic bread knife , although you wo n't be getting any extra performance for the money . Ceramic blade mandolines , however , are great . The ceramic blade will be sharper and hold the edge longer than a steel mandoline , and since you do n't sharpen a mandoline anyway , it does n't matter that ceramic does n't sharpen . Note , a separate , and good , question would be " what knives do I need ? " The answer is it depends , but I concur that you should not buy a " set " of knives .
Well , if you really want a " definitive " way to measure when lactic fermentation is complete , you 'd have to do a laboratory test directly for residual sugars . Most traditional foods that are lactic-acid fermented do n't have enough sugar to reach a final acidity that will self-limit continued fermentation by killing all the bacteria . ( Foods with too much sugar also often tend to spontaneously undergo yeast fermentation and lead to alcohol production instead if not monitored . ) Given the wide variety of fermentation products that can result from initial ingredients and different fermentation conditions , it 's really difficult to come up with some sort of " test strip " or something for residual sugar that is accurate . Home fermenters rarely bother with such things , but large-scale commercial fermentation sometimes tests residual sugar content for batches to ensure shelf-stability . That said , a specific recipe with specific starting ingredients will often have a target pH range , depending on the quantity of sugar in the ingredients , the amount of salt ( which in excess will inhibit further fermentation ) , desired flavor , etc. . The composition of the ingredients will determine the mininum possible pH when fermentation is effectively complete . The desired pH of lacto-fermented foods can vary anywhere from about 3.0 ( even down to ~ 2.75 for some sweet relishes ) to 4.5 ( more common in grain-based ferments , or quick-fermented vegetables meant to be used up quickly ) . To answer the specific question for sauerkraut , I 'd say most people would say sauerkraut fermentation is " complete " when a pH of ~ 3.5 or below is reached ( though opinions may vary ) . Part of the difficulty in answering the question is that home fermentation is often done with the intention of keeping the food " alive " even when it is consumed , which means fermentation will still be ongoing . In most traditional food cultures around the word , lactic acid fermentation is often deliberately incomplete , only used for a short period to transform an ingredient and then use it within a dish for consumption . This contrasts with much alcohol production , where continued fermentation in your final product can obviously create various difficulties for bottling , proper aging , etc. . And some people just prefer food at various earlier stages in the fermentation process . To take sauerkraut as an example , a pH of 4.0-4 .5 will be achieved rather quickly ( usually within a few days , depending on temperature , salt content , etc. ) . Some people prefer the taste of a fresher , crunchier product , and they may only ferment for a few days and then refrigerate to slow down fermentation significantly . Other people like to go much further and will ferment sauerkraut anywhere from a month to several months , again depending on temperature -- to achieve a final pH below 3.5 and even down to ~ 3.0 . Over time , the final product will obviously get more sour , but it will also soften and various nutritional changes will take place . It 's all a matter of preference when done at home . Lastly , in reference to the " lagering " aspect of the question , I think the closest analog in lacto-fermentation is the fact that various processes ( and various bacteria ) will work better at different temperatures . A higher temperature fermentation , for example , may result in a greater acetic acid component in the final ingredients , enhancing the " sharp " vinegar notes . At lower temperatures other bacteria may become more prominent in the fermentation , and in some temperature ranges enzymes and natural ( spoilage ) reactions may help to change flavor and texture too . Anyhow , for these reasons , some people prefer to refrigerate fermented foods or hold them for a while at " cold cellar " temperatures to allow these " aging " mechanisms to work as bacteria slow down ( analogous to lagering ) . Whether this is done after fermentation is effectively complete or at an earlier stage when the food is less sour again depends on individual preference .
What you are looking for is called wholemeal flour . Here 's a quick US to UK baking translation guide . US on the left , UK on the right : All-purpose flour = plain flour bread flour = strong flour ( both have extra gluten ) whole wheat flour = wholemeal flour 1 stick of butter is 113g ( get a scale , trust me ) 1 large egg = 1 medium egg
It depends on how much alcohol there is relative to other things -- sugars primarily , as they are about the only calorific part of most alcoholic beverages once the alcohol is gone ( alcohol is the most calorific part for sure ) . You can use the alcohol proportion by volume ( ABV ) to approximate a little . Assuming equal amounts of each : Spirits do n't leave much calorific stuff behind at all after the alcohol is gone because they 're mostly alcohol . Alcohol by volume is between 40 and 60 percent in most cases . Wine leaves a bit more , as there is more unfermented sugar remaining in the beverage you buy , but there 's still not a heck of a lot . It depends on how dry the wine is . Alcohol by volume is between 10 and 20 percent mostly . Beer can leave quite a bit , as many have significant amounts of unfermented/unfermentable sugar . This can be where ABV lets you down for estimating -- high alcohol beers are also often high in unfermentable sugar too , so when the alcohol goes you 're still left with quite a few calories . ABV can be anything from 4 to 20 percent , with the majority clustering around 5 percent . Lite beers are usually pretty low in alcohol and also pretty dry , meaning low residual sugars too . A gray area is liqueurs and the like . Many are fairly high in alcohol by volume , but also heavy on sugars . I should also point out that in many cooking applications , the calories added by the alcoholic beverage are fairly negligible , given the small amounts used relative to the number of servings . Even a Boeuf Bourguignon or Coq au Vin with a whole bottle of wine in it does n't have all THAT much wine per serving -- that whole bottle gets broken down into 6 or more servings , so each person gets less than a glass worth of alcohol-free wine calories . That probably averages something like 40 extra calories per serving .
It depends on how moist you like your jerky . A typical jerky loses half of its starting weight in moisture , so 2:1 is the proper ratio . " Low moisture " jerky can actually be 1/3 the starting weight , a 3:1 ratio . So 2-3 pounds of beef will make 1 pound of jerky .
Beans split because the seed coat is n't soft enough when the interior of the bean rehydrates . Two factors that can help ease this problem : soak your beans to make sure the seed coat is well rehydrated when the bean interior cooks . This is the big one - heavily salt your soaking water . The salt ions will replace calcium in the bean skins and soften them . You will have magically whole beans . Refer to <URL> on chili which contains this image : <URL>
Salt that is used for food consumption is always meant to be sodium chloride ( and may or may not contain other things such as iodine ) . Other " salts " ( to use the term in the chemistry sense ) such as potassium chloride are not generally used by themselves for human consumption or specified in food preparation , even though they are potentially safe to eat . <URL> is still 85 % sodium chloride but because it has additional chemicals/elements/compounds in it , does have a different taste . For best results when baking , use plain table salt , sodium chloride , with or without iodine ( which is added to provide a necessary nutrient for those not living near a salt-water source of fish or not eating enough salt-water fish ) . Note from the link that sea salt does not contain enough iodine to supply a nutritionally adequate amount .
I do n't think the amount will matter too much for cooking , just may take a bit longer , but a thermotor should help there . What I would consider doing is make the crown out of the three like you had planned and cook the fourth seperatly ( but at the same time ) . When the lamb is done carve the extra rack ( by the single bone ) and use it to garnish the crown either inside the crown poking out , or infront of the crown laying on their sides so everyone can see how perfect the lamb is cooked ... so everyone will be impressed with both the pretty crown and how well the meat is perpared .
Quite the opposite , large ginger rhizomes are more potent both in flavour and aroma , because those compounds take time in the ground to develop and accumulate ... There 's a Chinese proverb : " It 's the older ginger that 's got the punch / heat " , referring to wisdom of the elders / the experienced ... The younger rhizomes have a milder flavour , and a smoother texture ( the older ones are more fibrous ) so are used for pickling in both Chinese and Japanese cuisines ...
While I suppose this is technically possible , I would never consider trying to make this substitution . Muffins are are form of quick bread . Their structure is based on gelatinized starch from the flour , leavened by chemical leavers such as baking powder or baking soda . In chiffon cakes , sponge cakes , and angel food cakes , the whipped egg whites or meringue form the primary basis of the structure as a foam with mechanically beaten in air . These batters are much much thinner than quick bread batters , generally , so that the other ingredients can be folded with the egg whites while maintaining the foam . Instead , I suggest you take a different approach : Find a better quick bread recipe -- there are many , many good <URL> recipes easily searchable . If you do n't find a muffin recipe you like , you can always use any banana bread recipe for muffins as well , since quick breads and muffins are the same thing , just baked in different shapes . Find a recipe for a <URL> or <URL> . You can always bake these recipes in cupcake form if you like . Finding a good coherent recipe will almost certainly by easier than trying to adapt a muffin recipe you are not happy with into something else . If you are really wanting to transform recipes more generally , you need to learn the basis on which they work . You might want to read <URL> , as a starting point -- however , the ratios of ingredients are only part of the story . The other part of the story is the method or technique by which they are prepared . In the world of cakes and muffins and quick breads , these include the muffin method , the creaming method , the <URL> , and -- I do n't know a general name for this method -- but the whipped egg whites folded with other ingredients technique . Each of these methods works optimally with different ratios of ingredients , but also achieves different outcomes with the same ingredients . So you would have to analyze the individual recipe , adjust the ratio of ingredients , and possibly modify the method by which the ingredients are prepared or combined . Frankly , to lighten a muffin recipe , I would first ask : are you measuring correctly ? Too much flour is going to lead to a dense outcome , and flour is very easy to mismeasure . I would suggest always baking by weight , not volume when you can . Reputable recipe sites for baked goods will tell you the weight of flour in addition to the volume measurement , or at least tell you what the standard weight of a cup of flour is . If no such guide is provided , I find that using a 4.5 oz ( US ) standard cup for flour is pretty generally successful . My second approach would be to very , very slightly increase the amount of baking powder , maybe by 1/4 tsp increments in two different trials . If that fails , you might try reducing the flour by 25 % or 50 % , but not increasing the number of eggs ; instead , change your method from the muffin method to the whipped egg white method , separating the eggs , whipping the egg whites , and then folding them into the other wet ingredients , then gently folding in the dry ingredients . Still , when you do these kinds of changes , you need to test your recipes , keep careful notes , and so on . I still would start by researching already tested recipes that achieve the outcome you desire .
You 're very correct the grinders are pretty pricey . I believe we paid about $ 300 for ours . There are a few good reasons for me to have a grinder . Whether they are good reasons for you is your call . 1 - I can grind whatever I want . Right now I am using hard white wheat . Unbleached , hard , white wheat flour is more expensive than your run-of-the-mill flour and comes in annoyingly small bags . I also grind beans , quinoa , oats , etc. . 2 - I can control the fineness of the grind . This is a minor thing but it is nice for me to be able to experiment with the texture of the product . In practice I usually leave it on the same setting but it is finer than the flour I can purchase . 3 - Wheat flour is very perishable . I go through a fair bit of flour . As much as 200 oz in a heavy week . In order to have enough wheat flour on hand for a couple weeks it would have to live in the freezer . I do n't want to waste that much freezer space . Whole wheat berries last almost indefinitely . 4 - I like the flavor better . It tastes fresher and more nutty . This may be imagined - I have n't done any double blind tests . I should do that . 5 - Cost - I had to do some of the maths as I do n't usually pay a lot of attention to this . King Arthur white wheat flour costs approximately $ 1.00 a lbs . I buy 25lbs bags of bulk white wheat for $ 12 - $ 15 or $ 0.50 - $ 0.60 a pound . If I use around 10 lbs of flour a week ( usually a little less , it varies ) I am saving about $ 5 a week . If you do n't have access to wheat that cheap or do n't make that much bread then of course the savings will be less . As for nutrition - I read all the time that the nutrients in whole wheat flour degrade very quickly . I 'm not a chemist but those results seem plausible to me based on how quickly the flour itself degrades in quality .
To some extent , this is a question to which the answers are necessarily quite subjective . However , as a general guideline , I would suggest that you look at the bread as just another ingredient in the dish -- not as somehow distinct from the filling choices . Like any other ingredient pairing , you can evaluate the characteristics and choose things to complement each other . So if you pick your bread first , evaluate if it 's rich or mild , savoury or sweet , dense or light , crusty or soft , thin or thick , etc , and then choose fillings to complement those properties . For your fillings , there 's not only the flavour pairing of the filling and the bread to consider , but also the texture/properties of the filling . A dry filling might not be as pleasant on a dense bread because the texture would be too much the same . Similarly , a saucy filling needs an appropriate bread selection to contain it and make it easy to eat . Many pairings that are considered standard will just taste " good " to us because of tradition and familiarity , but originally , someone probably put them together for a reason . That does n't mean it 's not worth trying something different , though . With the globalization of cuisine , we have many more filling/bread choices available and you might find a new favourite by pairing a bread from one culture with a filling from another , based on their complementary qualities .
I 'll second NBenatar but with a bit more info : Carrots , onion , and garlic are n't dangerous when they sprout but they use their sugar reserves to make the sprout . They go downhill very fast and get rubbery and unusable . Whenever garlic or onions sprout I just plant them and use the greens instead . Potatoes are a little different . Even after sprouting they can still have usable parts for some time . The green portions of a potato are toxic ( not enough to be scary but I 've heard they will make you sick if you eat enough ) . It 's worth cutting away the green parts if the potato is n't soft yet .
It is likely the same as a 14 oz can of tomatoes . From the Wikipedia article on <URL> : A standard size tin can is roughly 400g ; however , the weight can vary between 385g and 425g , depending on the density of the contents . UK shops <URL> tins of tomatoes quote 390-400 grams based on what I 'm seeing . This is equivalent to 14 oz . American cans will generally say the weight in ounces and in grams if you want to double check .

How to complement a dish ?
You could certainly get a cookbook of side dishes and learn some new favourites , but what might be more useful is a book that teaches you about flavour combinations and menu planning . I would suggest <URL> as one such book . It 's not about specific recipes ( you can find those elsewhere or make them up ) , but rather it addresses the kind of skill you 're looking to learn . One technique is to consider the origin of the main dish and choose side dishes from the same region . Seasonality or market-based shopping is another approach to expanding your repertoire .
You want the ones that look like little tiny T-bone steaks . Typically they are called Lamb Chops , but look first as there are different cuts under that name . You might also consider doing a rack , which is the equivalent to a Rib Roast , but obviously much smaller . For the rack , I 'd sear it in a pan , and then broil it until done . ( 15-25 minutes , 140-160 degrees ) .
A roux normally is equal parts fat and flour . It should be fairly solid , not runny . However , it is an individual decision . I 've known guys who like it quite solid ( like me ) , but you have to whisk the hell out of it to get out all of the lumps . Normally , if I am making a sauce or soup that I ca n't strain , I will make it a little slack . I also add my roux after so I can control the thickness of the sauce or soup . Normally you are not instructed to do so , but you have greater control . If you do it this way , you have to vigorously whisk while adding , or the starches will congeal together in lumps . No big deal if it you are able to strain , but ...
I did this as an experiment last month , because I wanted a marble cake . The part that I wanted chocolate , I just swapped out a half-cup of the flour for cocoa . I should note , however , that while it tasted great , it made a denser , slightly drier cake than did the white cake batter . Next time , I plan to add a couple of teaspoons of grapeseed oil and some extra baking powder to counteract that problem .
Topside is quite a tough cut , so I 'd tend towards a longer cooking time ; as ' low and slow ' as possible , really . With other meats , escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts , like chicken breast or pork tenderloin , which would be cooked relatively quickly , so I 'm surprised your recipes call for topside .
Wilds of Russia ? If you have dry ice , just adding pieces of it ( chopped small ) to your drink will work to some extent . Here 's a vid : <URL> Be aware that not all dry ice is food grade . If no dry ice , you can get by with sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and vinegar ( acetic acid ) , or some other acid . Just mix the two chemicals , and bubble the resulting gas through your drink . Here 's an Instructable , w video : <URL> . It 'd be easy to improve on the kid 's method , for example by adding a <URL> , but the general principles are sound . Either method will cause some change in your liquid 's taste , as you 're lowering the pH by generating carbonic acid , but that 's true of any carbonation scheme .
Just to summarise the comments into an answer : To lighten the icing , you can add air to it by whipping , either by hand or with an electric mixer . It will probably be easier to do that if you loosen it a little with some milk or cream .
I have the <URL> and it works well for sweet potato fries . The product spec for them lists " Yams " which are sometimes what sweet potatoes are called in the U.S. ( technically , yes , yams are different but real yams are not often available in the U.S. ) . The <URL> specifically lists sweet potatoes : Makes French fries , sweet potato fries , zucchini sticks and other favorites
The cinnamon " sludge " is fiber . The fiber that came from the cinnamon is soluble in water . 10 grams of cinnamon is about 8 grams of fiber ( see <URL> ) . it is safe to eat / drink ( fiber ! ) in moderate amount ( chinese cinnamon or cassia is not safe in high dose because of its toxic component called coumarin ) of course , cinnamon sticks wo n't produce so much sludge . if you use a hot drink , stir it so it does n't sit at the bottom . Ceylon cinnamon ( = " true " cinnamon ) is different from Chinese cinnamon ( = " cassia " ) and may have different properties w.r.t solubility and water . Check out your container that does n't sludge , and compare with what you have been using in your grinder .
You can certainly cut meat on these , I have a large end-grain cutting board that is too large to wash conveniently in my sink . There are a number of methods to clean them : Soap and Water Soap and hot water are best for regular cleaning . Just get a rag or brush and scrub it . Dish soap is just fine for this use . Make sure to rinse and dry it thoroughly . Vinegar If you do n't mind the smell you can use undiluted white vinegar to clean and sanitize your surface . If you keep some in a spray bottle you can just spray it down and wipe it with a paper towel . If you have a big oily mess , I 'd suggest starting with the soap &amp; water method , and finishing up with vinegar . Vinegar is apparently <URL> at killing microbes , surprisingly more effective than harsher quaternary ammonium solutions . Bleach A little goes a long way with this . You only need a teaspoon or two for a quart of water . Just spray it down thoroughly , let stand 5 minutes . Finish with rinsing and drying . Like vinegar this is best as a followup to soap &amp; water for a really messy board . Lemon If you have strong garlic , onion , fish , or other smells in your butcher block you can cut a lemon in half and rub the board down with the halves . Lemon juice is a weak antiseptic , so this should be used primarily for odor control and not as a sanitization substitute . Note that regular cleaning also requires regular seasoning of your block surface . You should oil your board/block once a week , or more with frequent use . See also : <URL>
I usually notice when cutting onions and tomatoes . With a very sharp knife cutting an onion does n't cause much tears at all . As it dulls though it does more crushing than slicing which releases more gas into the air , which makes you cry more . Ripe tomatoes help because they are so tender . If it becomes difficult to slice a tomato without crushing it , your knife is too dull . A well used , properly cared for knife should require sharpening every 6-18 months , depending on usage . Mine get sharpened yearly . You may find it beneficial to read these related questions , and their answers : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Roasted garlic will get a slightly sweet flavor , dipped in a chocolate fondue can be wonderful and I have seen a recipe for garlic chocolate chip cookies . <URL>
This sounds just like my cooking technique , and I have come up with a few ways to recover from overwatering . Always lowball the amount of water Like you said , you can always add water later . But if you 're not watching the dish , you do n't want the water to run out and burn . Corn starch Corn starch is a good way to thicken up the water into something more saucy . This is my preferred method if the extra water actually has flavor , because it adds a nice sauciness to the dish . Make a corn starch ' slurry ' by mixing cold water and some corn starch , then add that to the hot dish that still cooking . You want to cook the dish for a few minutes after adding corn starch to let it thicken and cook out the raw flour flavor . You 'll have to adjust the amount of corn starch depending on how much water there is , but a little goes a long way , its WAY more absorbent than flour . Remove the lid and stir occasionally This is the easy way , but it takes a while and sometime you can cook your dish in to mush . This lets excess water evaporate , and stirring just helps that a little .
I would venture to say there is no one specific traditional side dish . If you go to Italy you are n't going to see saltimbocca with a side of anything on the menu . You can pick you primi and contorni yourself . I think s very simple mixture of roasted or grilled asparagus and/or squash would be very nice . If your wanting traditional and you are making a roman style saltimbooca ( saltimbocca alla romana ) You can try to pick a primi and contorni that would be common and traditional to that region . For example you can do " bucatini all ' amatriciana " as a primi . With a nice fennel and orange and/or artichoke salad as a side And of course to the season it is being prepared . To me that is really what is " traditional " Italian cooking .
There is nothing especially interesting going on in a hot compote . You can chill it as quickly or slowly as you want to , until it reaches the desired temperature . Food safety requires that you do n't keep it for more than 4 hours in the danger zone ( between 60 ° C and 4 ° C ) , but if it is in individual serving bowls , on-the-counter chilling should be enough . Also , do n't put large amounts of hot liquids in the fridge , you risk raising the entire fridge 's temperature to unsafe levels , and the inside of a large container wo n't cool quickly enough to leave the danger zone . If you made lots of compote at once and want it very cold , chill it in an ice water bath . The final temperature can be whatever you prefer . I eat my compote slightly colder than room temperature ( 15 ° C to 20 ° C ) . You can eat it fridge-cold , room temperature , or even hot , if it tastes better to you .
Keep in mind that whipping cream or egg whites by hand may take longer than you expect . That said , there is a proper way to whisk egg whites , and it is quite likely that taking breaks due to your fatigue is interfering . See <URL> for detailed instructions . In particular , see below for an excerpt on one possible problem ( although there are numerous things that can potentially go wrong ) . We will split the whisking of egg whites into two parts . The first covers the disintegration of the mucous mass up to the point when it becomes a grayish , roundish mass . This part requires mixing with an easy and rhythmic effort . The second part covers the conversion of the round , gray mass into a smooth , light , firm , stunningly white batter . This second part , unlike the first , requires a very vigorous and accelerated effort . During both these periods , the whisking , even though different in strength and speed , must not be interrupted . Under no circumstances should you stop once you have begun to whisk . Stopping causes the whites to disintegreate . Instead of rising and firming up more and more , their mass will remain semi-solid and will take on a blotchy , grainy look .
Older goat tends to have a very strong flavor , hence why many suggest braising in strong flavors . You can braise your kid following these recipes - just remember to use 3/4th the amount of strong seasonings as you would for a regular goat . As for grilling the meat , you could try to marinate the meat overnight with herbs and spices . Unlike chicken , which is a fairly blank canvas taste-wise , goat has a strong taste ( even kid meat has a slight gamey/goat-y flavor ) . As I said , if grilling , marinate . If you 're braising or stewing , toss in a beer , some mint or basil and a few other herbs . For the ribs - you could french them to get rid of some of the connective tissue and then marinate and roast them at low heat for a few hours to break down some of the connective tissue . Good luck and great eating !
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but I do n't think there is anything you can do to remove that flavor . It sounds like what is often described as " scorched " flavor . In restaurants , that is well known as the one flavor you ca n't mask , you just have to dump the whole batch and move on . You can feel free to take a shot at masking it with acid ( lemon , vinegar , ... ) , salt , sugar , and spices , but I do n't think it is going to work .
Okra is great in curry . I 'll do an okra and tomato curry , but you can find plenty of recipes online .
I do n't think a pork sirloin roast will stand up to that kind of cooking very well . That is a very lean piece of meat , which does not lend itself to long cooking times at low temperatures . That type of cooking is best reserved for cuts of meat with lots of fat and/or connective tissue . If you put a pork sirloin roast in your cooker for 8 hours on low , you 're going to have one tough , dry piece of meat when you are through . You would be better served by cooking it in the oven at higher heat , for a relatively short period of time , like 400F for an hour or so . Bear in mind , you 're not going to get to a fall-apart tender state with a sirloin roast . This is n't a pork butt with which you 're dealing , which you 'd take up to an internal temperature of 195F or more . Rather , you 're going to want to target the safe temperature , and no higher . You want the meat to be juicy . Cut into thinner slices to achieve maximum tenderness .

How can I stop my eggs from cooking when I make lemon/lime curd ?
To prevent this from happening , apart from what <URL> , check the temperature with a thermometer . Eggs start coagulating around 60ºC . If you keep the temperature around 55ºC you are pasteurizing the eggs at the same time .
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
Cook 's Illustrated recommends storing lemons in the fridge in a tightly sealed ziptop bag with the excess air removed . I would imagine that the same applies to limes . As I understand it , the idea is to prevent air circulation in order to reduce the rate of dehydration . <URL>
Things to try Rice should still be warm Handle rice gently , do n't squeeze it Does it fall apart because it is sticking to your hands ? If so : Use warm salt water on your hands ( not dripping wet hands though ) Rinse the rice more before cooking to remove excess surface starches . The process is : Rinse in bowl of water , gently tumble , let stand 20 minutes , change water . Repeat until rinse water runs clear If this still fails to solve this sticky issue , you can use cling film ( plastic wrap ) as a guide and release agent on your hands . Peel the plastic off as you wrap the nori on
I 've cooked a number of batches of cookies based on small variations of <URL> , which is very simple and requires no eggs . I generally use a little more oil and water than the recipe recommends , but perhaps that 's just my preference .
You might be able to counter-balance it with other flavors ( salt , sour , sweet , hot ) , but you 're likely still going to have some bitter notes come through , it 's just a question if it 's tolerable or not , and some people dislike bitter more than others . ( I ca n't understand how people can drink beers other than lambics ) In looking at a <URL> , one of the recommendations is a bit of milk or cream . If you 're not lactose intollerant , it might be worth a try . This could also be a chance for an experiment -- ladle it into a bunch of glasses , try some different things ( sugar , vinegar , soy , hot sauce , milk , worcestershire , combinations of them , etc ) , and report back to us with what you think worked best .
In the accepted answer to <URL> , it says that you can try wringing the pumpkin purée out in cheese cloth ; or in a comment , that you can let it drain in a colander .
You may need to add more oil , say a generous tablespoon . Also , I do n't think you should need to soak those lentils first , the pressure cooker should be more than able to take them apart without any advance soak . Also be sure to use plenty of water . At least 8 cups for 1 pound of beans .
The exterior coating on an egg is known as the " cuticle " . It helps to protect the ( porous ) shell and minimize moisture loss , but it eventually breaks down as the chick matures and prepares to hatch . The reason that eggs in the US are typically sold under refrigeration is because they are washed with warm water and detergent to remove the large amount of bacteria that are deposited on the shell while being laid . Once the cuticle is removed the egg becomes more porous . Most bakeries that are using whole eggs will typically keep several flats out at all times to have them at room temperature . Eggs will store better and longer in the refrigerator but if being used frequently and fairly quickly , they can also be left at room temperature . Howard McGee in On Food &amp; Cooking says that egg quality deteriorates as much in one day at room temperature as it does four days under refrigeration .
Oven cleaner will take that right off . If you 're sensitive to nasty harmful fumes you can get the fume free kind . Make sure you follow the manufacturer 's instructions to the letter , and make sure no kids or pets are around .
Optimal texture is about optimal heat transfer . When a vegetable releases so much water that it simmers in its own juices instead of pan-roasting , you should increase the heat transfer . To achieve that , you need to 1 ) use high heat , 2 ) not overcrowd the pan , and 3 ) use a pan which is capable of better heating . Cast iron is perfect for these situations , heavy steel pans too . Aluminium is much harder to work with , especially if it 's thin . Also do n't use a nonstick pan , you 'll destroy the coating at the temperatures needed . This technique can be used on its own , or combined with something else , for example oven drying . But note that a zucchini is over 90 % water , so you wo n't be able to simply get it dry enough to resemble a dough noodle .
Melting carob is a bit different from chocolate . The sugar crystal formation is not the same for tempering chocolate . One suggestion is to add paramount crystals ( which is a combination of palm kernel oil and soy lecithin ) to help start/control the process . I would also recommend not keeping the double boiler actually on the double boiler for the entire time . Heat it up until some of the carob melts . Remove from heat and stir . Add it back to the heat and continue removing to stir as each bit melts a little more . It takes longer but it allows you to control the heating and crystallization process . End the end , you should have a smoother and more even end result .
You could put them in a pan of boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes ( not so to they 're cooked through ) before putting them in the oven . The potato on the outside of the wedges will soften and cook a little bit which will help the outsides crisp up a little . Make sure you allow them to drain completely before you put them in the oven .
The mixture should lighten in both color and texture , and it should be ' fluffy ' . It should also increase in volume . The point of creaming is to incorporate the sugar with the fat , while at the same time adding air to the mixture . The air bubbles introduced during creaming expand during cooking , making the cookies rise and giving a lighter texture . Cookies baked with under-creamed butter would therefore remain fairly flat and dense .
Ah , we consumers and our expectations : Egg yolks are yellow . But in reality , yolks come in a range from pale yellow to deep orange . The colour is determined by the food ( wheat makes lighter yolks than corn , for example ) and can be influenced by feeding " colourants " for a darker hue . Some regions allow even artificial dyes , but a pinch of paprika will do nicely . Apparently the " expected " or " preferred " yolk colour is also a cultural thing , I found a source claiming that European customers want more orange hues while US customers expect deep yellow . Organic and free-range eggs typically have a greater variation than those from large agro-industrial production . So if your scrambled eggs are sometimes lighter , sometimes darker , either accept it as " natural " or check the colour of your yolks when you crack the eggs and for pale yolks add a colourant like a small pinch of turmeric ( what makes curry powder yellow ) or paprika ( for more orange eggs ) . If you use only a very small amount , it wo n't influence the taste or only very slightly so . Stir the spice in , then proceed as usual .
Lime juice is n't going to make it less spicy , if anything I 've found it accentuates the spiciness a bit although I 'm not sure of the mechanism . It could be that the acidity frees up more capsaicin compounds ( what makes hot food hot ) , or wakes up your taste buds more . Most likely you have simply added a weak jalapeno . Peppers of the same variety can vary in heat strength quite a bit depending on the where and how it was grown , although you 'll get weak and strong peppers from the same plant . You can make up for the lack of spice by adding more jalapeno or a bit of hot chili powder .
You do n't have to use water as the liquid in your bread . Enriched breads use milk and/or eggs . We have recently had questions about breads which use orange juice . On the technical side , you have to adjust recipe a little . Pickle juice does n't have much dissolved solids , so no need to adjust for that . However , it is very salty , so you should reduce or completely leave out the salt . The acidity will help with gluten development and also with breaking down the starches in flour to make them available for chemical reactions which produce more flavour , so this is a good thing to have . However , yeast itself has some strong pH preferences . It grows best in a slightly acidic environment , but if the dough gets too basic or too sour , it will slow down or not grow at all . I think that the diluted vinegar in the pickle water wo n't oversour the dough , but it would be a good idea to make the poolish with pure water and only add pickle water for the dough itself . As for taste , I ca n't say that much without ever having tried it , but my intuition says that you will get a whiff of pickles , but not a full-blown taste . After all , bread made with orange juice does n't taste like biting into an orange . I think you will notice the difference , but you will still have to add pickles to your sandwiches for taste ( and they are needed for the crunch anyway ) . As for horrible , it depends entirely on personal taste . I am not a fan of pickles or soured breads , and would n't eat it . There are people who drink the pickle water from the jar ; I think they will enjoy the pickle-smelling bread too . If you are a pickle fan , I think it is worth a try , if it does n't work , you only throw out under a dollar 's worth of ingredients .
My wife loves bacon that 's cooked to the cusp of burning , so I 've got a good knowledge of the properties of bacon on that fine line . It 's so brittle , you can powder it very easily . I myself would probably just stick it in a plastic bag , and whack it a few times with a pan , but I do n't see any reason why you could n't put it in the blender . I have a nice mortar and pestle I use for powdering things , but that 's probably overkill in this case .
I would guess your main problem is the protein in the flour . To get that stretchy dough that will not tear you need bread flour . Your water , the proportion between kneading and resting of the dough , and the salt also matter . The recipe you are using has way too much fat in the dough . The <URL> suggested by bonCodigo is closer to the needed proportions . <URL> on roti canai . Flour . You can buy roti flour from an ethnic grocery store , but many of the chain supermarkets in the US now carry bread flour . It has higher protein content without being whole grain . Different flours have different proportions of gluten . Those with lower content ( called weak flours ) being better for cakes and those higher content ( strong flours ) , better for breads . Gluten is not one protein , but a mixture of two protein families : gliadins , which give the dough its plasticity , and glutenins , which give the dough its strength . Different strains of wheat have different ratios of gliadins to glutenins , hence the need to find an appropriate flour . In the US and Canada , high protein flours tend to be optimized for loaf breads and not flat breads , so some hunting around for a good brand may be needed . Ghee The recipes on the net vary dramatically in the amount of fat added to the dough . The basic process of dough making is to get the water to break up the gluten in the flour and then stretch those giant molecules to create a network of stringy , tangled molecules . Too much fat interferes with this process . About 5g of fat for every 100g of flour is a good ratio . As ghee adds flavor , the trick to make a dough with higher ghee content is to think of it as a croissant and fold the fat in after the dough has incorporated some water . This is done by brushing the ghee in later stages of stretch and fold . Kneading and resting Making the network of gluten proteins requires energetic changes . Lots of water and rest could do it ( as in no-knead breads ) and so could a little water , a little rest , and a lot of kneading . With flat breads one does not need to wait for the yeasts to create the bubbles in the dough . The resting is for the water to do its work of untangling the gluten . The trick is to know if the water activity , resting , and kneading have brought the dough to the right point . There are many <URL> that are better explained through a video . The dough in the leaner recipe is a wetter dough that is a bit trickier to knead by hand . <URL> is to place it on an oiled countertop , pinch a corner , and fold it over . Repeat a few times and it will become easier to handle without having to add extra flour as it often suggested . Water . Do n't use tap water . It may be too alkaline , to hard , or too chlorinated . Andrew Whitley in his Bread Matters book has a chapter on how guilty he felt using Evian to make his bread , but it improved his bread . For flat breads one is less worried that the chlorine in the water will kill the yeast , but depending on your tap water composition , the other chemicals could be an issue .
Replace your ladle with an ice cream scoop . You will be able to control the amount of dough for each waffle much easier . For my waffle iron and scoop I use two scoops . An additional advantage over a ladle , is that the dough releases much easier from a scoop , which reduces the probability of making a mess .

How does the power setting on a microwave work ?
It may already be an implicit assumption , but I think that time to cook is probably not as important as how to cook . While the power setting does affect the time to cook , the importance of time is to control how hot the parts of the food get . As with all cooking , there is a need to control temperature . Running the microwave at less than full power allows time for the heat to be conducted from the hot parts to the cool parts . It is similar to searing vs. sauteeing . I think that the accuracy of most microwave oven 's power settings are good enough ( my own testing shows about 10 % ) . I would be more concerned about how I wanted the item cooked . Some examples : When I want to reheat things like a thick soup , I run the microwave at full power for a short period of time , stir , and run the microwave again . Stirring the concoction distributes the heat faster than the conduction process . When I want to defrost frozen foods ( think meat ) , I use the lowest power setting . This prevents the edges of the food from getting cooked .
I 'd go for a more powerful one , in general , and I noticed that the higher powered disposals are sometimes quieter , which I really like . I really learned that paying the extra for good plumbing parts ( faucet , disposal ) through our plumber was worth it , since they can be fixed , unlike cheaper big box store stuff , and that there was a real difference in the higher quality disposal .
I 've done it in the husk , when it 's fresh ( ie , the husk is n't dried out ) , but I do n't like the grassy flavors that the husk imparts . My neighbor 's clued me into a box of dry wax paper sheets to cover food for the microwave ( so I can be lazy and not have to clean the microwave as often ) , so I wrap the corn in it after it 's been husked and the silk removed . I just roll in around the corn , twist the ends like the paper wrapping on taffy , then microwave it for a few seconds . I have n't done it recently , so I ca n't remember exact times ( and the wattage of microwaves differ , anyway ) ... you just want to warm it through , though . If you were going to try to get it hot , I 'd consider dropping to medium power for a much longer time , so you do n't overly cook the outside , as I vaguely recall having an incident once .
My understanding is that the ratio shifts from 10:1 ( liquid to roux ) for a pale roux , up to about 5:1 for a nutty brown roux , with a somewhat linear relationship between the two extremes . A dark brown roux has very little thickening power , mostly they are used for flavor more than actual work-a-day thickening . The problem may not so much in the roux ratios , but in other ingredient variations . For instance , if you are using a traditional 3:2 flour : fat roux , and your fat is butter , make sure you are using clarified butter , or that you are allowing most of the water to cook out of the butter before adding the flour - excess water in the roux will break down some of the starches and reduce the thickening strength . Finally , there will be some variation no matter what - you can always make a little extra roux in a second pan to integrate if necessary .
My knowledge about the phenomenon itself is limited but I did see it mentioned in " Modernist Cuisine " ( Nathan Myhrvold , p. 147 ) Many recipes for foie gras , liver , sweetbreads , and other offal include a soaking step before cooking . For kidneys , this step serves a very simple purpose : to remove any trace of the animal 's bodily fluids . Recipes often call for soaking foie gras , liver , and sweetbreads in milk . It is often said that milk improves the taste , purges blood , lightens the color , or affects some other property of the meat . We were skeptical , so we tried several experiments . With a mild-flavored organ meat like foie gras , we could taste a difference , but , frankly , in our tests , we prefer the taste of water-soaked to milk-soaked foie gras . With stronger-flavored organ meats , there is even less of a difference than with foie gras . So our suggestion is to simply soak the meat in water . So , there you have it .
Unfortunately , the function depends on the manufacturer . While turning off a set of elements may be common , another option is that the setting may just increase the cook time . Bagels are thicker and have more mass than sliced bread , so a longer toast time is necessary to have a similar level of toasting . In particular there are Cuisinart toasters where the bagel button only lengthens the time of the toasting and does not change the pattern . From <URL> Bagel button The bagel feature adds extra time to the toasting cycle to allow for thicker breads . You may also use the bagel button for English muffins and other thick breads .
A cappuccino is probably not what you want to try latte art on . The amount of froth in a cap will probably cause the milk to be too thick to pour with . You want to start with your milk texture . You want stretch the milk and texture it so that it is suitable for a latte or maybe even a flat white . Correct micro foam will be integrated with the milk . It wo n't float on top . The surface will appear shiny and it will have the consistency of cream . For a free pour this is really important . Crema can also be your enemy . If your beans are too fresh , it can be a bit difficult to cut through . You can swirl your cup . You can also break it up a bit with your milk since you wo n't start pouring immediately . Once you can get your milk texture right , a good way to start is with some basic shapes . It can be useful to have a jug with a pronounced spout . 1 ) A basic dot in the middle of your cup . As you get to the top of your cup , tilt your jug a bit more to let the foam push the crema out of the way . 2 ) Basic heart . Same as the dot . But instead of just stopping the pour , push through the dot and slow the pour down quickly at the same time . 3 ) Layered dot . Starts like your basic dot . But as you increase the pour rate , wiggle your jug left and right smoothly . This will pull coffee in between the layers of the milk . Then just stop pouring . 4 ) Layered heart . Same as the layered dot , but pull through the dot like the basic heart . 5 ) The Rosetta . This is probably the iconic latte art pattern . This uses the skills of your layered heart . But you start your pour from the back of the cup with relatively large wiggles , then start to pull back and make your wiggles smaller . This gives you the curls at one end of the cup and the tapering " leaves " at the other . To finish , pull through like a heart . Other patterns are then variations on these themes . Like the tulip , swan , multiple hearts , multiple rosettas . And some combine free pouring with a bit of etching eg . smoking dog , pac man . Edit : This is how I learned to froth milk for a standard jug . The jug should be at an angle so that you can form a whirlpool . The tip of your steam wand should be just under the surface of the milk . Then turn on the steam . So I stretch very quickly and then spend the rest of the time texturing . You should n't be moving your jug up or down very much if at all .
The process of pasteurizing milk is to treat it with heat to kill microorganisms such as Brucella , Campylobacter , E. coli O157 : H7 , Listeria , Mycobacterium bovis , Salmonella , and Yersinia that may or may not be in the milk . This is a precautionary step that is taken when you are not 100 % sure whether your source of milk is disease free . Pasteurization can occur at different temperature for a different amount of time but the easiest temperature to pasteurize milk in the microwave is to bring it to 161 F for at least 15 seconds . Pasteurizing the milk in the microwave is a bit tricky because overheating it make cause it to boil over and it also heats the milk very unevenly . In the worse case scenario it can curdle if you overheat it . You will need to buy a thermometer for this method . You first want to microwave the milk for a minute . Then you want to stir the milk and take a temperature reading from the stirred milk . Now you want to continue to put the milk in the microwave in short 15-30 second intervals ( decreasing as it gets closer to 161 F ) and stirring and taking the temperature reading each time . When it has finally reach 161 F , you want to heat it for 15 extra seconds in the microwave and at that point it should be pasteurized . Another thing you can do is to just pasteurize it at home using your usual stove method and store the milk for later use . Once it has been pasteurized , as long as you refrigerate the milk , it will be good for a while . Just remember to quickly chill the milk ( using a ice water bath ) after you pasteurize it before you put it into the refrigerator .
It 's reminding you that flipping meat halfway through the defrost cycle will help prevent the bottom half cooking , while the top remains frozen solid .
Certain enzymes ( proteases ) cut the protein bonds that create the mesh that causes the jelly ( or Jello , or gelatin ) to , well , gel . Orange , watermelon and plum do not contain enough of those enzymes to interfere with gelling . In addition to paw paw ( more commonly known as papaya in the US ) , pineapple and kiwi ; mango , ginger root , figs and guava also contain enough of those enzymes to interfere with gelling . The application of high heat will inactivate those enzymes to the point that they will no longer interfere with gelling . That 's why you can use canned pineapple , but not fresh , in gelatin desserts .
Yes , it is safe . It is really more a question of quality . I would suggest that , in your specific situation you get a browning dish . ( It would be something that you could still use after your move , if you like . ) Please see the excerpt below from <URL> . There is nothing like a charbroiled steak straight off the grill . But for the times when you do n't want to fire up the grill - or even get the broiler dirty - there is a way to sear steaks in the microwave on an accessory called a browning dish . A microwaved steak will not brown well without one , and the dish is really the only acceptable way to brown in the microwave . Browning dishes can be either flat rectangular plates or black skillets that are designed for the microwave . Embedded in the plate or skillet are metal strips that cause the microwaves to couple or link , producing an electrical current . The dish also is coated with a metal that is resistant to the electrical current . You can read the rest of the article and the how-to information by following the link .
Is everything graded on the same scale ( with the same labels ) ? No . Grading is specific to every kind of fruit or vegetable , and often grading can be different depending on the form of the produce ( fresh vs. canned vs. frozen vs. juice vs. headed for further processing , etc. ) . Also , different nomenclature is used for different produce : some use " Grade A , " " Grade B , " etc. . Some use " No. 1 , " " No. 2 , " etc. . The number of grades can vary . And some use other nomenclature like " Fancy Grade " or " Commercial Grade , " either by themselves or in combination with the numerical/letter grade system . And is all produce graded , so that for example I can go to the store and find out what grade their supply of a given fruit is ? Grading is voluntary , and it generally costs producers to do it . Unless there is a complaint about quality , many domestic producers wo n't bother , particularly if they are selling at a local market or something . For marketing agreements , they are often required , though . And international shipments are required to be graded , but only small samples from a given shipment are generally inspected . What characteristics do the grades generally depend on , and what characteristics do they ignore ? You really can only tell by reading the individual grading policies for specific produce ( there are guidelines for well over 100 different types/forms of fruits and vegetables ) . The guidelines for <URL> and for <URL> . Also , note that these are only national USDA guidelines . States and regional markets can also set their own grading policies , so a " medium " tomato sold at a state farmers market might be the same as an " X-large " tomato on the USDA grading scale . But in general , grading often covers things like : Size ( sometimes specifying different size grades or minimum size for grading ) Appearance ( color , shape , " mature " enough to ensure proper ripening if not ripe already , proper trimming if applicable , extraneous pieces like stems on small fruit , etc. ) Texture ( firmness , smoothness , general " ripe " characteristics , etc. ) Defects ( blemishes , dirt , decay/spoilage , pest damage/disease , damage from sun/heat or cold , foreign material , etc. ) Allowable tolerances ( allowed deviation levels in above characteristics or percentage of pieces allowed to be non-compliant in various characteristics ) Characteristics generally NOT covered by grading : Flavor/taste Interior of produce ( since grading generally focuses on exterior inspection unless there is suspicion of unseen rot , disease , etc. ) Packaging ( beyond some note of packing that is likely to damage produce )
All of those ingredients should be fine . The only thing you really have to worry about is shelf life , so make sure to buy fresh ingredients and check your expiration dates , especially on the baking powder and baking soda and the almonds . I would just tell them to use it within a year ( or the earliest expiration date ) . Oh yeah , and do n't put the baking powder and baking soda next to the brown sugar . There is n't a lot of water in it , but it might be enough to cause issue .
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling . This lets the husk soak lots of water . Then place the corn , still in husk , on a hot grill for about 10 minutes , ~ 1/4 turn , 10 minutes , turn ... until the husk gets brown , even burnt . You should be able to tell when the corn is cooked by the smell . The sugars in the corn will start to caramelize and brown in the husk and it will give off a delicious caramel smell . You can check them by peeling down the husk to make sure that they are cooking well . Times will depend on your grill and how much patience you have . In general , it is difficult to overcook . You want to watch out for drying , but that usually takes a while if you soak the ears beforehand . Foil is a poor substitute for the natural wrapper . The husk both protects the cob from too much direct heat as well as holding water close to the cob to gently steam the kernels . And its just prettier with the browned and burnt husk , au natural .
You can get extremely edible results , which is good enough for me . The smoke-ring may be lacking from a competition grade result , but the flavour will be fine . Presume you have a big-enough BBQ to have at least two burners . Only use the burner the meat is not on . If you have any prevailing wind and are not completely sheltered , make the hot side the upwind side . Either get a smoke-box , or do what I used to and use foil . Soak 1/3 to 1/2 your wood chips in water to slow them down . Foil worked just fine for me , made a pouch , put in the chips and poked the up-flat-side with a knife to make smoke holes . If you have a larger BBQ , consider adding in bricks or stones ( no river stone ! ) to help maintain even heat . By having less air and more thermal mass , you will do better . Let me meat come to room temperature before you put it on . Also no need to smoke right away , as the meat will not take it until it heats up further in the BBQ . Happy Eating
Try heating the cream and milk to just below a simmer . Right before adding the milk mixture to the yolks whisk the sugar , vanilla , and eggs together . Pour the hot milk mixture into eggs very slowly . It 's best to strain it through a fine strainer . If you use vanilla bean make sure to add it after straining it . Let cool a little before putting it into the fridge . It should be cold before making the ice cream . It 's not necessary to fully temper ice cream base like crème anglaise .
If you ca n't get a bigger cutting board , here are a couple pointers to getting the most done CLEANLY in a small space ( mostly tricks from my kitchen manager ) : Use a sharp knife . It 's easier to control , and when you chop , pieces do n't move as much . Hone it at least daily to keep the edge aligned . Organize your work on the board . If you 're right-handed , keep raw ingredients on the left side , and finished , cut product on the other . Keep the spot you 're using to cut clear . It may only be 4-6 square inches , but it should n't have anything to get in the way . I like to use the bottom middle of the board for cutting and the corners &amp; top to organize stuff in various stages of cutting . Remove trash ( trimmings , ends , unusable vegetable scraps ) from the board . Either keep a trashcan next to the counter , or use a bowl to collect garbage . This frees up space on your cutting board . You can use additional bowls to store uncut material , and finished results . This frees up more cutting board area . All of these tips help , but I 'll tell you what my chef told me : the bigger your cutting board , the more room you have to work , and the faster you can go . As your knife skills improve , you will be able to work in a smaller space without problems . But first , start off with plenty of room . As you you gain experience , your cuts become more precise , you organize your space , and work faster and cleaner . With this advice in mind , you should move to a larger cutting board . The extra space to work make it much easier to develop proper knife skills , because you 're not trying to cramp yourself in . I suggest the largest board that you can comfortably fit in your sink for cleanup . With professional knife skills , I can handle prepping multiple items on an 8.5 " x 9.5 " cutting board ; however , I find that my 11 " x 14 " board provides a lot more room to organize my work , and is more comfortable to use . At work , I use the biggest board I can fit on my station .
Microwave ovens have a turntable because the microwaves themselves form what are known as ' standing waves ' . This means there are essentially static columns of microwave energy inside the cabinet itself . You can see this for yourself - spread a tray or plate with grated cheese , take the turntable out ( or press that button ) , and zap it for a couple of minutes . You should see bands of melted cheese interleaved with unmelted cheese . Thus , the food is rotated to ensure even heating .
You can put a cup/bowl of water ( you can also add some vinegar if you do n't mind the smell ) in there , heat it up to boiling , let the steam out . Then you should let it sit in the microwave without opening the door . Wait for a few minutes , open the microwave , and wipe off the inside . All that steam should have soften any stains or food pieces left in there . You may spray some natural cleaners or lemon/vinegar mixtures to wipe off the inside more .
Thin cut meat will curl if there is an outside perimeter of gristle or silverskin ( which there usually is ) . Those things shrink faster than the meat , causing the curling . Take a pair of kitchen shears or a sharp knife and make tiny cuts ( it should n't take more than 1/4 inch ) every inch or so around the perimeter of the steak , just into the meat itself . That should solve the problem .

What can I use in my own kitchen to fashion a panini press ?
Assuming that you do n't mind the bottom of your smaller pan getting dirty , you could put the sandwich in a heated larger pan and place the pre-heated smaller pan on top . According to your question , you 've got this this in own mental experiment . The next step would just require you to borrow from mechanical engineering and some cheap root vegetables . Mechanical designers use a widget called a standoff . It just help create a gap between two surfaces . <URL> Could n't you use the same concept with carrots ? You could just surround the sandwich with equal length ( maybe 1/4 -1 / 2 " shorter than the sandwich ) cut carrot " columns " for a carrot " tripod " of sorts . Bread will certainly cook faster than carrots and the used chunks could be edge-trimmed if they got blackened and consumed .
I do n't see why not , it 's the same process Many commercial brewers make a barley and rye malt for beer ( < 10 % rye ) . A good brewers supply shop should have rye malt too Rye is around ~ 40 % carbohydrate , while barley is ~ 45 % carbohydrate , so rye is not as sweet , but has a more interesting taste ( IMHO ) The differences for making malt rye over malt barley , assuming you have hulled rye : Rye absorbs water faster , so steep for less time ( ~ 30 % less ) Do not let it go mushy or it will not germinate Rye is more fragile with no hull and a thin " skin " . So must be handled more carefully once steeped . If it is damaged it wont germinate Lower germination rate ( due to above ) , so less conversion , so less sugars and flavour Otherwise just follow the normal malt barley process , which is well documented
How about Ruhlman 's book , <URL> ? The entire work is dedicated to breaking cooking down into ratios , and it includes recipes . I hear the bread recipe is particularly good .
I have made refried beans out of pinto , small red , black , and even navy beans . I almost tried using kidney beans once but it seemed wasteful . They were all different in texture but they were all good . Black beans , for example , have a much more fibrous skin so the refried beans are not as smooth - I actually prefer it to the homogeneous pinto mash . Obviously their color is also more interesting . There are a lot of different bean varieties and I do n't know what is available to you . In general I would say to just try whatever you have - it will probably taste good even if it is n't exactly like pintos .
In general places that do this with pancakes do not cut-out , but indeed use a mold or the like . The scrambled eggs would likely look fine " cut " , but part of a pancake is the edge , even if it is modified by touching the edge of the mold . So long as the mold is metal , your dollar-store purchases should be fine . You will likely need to oil/butter them in some way so that the product - batter or egg - does not stick to the metal itself . I have myself used clean old tuna tins to make round " self-contained " fried eggs for a home version of a McMuffin .
During my younger days working in restaurants I have grated many pounds of cheese using a ' meat grinder ' ( or rather the meat grinder attachment for a hobart stand mixer ) ... I have also used my home Kitchen Aid meat grinder for cheeses ( cheddar , jack and mozzarella mostly ) . So , it depends on the grinder and the attachments you have but yes it can be done . You want a fine grinder plate and cold cheese ( so it stays together better ) . You probably also want to be doing a " serious quantity " as the set up/tear down/clean up will be an endeavor . If your having friends and family over for a Mexican Fiesta , perfect . If you are making a quick plate of nachos ... OVERKILL . . For a few burgers , do it once and decide for yourself if you want to do it again . It wo n't be bad for the grinder It wo n't be bad for the cheese Expect Leftovers ... ( note : IMHO near frozen mozzarella for lasagna is a perfect place to use a grinder for cheese ... )
I 'd like such a dish with courgettes , or mushrooms . Chickpeas sound like a good idea , butternut squash might be good as well . Sweet potato , perhaps .
It can be a bit tricky , a couple of tips : Use a lot less liquid in the blender than normal . Do batches if needed . Vent the lid so the steam can escape . A lot of lids have a center piece that can come out . Using less liquid will stop stuff coming out the top . As Ocaasi suggests , you can cover the open lid with a kitchen towel as you start to insure there 's no spray . Start the blender slow and then speed it up . This may not work depending on how fast your slowest setting is . But once the vortex gets going , the liquid wo n't splash . It 's only when the blades start that you have that issue . Slower start speed means less splash ( a vita-mix can start very slowly and have no splash at all , great for hot liquids but the price tag is a bit high ) .
Be sure not to crowd them on the pan when roasting .
Leaving any sort of sugar confection in the fridge ( as it will out of the fridge also , but to a lesser extent ) will soften the sugar after a prolonged period due to the moisture in the air . However , putting it in the fridge for a short period of time will simply speed up the cooling process as you put in your question .
Rose petals are edible . If you look for rose petal recipes , you will find many creative uses of them , including rice pudding with roses - so your pudding intuition was correct . During colonial American times they were considered a treat . You can candy rose petals with egg whites and sugar - typical cautions about appropriate raw egg white useage applies . Before using your rose petals in culinary applications , make sure to remember what chemicals you used on them . If they 've been sprayed with pesticides , you do n't want to be eating them .
Making Mozzarella is not fantastically difficult , but certain things during the process are critical , probably the most important is temperature . If it 's your first time making cheese , you might find the buying a ' starter kit ' the easiest way to get up and running . These will provide you with all the important items you needm such as rennet . If you feel brave , then you forego the kit and dive right in . For Mozzarella try to find Buffalo milk , which is what ' proper ' Mozzarella is made from . It 's lower in cholesterol than cows milk , has more protein and makes a much richer cheese . If you ca n't get Buffalo milk use the best full fat , non-homogenized milk you can find . Here 's a recipe I 've used before <URL> Here 's a link with the differences between Buffalo milk and cows milk <URL> Whilst it 's quite possible to make virtually any variety of cheese at home , some cheeses , such as blue cheese , require a place to develop at the correct temperature and for quite long periods of time . ideally , this would be a temperature around 10c with a humidity around 70 % and a time for maturing at around 2 to 3 months . Here 's a good place to start : <URL>
You do want a coarse grind for french press coffee . The key is letting the coffee steep for long enough to make a strong brew . I have good results with a 5 minute steep time . Be sure to use a timer , and compare different times to find the optimal brew . As a general rule , if you are at altitude , then you need to add time because boiling water is cooler . ( Note that I am at 5000ft , so 5 minutes may be too long for you . ) Below is a picture of the coffee chunks in a coarse grind on top of a US 5 cent coin ( 21.21 mm in diameter ) . The picture is from <URL> . EDIT : The reason to use a coarse grind for a french press is that finer grinds will get stuck in the filter and/or push their way through . This has three potential problems : 1 ) it will be harder to press down the filter , possibly leading to spillage or breakage ; 2 ) your coffee will have grinds in it ; 3 ) the coffee may become bitter , as the finer grinds that passed through the filter remain in contact with the coffee for too long .
Making maraschino cherries is a bit involved ... basically , you brine them and then flavor them . To keep them for a long time , you 'll also need to can them . <URL> a great recipe for making the cherries , and <URL> instructions for canning . The canning instructions are specifically for cherry topping , but you would use the same boiling-water canner process for maraschino cherries in their syrup . To pit the cherries , I 'd advise purchasing a cherry pitter ( yes , there 's actually a device for this ) if you 're going to be doing this very much .
Yes . The important fat is the one the starch first goes into . The higher temperature reached by fats ( as compared to water or milk ) helps cook the flour , creating flavors . The liquid added later dilutes the mixture into a sauce . The liquid 's fats are not as crucial for the sauce 's thickness as the liquid 's proteins . I think of the cooked butter-flour mixture as a thickner that can be added to milk , broths , and even a saucy dish . The roux thickens way better than just a slurry of flour and a cold liquid . Jack Lang has written <URL> and the science is summarized in chapter 4 of <URL>
Gloves are annoying and , much like condoms , do obscure sensation and -- in the case of kitchen work -- precision with your fingers . For those reasons I avoid them wherever possible . As a lifelong nailbiter ( from when I was about 9 until I was 31 ) , it was a habit that was really hard to give up . But it has been worth it , not just professionally . I know this is n't the answer you 're looking for , but : stop biting your nails .
The oil needs to be slowly added to the egg , vinegar , and lemon juice base while being vigorously whisked . Only add more when the previous amount has been fully incorporated . I generally add the oil 1/4 cup at a time , dripping it very slowly into the base . Once the initial 1/4 cup has been added and emulsified it becomes a lot easier to incorporate the rest , and you can add it slightly faster , but still 1/4 cup at a time . This is vastly simpler in a food processor . I have a <URL> which has a little white pusher piece with a drip-hole in it . You can simply add the oil into this 1/4 cup at a time , it will slowly drip into the mix . Use the metal blade attachment .
The bowl is n't absolutely essential ; it 's part of the aesthetic . The shape does serve a purpose , as most of them have nicely curved bottoms that will minimize the chance of the powder from clumping near the edge of the bowl . I 've used a normal whisk when preparing " matcha latte " drinks for a client of mine back in the day . There 's an advantage to having the 80-120 " tate " ( bristle ? ) because they make it easier to break up beads that form as moisture contacts the tea . But a normal culinary whisk will do the trick , perhaps with a bit more work . I do n't see how the silicone brush would help whisking ; they tend to be pretty floppy ( and mine has occasionally had some of the silicone strands break off when I 've used it for brushing food ) .
It depends on what kind of settings your crock pot has . A low simmer on the stove is probably equivalent to something fairly low on your slow cooker , though . If all you have is warm , low , and high , you want low - in some cases it might be too hot , though . You 're aiming for just short of boiling , so a setting that gets you a few bubbles now and then is good . More than that and you 're cooking a bit vigorously , and on a " warm " setting you likely are n't heating it enough to cook properly and stay safe . If you have some kind of continuous settings , you can possibly adjust to get exactly where you want !
The possible risks I can think of are ( 1 ) the large thermal mass may mean that the soup cools off too slowly , leading to spoilage in the middle , and ( 2 ) freezer burn on the top of the soup , because there 's no truly effective way to seal out air from a pot . In practice , ( 1 ) is unlikely unless you 're talking about a 25-gallon pot or something , in which case it would n't fit in an ordinary freezer anyway . ( 2 ) on the other hand will be a problem , unless you 're only freezing the soup for a short period . The only risk to the pot is that it may not quite fit in the freezer comfortably , so as people take things out and put things in , they may shove the pot about and maybe break a handle or something .

What can I do with badly cooked honeycomb ?
It might be possible to dissolve the candy , and then boil it down again , foaming it with fresh baking soda when it hits the proper stage . The thing is , the candy has already got the full level of baking soda reactants ( either sodium carbonate or sodium oxide ) from from the first cooking , which may contribute to some off flavors . Instead , if it is enjoyable as is , I would suggest just eating it as a toffee like candy . Otherwise , chalk it up to experience and watch the temperature more closely next time .
I would actually just make caramel . Place about 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup in a heavy bottom pan and dissolve over low-medium heat then crank up the heat and let cook , without stirring , until the mixture turns a golden amber colour and starts smoking . Then use the resulting caramel to sweeten your coffee :-)
I 'm going to propose a different cooking method that 's closer to cooking it on the stovetop ; gnocchi when cooked wrong can be quite dense . It 's still edible , but it 's not as enjoyable . take your cooking vessel , and heat up your cooking liquid ( I 'd go with just water , as we do n't know how much liquid it 's going to absorb , and we do n't want too runny of a sauce ) Float a toothpick in it , or something else microwave safe . ( note : this is for safety ... we need nucleation points so you do n't get scalded in step # 5 ) Microwave on high 'til boiling ** Remove the toothpick Add the gnocci Microwave on high 'til boiling again Microwave on low until floating . Drain Add sauce Microwave to warm the sauce . ** as you said you had a combination water cooler/heater , you can start with hot water , and skip steps 2 through 4 .

Egg-whites in a carton are usually pasteurized . Pasteurized eggs are not great for meringue because the heat from the pasteurization process negatively affects the proteins in the whites that make for good meringue . With a lot of whipping ( and more cream of tartar or other stabilizers ) pasteurized egg whites ( whether from pasteurized eggs or from cartons ) can make meringue though it most likely wo n't be as stiff as those from non-pasteurized eggs . I would suggest getting regular eggs and trying to use the left-over yolks for something like creme brulee .
Yes.The basic ingredients for both are the same ; the difference lies in how they are cooked .
Any kind of flavoring , really , so long as the application will accept a syrup substance . They make killer milkshakes / malts . Add them to all kinds of desserts , beverages . I 've occasionally replaced extracts and granulated sugar in a recipe with a flavored syrup but you have to experiment with the right combinations as this tends to either overpower the dish with flavor or not make it as sweet .
You can make some very good sauces , based on demi-glace . Bordelaise ( if you add chopped shallots , red wine and a bit of marrow ) ( eat it with grilled beef , steak or pork ) Robert ( if you add chopped onions , vinegar and white wine , and a bit of mustard ) ( fits very well with grilled pork ) Zingara ( chop ham , mushrooms and truffle into tiny pieces ) ( You can mix this with tomato sauce and it goes well with beef tongue ) If you want to use demi-glace as it is , it fits very well with pork chops or lamb , hogget , or mutton .
First , you do n't specify if you mean cream of coconut , or coconut milk . I think coconut milk would be the thing to try here , as it has less fat . Second , if it works , it wo n't be bechamel any more . But this is a technical detail : if it is tasty to you , you should be able to use it as a substitution practically everywhere . Third , does it work ? I have n't tried it , but I would strongly assume that it will . Coconut milk has more fat than normal milk , but this is n't a terrible problem for roux-based sauces . Indeed , I have read recipes ( in reliable cookbooks ) which direct the cook to add melted butter to the roux before or after adding the liquid . Which means that the fat ratio in the sauce is n't too exact ; it is the ratio of flour to water which you have to keep straight . The one thing to pay attention to is that coconut fat melts around 34-35 ° C . So your coconut roux sauce will exhibit noticeable difference in thickness depending on the temperature . As long as you serve it warm , it will be a similar thickness to bechamel . If you let it go cold , it will probably thicken quite a bit . If you plan to serve it cold , adjust the flour amount accordingly .
Rust , or iron oxide , is not poisonous , unless consumed in large amounts . Thus it is relatively safe to grill on your barbeque . What about the people who get cut by rusty nails and get lockjaw ? That 's not due to the rust , but rather , due to the bacteria on the rust , which is called , <URL> , which is found in the soil , and presumably , the nails have had come in contact with the soil , and so actually contains some of these deadly bacteria , and so , when a wound is made by the sharp object , the sharp object ( nail ) will also infect the wound causing tetanus , or lockjaw . Which is totally irrelevant to your grill , as I assume , it has n't actually come in contact with the soil has it ? So , it 's safe , relatively
I 've cooked a number of batches of cookies based on small variations of <URL> , which is very simple and requires no eggs . I generally use a little more oil and water than the recipe recommends , but perhaps that 's just my preference .
Ground beef cooks quite fast . It does n't need more than 5 minutes ( depending on the base of your pan and the amount of meat of course ) . Just take a piece and rip/cut it open . If it 's brown inside , and not red or pink , it 's fully cooked .
It can be a bit tricky , a couple of tips : Use a lot less liquid in the blender than normal . Do batches if needed . Vent the lid so the steam can escape . A lot of lids have a center piece that can come out . Using less liquid will stop stuff coming out the top . As Ocaasi suggests , you can cover the open lid with a kitchen towel as you start to insure there 's no spray . Start the blender slow and then speed it up . This may not work depending on how fast your slowest setting is . But once the vortex gets going , the liquid wo n't splash . It 's only when the blades start that you have that issue . Slower start speed means less splash ( a vita-mix can start very slowly and have no splash at all , great for hot liquids but the price tag is a bit high ) .
( Storage note : do not wash the bulbs before storing them ; place in plastic bag in the refrigerator . Wash just before using . ) Young kohlrabi is great raw . Peel first , then add to salads ( sliced or grated ) serve as part of a veggie platter w / dip grate it and add to slaw ( but after grating it , put some salt on it &amp; let it sit , then squeeze the water out of it ) puree it - here 's someone who really loves it pureed : <URL> Cooked kohlrabi can be steamed or boiled . Remove the skin after cooking . You can eat the leaves , if they are still firm and green ; use them within a couple of days . Wash the leaves &amp; remove the tough stem parts ( ribs ) . Blanch in boiling water for a couple of minutes , drain , chop , and serve with a bit of butter , salt , and pepper . A little vinegar or lemon juice is good on them , too .
Oil or fat is absolutely not necessary to cook rice . I suspect you may have been taught the pilaf method where the rice is first sauteed in oil or butter , and then liquid is added and the rice is fully cooked . The purpose of the pilaf method is to add depth of flavor . When making pilafs , additional herbs , spices , or aromatics ( such as onions ) are often included . If you have been taught to add oil without the sauteeing , then the only purpose of it would be to add flavor . It wo n't really help prevent sticking , and is n't needed for the rice to cook properly . There are many methods to cook rice in addition to the pilaf method , and many to do not require any fat . Simply boiling or steaming in water is completely traditional in many Asian cuisines . In some cuisines , the crusty rice that sticks to the bottom of the pot or rice cooker is actually highly prized ( see Wikipedia 's <URL> article ) . You can mitigate the crusting of the rice by making sure to use the lowest flame or heat setting that will keep the rice steaming . I actually prefer to put the whole pot in a moderate oven , rather than do it on the stove top . You can also use the pasta method of simply boiling the rice in water , and then draining it when it is done to your liking , to completely avoid the crust . This will result in less sticky rice since the surface starches will be left in the boiling water . I understand this method is popular in some parts of India and Pakistan .
I feel the same as you Anderson . I found that too and you just made me to do some research , which I found they have different smoke points . Unrefined sunflower oil 225 ° F 107 ° C Unrefined peanut oil 320 ° F 160 ° C see the link : <URL> Also , one of the reasons food stick to the pan is the evenness of the temperature of the pan . If you use a thicker pan or copper pan , the heat will be distributed on the pan more evenly and food will stick less . The higher smoke point of oil makes me to believe the oil helps to distribute heat more evenly .
It 's not entirely clear if this needs to be cooked after being wrapped . If you can cook it beforehand , and you really want something that has no taste at all , then you ca n't do much better than the technique Adria uses his <URL> , which is basically to create paper-thin sheets of gelled agar and gellan , cut them into circles , and wrap . Of course the technique makes it trivially easy to adapt to other shapes and sizes . If you really want them totally sealed , a torch or even a smear of very hot water should do the trick , it 'll gel again as it cools . If this needs to actually be baked or fried , then I 'd go for dumpling wrappers or gyoza wrappers , which are just circular versions of spring roll skins . This is exactly the application they exist for , and there are various kinds of rice-based skins that are so thin , they 're actually translucent : It goes without saying that white rice is pretty bland and wo n't add much flavour of its own . The Cook 's Thesaurus also has a <URL> ; if the above do n't work , maybe one of their other suggestions will suit your fancy .
Should be fine to eat , from a food safety perspective . The heat will be high enough to prevent bacterial growth . I ca n't speak to the flavor , of course . Edible is a matter of opinion . Goodness knows we 've all eaten our culinary screwups that nobody else would touch at least once .
The goal is to keep the surface of the bread from drying out . A wet towel works fine but plastic wrap is cheaper and easier than constantly cleaning wet towels . I have used both methods and have n't noticed a difference in the bread produced . In very dry climates , when I made bread with multiple rises I sometimes had to redampen the towel which was an added inconvenience . Lately I have been proofing large batches of bread in a large stock pot and just use the lid of the pot as the only cover .
The way to ensue moist meat is to make sure that you do n't overcook it . It is really just that simple . Variations on cooking method are to achieve certain effects on the meat , i.e. searing to develop more flavor due to the maillard reaction , sous vide to allow you to cook to a specific temperature , ect . In the war against dry meat , a thermometer is your best foxhole buddy . That said , some cooking methods allow you to hit that temp mark easier than others . Typically , the slower heat enters the food , the closer to the specific temperature you will be able to get . Thus things like a braise more often result in a meat that is moist as the window between cooked and over-cooked is much larger than on something like a grill .

How do you know if stone-ground flour is truly milled with stones ?
The FDA does not currently have a legal definition of stone ground . Companies like Hodgson 's Mill , Bob 's Red Mill , and Arrowhead Mills have petitioned the FDA to set a definition in the past under the concept of truth in labeling , to no avail . <URL>
I recommend ( and use ) a <URL> . Not only are they fairly tough and sharp , you can adjust the blade to the depth you need ( you do n't want to cut too deep ) . And the blades are cheap to replace ... As others have noted in the comments , be careful with this as you would with any knife : the blades may be small , but they 're quite sharp .
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
Because onions contain a lot of flavour compounds that we like , and which are synergistic with meats .
Put your flour in water . It should be slightly fizzy due to the presence of baking powder if it is active self raising flour . If it is plain it should react like normal flour .
I use a baster and have never had a problem with the top part getting too hot , perhaps you could consider getting a bigger one so that the fat does n't get near the top ? Another option to consider is putting a lid on the pan and tilting it , over a suitable receptacle , then cracking the lid open slightly to allow the fat to drain out without releasing any of the meat .
I think it 's because freezing tend to dry things out . At lukewarm temperature , it 's still ' steaming ' a bit , which means evaporating liquid , so losing moist . If you can stop the drying out process at that point , the pastry wo n't be as dry as when you let it cool completely . Of course , a too high temperature can do harm to already frozen things , or would cause condensation in the package , so that there would be ice formed . This could be the reason , and therefore , the statement can be true .
In the pastas that I have made the structure of the noodle is built out of protein - usually entirely from gluten from wheat flour . In fact the base of my pasta is just flour and water ( or juice or pureed vegetables , etc. ) Egg noodles , obviously get structure from the egg . Quinoa has no gluten and will impart no structure to a typical pasta . You could easily add it to a normal pasta recipe as long as it was not in so high a concentration as to compromise the gluten structure . Without experimenting I do n't know what ratio this would be . A cursory google search found several quinoa pasta recipes . The ones I looked at were similar in that they relied on a variety of starches and egg for structure . I imagine these would taste fine but they would be more like dumplings or egg noodles than al dente Italian pasta . The results of the quick search : <URL> <URL>
Some cookware are ' cured ' . Mostly cast iron pots and pans . I never heard of a pizza stone being cured , so I 'm guessing this is to avoid eating soap . Other than that , I would n't know . Cast iron gets cured for two reasons : 1 . Create a non-stick layer 2 . Avoid oxidation . Neither of these reasons apply to stones ( or do they ? )
The original recipe calls for a total of 2 lbs of ground meat , 1/2 beef and 1/2 veal . I would suggest a close approximation to the effect can be had by using either ( in decreasing order of preference ) : 50 % ground pork , 50 % ground beef -- Some of the mild flavor of veal , with tenderness and flavor from the pork 100 % ground beef -- It wo n't be as tender or as subtle , but still will be good I would avoid trying to use as part of your substitution mixture : Ground lamb , goat , ox , and so on -- flavor is too strong Ground chicken or turkey -- these are extremely low in fat , likely to toughen your overall mixture , and likely to make it taste more poultryesque Personally , I would also switch from whole eggs to just the yolks , which will bring the binding and tenderizing qualities of the yolk , without the slightly rubber-like texture of albumin based white , to more closely approximate the qualities the veal would have brought to the dish .
It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container . If the moisture is at a safe ( low ) level , then mold wo n't grow . See for example , <URL> , which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8 % for retail storage/shipping , although if you look at their data table , it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5 % range ( which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool , dry place ) . Honestly , cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities . Most likely what you 're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats ( the process which causes rancidity ) without actual full-blown rancidity . Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure . If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer ( sealed , to prevent contamination or off-odours ) . Although most ( all ? ) nuts are considered shelf-stable , they do keep longer in the fridge or freezer .
The true aficionado would claim that you actually do n't store cooked pasta , but for those cases where this is n't viable , you have a few options : Pasta that will be cooled and re-heated later , e.g. left overs Drain well , cool , refrigerate . The pasta will stick , but you can dump it in hot salted water foe a bit to re-heat where it will unstick again . Not perfectly al dente , but probably ok . ( Slightly undercooking pasta can mitigate this a bit . ) Pasta that should stay warm , e.g. on a buffet Add a bit of fat ( olive oil , butter ... ) to coat your pasta . Keeps it from sticking . Critics claim that it also keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta . Adding the sauce can have a similar effect , but you risk soggy pasta . Pasta that should stay cold , e.g. pasta salad The only case where rinsing pasta is kind of allowed . Side effect : cool pasta ( well drained after rinsing ) can be mixed even with heat-sensitive dressings right away , avoiding stickiness issues again .
Funnily enough I made some of these just a week ago . They 're not at all difficult to make and you can use any rind , which your butcher should be able to supply . Depending on your health considerations , you can oven cook them or you can part oven cook part fry . Oven cook method : Cut the rinds into 4 by 4cm pieces Place in a pan of boiling water for 10 minutes allow to cool , then place in the fridge until the skins feel ' dry ' approx 2 hours Preheat the oven to 220c ( 425f ) and place the rinds on a baking sheet . Season and place in the oven Turn the oven down to 180c ( 350f ) and cook for about an hour . You will need to drain the fat a couple of times . Let them cool and add more seasoning , if needed . The Oven/Fry method Cut the rinds into pieces that will fit on a rack over a baking tray ( not small pieces ) Half fill a baking tray with water and place the seasoned rinds on a rack over they tray Roast these in the oven at 220 to 230c ( 350 to 450f ) for 10 to 15 minutes . When they 've changed colour and start to bubble they 're done . Remove form the oven and cut into 4 by 4cm strips In a pan half filled with very hot veggie oil or a deep fat fryer , cook in batches until they ' puff ' up around 2 to 3 minutes . Remove and let the oil be taken-up by paper towel . Season and you 're good to go . I tried both methods and I preferred the second , something about frying them just ' felt ' right :)
Here 's something useful to know . A good typical salt level for most savory foods is in the neighborhood of 1 % by weight . So if you know how much your dish weighs in grams , then add 1 % of that in salt and you should be very close to a good result . Adjust down if you are using any ingredients that are already salty , like capers . Adjust up if after the first few times you try this , it is a little light for you . You will also learn how much your salt weighs by volume so soon you can just use a measuring spoon or a pinch instead of weighing the salt .
If it 's raw , stick with the best-before date on the label . If cooked , you have at least <URL> , regardless of whether it 's pork , veal , or regular beef .
Quinoa naturally contains a bitter compound on the outside of the seed . Usually you have to rinse the quinoa to remove the bitterness but most commercial quinoa seems to have already been rinsed . So , I no longer rinse my quinoa . If you have time , it 's nice to heat a pan and add the quinoa and toast it a little ( for a nutty flavor and fluffier texture ) , then add water and salt . I typically bring the water to a boil ( 2 cups water to 1 cup quinoa plus 1/4 tsp salt ) , cover and reduce the heat to a simmer for 10-20 minutes ( or until the little tails release ) . Lately I 've found that using a rice cooker is a no-fuss way to prepare quinoa . I usually just do quinoa , water and sea salt but you can add spices while cooking it if you want to enhance the flavor . I would add vegetables afterwards . Quinoa is so quick-cooking I would n't see the need for a pressure cooker .
The term " ground red pepper " is ambiguous in English . Things sold under that name in the US have a wide range of heats , and likely are made from multiple varieties of peppers , though I 'd say they 're more commonly hot things like cayenne , or other varieties with somewhat less heat . That said , do n't worry about it too much in these cases . Anything from mild paprika to cayenne would likely fit within what the authors meant , and you 're not going to harm a recipe by increasing or decreasing the heat , or by using a chile powder with a slightly different flavor . Just use something ( or a blend ) that provides the heat level you want , and you 'll be fine .
I am not a chemist , but my grandma always used to make bread ( and similar stuff ) with sparkling water instead of still water . She always mentioned that the result will be more fluffy and airy . This only addresses the question about the ( important ) consistency though , but I guess you should just try it out yourself . Edit : Some benefits of using sparkling water in the kitchen As this answer got downvoted to zero I guess my grandma was not convincing enough . So I asked a befriended chef who works at a luxury hotel chain in Germany . Here 's what he explained : Desserts can be made more creamy without actually adding cream . Here he gave examples of pudding/mousse-ish desserts Vegetables steamed with sparkling water results in less loss of color ( i.e. brighter colors ) , more crispyness , and stronger taste . He particularly recommended to try it with carrots , broccoli or cauliflower . You can add sparkling water to thick soups shortly before serving to get them more foamy . Similar with Salad dressings Last but not least he confirmed precisely what my grandma said . For doughs and similar stuff ( for salty or sweet dishes ) you would get a nice fluffy texture . Kudos to my grandma at this point .
In all the recipes I 've followed with a cup measurement ( volume ) of flour , it is unsifted . From what I 've read , if a recipe calls for sifted flour there 's two ways to do it : If it calls for " sifted flour " you sift the flour first , then measure it . If it calls for " flour , sifted " you measure first , then sift it .
Here 's a picture of some raw ground beef from the Wikipedia <URL> article so that you can see for yourself . Basically it is beef that has been run through a meat grinder , great for making taco meat , hamburgers , and the like .

What causes popovers to rise so much ?
There is a lot of water in the milk . The high heat turns the water into steam . The egg and flour contains proteins and gluten that forms a " net " . The steam ca n't escape without pushing the net upwards . This makes the dough rise . It helps that the container is a narrow cylinder .
I just found the <URL> for it . The name of it is Bak Kwa ( Sweet BBQ Pork Jerky ) . Here 's the <URL> ( boy it 's easy to find things when you know the name ! ) . The recipe actually grind up the pork . They use about 70 % meat and 30 % fat . But according to the wikipedia entry there is also an expensive version where they slice of a solid piece of meat . Sugar and salt was originally used and then the meat was smoked ( this sounds really close to BBQing , which generally cooks the meat with smoke ... yummy tender ribs ) . These days , people make them in the oven at low heat . In the recipe , they put the minced mixture between two sheets of parchment paper , which probably keeps it moist and tender !
The difference may be in how finely the peanuts are ground . Depending on the stores machine , you may not be getting a perfectly smooth peanut butter which means there is still some residual oil in there . Also , a week after fresh-ground is still very fresh . That jar of xyz brand on the shelf can be six months or older . If you leave your fresh ground out for longer , it most likely will separate . The other bit might be that the oil comes out when the grinding processes warms up the peanuts , and your local store 's machine might still keep them cool enough . You can see a similar effect with coffee beans and their roasting temperature . Speaking of which , the commercial process might also roast at different temperature . What I have noticed is that if I let our Vitamix blender go at the peanuts a little longer , the oil does eventually get coaxed out and that batch will have its oil separate eventually .
This question is actually answered in a <URL> you linked : kimberly says : Sorry for silly question , but the ingredient list says " 1/2 sleeve celery $ 0.65 " . do you mean 1/2 of a stalk or 1/2 of a bunch of celery ? [ ... ] Beth M says : Yes , I meant a half bunch . Sorry about the confusion ! :) I used about 4 stalks or so . They cook down quite a bit . Also there 's a picture of the ingredients used : So 4-5 stalks appears to be intended amount of celery . A recipe like this though is going to pretty flexible so if that seems like too much or too little it should n't be a problem if you go outside that range .
Short answer : Steam . Long answer : Proteins in egg whites are almost uniquely suited to making foams of tiny bubbles , then stretching like a web of bungee cords as the water inside these bubbles turns to steam in the oven . Therefore , the critical element in making your souffle rise is the skill with which you whip the whites into a foam to the correct degree ( just to stiff peaks , not over-whipped ) , followed by integrating ( folding ) that foam into the dense , flavor-filled base . There are a few tricks for augmenting the rise -- e.g. , using a pinch of tartaric acid in the whites , using a copper bowl -- but if your technique is poor , these things wo n't make enough of a difference . Alton Brown ( " Good Eats " TV show ) has an excellent program explaining the whole thing , including some basic chemistry , available free on YouTube : <URL> <URL> By the way , you said that a successful souffle must rise above the vessel . While rising high is a major goal , I would not limit success to that event . Last night , I made chocolate souffle that only crested the vessel a little ways ( not the ideal " double the volume " ) , but each bite was still ethereal and decadent at the same time . Everyone 's plate was clean . THAT , to me , is a successful souffle .
<URL> are antioxidants that are a very common water based pigment in plants . There are over <URL> which are are responsible for many <URL> . It is thought that the colors serve to attract pollinators to flowers and camouflage leaves from herbivores . They are the naturally occurring in purple snap beans , garlic , some ginger , many berries , red cabbage , as well as many other common foods . When added as a food coloring , they have the E number E163 . The color is dependent on the pH of the fluid around them . This causes many plants ( such as <URL> ) to lose color as they are cooked and their cell walls begin to burst and release water , diluting fluids the anthycyanins are in or absorbing cooking liquids of a different pH. Some varieties of <URL> contain anthocyanins which can turn blue when exposed to acids . Varieties of ginger originating in Japan contain these compounds , but varieties originating in China do not , which explains why this only happens to some ginger . The pH of ginger is slightly acidic , so that probably starts the reaction . Anthocyanins are also responsible for <URL> when in an acidic solution . In the case of garlic , the color is sometimes enhanced by reactions between the sulfur compounds naturally occurring in garlic and copper that may be present in water or cooking vessels . This creates another blue pigment , which is still perfectly safe to consume . More technical information can be found in <URL> .
According to ( US ) <URL> : ( c ) In accordance with § 184.1 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the ingredient is used in food with no limitations other than current good manufacturing practice .

Doner kebab is A ) not a single joint of meat and B ) cooked in slices , so attempting to get anything similar with the technique you described is a triumph of optimism over reality I 'm afraid . As Gary suggests , lamb/mutton shoulder requires long , slow cooking , but this will not yield a doner-like result in terms of texture . I would rub the lamb with plenty of spices , cumin , coriander , garlic etc and olive oil . Make small cuts in the meat and really massage the spices in . Place the lamb in a roasting tin and cover with foil . Get the oven as hot as it will go , put the lamb in , and turn it down to 150C . Cook for 4 hours and the meat will fall off the bone . Pull to shreds and serve in pitta breads with yoghurt , salad , onions and chilli sauce . Voila !
After creating a new batch using the same process as my first one , but with a different , non-Greek , starter yogurt ( which uses a different set and balance of bacteria than the starter I used for my first batch ) , I found that the texture was the same as my starter yogurt and was without the pithy texture . Therefore , it seems that it is , in fact , the difference in fermentation , which depends on the types of bacteria cultures in a given yogurt that determine the texture of Greek vs non-Greek yogurt .
Storing Tea You tea should never become bitter due to your storage methods . The only thing that should happen to tea as a result of how you store it is general loss of flavor or loss of the complexity of flavor ( in a green tea , you might lose any honey or fruit notes of a tea that has been improperly stored , but it 'll still taste like green tea ) . There are a couple of factors at play when storing tea . The first is light . Exposure to light will degrade the quality of tea , stripping it of both color and flavor . Light also sets off <URL> . So , you should store your tea in a light-blocking container ( like a typical metal tea tin ) . The next factor is air . Tea needs to be stored in a place that does not have any strong-smelling other foods or chemicals because it absorbs other odors very easily . In addition , tea absorbs moisture from the air , so it needs to be stored in a dry place . Moisture can cause several different problems with your tea : it could start binding to the tannins and make your tea taste bitter when you eventually brew it , and excess moisture could provide breeding grounds for bacteria or fungus , which would make your tea unfit for brewing at all . So , store your tea in an airtight container that blocks moisture and any other nearby odors . Vacuum sealing is not necessary , unless you want to keep a batch of tea for a long time without using it at all . I have n't found any evidence supports claims of oxidation affecting taste more than moisture or light . Different types of tea are created by oxidizing tea leaves ( white teas are the least oxidized , black teas the most , and greens and oolongs are somewhere in between ) , so oxidation is not inherently bad for tea . To sum it up : Protect your tea from the harmful effects of light , moisture , ambient odors , and air by storing it in an airtight container in a cool , dark place . If stored properly , most kinds of tea leaves should retain most of their flavor for about two years , though fresher is always better . ( Some teas , like Japanese green teas , are traditionally only stored for about 3 months . ) Brewing Tea In order to achieve the best taste , brew tea according to the processor 's instructions ( at least to start with - once you become more familiar with tea and what you like , you can adjust according to taste ) . The tea manufacturer 's want their tea to taste good , and they are experts , so you can rely on them to provide decent instructions . I 've never bought tea that did n't have instructions for brewing right on the package , but in case you find some that do n't have instructions , here are some general guidelines . I 've taken this from Upton Tea 's <URL> , and it corresponds to my own experience with making tea and chatting with tea importers / shop owners , too . Whole Leaf Teas black teas : boiling ( 212 F ) water , steep for 3-4 minutes ; if serving with milk or lemon , steep 4-5 minutes green teas : slightly less than boiling ( 180 F ) , steep 2-3 minutes oolong teas : lighter oolongs use warm ( 180 F ) water , steep for 2-3 minutes white teas : less than boiling ( 180 F ) water , steep for 2-3 minutes herbal tisanes : boiling ( 212 F ) water , steep for 5-8 minutes Fanning , Crushed Leaves , or Powder This is what most pre-bagged teas are , and since they have been processed to be finer , they require a shorter brewing time . ( Finer leaves means more surface area , so you get more tannins per second when brewing , compared to tea leaves in larger pieces . ) Use guidelines above , but brew for 1-1 .5 minutes less than whole leaf teas The bitter taste comes from <URL> . There are two ways for tea to become unpleasantly bitter : steeping at too high a temperature , or steeping for too long . ( It 's also possible that if your water is heavily chlorinated or otherwise impure that it could be making your tea taste bad , but that 's far less likely than improper brewing . ) If you 're making tea from loose tea leaves , using too many leaves could also make your tea bitter ; a good rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of tea per 8 oz of water , though this can vary depending on the type of tea you 're making . Generally speaking , the longer you brew tea , the more tannins will be released and the bitterer the tea will be . If you use the times above as a starting point , you should n't get any overly bitter tea , but remember : each batch of tea is unique , and each tea drinker 's taste is different . Experiment until you find what you consider to be the perfect cup of tea . Lastly , start with good quality tea . Some tea is poorly processed and the flavor is ruined before you 've even opened the package . If you start with a high-quality tea , you 're much more likely to get good results . :)
I ended up measuring the scoop spoon the next time I was in the US , and it turned out to be 1 Tablespoon .
If your beef shank is chewy , it 's undercooked . Period . Whatever the amount of time is , even if it seems like a lot to you , it 's not enough . Overcooking will cause meat cuts with a lot of connective tissue ( like shank ) to dry , and even fall apart because it is too tender . But it will not still be chewy .
Like many crafts which originated in Japan , their sushi training more or less creates sushi artisans . If you just want to make a snack , you 'll have plenty of ability given a basic review of techniques . You should focus your learning on understanding food-safety , getting the rice right , and making the roll not fall apart . The rest is just levels of mastery which you need not approach in your kitchen in order to experiment and enjoy a good dish .
Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it ( it 's not quite vinegar , not quite wine ) . I 'd probably try a blend of some other mustard + a little white wine vinegar ( not white vinegar ; white wine vinegar ) or champaigne vinegar or apple cider vinegar . ( Maybe even a dry white wine , if you have that on hand ) . If you have dry mustard powder , and some time to let it sit , you could also try making your own ; most of the recipes online seem to use a dry white wine as their base , a few use white wine vinegar .
I 'm not sure whether you meant <URL> . If so : These are made of yeast-leavened dough which is quite soft . ( Yeast-leavened dough is also part of toast , pizza , bagels , some kinds of donuts etc. ) In addition , <URL> : Between two layers of dough there is a layer of solid fat ( like butter ) . I think that the fat will make the yeast-leavened dough " extra " moist . To make a simple yeast-leavened dough you need water , ( plain wheat ) flour , salt and yeast . Some other pastries require sugar , fat ( e.g. butter ) , replace water with milk , et cetera ... The flour needs to have <URL> otherwise the dough can not hold the tiny air bubbles that the yeast produces and the dough wo n't be able to rise . Plain wheat flour suits perfectly for this purpose . But it has a disadvantage : If you store the pastry wrongly , the pastry will be frumpy . ( 1 ) Just pick a nice receipe of cinnamon rolls and you 'll see :D If you want to know more about cooking and stuff : " Cooking for Geeks : Real Science , Great Hacks , and Good Food " by Jeff Potter ( O'Reilly &amp; Associates ) . Seems to be a nice book for geeks :D ( 1 ) Source : " Kochen für Geeks " - somehow I could not find the chapter about yeast in the English pendant .
Garlic is a wonderful vegetable that can add intense flavor , and is also praised by many people for its healthful benefits . But as is the case for most strongly flavored foods , personal preference varies widely . You 've already established one reference point , in that the amount you 've used in the past was insufficient to result in a flavor that you personally found strong enough . So , the obvious next step is to increase that amount gradually each time you prepare that particular recipe until you reach a point you find most pleasing , or at least until the garlic flavor sounds a note that harmonizes with the dish . Note that garlic cloves vary not merely in size , but also in intensity of flavor ; depending on the source , age , and other factors . With experience , you 'll gain a sense of this , partly from the aroma and " feel " of the garlic . As is the case with many cooking techniques , with practice you 'll become better at judging this too . Also to consider , is what form you 're using the garlic in your recipe . For example , a meat roast recipe may call for whole cloves to be inserted , causing the flavor to disperse from the inside out . A sauté or sauce calling for minced garlic , distributes the flavor more evenly . Using a garlic press goes even farther , releasing juice and making it almost like a paste -- this works very good in a marinade , but it might be too strong for other things . You can also throw whole cloves of garlic in with potatoes while steaming them -- the garlic will become buttery soft and blend in beautifully to make delicious garlic mashed potatoes . If your garlic is burning , most likely the heat is too high , or else you 're cooking it too long . At what point you add it to the dish , depends on what you 're cooking , and what other ingredients are included . If I 'm sautéing up a collections of vegetables , I 'll usually begin with onions in the skillet first , and mince up the garlic while they 're starting to cook . The onions will have " sweat " a bit , reducing the chance of the garlic burning . Your task now is to experiment with all of these things , observing the differences in how it appeals to your own taste . If you only ever cook for yourself , you 'll be all set . However , if you 're cooking for others , you may wish to moderate the garlic level , to suit the tastes of your guests -- for that , there 's no rule of thumb . If you 're cooking for diners who normally eat bland or packaged food , a little garlic can go a long way . But for people who are used to ethic food where garlic is prominent , it might be impossible to use too much . The key to seizing control of garlic and mastering it in your kitchen , is to explore and understand how it tastes to you . Doing so will give you the knowledge and skill to wield garlic with confidence . Have fun , enjoy garlic , and listen to feedback from your guests .
Yes , you can squeeze citrus too much . That bitterness you sometimes taste in citrus fruit comes from limonin , a compound that most people can detect at concentrations as small as a few parts per million . In many citrus fruits the limonin is created once the acids of the juice vesicles interact with LARL , a tasteless substance in the fruit 's tissues ( <URL> ) . In the juice of a squeezed lime the reaction from LARL to limonin takes a few hours to complete , so if it is very fresh it will not be as bitter . Over-squeezing , as in using a pestle , will expose more of the tissue ( and therefore LARL ) resulting in more bitterness later on . If the peels are in the mix , it will also extract some of the oils ( mainly limonene ) from the peel , which is very bitter . So bitter , that <URL> are designed so that the juice extracts never touch the peel . During summer , guests often ask for caipirinhas at our house . I like to imagine that it is because I peel my limes , remove most of the white pith including stem , and try to mash the limes just before mixing the drink . This way it requires less sugar allowing those great citrus flavors to stand out .
TL : DR answer - not really . The beaten egg whites are an integral component of the souffle , forming both the rising action of the mixture ( by capturing air within the protein network of the eggs ) and and the structure . The recipe you linked to is more of a cake than a souffle , even using the creaming method commonly seen in cake production . While other ingredients can capture air as well ( such as the gluten formation from flour in a cake or bread ) , they change the nature of this dish so much that it 's no longer recognizable as a souffle . Adding baking soda unfortunately wo n't help in this particular instance as the rise caused by this is due to the carbon dioxide gas released . The souffles have that part covered with the air bubbles released during baking - what they need is the structure to trap them in . I hope that helped to clarify !
First , try proofing your yeast ( mix 110 ° F water , a little sugar , and a little yeast in a small container ; confirm that it foams ) . It may be that your yeast is ( well ) past its prime . That 's the most likely reason I can think of that your dough did n't rise . Second reason could be that while mixing , the dough got too hot -- heat will kill yeast . Yeast dies somewhere around 130 ° F , but really you want to keep it much cooler than that . If its getting too hot , consider starting with colder ingredients ( e.g. , ignore the instruction to warm the milk ) . Finally , I 'd suggest using recipes that are by weight ; flour is much easier to measure by weight . You may be using a different scooping technique than the recipe author . Also -- there is something weird about that recipe . It lists 3 1/2 cups flour in the ingredients , but then only has you add 2 1/2 cups in the steps . I suspect that is a mistake , and explains the batter-like consistency you got .
Supply and demand . Supplies of avocados are declining due to droughts and unusual weather patterns . Not only drought can reduce crops , but unusual cool weather patterns can as well . Avocados dislike temperatures lower than 10 ° C and have absolutely no frost tolerance . Demand for avocados is going steadily upward as more people enjoy cuisines in which they are popular , such as Mexican and many South American dishes . Avocado oil is becoming more in demand as people consume it for its healthy omegas , and cooks use it due to its high smoke-point . Declining supply + rising demand = high prices .

Is there an easy way to tell if a pan/pot is oven-safe ?
Speaking in generalizations , without knowing the details of content : Anything with a non-stick coating - I would n't put it in the oven . If you do n't know what the non-stick coating is made of , you ca n't be sure if it will melt . Additionally high temperatures and non-stick coating make for off-gassing . Anything with plastic handles , knobs or any other plastic parts - do n't put it in the oven at any temperature . No way to know how it will react . Cast iron - always oven safe to almost any temp that a non-commercial oven would reach Enameled cast iron ( like Le Crueset ) - oven safe to 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Uncoated stainless steel - oven safe to 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Uncoated anodized aluminum - I would say no more than 450 ° F ( 230 ° C ) , to be safe Copper - 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) Glass - 450 ° F ( 230 ° C )
The ideal tool depends on what you 're trying to do with it . If you want something nice and fine , which will release as much flavor as possible , avoid getting any of the pith , and not add distracting texture to a dish , use a fine rasp grater ( sometimes known by the brand name microplane ) : ( There are also coarse rasp graters . That wo n't be any better than a standard grater . You want one that looks like the picture . ) If you want something small but visible , use a citrus zester : You can get skinny little strips that tend to curl with the small holes at the end , and bigger curls like you 've seen on the rims of cocktails with the wider hole in the middle . ( Edit : added the second picture . That looks like it was fun . ) Finally , if you want big pieces to put in something to cook in something , then maybe fish out later , you can use a normal vegetable peeler :
Sure , just roast them in a pan with oil for few seconds , not long enough to darken , and remove the nuts . As soon as you remove the cashews from oil they are sticky , then you need to sprinkle salt on it . Do n't add much -- add slightly , checking the taste , and then mix according to the taste you require .
I 'm going to step out on a limb here and declare that you 'll need to add more of the other ingredients . Even then , you 're likely to throw off the overall balance of flavors because they have not all cooked together . Here 's a <URL> that suggests there are about 6 compounds that primarily contribute to the flavor and aroma of celery . However , as a home cook , I have no idea what any of these are or how to suppress them specifically . It may be possible to do so , but that solution is likely to be impractical for the home chef . Another problem is that celery has a very flavor-enhancing effect ; this is why it shows up so often in traditional vegetable bases like <URL> and <URL> . Here 's another <URL> summarizing a paper that identified the specific compounds responsible for this ; the odd thing is that these " phthalides " are largely tasteless . In short : the balance and overall tastiness of your soup might have been reached specifically by adding so much celery . I think you 're going to have to chalk this one up as a learning experience and adjust your recipe next time . One thing you could try ( if you 're not already , which would surprise me a little ) is <URL> the celery . I find that this makes the flavor overall a bit milder , with less of the vegetal-bitter flavors while still getting the umami-enhancing effect .
I think it would depend on the cheese . For a reasonably hard cheese , like cheddar , I have done it , and never gotten sick ( your results may vary ) . If it 's pre-grated , then I would not touch it anymore . For a softer cheese , like a brie , I would not risk it .
It 's usually safe to eat the skins of potatoes . If there is a greenish tint under the skin , you 'll want to peel down to below the greenish bit . If you do n't , it could lead to solanine poisoning . See <URL> and <URL>
Usually you can tell when Pineapples are ripen , which will be sweet , when Leaves are loose and can easily be picked from the top The shell has golden colour ( but not dark brown , these are getting rotten ) The aroma even from out of the shell is strong A typical pineapple that is bought green and unripen , takes one to two days to ripe well . Do n't put them in the fridge if you want to ripe them . Keep them out on the counter . As a street food vendor , we always keep them in the truck for one night prior to selling , that ensure the pineapples ripe enough and the juice comes out of it . Hope it helps .
It 's semantic nitpicking . Tofu is defined as soy milk , curdled and pressed . Some people who do n't care about oriental culinary tradition think of tofu as any non-dairy milk that is curdled and pressed into a curd . Technically your almond tofu would be almond milk curd or some such . In reality your coworker is being pedantic and I would accept the term " almond tofu " as a perfectly understandable , non oriental , colloquialism .
I 've had good luck baking naan on an indoor grill . I have an electric one , but you could use a stovetop one as well . Just apply a little butter , ghee , or spray oil , wipe it off , and bake . ( Click for larger images ) <URL> <URL> I used an alternative method to make lavash : an inverted wok over a stove burner . You 'll need a gas stove to do this one . I applied them dry , cooked about 1-2 minutes on one side only . You can brush with butter or ghee after they 're done . <URL> <URL> <URL>
That is wax , it 's done to help keep the moisture in the root . Turnips are also . You know it 's getting along when it gets soft and spongy or when the skin starts to wrinkle , same with turnips , beets , parsnips , carrots ... You pretty much can tell whether they are good or not in exactly the same ways . Are the firm and crisp or soft , flabby and spongy ?
Unfortunately sorting bread pans by loaf weight is very vague . A 1lb light and fluffy white sandwich bread might have about the same size as a 2lb heavy , dense wholegrain or rye bread . Also , do you expect your bread to rise really high over the rim or should that be more of a limit ? In short , the size of " a 1lb bread " depends a lot on the kind of bread you have in mind . A quick Internet check of pan dimensions from various manufactureres confirms that there is no standard size , it seems they vary by up to 50 % in volume . So if your relative 's wish list states a pan of a certain size , I suggets you go shopping equipped with a meassuring tape instead of looking for a certain " pound value " . Side note : Most 2lb pans are a tad bigger that the requested size and 1lb ones a bit smaller , but I found <URL> sold in the UK by Williams Sonoma ( what a coincidence ! ) that seems to have exactly the sought-for dimensions .
Cook it less , if you can . The more you cook it , the more you get that smell . Perhaps you are just more sensitive to it than most ; I do n't generally notice it until it 's overcooked by my standards . Along with this , cook it as fast as you can . The flavor you do n't like is produced by enzymes converting precursor molecules into those with the flavor . From On Food and Cooking : Heating cabbages and their friends has two different effects . Initially the temperature rise ... speeds the enzyme activity and flavor generation , with maximum activity around 140F/60C . The enzymes stop working altogether somewhere short of the boiling point . If the enzymes are quickly inactivated by plunging the vegetables into abundant boiling water , then many of the flavor precursor molecules will be left intact . ... If the cooking period is prolonged , then the constant heat gradually transforms the flavor molecules . Eventually the sulfur compounds end up forming trisulfides , which accumulate and are mainly responsible for the strong and lingering smell of overcooked cabbage . So as suggested by others , boiling instead of steaming to reduce cooking time helps . So does cooling quickly , with cold or ice water . Boiling in excess water will also leach some out , but you might also lose flavor you like . A couple other thoughts , also from On Food and Cooking . Cabbage family vegetables grown in the summer , and under drought stress , produce more of the flavor precursors , and those grown in the autumn and winter with less light and more water have less . They 're also more concentrated in the core of the vegetables . And for cabbage , you can remove a lot of them by chopping and soaking in cold water ; conceivably the same could work for broccoli , but again perhaps at the cost of desirable flavor .
When you do n't preheat , you cook your food at a lower temperature as your oven heats up for the first 5-15 minutes , depending on the target temperature and your oven 's strength . For forgiving foods , like a casserole , this may not affect you much - you 'll just have to bake longer than the recipe says to . As long as you 're careful , you 'll be fine . But if you 're baking something that should be baked for a short time at a relatively high temperature , your results are going to be very different . For example , take traditional Southern biscuits : they 're baked very hot for less than ten minutes . This cooks them all the way through , and browns the top and bottom . If your oven starts out cold , they 're going to be done in the middle before they 're brown ! Beyond under-browning , you 'll also run into problems like lack of rising in steam-leavened foods . Pastries , in particular , could probably be disastrous .
Two things . Use a sharper knife . Do n't chop , but slice gently . Let the weight of the blade do the cutting .
If it has a shiny/reflective surface and does n't melt or bloom ( much ) at room temperature or hand temperature , then it 's already tempered . Virtually every packaged chocolate is already tempered . Untempered chocolate generally needs to be refrigerated for longer-term storage , so if a package does n't specify refrigeration ( and I 've never seen one that does ) , you can assume that it is tempered .
Restaurant supply stores carry degreaser , which will remove the brown baked on oil . However , that oil is n't hurting your cooking at all . It is the same thing that forms on cast iron skillets , but it is n't objectionable because you do n't notice the color against the black of the cast iron . If it works I 'd continue to use it . If you are thinking of changing , you might want to consider the cast iron Dutch Oven route . They hold their heat better than consumer deep fryers and a Dutch oven can do more than just deep fry . And they are easier to clean .
Buying local honey is one way to be sure that what you are getting is " honey " . I 've never heard of people passing off something else as honey . Is n't that why we have the fda ? If you are buying it in the store , check the lable ... my honey has one ingredient ; honey .
You want the ones that look like little tiny T-bone steaks . Typically they are called Lamb Chops , but look first as there are different cuts under that name . You might also consider doing a rack , which is the equivalent to a Rib Roast , but obviously much smaller . For the rack , I 'd sear it in a pan , and then broil it until done . ( 15-25 minutes , 140-160 degrees ) .
Cut out any green parts then remove the skin . If you can see any remaining green parts after the skin is removed then cut them out too . What you 'll have at this point will likely look and feel like any other peeled potato except with bits cut out . If it still feels soft or looks unusual throw it out , otherwise its fine . Just a normal potato whose skin had gone a bit wrinkly and soft .
How to see if your pasta is " al dente " : If your pasta cooks about in 10 minutes ( for example ) , when you put pasta into the boiling water take one pasta after 8 minute ( about 20 % before the time of cook ) , bite it and observe the pasta : the external is more yellow than the internal that is white . When the internal white disappears the pasta has cooked " normale " , when the internal white is small the pasta is " al dente " .

Why do n't my cookies flatten ?
There are a few things I can think of . The first is , are you sure your oven is at the right temperature ? Although your oven may beep that it 's preheated , without checking it with an oven or infrared thermometer you ca n't be sure that it 's actually at the temperature you need - and even if it is at that temperature where the sensor is , it might not be the same temperature elsewhere in the oven . Try moving the rack you 're using one or two levels closer to or further from the element and see if it makes a difference ( further will probably be better if you 're trying to increase spread ) . My oven has a 50-75 & deg ; F range from the top rack to the bottom - a major difference when it comes to baking ! Understanding my oven 's temperature range changed my baking outcomes significantly . Second , are you letting the dough come to room temperature before baking ? I 've found that the colder my dough , the less spread I get . On Betty Crocker 's site , there is <URL> and under " Why do n't my cookies spread " , they recommend using an aluminum sheet - the darker the cookie sheet , apparently , the less spread you will get . I have n't tested this personally , but I trust the source :) I get good spread on my silpat baking sheets , for what it 's worth . The only other thing I can think of is your butter , is it truly softened , or is it a hard block , or is it melted ? I 'm not an experienced enough baker to explain the science behind the differences as they relate to baking , but I do know that those three options will produce significantly different results . I believe that if your butter is too cold , they wo n't spread as much as they could - but hopefully someone can chime in and confirm or deny that . Oh , and I asked a friend of mine who 's a baker - she said that it 's possible that your baking soda is old , and that could cause it , but I do n't know from first hand experience if that 's possible or not . I trust her judgment though , as she 's my go-to with baking questions and she 's never led me astray .
As Michael mentioned , a shaken vinaigrette is only going to stay together primarily while you 're shaking it . If it 's been staying together long consider yourself lucky all the other times ... this time was what should be " normal " . The more particulate such as herbs , mustard , spices , etc. that you have in a vinaigrette the quicker it will emulsify and the longer it will stay emulsified . The particles of spice and herbs act as physical barriers that help to interrupt the droplets of oil so that they are n't able to coalesce and come together as they can when you have just oil and vinegar/acid . When doing vinaigrettes by hand using a whisk , start with your acid and add the salt along with anything else , leaving the oil last . Adding salt to the acid component will help it to better dissolve so you get a truer reading on the flavor . When it 's added last as it 's usually written in most recipes : " season to taste with salt and pepper " , the salt usually has n't dissolved by the time you taste it and you 're much more likely to add too much , resulting in a dressing that 's a bit saltier than you might like . The manner in which you drizzle the oil and manner in which you whisk it when doing by hand , are also important factors . When whisking vinagirettes by hand , drizzle the oil form a higher level so that as it hits the bowl you have a finer stream that 's easier to emulsify . Also , use a back and forth " zig-zag " motion rather than a circular whisking motion . The " zig-zag " motion will allow the wires of the whisk to better break up the oil into droplets and emulsify them with the acid . Using a circular motion creates a vortex in the center of the acid where the oil tends to pool , resulting in an oily vinaigrette . The great part of using an immersion blender ( aka stick or wand blender ) is that EVERYTHING can go in at once . Use a container that 's deeper than it is wide ( such as 2 cup liquid measure ) so that there 's plenty of depth for the liquid . Garlic , shallots and herbs can even go in whole . The immersion blender will blend up your garlic , etc. and emulsify the oil with the vinegar . An immersion blender or a standard blender provide you with a the most stable vinaigrette .
My guess would be that you boiled the soup at some point , possibly for an extended period of time . If you bring it to a full boil the fat from the meat will emulsify and distribute itself through the liquid . This is the same stuff that foams to the top , the " scum " that a lot of recipes ( usually ones that say bring to a boil , then simmer ) tell you to skim off . I would venture to say that this distribution of the fat into the liquid is also why it tasted heavier . When making stock or soups , the most I 'll heat them is to just below boiling and keep them at that simmer for a little longer to make up for not bringing it to a boil . When making stock , I strain once through a chinois and again through a piece of cheesecloth in a chinois to help reduce the floating particulates , but this wo n't really solve the cloudiness problem ( though it will help some ) . You can also try putting it into the fridge overnight so that the fat comes to the top and solidifies , but I do n't think this will solve the problem , only help reduce it . If it 's just the stock that 's gone cloudy , <URL> has some suggestions on how to clarify it , but honestly unless you 're presenting it to guests , I see no reason to even bother . I 've made cloudy stock and clear stock before and except for a slight " heaviness " difference , the taste is generally about the same . The cloudy stock sometimes has a more oily mouth feel , but it 's not a major difference - and I 've found some people seem to prefer the soups or rices I make with a cloudy stock . If you have a hard time controlling the temperature on your range-top , you can use an oven-safe stock pot and cook it in the oven at 180 & deg ; F to keep it just below a boil . One other trick , depending on what kind of soup you were making - if you were making ( for example ) chicken soup , consider trying to turn it into a cream of chicken soup to hide the cloudy broth :)
You can season the exterior of the kettle to help prevent rust , if you like . The interior of a cast iron tea kettle is often rust-proofed through chemicals that accrue during normal use . One of these is lime scale . Repeatedly boiling water , especially hard water , will build a coating of lime scale that will keep rust at bay . Another set of chemicals that help reduce the occurrence of rust are tannins . The tannic acid in tea leaves will react with red iron rust on the kettle to produce a more stable , blue-black compound called ferric tannate . To " season " a brand new tea kettle you can save used tea leaves and bags then place several in the pot and adding boiling water . Allow the " tea " to sit for 20 minutes then discard and rinse . As other answers state , a traditional fat-polymer seasoning of the interior is unnecessary because you do not need to prevent food from sticking to the kettle .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
Unfortunately , cornstarch does that . It does not reheat well . Potato starch is even worse , and that 's the thickener in Knorr 's Leek Soup . If you want to reheat something thickened , your best bet is to thicken it with a roux . There are other more modern thickeners ( think molecular gastronomy ) , but I do n't know much about those .
Follow these steps and watch very carefully ... Set your oven on Broil ( high ) and put your rack on the top shelf . Let the oven get nice and hot ( 3-7 minutes ) . Fill an oven safe dish with crushed ice and water and place your dishes into the ice/water bath . The cold bath should keep the custard from cooking , but the sugar on top will heat till it caramelizes . It 'll only take 3-4mins .
It may be that your oven is not up to temperature before your first batch goes in . If it 's not hot enough your cookies will have more time to melt and flatten before they cook . Try giving the oven 10 more minute preheating time before putting your first batch in .
You already have mentioned the primary reason for adding the flour : to thicken the chowder . The author of this particular recipe has added it to the recipe while you are sauteeing the aromatics , I infer . This creates , in essence , a quick roux , cooking some of the raw taste out of the flour , and helping ensure that you will not get lumps . You could certainly thicken the chowder later with a flour slurry , for example , but this method is convenient and effective in this type of recipe .
It 's definitely a very real reaction . I 'm not sure exactly what in the squash it is that causes it , but since different people react differently - some people have strong reactions like you , some people have mild ones , and some have no problem at all - it seems to be some sort of mild allergic reaction . It 's often called contact dermatitis , but that 's a very generic term and does n't really mean anything you do n't already know . I 'm not sure exactly what component of the squash it is that causes it , but I do n't think it 's carotene or potassium . It 's likely some more complex molecule that tends to be present in various winter squashes . Images from <URL> . You can avoid it by completely wearing gloves while working with the squash , or if you 're lucky , you have someone else with you who can handle the squash without problems . For many purposes , like soup , you can also simply cut the squash in half , roast it , then scoop out the good stuff . But if you do really need to peel it and cut into chunks , your best hope is just to try to avoid touching it too much . You 'll also want to wash your hands immediately after , or even a few times while you 're cutting if it takes a while . If you do end up with this despite your best efforts , cortisone cream can help relieve the reaction afterward . ( And as for your soup , there 's nothing wrong with letting more moisture escape in exchange for browning . You can always just add more water or stock back into the soup . This can even be a good thing , since it lets you replace water with a more flavorful liquid . )
Your question has two main parts , what 's elastic about gluten , and why do n't other plants have this unicorn we call a gluten protein . I 'll provide some background info first , but feel free to skip ahead to the spoilers if you like . Quick and dirty background on proteins ... All proteins ( like gluten ) are made of differing sequences , and number of about 20 or so basic amino acids ( glutamine , lysine , cysteine , arginine , isoleucine , just to name a few ) . So when we talk about large proteins like gluten , it 's sometimes hard to remember that chemically , we are talking about many-many amino acid ( AA ) molecules which link together . The way the AA 's link together matters because , the chemical interactions create the overall larger shape , and helps determine the physical properties of the final protein . If I did n't put you to sleep , or you want to geek-out on this stuff : resources regarding the secondary ( bonding between AA 's which creates alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets ) , tertiary ( AA side chain interactions and AA 's backbone ) , and quaternary ( 3D ) structures of proteins , pubmed is where you need to go . Glutens and what they are : Gluten is the main storage form of proteins in wheat . Gluten itself is a fusion of glutenin and gliadin protein units which belong to the prolamin superfamily ( prolamines are cool , look them up ) . Gluten subunits fall into three broad categories : High molecular weight ( HMW ) prolamines , ( glutenin subunits ) approximately 6-10 % of protein Sulfur-rich prolamins ( approximately 70-80 % of protein ) which include : gamma-gliadins , alpha-gliadins , and the B - and C-type low molecular weight ( LMW ) subunits of glutenin Sulfur-poor prolamins ( approximately 10-20 % of protein ) include : v-gliadins , and D-type LMW subunits of glutenin Variances in the spread of these proteins contribute to the way wheat varietals are utilized commercially ( like winter or summer wheats ... you have seen the variations available to buy on store shelves ) . The composition of gluten protein in whatever wheat strain that 's being used translates into differing physical properties ( elasticity , density , etc ) in the dough it makes . Where do the elastic properties come from ? Elastic properties in gluten come from the way the components of the protein matrix interact with water . The gluten proteins react with water in ways that other storage forms of protein can not , namely in the swelling/hydration bit . There are two things going on at the same time . The gliadin sections of the gluten protein contribute to the friction with which the hydrating liquid is able to move around in and near the protein matrices ( viscocity ) . The glutenin portion of the molecule is responsible for the elasticity or strength of the protein matrix . Glutenin seems to undergo reversible ( not as common as you 'd hope ) stretching because of the way it is folded . Why do n't any other grain proteins seem to have gluten ? I would like to point out this is more of a plant physiology/phylogeny question rather than one related to cooking . They just do n't have what it takes . The way different plants create the storage form of their proteins is determined by their specific DNA sequences within the genome . AA Structure , order ( N-C terminus ) and final shape of the proteins created by the plant are a result of the transcription , translation and post-translational modifications of DNA sequences in the plant .

Gerbil gave the basic reasons as to why this might be happening , but as for the ' how to recover ' ... you have a few options : Wait for it to finish separating , and take the oil off , then serve without oil . If you still want some fat for mouthfeel , after separating , you can add some butter back into the warm ( but not too hot ) sauce , and stir 'til melted and combined . If going for a more gravy-like consistency , after separating , put the oil back into the pan , make a roux and follow the <URL> , but use the juices in place of the milk . After separating , take some of the non-oil part , add an emulsifier ( eg , mustard ) , then slowly whisk back in some fat , add some of the juices , then slowly add the rest of the fat 'til it 's the consistency you want . Put it into a blender an mix ( although , open the vent hole , then put a towel over the lid , and hold it down with one hand when you turn it on ... blending hot things can be a mess ) or use a stick blender . In the future , I would separate out the juice &amp; fats before reducing . You never know quite how much fat will render out of a piece of meat , and I feel I can reduce the juices faster when there is n't fat in there , but I 've never actually timed it . Or , you can go the roux / gravy route if you 're in a hurry .
Assuming your roux is flour based , the original recipe mixture was able to be a sauce because the proteins in the flour formed gluten and created that lovely thickness we enjoy ( your seasonings sound like a nice combo ) . The water from the other ingredients are trapped in the gluten . Unfortunately , when you freeze it , the water molecules form sharp shapes like knives and cut your gluten strands . This is n't a noticeble problem until your defrost it . It does n't matter how quickly or slowing you defrost . The damage was done when it was frozen . To work around this issue , you have to freeze it faster ! Professional establishments can super freeze things super fast . Freezing faster will make smaller knife-shaped ice crystals and that reduces the damage . TIPS : freeze in smaller portions and shallower depth on a pre-frozen metal cookie sheet . Defrost and strain the sauce . Make a new roux and add the defrosted &amp; strained sauce . The flavor comes from the frozen sauce and the new roux recreates the gluten .
One of the first things I learned in Indian cooking is that the combination of tomatoes , onions and ginger is self-thickening . As time went by , I realised that the thickening effect is far more noticable with old varieties of tomatoes - " beef " tomatoes and a lot of the modern varieties are difficult to thicken unless partially fried first . Despite the absence of ginger , I suspect that the thickening is purely a natural action between the tomatoes and the onion , and that the tomatoes used were some particularly nice old variety .
Corn masa is what you need for this . The process of nixtamalization makes the corn more easily ground and therefore the texture of doughs made with it will not be " gritty " in the way that a dough made with corn meal or corn flour will be . Also , corn masa ( or masa harina ) is more nutritious than standard corn products due to the chemical changes that result from the nixtamalization process .
Puff pastry is a laminated dough , with very strong gluten development , so an extra couple of days in the refrigerator should not have caused problems . 450 F seems like a typical temperature , and the time seems in the normal range . The only thing you have mentioned is that is definitely outside the standard treatment is trimming the edges with a butter knife . Normally , you want to trim or cut puff pastry with a very sharp knife or pizza cutter , in order to cleanly cut through the layers . A blunt knife like a butter knife can mash the layers together , making it hard for them to separate at the edges of the pastry . Still , this should have lead to lopsided or strangely risen pastry , rather than a complete failure to rise , especially in the center . The other possibility is that the dough was too warm when you rolled and worked it , or that you rolled it too much , which would work the fat or butter layers into the dough phase , rather than keeping discrete layers of flour then fat , which is what allows the rise .
Toughness is usually the result of either too much gluten ( which in turn comes from using a flour too high in protein ) , or not enough fat ( or possibly adding the fat at the wrong time ) . Poor volume on the other hand is usually the result of using low-protein flour , and thus not having enough gluten formation . Therefore it is logical to assume that the most likely cause of your bread troubles is the fat . Try adding some more fat .
The reason that your basting sauce flopped was the recipe was calling for an emulision ( basically , a vinegrette ) and by leaving out the vinegar you are changing the one of the basic building blocks of the dish . The sauce will require that you add the fats to the mustard as it will clump as experienced if you do n't . The mustard in the original recipe is used as an emuslifer and may need to be cut down without the addition of the vinegar . To build a sauce like this , you should start with the vinegar , add the seasonings and any emulisfers ( in this case , the mustard ) and slowly drizzle the fats into the resulting mixture until all has been incorperated . You will still get a smooth sauce as long as you keep the order even if you leave off an ingredient or two .
If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge , it means you did it right ! Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin ; that 's the very essence of stock-making . The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock ; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency , but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture . The more you reduce the stock , the more gelatinous it will become , so if it turned out stiffer than you expected , it 's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate . Typically , when making stock , you use a very low simmer ; just a few bubbles per minute . Any more than that and your stock will reduce . But reducing is perfectly OK , and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few tablespoons ; it 's like bullion , only without all the salt and preservatives . Heavily-reduced stock is called glace de viande and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick , imparting a powerful meat flavour . But you probably did n't reduce it that much . If you 're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous , even at higher temperatures , you can feel free to dilute it . For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1 , but taste as you go along just to make sure you 're not watering it down too much . When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator , it is probably fat , which you should skim off and discard ( or reserve ) . The rest is your actual stock , and in your case it sounds delicious . Also , since you mention vacuum-sealing - I prefer to use covered ice cube trays for freezing stock . That lets you portion it out much more easily than a big solid blob .
The microwave caused heat which released oils from the coppa 's spice blend , including capsaicin .

How does vacuum sealing something in a mason jar help ?
To have less oxygen and / or other contanminates . Like is used with pumps on wine . Not sure how many foods are negatively effected by oxygen . Potato chips for one . Potatoe chips are also effected by moisture and this is less moisture . According to <URL> fats oxide to produce " off " odors and flavors . Since nuts are sold in sealed bags / jars I suspect they are effected by oxygen . But that may be just for moisture . Found a reference that the oil in nuts will oxidize so low oxygen is good for storage . According to a comment a vacuum also required to create a seal . It kind of makes sense to me but I am not 100 % convinced a vacuum is required for a seal . For sure you are not going to hold a vacuum without a seal . A mod asked me add this information but I do n't feel athoritative here .
I have used diced turnips in dishes as a replacement for potatoes . That may work if you enjoy eating turnips . Of course the taste will be much different than potatoes . According to Wikipedia ( eep , I know ... but just for a rough idea ) : 100 grams of . . Turnips 7g carbs Potatoes 17g carbs
I think what 's really happening here is mostly physics , rather than any magical reaction between the meat and the " velvet " ( i.e. egg and cornstarch ; I 'm going to use this term for brevity ) . The largest effect is that the velvet adds a thin , clingy coating to the outside of the meat . When introduced to heat , that 's providing a barrier to the movement of thermal energy into the meat proteins . The proteins in the egg are denaturing , the starches are gelatinizing , and that absorbs some of the energy that would otherwise have gone into your meat . The presence of sheer additional mass from the velvet also means that it simply takes more energy to raise the overall temperature . This means that the temperature increases more slowly , and can be better controlled ( sort of like sous vide cooking ) . As the starch gelatinizes , it 's also forming a moisture-resistant barrier around the outside of the meat . That could very possibly prevent moisture from leaking out of the meat as it 's squeezed out of cells with denaturing proteins . Ordinarily it would leak out into your poaching liquid ( or wok if you 're stir-frying , where it would rapidly boil off ) but now it 's trapped in the pieces of meat . This is also somewhat analogous to sous vide cooking , or maybe to poaching in oil - the food being cooked stays moist , because the water is trapped inside ( by a bag in sous vide , by hydrophobic oil in oil-poaching ) and has nowhere to go . Another factor is the very gentle cooking being done , in a barely-simmering water bath for a short period of time . This is cooking the meat just up to the point of doneness , by doing so at a rather low temperature ( say 210 F or so , compared to 500 F or higher for a properly hot wok ) and only very briefly , with the velvet coating for additional thermal protection . After that , the meat does n't really need to be cooked much at all - it can be tossed into a nearly finished stir-fry just to the point of being re-heated . That seems to be why <URL> tosses out this interesting comment : The meat remains soft and tender . ( You 've probably noticed in Cantonese restaurants that stir-fried meat is almost never browned or seared . ) I had n't given it much thought before now , but that seems to match my experience in good Chinese restaurants , at least with certain dishes . Contrasting this with stir-frying sans-velvet , think about a browned piece of meat : the surface is covered with a delicious Maillard-browned crust , but those proteins have also been cooked to the point of losing their moisture . Even if the interior of the meat is moist , the outside 's been dried , literally to a crisp . With velveted meat , that 's not the case - each entire piece remains moist , and there 's no browned , crunchy layer . I 'll be the first to admit that much of this is conjecture , but I think it provides a reasonable explanation for some of the processes that keep velveted meat moist . Might be interesting to dig up some scientific references on the thermal gradients of proteins vs. starches - I 'll see what I can find .
You 're correct - it 's a myth , as is adding something acidic to it like lemon juice -- see explanation <URL> . As you said , what causes it to brown is the oxidation , and that 's just exposure to the air . If you wrap a cut avocado ( or guacamole ) in plastic wrap so there 's no air space between the wrap and the avocado , then it will stay green longer than areas where air is getting to it .
The are n't coated , but the chocolate is mixed with hardeners . Things like xanthan gum , gum Arabic , corn starch , bees wax , etc. . These let the chocolate harden and polish a little better .
No . The amount of salt you would have to add to water to make an appreciable difference is enormous . Salt is added to water for various reasons : to season whatever is being cooked in it ; to maintain colour ; to maintain structural integrity .
That depends on the rice . I have done my own measurements in the past ( I hate volumetric measurements , ) and found : 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Brown rice ( medium grain ? ) weighed 142g . 1 full-to-the-brim rice cooker cup of dry SunRice Calrose rice ( medium grain ) weighed 150g . Both were Australian grown rice . The rice cooker cup 's top measurement is 160ml , but I always fill to the brim because ... I 'm too lazy to look at the notch . Why is the weight different ? Because different grains of rice can wedge together more efficiently ( less air pockets . ) The weight measurement for a long grain rice like Basmati would be different again . TL ; DR : buy a scale to be accurate .
To answer your last question : yes . Regarding the previous question , it 's because the temperature at which the cocoa butter in the chocolate crystallizes affects the overall consistency of the chocolate . If you 've ever eaten a chocolate bar that was left in a car on a hot day after it has cooled down again , and who has n't , you 'll know about this . Sometimes chocolate tastes fine but has a definite ' grittiness ' to it : other things being equal , that 's usually because the cocoa butter crystals are too large . Cocoa butter has a number of different crystal forms , each of which will have a slightly different effect on texture and melting point . When melted chocolate sets , the cocoa butter crystallizes , and it will generally all crystallize with the structure that it starts to crystallize with . ( This process where crystals start to grow is called nucleation . ) So you want to have control over the temperature at which crystallization starts . The optimum crystal form for nice chocolate will tend to predominate when crystallization starts somewhere between 18-25 degrees C ( around 64-77F ) . So if you think about it : when you add room temperature stuff ( like a pretzel ) to chocolate that is considerably hotter than room temperature , the resultant temperature on the surface of that pretzel will likely be way higher than 18-25 degrees . On the other hand , if you are dipping an item that is significantly below room temp , then your chances of hitting that window are much higher . The surface structure of the thing being dipped can of course make a difference to crystallization as well , but for normal purposes that is marginal . To put it another way , it does n't matter what ingredients you 're dipping - temperature is key !
I grew up in a fishing village and making shrimp paste is one thing we do for a living . The good manufacturing practices we observe keep our shrimp paste in good condition for a year and a half . I do n't even put it in a refrigerator .
Forever . Honey , comb present or otherwise , does not go bad . It even acts as a preservative . The date you are seeing is solely referring to the " quality " degradation . Completely edible honey has been found in 3,000 year old Egyptian tombs .
I surveyed many recipes available by googling " Loation sticky rice " , " Thai sticky rice " and " Viet sticky rice " . None of them mentioned kneading anything in after 30 or 40 recipes , although many mention fluffing , folding , or stirring the rice after cooking or steaming to manage the texture . Several did mention that it is appropriate for eating with one 's hands . The key may be the variety of rice that is used . Short grained glutinous rice will have the sticky texture desired .
I have never added butter to sponge sheets when making swiss rolls , jelly rolls , or anything similar in the past . It 's just straight up bread flour , sugar , and eggs . I can only think of three possible reasons why butter might be added : To improve the flavour ; To keep the sheets moist and help prevent overbaking , as any fat would be used in cake batter ; however , this is generally not a major concern in cake rolls ; or To help prevent it from sticking to the sheet ( do n't bother ; if you have this problem , use a silicone mat ) . Reasons # 2 and # 3 are n't very convincing to me , so I would only bother adding butter if you prefer the taste of swiss rolls with butter added . I do n't think butter would help with rolling at all , in fact it might make rolling more difficult on account of making the sheets more crumbly and less able to hold together under pressure .
As to the science behind why this works , I can only guess . However , as to other things you can try for this trick , I managed to find some references from old cookbooks about using slices of potato for clarifying their deep-fryer oil . Other suggestions were a slice of bread or lemon peel . Weird -- but interesting . <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> When you have finished frying , clarify the oil by frying a piece of bread , a strip of lemon peel , or a slice of potato in it .
Note : This answer goes in a bit more detail than necessary to answer the question . If you truly only care about the hydration , please only read " Water/flour ratio " and " Flavor of the bread " . I have added the other information as well since the effects are similar to that of a change in hydration . I 've frequently baked ( about once to twice a week ) with sourdough for 4 years now . I 'm not a professional . The only thing I can take a bit of pride in is that a professional baker who tested a loaf of my sourdough bread told me that it 's " fantastic , considering the little possibilities available to control the conditions the sourdough and loaf are exposed to at home " . So while far from perfect , I 'd consider my sourdough breads and knowledge pretty good . Most of what I 'm writing now was first read on the internet somewhere and confirmed through testing it with my own sourdough culture ( I 'm still using the same one I started out with ) . Apart from the flour you use , there are several factors that affect the taste of the resulting bread : Temperature This has , in my experience , the biggest impact on the taste . The following rules apply : Anything over 40 ° C is deadly to the microbes in your sourdough . Lower temperature : More acetic acid , less lactic acid , yeasts develop more slowly . Higher temperature : More lactic acid , less acetic acid , yeasts develop more quickly . Lactic acid bacteria prefer temperatures at around 30-35 ° C Yeasts like temperatures around 25 ° C best Note : Your sourdough can be 1-2 ° C warmer than the environment due to microbial activity . That can be important to keep in mind . Water/flour ratio Most of the time , people use a ratio of 1:1 water/flour for the sourdough and that will give you good results , but you can play around with that ratio to change the taste to your liking : Lower water content causes more acetic acid production and less developed yeasts Higher water content will make it easier for the yeasts to grow and increase the lactic acid content I 've found that having more than 1.5 times the amount of water compared to the flour will hardly have any effect on the dough anymore and I 'd recommend stirring the dough every couple of hours with that much water . On single staged sourdough , using less than 0.75 times the water compared to the flour is also not a good idea and you will probably be required to add yeast in the bread dough . Salt and oil Adding these , especially salt , to the sourdough already will have a considerable impact on the sourdough taste . A sourdough made with salt in it will taste quite different from one without it . I 'm not quite sure about why this is , but it may have something to do with the yeasts growing more slowly ( more information below ) . Both salt and oil will slow down the growth of the yeasts , but do n't have much of an effect on the lactic acid bacteria . Adding oil mainly affects the mechanical properties of the dough ( it will be softer and more ductile ) . It also helps with the structure of the bread ( the air bubbles in the bread will be smaller and more uniformly distributed ) , especially in the presence of an emulsifyer ( lard is both fat and an emulsifyer , so it works well in this regard ) . For this reason , it does n't make much sense to add it to the sourdough already . Of course , if the fat is n't tasteless , it will also add to the taste of the bread ( I love using natural olive oil in my wheat breads ) . Flavor of the bread Sourdough actually has some pretty complicated chemistry that I know little about . However , here are some effects that I do know : Lactic acid will give your bread a mild , sour taste . This works very well for wheat breads . Acetic acid gives you a stronger , more sour taste ( very noticable while eating ) . This works great for rye breads The amount of yeast in your sourdough also has a big impact on the smell and taste of the bread . Yeast is beneficial to the bread not only for it 's leavening properties . Apart from CO2 , it also produces ethanol , which will esterify the lactic acid to ethyl lactate over time , which in turn has a strong flavor . Okay I think that 's it . I hope this helps you .
Well 1.5 cups is volumetric so the weight will depend on how tightly packed that cup is , if they are chopped , etc. . On average though , 1.5 cups of chopped hazelnuts is about 6.08 oz ( 172 g ) according to the USDA 's averages . You can check the USDA 's <URL> if you want to see estimated weights for 1.5 cups of whole , chopped , or ground hazelnuts .
If you look here , at the last paragraph of <URL> , he gives you a fairly easy way of removing the air from a plastic bag without a vacuum . Put your food in the bag and then submerge the bag in water just to the zip . The pressure will expel all the air . Then zip the bag up as you pull the closed portion underwater . This gets results comparable with a home vacuum sealer , I think , with the added benefit that you can include liquids easily . While I would n't consider myself an expert on this topic , I would n't fill the bag with anything you would n't want to marinate your meat in .
Ok - finally got it open ! While googling , I came across a suggestion to cover the lid with a plastic glove and use that for traction . Not sure if it was the combination of running under hot water + the glove , or if the glove would 've worked on it 's own , but it 's open now :)
Have n't tried it but here : <URL> The link suggests the following technique : Vacuum seal pieces of watermelon ( if you do n't have one , just put it in a ziploc bag and take out as much as the air as possible ) Freeze it overnight Take it out and thaw
It depends on a lot of factors : what you 're describing is n't much different from making jam , and homemade jam is good for about a month , once you open it . Assuming you got the temp high enough to kill all the bacteria , the time will depend entirely on PH and water content . The more acidic , and the less watery the better . Generally things like this freeze well though , so , when in doubt , throw it in the freezer .
If your jars are n't in the refrigerator already , I highly recommend unscrewing the lids as soon as possible ... unless you want to be able to share stories about how you found glass shards and the smell of kimchi everywhere in your kitchen one day . Depending on when you mean to eat them , I 'd recommend a mix of room temperature ripening and fridge storage . Keep the lid completely unscrewed while at room temp until ripened to a stage you prefer , and keep it loosely on in the fridge and eat it up in the next few weeks ( where it will continue to ferment some more but slow down drastically ) . It 's not a terrible idea to put something like a sheet pan under the jars just in case one overflows . Cheesecloth is overkill , but you could choose to use that or anything that 'll cover the top of a jar without making it airtight while at room temp . Glass jars are used often in commercial kimchi production and sale , so other than making sure the lid is n't fully screwed on they 're fine to use . The explosion concern is mostly when you leave it too long ( more than several hours ? ) at room temp or in the fridge for more than a couple weeks - while the jar is completely sealed . This all depends on the kind of kimchi you are storing , of course . I 'm assuming it 's the freshly made napa cabbage type you 're talking about . Some kimchis do n't ferment as much or at all .

Can Fresh unboiled egg pasta be used for lasagna ?
Like Bob said , surely boiling some noodles is way less of a bother than breaking out the pasta machine ? If you really want to make fresh pasta , I do n't see any reason you could n't use it for lasagna without boiling it - the reason one boils dry noodles is because it 's hard to get them to soften in the time it takes to bake the lasagna . But just like when cooking fresh noodles , you need to be careful not to overcook it , so make sure all your fillings are fully cooked before you start layering . It also should be perfectly fine to not cut the noodles into strips - the reason dried noodles come that way is for easier handling . It is possible to make lasagna using dried lasagna noodles without boiling them first , but you need to add more water and bake it longer . A search for " no-boil lasagna " will turn up scores of recipes .
It is absolutely worth adding ground pork or veal . I usually use a leaner ground steak and compensate with a fatty ground pork ( shoulder is good ) - fat = flavour . Another tip is to take your time . Many people try and cook bolognese in half an hour , but considering ground meat is usually made with tougher cuts , you end up with tough meat and under-developed flavours . Use plenty of onions and garlic , brown your meat well , use good wine , stock , tomatoes and herbs ( thyme , rosemary and bay ) and gently simmer that bad boy for at least 3 hours . For ultimate flavour , cook it the day before and let the flavours marry overnight .
Add the baking soda to the cut meat and then wash it off . Measure about a teaspoon in your palm and then sprinkle it over the thinly sliced meat from high up . This way you get a thin layer over all the meat . Wash after some time ( you can do it overnight ) . There is an <URL> that you may follow The baking soda will work like other meat tenderizers , by denaturing the proteins on the surface of the meat , so it should work on pork or chicken as long as the baking soda is on the meat ( and not the skin or fat ) . The tenderizers penetrate the meat very slowly , millimeters per day at refrigerator temperatures , faster at cooking temperatures , so in practice it will only work on thin slices . If you use thicker pieces , you will still change the meat 's surface texture . If you use the baking soda straight into the dish in the same proportion ( some people like it this way ) , adjust your salt accordingly , as the baking soda will make the dish salty .
I do n't want to disappoint you , but the sad truth is that extra virgin olive oil is unsuitable for all the cooking methods you mention . When you heat any oil past its smoking point it starts to deteriorate and can even become dangerous . Olive oil , extra virgin in particular , has a lower smoking point than most other oils . In fact , you will be better off with an olive oil of lesser quality . Such an oil will have been processed and thus purified , increasing its smoking point . You may think that butter is unhealthy , but at high temperatures it will actually withstand the heat better than extra virgin olive oil . Good oils for the purposes you mention are canola oil , sunflower oil , peanut oil , and grapeseed oil .
Based on your edit to your question , and with some additional thought , I 'm going to answer this differently . Soured milk differs from what you called " spoiled " milk in only one way - what wild bacteria reproduced faster : bacteria with tasty waste products or bacteria with disgusting waste products . With that in mind the major potential problems with using this milk to make yogurt are : If the wild bacteria crowd out the yogurt culture If the yogurt culture is not able to work because the milk is too sour . In making homemade yogurt neither of these should be a problem . In making all yogurt - including yogurt made from raw milk in commercial settings - the milk is heated to 190F for some time to denature albumin proteins and to partially sterilize the milk so that the yogurt cultures will have the upper hand . This means that all yogurt has been pasteurized and the fact that the milk was purchased raw is a red herring . This will make problem # 1 above unlikely . Not heating the milk will leave you with @rumtscho 's answer - you can only guess what you might get by incubating it . As for problem # 2 . Milk proteins begin to coagulate at a Ph of about 4.6 . The target Ph for yogurt is usually 4.5 . When making yogurt , Streptococcus thermophilus brings the milk down to about 5.0 and Lactobacillus Acidophilus takes over and brings it down to 4.5 . Lactobacillus Acidophilus is active well below this Ph. Therefore , if your milk is not already thickened then it is , by definition , not too acidic for the yogurt culture to work . Unfortunately , as the commenter from your first link indicated , heat combined with acid will cause the milk to prematurely denature . If you milk is too sour already then heating it to 190F may cause the protein to precipitate out and you would have paneer ( sort of ) . I looked but was unable to find at what Ph milk proteins will denature at 190F . <URL> <URL> If you can strictly verify the handling of your raw milk to have confidence that it has not been contaminated with harmful bacteria , and if the milk has only slightly soured so that it can be heated without breaking , you should be able to successfully make yogurt out of it knowing that the texture might vary from that of your starter .
Pasta ( by which I infer you mean dried , Italian-style semolina pasta ) is edible raw , right out of the package . It is not , however , palatable . If you soak it in water , it will hydrate and soften over time , but that is not the same as cooking it . True cooking also cooks the proteins and takes away that raw starchy taste . There is no way to achieve that without the application of some heat above about 180 F for at least a few minutes . See also : <URL> Note that in one of the answers to that question , Rumtscho points out that supermarket ramen noodles are precooked ( they are generally par-fried , sometimes par-baked ) and are much more palatable eaten straight from the package , or simply soaked .
White fish are , as a rule , more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish . Add farm-raised to that equation and you have the makings for a very bland meal , which is why you almost always see farm-raised white-fleshed fish served with heavy herb treatments and powerful sauces , or ( in cod 's case ) fry batter . Tilapia and cod are two of the most common farm-raised fish on the market , so I 'm leaning heavily on my suspicion that you 're trying to make sushi out of the farm-raised varieties and not wild game . If it 's white fish you desire for sushi , talk to your fishmonger . Tell him what you 're doing and ask for his recommendation . He 'll direct you toward game fish that that are either very new and very fresh or that of the flash-frozen variety .
As far as I know , raw tuna is not usually salted and/or pre-treated . What may be happening is a case of perceived salinity . For example , there are numerous <URL> that <URL> foods with certain odors can be perceived as much saltier than they actually are . If you have access to that second article ( it is copyrighted and behind a <URL> , so I ca n't post it here ) , it has a great figure on page 3 depicting the perceived sourness , bitterness , sweetness , and saltiness of a number of common foods , including tuna . The aroma of plain tuna alone ranked higher than soy sauce on the saltiness scale , for example . Tuna is relatively high in fat , and <URL> that high fat foods can also increase perceived saltiness . Perhaps you were using a fattier part of the fish ? Finally , <URL> that dehydration increases the saltiness of tuna ( which actually seems somewhat intuitive ) , especially if extra salt is added before cooking . Was your tuna previously frozen ? Freezing -- especially if done improperly and/or if there are multiple freeze/thaw cycles -- can act like dehydration .
Most fats work ( this is why cocoa butter works ) most people recommend Crisco but a small amount of low flavoured oil ( or flavoured for that matter ) is fine . I like ganache so personally extra thick double cream does it for me . Either way it 's easier to add more later than take out ! Start with a little bit .
I 've preserved cut fruit for at least 6 hours before using just lemon juice . Lemon juice inhibits the oxidation of the fruit which prevents browning as well of a loss of crispness . One lemon should be enough juice for a 1.5 quart bowl of cut fruit . Simply squeeze it over the fruit and toss gently to prevent bruising . Since you 'll be working with apples , kiwis , and bananas I think your best bet will be to keep them separate . The lemon juice will benefit both the apples and bananas , but might only be marginally effective if unnecessary for kiwi -- since kiwi brings plenty of its own citric acid to the table . The fruit should be stored in the refrigerator to additionally inhibit oxidation . In my experience covering it with plastic wrap with a few holes poked in it works great . Aluminum foil should be fine as well . I find that the covering is primarily to protect your fruit from picking up other odors from within your fridge , and the holes permit the fruit to " breathe " releasing the buildup of ethylene gas that will occur if it is completely sealed . If lemon juice is undesired you can use other citrus juices including : lime juice , orange juice , and pineapple juice . Obviously they will all bring their own flavors . If this flavoring is altogether undesired , then you should consider getting a commercial product called <URL> . It 's basically a powdered citric-acid , and kosher to boot .
I have only seen it used in dahl dishes , presumably because of it 's claimed digestive properties . Asafoetida is incredibly pungent ; anything more than a pinch seems too much and unpleasant . I think of it as a flavour-enhancer , a natural , Indian MSG rather than a spice in the normal sense . It makes your mouth water quite intensely and seems to stimulate the savory tatse buds ( umami ) . This is lovely when done subtley and kept in the background . Therefore , I suspect you could add small pinches to all kinds of savoury food .
Applesauce has little flavor and almost no nutritional value . It is added to baked goods for the one thing it does have - pectin . Pectin interferes with gluten in a similar manner to fat although by a different mechanism . For this reason applesauce is often used to replace some of the fat in recipes for health-conscious bakers . <URL> . Or if you are <URL> . Other banana bread recipes are very similar to cakes and rely on a huge amount of fat - often creamed with a large amount of sugar . Your options are then to : Replace the applesauce with some other oil substitute . Another puree of high-pectin fruit would work . Switch to a recipe that just uses the fat and enjoy a richer banana bread .
Use common advices : closed jars , in a fresh and dark place ( a bodega is wonderful for keeping the spices ) . Direct sun is one of the worst enemies . And when everything else fails , consume it ... f.ex . this very simple recipe , just rice + veg stock + mushrooms + garlic + persil + saffron <URL>
Not only are " friendly " bacteria being cultured , those bacteria make an acidic environment which is hostile to " bad " bacteria . Myself , I make plain yogurt and mix things into it at the time of eating , but things mixed in from the start essentially become " yogurt-pickled " and should be fine for a reasonable period under refrigeration . A standard part of preparing to culture yogurt is a high-heat treatment ( scalding ) of the milk , both to kill off unwanted bacteria and to cause structural changes in the milk proteins that are beneficial to forming the yogurt curd .
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
I also typically use bottled lemon juice , as my budget does not allow for fresh lemons . <URL> says you should use the bottle within a week , but I 've had success with keeping it much , much longer . That said , this is one item that will not usually work well past its best-by date , I 've found . Maybe in the future , you could freeze it in cubes if you ca n't use it soon enough ?
As eggs are a very versatile ingredient : when substituting , it is important to determine whether the eggs are being used as a leavening agent or binder ( or both ) . In recipes where the egg is used primarily as a leavening agent , I have used a mixture of baking powder ( not soda ) , water , and vegetable oil in a 2:3:3 ratio , though you may want to experiment with the proportions depending upon your recipe . You may also need to vary the amount of other liquid in the recipe . Where the egg is used primarily as a binder , you could use banana , applesauce , or gelatin , depending upon the recipe ( obviously , you 'll probably want to avoid the fruits in a savory recipe ) . I 've used , and been thoroughly disappointed with , the available commercial " egg replacers " and do n't recommend them for any purpose . I 've heard of using flax , but have no personal experience with it . However : as the father of ( and resident chef for ) a young child with egg and milk allergy , it is my experience that successfully substituting for eggs is very difficult . For breads in particular , I do n't even bother with recipes that call for eggs or milk , and favor those that use the basic 3 ( 4 ) : flour , water , yeast ( salt ) .
They just use it for the lecithine . You can buy straight lecithine ( they normally sell soy-based lecithine , but maybe you should check with the producer to make sure it is vegetarian ) and dissolve some in the cream . Do n't bother replacing the fat , truffels have enough from other sources .
The usual materials used in an oven ( no matter if electric or gas ) are almost all food-safe non-melting materials used for cooking vessels . If you can use it on a stove top , it should be OK for the oven too ( unless it has a handle from a different material ) . Metal . Oven pans are made from non-reactive metals ( like stainless steel ) or reactive metals with a protective layer ( e.g. seasoned cast iron ) . Do n't use metal vessels which have non-metal parts , like wooden or plastic handles ( except for oven-rated handles , like the phenolic handles on Le Creuset enameled cast iron , which are rated for up to 200 ° C ) . Else , all metallic pans and pots meant for stove top are good for the oven . Also , pay attention to temperature : PTFE ( non-stick ) coated vessels should n't be heated above 250 ° C. Ceramics . If glazed , you should make sure that the glaze does not suffer under high temperature or does not leach dangerous chemicals into the food under high temperatures . There are many glazed ceramic pans meant for the oven , such as lasagna pans , quiche pans , tagines , gyveches , etc , and you can be sure that these are oven-safe . You can also use table porcelain for some limited scenarios , e.g. poaching an egg in an individual serving of soup , but do n't risk your finest porcelain , and do n't do it if the plates are decorated with adhesive designs . If unglazed , you should make sure it is intended for the oven , some types of earthenware may be damaged by the heat . The ones meant for the oven ( like römertopf ) should be fine . Glass . If it is borosilicate glass ( sometimes called Jena glass ) , you can use it in the oven . Do n't subject it to temperature shocks , use room-temperature glass pans ( do n't layer a lasagna the day before in a glass vessel and then bake it straight from the fridge ) , and do n't put them in too hot an oven ( up to 200 ° C should be OK ) . You ca n't determine if it is borosilicate glass or soda lime glass from its looks , so here you have to be sure that the manufacturer markets the vessel as oven safe . Silicone . Food-grade silicone is great for baking and practically indestructible ( unless you cut it ) . If the manufacturer gave a temperature range , go by it , I 'm not sure it will hold up at above 250 ° C , but it is no problem in the normal cake and pastry baking range . Plastics . Some plastics may be able to withstand heat , but you ca n't usually recognize that from their looks , and you do n't know if there may be other problems ( such as melamine , which releases toxic chemicals when heated ) . In theory , I would trust a big manufacturer who markets a plastic pan explicitly as oven-safe , but in practice , I have n't seen such pans . So do n't use plastic vessels in an oven . Wood . Do n't use wood in an oven . It should n't be able to catch fire at normal oven temperatures , so it is not a hazard , but the heat will damage your vessel . While it will still be usable ( especially if you take care to wet it beforehand ) , it will lose its smooth surface , and it will probably warp . Glued wood can also split along the glue lines . If you have a cheap bowl you do n't mind damaging , you can use it in the oven , but I do n't see why , when other materials are much better suited .
It really does depend on the recipe . Egg yolks have some protein but a lot of fat which adds flavor and makes baked goods more tender and moist . Whites are just protein which adds structure and has a drying effect . If the particular recipe is depending on the eggs for the binding power of their protein you may not get enough by substituting just yolks . Remember that the volume of the yolks is less than whole eggs so you may see better success substituting two whole eggs with three yolks . Some cakes will handle the reduced protein . White and yellow cakes will be ok . Pound cakes will also be fine and in fact some recipes call for only yolks . Expect your cake to be a little denser , softer , and tastier . Any kind of sponge or angel food cake wo n't work because they rely wholly on the protein from the whites . Soft , rich breads will also benefit from the added fat . The breads will derive their structure from the gluten in their flour . Cinnamon rolls and rich doughnuts come to mind . A local doughnut shop is famous for the yellow color which comes from using fresh yolks . <URL> Yolks can be used in many recipes that call for whole eggs . Look for recipes that will benefit from all the added fat . Anything custard-like , where the eggs are mixed with milk , will work very well - even better than with whole eggs in fact . Examples are custard , flan , puddings , french toast , etc. . Given the season you might consider a custard-based ice cream .

Can I use garlic leaf for cooking ?
When we have had garlic in our garden I have used the garlic leaves . They do have a garlicky flavor but are milder than garlic cloves . I tend to use them more as I would chives or garlic chives as in addition to having the milder flavor than the cloves they make for a quite nice presentation . Regarding drying them , I have never tried it . Off the top of my head I ca n't think of any reason not to dry them for later use but there may be issues that I just do n't know about .
Simply put : No . Step 3 on <URL> : Just be sure that the temperature remains at about 130 to 150 degrees Thinking of beer fermenting , specific temperature ranges are required because that 's what keeps the yeast happy . Not sure about the function in this case , but it follows that it 's probably temperature-sensitive as well . A food dehydrator would probably be a better bet than the oven .
@tcb , I have successfully used sona masoori rice for dosa batter . try this method : Preheat oven to 200 degree F . Then turn off the oven . Then put your batter-pot in the oven on a tray.Check after 5-6 hours . If temp are really low outside , and you think it is still not fermenting , again turn on oven for a couple of minutes and turn off . Batter should be ready in 9-10 hours .
Absolutely , go ahead and use it . I always ignore the " white and light green parts " instruction anyway , and use the leek up until the point where it feels dried out instead of firm and fleshy -- well into the dark green parts -- and it 's always delicious , even when cooked for significantly less than several hours .
If your caramel rolls are the kind with a sticky , gooey mass in the bottom of the pan that is flipped upside down out of the pan , then I would say that the rolls wo n't really get good and caramely in a stoneware pan . You 'd be better off baking one pan of rolls at a time in the metal pan . While one pan is rising and baking , just chill the other part of the dough ... either plain in a bowl , or prepared into a log that only needs to be cut . If the caramel rolls are more like a cinnamon bun , then the stoneware dishes should do fine in a pinch . This is assuming they are glazed stoneware and not terra cotta . Cooking time will increase a bit as the stoneware will take longer to heat up ( it will also retain the heat longer when removed from the oven ) . You could always just go out and buy some foil pans . I do that when I make rolls ( caramel , cinnamon , and sticky ) for the local fire company 's carnival . They go through 17 = 20 dozen rolls each year . I know baking rolls can be a lot of work , so what I have found to be very helpful , is to make the dough the night before baking . Cover with cling film , and let it have a slow rise in the fridge all night . ( you will get improved flavor too . ) The next day , divide the cold dough up and prepare as usual . They will take a little longer for the rise in the pan after shaping , but it sure is a lot easier on you .
Vinegar would n't be harmful . The resulting reaction would create a ferrous salt which would be easily washed away . However , it was probably the vinegar and other acids in your food that cause the rust in the first place . Steel items stored in a acidic environment rust faster than those in plain water . Washing and storing dry is the best way to prevent rust .
Yes . The important fat is the one the starch first goes into . The higher temperature reached by fats ( as compared to water or milk ) helps cook the flour , creating flavors . The liquid added later dilutes the mixture into a sauce . The liquid 's fats are not as crucial for the sauce 's thickness as the liquid 's proteins . I think of the cooked butter-flour mixture as a thickner that can be added to milk , broths , and even a saucy dish . The roux thickens way better than just a slurry of flour and a cold liquid . Jack Lang has written <URL> and the science is summarized in chapter 4 of <URL>
The main difference between a food processor and a blender is its shape and how the food is mixed while it is being " cut up " . In a blender , it relies on the funneling action of liquid to mix the food around . Otherwise only the bottom gets blended while the top stays solid . Food processors usually have a flat bottom and have a mechanism to turn the food as it cuts it up . This results in evenly chopped food . If you want the gazpacho to end up completely smooth , then the blender will definitely work in this application as it will be liquid enough to get the funnel action going to mix the food around . Keep it mind it would be a good idea to start blending the vegetables with high water content such as tomato and onion first to create a liquid " base " for the other vegetables . IF you want coarse chunks for the vegetables , it is slightly trickier but still possible to use a blender . You need to work in smaller " batches " and use the pulse functionality instead of just blending . If the batch is too big , you end up with overblended mush on the bottom and unblended chunks on top .
People choose to eat vegetarian diets for a number of reasons . Not only might the flavor offend your guest , but it may cause them to be physically ill . You can substitute vegetable stock or broth for the meat products you are accustomed to using . Mushrooms lend a meaty flavor to dishes they are used in and could potentially be used to replace your meat . I would suggest cooking them separately first to draw out the moisture , then adding them to the beans near the end of the cooking process so they soak up some of the flavors and have a chance to marry . Remember mushrooms are little culinary sponges . They will take flavors and run with them , adding their own earthy notes in the process . Search for vegetarian rice and beans dishes to get an idea of the possibilities here . From an etiquette standpoint , you may want to avoid the temptation to apologize to your other guests for having to make a veggie substitution as that would be a quick ticket towards alienating your vegetarian pal . I only mention that because some people do n't think about things like that and I have a few friends who are on restrictive diets . They are sometimes embarrassed when people go out of their way to make menu changes for them . Another alternative altogether is to find a way to prepare two versions of the dish . Meaning , you could use meat as you are accustomed to but leave a portion of the food vegetarian . When it 's practical I like this option a lot . It just comes with the downside of increased cleanup and stovetop logistics issues .
I make garlic paste quite often , using this technique I saw on Bobby Flay . Put the whole clove on the board . Lay knife flat , and smack it with your hand . Remove paper and root . Dice finely . Sprinkle with the quantity of salt your recipe calls for . With the knife relatively flat , grind the garlic into the salt with the knife . Typically , I 'll make a pass in one direction with the edge on the board , leading with the spine , and then come back with the spine on the board , leading with the edge . You need a wide knife ( at least a french chef 's knife , cleaver or santuko ) in order to keep your fingers out of danger . I apply the downward pressure with the top of my palm , with my fingers curled back . Check this for a similar technique - <URL> ( The mincing starts around 2:40 After 5 or 6 passes , you should have a nice fine paste .
Yes , you can temper the callets . Couverture is couverture , and the only thing that 's really different about the callets is their shape - they 're specifically intended to be melted easily , unlike the bars which they ( sort of ) expect people to eat directly . The bars are less likely to melt during shipping which is why they also sell them in that form .
Not long at all . Usually 1 minute is enough . If it starts to turn brown , it 's been in there too long .
You 'll be fine doing a straight substitution . Well , maybe I should n't be so definitive since these are powders we 're talking about and it 's not quite the same thing , but I 've substituted buttermilk for whole milk in bread recipes plenty of times . The only thing that changed for me was the rising time . When I use buttermilk in my sandwich bread , it needs an extra 20 minutes or so on the first rise compared to the whole milk version .
Typically garlic is used . If you prefer onions and garlic , go ahead but it 's typically cucumber , yogurt , dill , garlic , lemon juice or vinegar , olive oil , salt , pepper , and sometimes sour cream .
No , you ca n't . You should always assume glass is not safe to use on the stovetop . Essentially none of it is , and while there are a very few exceptions , they 'll say so explicitly . ( For example <URL> says stovetop-safe in the description . ) That bowl is nothing special , definitely not stovetop-safe - it 'd shatter under the thermal stress . If you look carefully on the packaging , you might even find a warning that 's not for use on the stovetop .
The flavor is described as being very mild and unless the recipe calls for a ton of the stuff it is probably being used mostly for color . The color it gives is a yellow-orange . Substitutions used are turmeric , paprika , or a mixture of the two . It was often used itself as a substitution for saffron but of course saffron would be too expensive to make the substitution back . If your recipe does use a lot of annatto ( or you are serving it to people who claim to be able to detect the difference ) then your best bet would probably be to just buy it online . It is a seed so it is n't fragile and ships well . <URL>
I 've never heard of anyone trying this . I think its very unlikely though . Those gas deflectors are actually specially designed to pull in the appropriate amount of atmospheric air for a proper flame . This is why the flame you see is so blue and has very little orange . I 'd look into seeing if there is some way to get a replacement deflector that is better suited for wok cooking . You could also do what Alton Brown does and use the bottom half of a turkey deep fryer , outside preferably , and not over any pipes or electrical wiring or gravel .

Personally , I just throw them into stir fries or fried rice ( add them near the end of the cooking time ) . I 've also had them slightly stir fried with pea shoots in sesame oil . Simple but delicious . Tofu666 , an amazing vegan blogger , fries them often . Here 's a sample : <URL> This page has instructions for pickling them : <URL>
Follow these steps and watch very carefully ... Set your oven on Broil ( high ) and put your rack on the top shelf . Let the oven get nice and hot ( 3-7 minutes ) . Fill an oven safe dish with crushed ice and water and place your dishes into the ice/water bath . The cold bath should keep the custard from cooking , but the sugar on top will heat till it caramelizes . It 'll only take 3-4mins .

What are the differences between baking in bulk and baking in smaller amounts ?
Yes , recipes need to be changed as well . The most important [ IMHO ] difference is leavening ( yeast/baking powder/soda etc. ) The next issue is ratios , once you get beyond ' doubling ' a home recipe your ratios will get out of sync . When you multiply dry ingredients ( other than yeast ) do so By Weight rather than dry measure . ( note for sugars in a yeast leavened recipe : sugar is often ' treated as ' a ' wet ingredient ' , still multiply by weight , this will provide the correct amount of food for the yeast ) Rule of thumb for yeast baking is to multiply everything but DO NOT multiply the yeast for doing 2X or 4X . When you are increasing the recipe by 8X you double the original amount of yeast . Your rising time may increase but that also happens with temperature variations . Rule of thumb for chemical leavening is to multiply carefully ALL ingredients . If using baking soda and acid , sift the baking soda with flour and mix the acid ( vinegar , lemon juice , sour milk ) with other liquid ingredients . That way you do n't lose rising power when mixing more dough . But for chemical leavening , you have to bake the mix without it sitting around . So you might weigh and set up 4X , 4X , 4X if you need 12X yield . [ from <URL> Home sized recipes can usually only be doubled safely . Beyond that , due to rounding , the ratios within the recipe will get out of sync . We have a number of pro resources here , take a look : <URL> ( <URL> ) These are , obviously , only ' general guidelines , your mileage may vary with any given recipe .
Peanut and canola are vegetable oils . Vegetable oil is a catch-all term , it 's not asking for a product labelled " vegetable oil " although you can buy it in the store . Oils labelled vegetable oil are blends and can be any proportion of things like canola ( rapeseed ) , peanut , corn , sunflower , etc. . Just do n't use Olive oil , it is a vegetable oil but it wo n't be good for cakes ! Different vegetable oils will give different properties although most will give you about the same result . Canola is flavorless and relatively light while peanut is a bit richer and , well , peanut-y . The differences in your cake will be subtle , however .
We have a convection oven and almost always use it . I ca n't remember the last time we did n't use convection . Our model automatically decreases the temperature , so if you set it for 300 , then it will heat to 275 . Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number , but it seems to work . Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven . Our also has a single and multi-rack mode , and it circulates the air differently in that case . We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative . I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven , but in our case , we always use it ( except for broiling of course ) .
The generic term for sugar-water pastes used to decorate food is <URL> . Rollfondant sounds like ready-to-roll icing , but it could be <URL> , which contains egg white . Modellierfondant sounds like modelling paste . There are various recipes which use different additives to the core ingredients of sugar and water in order to obtain a suitable consistency and to dry without cracking .
There are three ( to the best of my knowledge ) main factors at work here : <URL> . This is a gelling agent , a bit like gelatin . Fruits such as apples and plums are very high in pectin ; citrus fruits are not that high in pectin but citrus peels are incredibly high , so if you 're using any of the peel , you 're getting tons of great pectin . Obviously , the more pectin , the faster and firmer it 's going to gel . If the fruit does n't contain much pectin then you 're going to have to cook it down a lot or just add actual pectin ( you can buy it in stores ) . Acidity , as you suspect , makes a big difference . It 's not just acidity , it 's the relationship of acidity to pectin as above . For more details read <URL> . Basically , pectin gels best at a pH of 2.5 ( almost exactly the pH of lemon juice ) to 4.5 ( about the pH of sweet grapes ) . It 's best to hit the sweet spot in the middle rather than the extreme ends , so you wo n't generally be using pure lemon juice , you 'll be adding some sugar and other ingredients . Which leads me to the final factor : Sugar . As described in <URL> , sugar precipitates the pectin , basically making the pectin molecules less soluble which mimics the effect of a higher concentration . Therefore , more sugar makes the jelly set faster . So : Pectin-rich fruits + high acidity + high sugar content = fast setting . There are actually various other factors that affect the pectin ( which is pretty much the only gelling agent at work when working with natural fruit jellies ) like salts and even alcohol , but in the vast majority of recipes , it 's acidity and sugar that are your primary concerns as well as the actual pectin content of the fruit itself .
You want to use baking soda . Baking powder is used as a leavening agent and does this by combining an acid and a base , so it would not make your chicken more alkaline . Baking soda , on the other hand is just sodium bicarbonate and will make your chicken more alkaline . However , baking soda , especially if used in excessive amounts , will give your chicken a bad taste . Baking soda tastes bitter , and cooking it for too long at high heat exacerbates that . From reading online , it seems that adding baking soda will indeed make your chicken look much browner ( the same way that pretzels are dipped in lye to produce their brown colour ) , but it would affect the texture/taste of your chicken . If you want to add more flavour , I would think that properly browning the chicken ( using high heat , having patience ) would be more effective than adding baking soda , which might give the appearance , but not the taste .
Consider what the " no cheating " version of the ingredient is , and get the closest thing to that , that 's convenient enough for you . For things like garlic , ginger , etc. , the " no-cheating " version is to get the fresh ingredients and crush/grate them - what you end up with is a paste . The paste you can buy in jars is this stuff , with preservatives added to make them last . Some flavour will be lost . To make powder , the paste is dried , and more flavour is lost . But the powder will keep for a long time in the cupboard . Note that some spices take on different , desirable flavours when processed . Paprika powder has its own properties when compared to fresh paprika peppers . You 'd use fresh ginger in many curries , powdered ginger in many cakes , candied ginger in some other sweet dishes . Recipes will specify what to use . For things like black pepper , cumin , turmeric , coriander seeds , the " no-cheating " version is to get whole seeds , roast them and grind them in a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar . So buying the ready-ground version is only one step away from the ideal . Try grinding your own at least once . The extra depth and complexity of flavour is striking . But for convenience , ready-ground spices are fine . " Roasting " , for small quantities of whole dry spice , involves briefly heating them on a hot dry pan . It brings out spice flavours you do n't get from just frying or boiling the spice . Of course , it 's optional . Ground spices have a shorter shelf life than whole dry spices . If you open a jar of powdered spice and it does n't have a strong aroma , throw it away -- you might as well use dust . Whole spices have the aroma " locked away " , to be released when you grind . To make a paste , these are sometimes mixed with wet ingredients ( like garlic and ginger ) , water and oil . That 's the basis of the jars of " spice mix " you can buy in supermarkets . It 's also the first step in many curry recipes -- grind your spices , mix with oil to make a paste , and gently fry before adding the onions .
When I made scones for the first time , I also found the taste a bit unusual . The recipe I used specified a total of 11 g baking powder and baking soda per 250 g flour , and also 5 g salt . I used less salt , but the taste is definitely unusal for people accustomed to continental Kleingebäck . I can see two reasons for this . First , the dough for scones is quite unusual , something between cookie and pastry . It is a lot tougher than the usual soda-leavened dough . So I guess that it needs additional leavening power in order to create a light texture , unlike the semiliquid batters which raise without a problem . Plus , it gets no help from egg whites the way some cakes do ( in fact , my recipe specified egg yolks only ) . The second point is one you already mentioned in the question . It seems that the English tradition is to eat scones with cream and jam . I tried it with my own scones , and the combination was quite good . I do n't eat much jam , as it is too sweet for my taste , but the pairing with the bland scones was really nice . A sweeter or richer vehicle would have made the whole thing overwhelming .
Your clarification means a lot -- " baked " potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own , where the insides become fluffy and creamy , and is done with larger starchy white potatoes , or sweet potatoes work well , too . Roasted potatoes , on the other hand , tends to be ( in the U.S. ) be smaller " new " potatoes , waxy potatoes , or even larger starchy potatoes cut up ( eg , ' oven fries ' ) . The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it 's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you 're going to be cooking them with the roast as there 's going to be moisture in there , I 'd go for a waxy potato ( eg , Red Bliss ) . As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil , and if they 're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast , as you 're going to have to rest it anyway , drain the meat juices , crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F ( 230C ) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes . ps . yes , I know a sweet potato is n't a potato . And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything , as it makes great baked potatoes , and roasted potatoes ( although , not sure how well with a roast at the same time ) and they 're good in pot roast and stews if you do n't add them too early .
Short answer : no , you can not without radically changing the recipe until it is something completely different . See my answer here for more information : <URL>
Traditionally <URL> used radiant heat to cook meat . This would have taken place over an open flame , typically on a rotating <URL> . In modern times this method is now called <URL> . Modern roasting refers to dry heat cooking that takes place in an oven , the food is cooked by <URL> . Until the late 19th century this method was referred to as baking . <URL> is essentially the same as roasting in modern times . Baking most often refers specifically to the cooking of " baked goods " ( breads , pastries , etc. ) . However , the terms baking and roasting are often used interchangeably ( baked chicken , roast chicken ) . There does n't seem to be a hard and fast rule here as to which term is used . For example , you roast asparagus , turkey , chicken , but bake lasagna , casseroles , and also chicken . <URL> uses a combination of moist and dry heat to cook the food . This is what occurs in a crock pot , or in dutch oven/stock pot in the oven . Your meat will be cooked in an ample amount of seasoned liquid such as wine and/or stock . <URL> I had never heard of before . According to Wikipedia it 's a trademarked method of pressurized deep frying . I doubt this is what you were referring to .
Per <URL> : [ T ] here are really two distinct cuts from the diaphragm of the steer . The outside skirt steak is from the plate section , below the rib and between the brisket and flank , and usually comes with the membrane still attached , which needs to be trimmed before cooking . Inside skirt comes from the flank -- it 's narrower and thinner than the outside skirt , and comes with the membrane removed . According to the <URL> , outside skirt stake is extremely rare in the US , as much of it gets exported to Japan due to a quick in the tariffs . The outside cut is tougher , but extremely flavorful . Both are used in similar applications , if you can get them . Given that any skirt you buy is probably inside skirt , the difference is likely to be moot . In making fajitas , Kenji Alt recommends grilling it over extremely high heat , to get browning flavors on the outside , and not overcook the center . He recommends not cooking it over medium rare . A couple of pictures :
It depends greatly on how hungry I am . :-) 350F for about an 60-90 minutes , depending on how many are in there . 425F for about 40-60 if I 'm hungry and impatient . Microwave on high for a few minutes ( few holes poked in it with a fork ) if I 'm really hungry and really impatient . They 're done when a fork goes in easily .
If your question is if we can , the answer is yes . Rapadura = brown sugar tablet . The brown sugar is very similar to panela and jaggery . The difference is the source of raw material , and the origin of the country where it is processed obtain the sugar . Jaggery is in Asia , brown sugar and panela or rapadura in many Latin American countries .
Good question @mfg . I hope I can help a little bit . The basics behind the egg wash are to provide for a couple different thing . These being shine , crispness , and color . Shine The shine is primarily provided by the egg yolk . The higher concentration of yolk the more shine . Crispness This come from the egg whites . The whites make things a little crispy and sometimes can crackle a little bit ( mainly when usually by themselves ) . Color This comes from the fat and protein . Leaving the yoke in along with the shine will add color . You can add water to lighten the color a bit . I find that using the white also dilutes the color a bit but not as much ( but the white also makes it crisp ) . Add cream or milk to get it a little bit darker . Salt I often find people adding salt to an egg wash . I does provide some flavor to the crust , but I have noticed that for some reason ( when using a whole egg ) it does allow it to get a little darker than it would normally . Sugar Like salt it adds flavor ( sweetness ) to the crust . And it will also add some color . Especially if baking at a higher temp and using a raw or brown type sugar . Alcohol I have seen the use of alcohol quite a number of times . From the results I have seen it behaves like water . Although not the the same degree . My guess is that it has to do with how fast the alcohol evaporates . As far as flavor , I ca n't say that it added much at the levels used . I did once definitely get a hint of a bourbon being used in the wash on a pretty plain white loaf . But they did mix in quite a good amount of bourbon to just an egg yolk . That is all I have really used myself or seen . I am sure that you can use other liquids although I do n't know what vinegar would do . Just keep in mind if they are high in fat , protein , or sugar they will add color . Otherwise they will lighten the color . I have also seen melted butter just used as a wash . It adds a nice color and buttery flavor . I have n't seen it added to egg wash but I would assume you could add to egg yolk to get a shine and probably darker color than cream/milk . Another important thing to remember is to beat your wash well when using for a bread coating . Unlike if your just using the was was to seal say a ravioli . If your egg was is spotty not one nice fully incorporated mixture your crust can also be spotty .
I have been told that cedar , white and yellow pine , and many other variaties are safe in normal quantities and have high vitamin content . Some have supposed medicinal effect for headaches , such as cedar . My advice is to look up " tea " or " infusion " with each type of needle you want to try so you can avoid a poisonous concoction . As for white pine , I have made delicious tea for breakfast and for the canteen with it while camping and have survived so far . It goes quite well with wild mint .
The kind of oil you use in baking is mostly a matter of personal preference . Any neutral oil ( no strong flavor ) will do . I suggest you use an oil that you keep around for another purpose , which is not too expensive . Some good candidates include : Canola oil Peanut oil ( refined , except for those with peanut allergies ) Generic " vegetable " oil Grapeseed oil is also excellent but tends to expensive . Oils you would want to avoid due to the fact that they bring more flavor which may not be what you want in baked goods include : Olive oil Sesame oil Unrefined oils of all sorts
I think Doug and yossarian both touched on the main points , but to summarize , there are four reasons why you might not want to use a meat thermometer for candy : Range A meat thermometer might go from 140 F to 220 F or something like that , which is plenty for meat . Candy often requires a range from about 75 degrees ( chocolate ) up to 400 + degrees ( hard candy ) . The range on most thermometers is simply not sufficient for most candies . Accuracy When you temper chocolate , 88 F degrees is an ideal working temperature ( for dark chocolate ) . Some people would consider 91 so high you might want to think about starting over . When you make caramels , the difference between 235 F and 240 F can be the difference between wonderfully chewy caramels and a sugar-flavored rock . If you ca n't read one degree increments at a glance , you need a real candy thermometer . Speed Meat thermometers often take 30 seconds to a minute to get an accurate result . When you are making candies , you have to be able to tell what the temperature is right now . Contamination I do n't want the thermometer that goes in semi-raw meat anywhere near my chocolate .
I 'd say yes , honey is a bit healthier than sugar , but this really depends on the type of sugar or honey . Raw honey is better than pasteurized honey . Highly refined sugar is less healthy than some less refined sugar . Assuming you are talking about table sugar and raw honey , in general : Sugar is sucrose . You need some enzymes to split it into fructose and glucose , your body has to make these enzymes and can digest those mono-sacharides . When you eat honey , there is no need for such body-made enzymes , because the fructose and glucose are n't combined , but they appear there as mono-sacharides . So honey is less demanding for your body . Honey is better for your blood-glucose level ( this level raises more if you eat sugar than if you eat the same amount of honey ) . Honey contains some vitamins and minerals , which sugar lacks . As a consequence of all these points : If you use sugar , you have a higher risk of high cholesterol and obesity than if you use honey . I did n't mention anything about the taste , since that is not health-related . Source and more info : <URL>
When I add a bit of baking powder to the flour breading I use for eggplant , the fried result is a little puffier than without . Frying forces water out of the eggplant into the breading . That along w heat sets off the production of CO2 . The same should happen with your chicken breading .

What does a healthy cast iron skillet look like ?
Ideally it should be matte to just-slightly-shiny black and very smooth . <URL> has some terrific information on the ideal oil to use ( flaxseed ) and method for seasoning , with actual scientific grounding .
The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on . Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat . Give cast iron ample preheating time , and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan . That equals crispy . Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron . You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan . That alone probably would n't make much of a difference , but considering that you 're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes , the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan . That is not a friend of crispiness . You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature . I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan . Teflon , on the other hand , should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time . Some people go so far as to say that you should n't preheat it all . So if your beginning temperatures were about the same in the pans , they should n't have been . After you put in the potatoes , forget about it . You 'll never get the same kind of crispy sear with a teflon pan as you will with cast iron , even if you do n't know how to best exploit the advantages of cast iron .
I suggest getting a quality stainless clad saute pan or saucier . For years I made risotto in the <URL> shown here : Unless you 're serving huge portions this is plenty of room for 6 servings of risotto . There are larger options available though , including a mammoth 14 " 6 quart one . This pan easily does 90 % of the work in my kitchen , so at any price it carries its weight in the kitchen . That said , this past Christmas I got the <URL> shown here : It 's a very close matchup , but this pan is perfect for making risotto . The higher sides are a definite benefit , but you do n't sacrifice much in flat surface area . The copper core is amazingly responsive , noticeably more so than aluminum . It 's obviously rather expensive , so if you 're uncomfortable spending that much on a pan I 'd suggest getting one of their regular 3 qt sauciers -- you 'll spend at least half as much . If I only had one pan in my kitchen though , I think I 'd still go back to the saute pan above . Its versatility is just unmatched . Regarding your concerns that a wider pan wo n't heat as evenly , this is generally true for a cheaper pan . However , All-Clad pans use magic to bond a layer of aluminum ( or copper ) between a layer of magnetic stainless ( exterior ) and 18/10 stainless ( interior ) . The end result is a very even heat which you can actually confirm with an infrared thermometer .
Corn masa is what you need for this . The process of nixtamalization makes the corn more easily ground and therefore the texture of doughs made with it will not be " gritty " in the way that a dough made with corn meal or corn flour will be . Also , corn masa ( or masa harina ) is more nutritious than standard corn products due to the chemical changes that result from the nixtamalization process .
It is not inherently unsafe , but it may not be something you want to do for other reasons . The main reasons not to store food in cast iron are : Foods , especially acidic foods , may continue to react with the iron , developing off flavors Moisture encourages cast iron to rust It is not good for maintenance of your pans seasoning , which is part of what makes cast iron pans so desirable for cooking Many cast iron skillets do n't have a lid , which may be desirable to protect the food from drying out , getting odors and off flavors from other items in the refrigerator , or contributing odors to the other items in the refrigerator . This one , of course , applies to any pan . Note : we have had extensive discussions elsewhere ( see for example , <URL> , and the many links within ) . Putting the food hot into your refrigerator may not be the best practice ( it is more ideal to cool it quickly , in a shallow dish in an ice water bath ) , but putting it into the refrigerator still somewhat hot is certainly better than simply leaving it out on the counter until it is cooler then putting it into the refrigerator . Per the <URL> ( thanks to <URL> for the link to the source material ) : Hot food can be placed directly in the refrigerator or it can be rapidly chilled in an ice or cold water bath before refrigerating . Cover foods to retain moisture and prevent them from picking up odors from other foods . A large pot of food like soup or stew should be divided into small portions and put in shallow containers before being refrigerated . A large cut of meat or whole poultry should be divided into smaller pieces or placed in shallow containers before refrigerating .
AFAIK you need to heat the pan to let the oil oxidize and polymerize ¹ so that it will form a chemically protective and non-sticking coating . If you wash your cookware with soap you will have to do it every time . For that reason some people do n't wash cast iron at all and wipe it with a clean cloth or paper towel after using . ( Burned oil is apparently not very tasty to bacteria and fungi so your pan stays relatively clean and bug-free . ) From my personal experience , meat sticks to untreated cast iron like glue , but on a well-maintained thick iron pan it glides like on Teflon . __ ¹ I do n't know if it makes any chemical sense because all references to polymerized fats I could google up were in relation to reoiling ( seasoning ) .
Scrub the heck out of it with Kosher salt and the tiniest amount of water , then start all over again seasoning it . A fair amount of work , but well worth it to save a good skillet .
Hello <URL> , it is perfectly safe to use stainless steel wool on a Vitreous enamel . I presume that the cast iron skillet has a Vitreous enamel finish . The reason is simple : Vitreous enamel is essentially a type of ceramic and has a hardness of around 5-6 on the <URL> . Steel has around 4-5 on the same scale . This means that generally , you can not damage it with the steel wool . Also no not confuse the " grit " of the steel wool with its hardness :P The only thing that will happen is that the enamel will get very small scratches and that things will stick a bit better in them . You can get rid of most of them with a good polishing compound if they disturb you to much . Personally I would advise you " not to need " to clean it with steel wool in the first place , but is something burned up badly and you do not have heavy cleaning agents nearby steel wool is an acceptable solution . If it is just for cleaning leftovers , usually soaking in soap water and a hard plastic brush does a very good job as well . Remember that even thou Vitreous enamel is very hard and durable it may be damaged by overheating or crack if dropped .
You can make your own crème fraîche . Just inoculate heavy cream with buttermilk . From <URL> : Ingredients 1 to 2 tablespoons cultured buttermilk 2 cups heavy cream ( pasteurized , not ultra pasteurized or sterilized , and with no additives ) Instructions Combine the buttermilk and cream in a saucepan and heat only to tepid ( not more than 85F degrees on an instant reading thermometer ) . Pour into a clean glass jar . Partially cover and let stand at room temperature ( between 65F and 75F degrees ) for 8 to 24 hours , or until thickened . Stir and refrigerate at least 24 hours before using . The cream will keep about 2 weeks in the refrigerator . The results from doing that are so close to " real " crème fraîche that I ca n't tell the difference unless I 'm tasting them side by side . If you want absolute authenticity , you can order the <URL> , follow their instructions , then use that crème fraîche to culture many further batches of real Crème fraîche . EDIT : HA ! :) Here 's Kenji 's $ .02 on the subject : <URL>
" Shocking " the food stops the cooking process , preventing the food from losing its color and texture .
Essentially , it 's like a giant chicken with a " deeper " and more distinctive flavor . The main reason I like them ( other than the flavor ) is the sheer quantity of meat you can get from one roasting session . One could roast multiple chickens for a similar effect , but with a turkey you only have one skeleton to pick meat off of , so it goes faster . Leftovers can be frozen and/or reused in all sorts of ways ( sandwiches , soups , casseroles , etc. ) . taste The breast meat of turkey is a little different from chicken , but they have a similar texture and both tend to be rather mild in flavor compared to game birds . If you had access to a wild turkey , the meat will be gamier . The dark meat of the turkey ( particularly legs and wings ) is generally much more flavorful than chicken , with a " deeper " flavor that some people love and others dislike . ( This may be the reason for the increasing popularity of whole turkey breasts sold by themselves in the U.S. , which can be roasted like a whole bird , but do n't have the " other parts " that are seen as less desirable by many . The vast majority of people I know tend mostly to eat turkey breast meat , usually served with gravy and stuffing . ) I 've seen turkey wings and legs sometimes offered at Southern U.S. BBQ joints ; when slow-cooked , they are a bit of a " Southern delicacy . " On most farm-raised turkeys I 've had recently , the thigh meat does n't have as much of that " rich turkey " flavor that I seem to recall in the past , but it has a more distinctive flavor than the breast meat . Internal organs ( " giblets " ) also tend to have a stronger flavor than chickens , if you 're into eating livers , gizzards , hearts , etc. . There 's often more fat in various parts of the bird than in typical U.S. chickens , which adds to a richer flavor . However , there 's usually not as much fat as found in other common U.S. poultry ( particularly duck and goose ) . appearance When prepared and ready to buy at a butcher , turkeys essentially look the same as any large poultry . They are often much larger than chickens , easily going to 20 lbs . ( 10 kg ) and more . There are some differences in proportions and details that you 'll see when cutting up or eating . In particular , the legs and wings have a bit more connective tissue and bony/cartilage bits than a chicken , since it 's a larger bird and needs more support . This also tends to make the leg and wing meat a bit " stringy , " which may be the reason for the slow-cooked versions I mentioned above , allowing time for the meat to break down more than when just roasting the whole bird . The meat is also a bit darker in color than chickens , particularly noticeable in the " dark meat " sections . cooking If buying a whole bird , most people in the U.S. essentially prepare it as they would make a large chicken , which usually means roasting in the oven . They are usually cooked at somewhat lower temperatures than chicken , to give time for the whole turkey to cook without drying out the exterior . Given the long roasting time for such a large bird , there 's been a bit of a trend recently to cut up the turkey so it lies flat ( " butterfly " or " spatchcock " ) , which allows it to cook faster and potentially more evenly . Other than that , one can often buy individual turkey parts and use them in similar ways to chicken parts , keeping in mind the longer cooking time required . They can also be used ( as with other poultry ) for soup meat , etc. .
A vegan is not going to eat your pan , just the food that was made on it . As no animals were harmed in the making of your pan ( well , probably but how would you know ) the pan itself would n't be an issue . Of course if a tiny bit of pan seasoning could go into the food , however anything else used in the preparation of the meal like cutting boards could cause a small amount of meat product to go into the food as well . Your kitchen is not vegan , and if a vegan has a problem with that they should not come over for a meal . I 'd be extremely surprised if the subject of your pots and pans came up to be honest , vegans I know appreciate people going to the effort of making a vegan meal for them .
This coating is not the same thing as a seasoning . Iron rusts when exposed to air . For cooking purposes , you season it , and it prevents rusting . Some manufacturers sell their iron cookware pre-seasoned , but others use other types of coating to prevent rust . This other coating can consist of wax or petroleum products such as parafin . Its only purpose is to seal the pan air-tight for the time it spends in warehouses and stores . It would melt during cooking and mix with your food . Therefore , you ca n't use it instead of seasoning . But you ca n't season a pan " on top " of the wax coating . The real seasoning would stick to the wax , and when the wax melts , the seasoning will come off . Therefore , you have to remove the wax coating before making a normal seasoning from polymerized oil . If you bought a pan which was seasoned instead of wax-coated , you can start using it without any removing and re-seasoning .
I believe that the " clichéd image " you refer to is popular ( and cliché ) because of chili con carne 's long history of being cooked outdoors in big cauldrons or at least over an open flame . As any camper will tell you , iron is the traditional material of choice when cooking with fire . As for what actually happens - cast iron is a porous material , unlike stainless steel or aluminum . The seasoning in cast iron is essentially a layer of baked-in grease that fills those pores and over time absorbs the flavor of everything you cook in it . It absolutely does impart a characteristic flavour , but what that flavour is depends to no small degree on what 's been cooked in it before . If you do n't care properly for your cast iron , that flavour might very well be rancid fat . So whether or not the flavour you get with your chili makes it better , worse , or just different is largely a matter of personal taste and habits . As for the acidity : Yes , acids can react with the iron , but cast iron is fairly corrosion resistant . Cast iron is also used for pipes , so this is pretty well-documented by engineers ; you need <URL> to corrode cast iron to any significant degree . Pure tomato juice is not a strong acid ; it has a pH of <URL> , which is just at the threshold ; when you consider that this is being diluted with tomato purée , water , meat juices , and various other lower-acid substances , it 's evident that you 're well within normal tolerances and can cook chili and other tomato products for as long as you like . Also , the seasoning itself provides some measure of protection for higher-acid foods , since the acid has to penetrate the grease , and water is not good at penetrating fat - that 's why food rarely sticks to well-seasoned cast iron . Now this is not to say that the iron wo n't react at all , it just wo n't noticeably corrode or make your sauce/chili taste like metal . Consensus seems to be that you 'll end up with up to <URL> , which comes out to about 160 mg for the whole 3 quarts . That 's not good for you if you eat it all at once , but <URL> every day for a prolonged period of time , so unless you 're eating an entire quart/litre of chili or tomato sauce a day , it 's not going to be a health hazard . So do n't fill your cast iron pot with lemon juice or dump half a cup of vinegar in there - but do n't worry about a few tomatoes either . If anything , it just improves the nutritional content . As far as heat distribution is concerned , <URL> . It 's far more prone to hot spots than reasonably-priced aluminum - or copper-bonded stainless steel . What it does do is retain heat very well , so it 's excellent at maintaining just the right simmering temperature for something like chili , which you would otherwise need some fairly expensive stainless steel to achieve . But you have to be very careful of scorching when you cook chili in cast iron ; stir often . A few times I 've left my cast iron chili pot sitting around unattended for just a little too long and found some of the meat stuck to the bottom . Last but not least is the seasoning and the answer is no , you would n't season it any differently . As I alluded to above , the seasoning really does n't have much an effect when you 're cooking a sauce or stew as opposed to a piece of meat or something else that has a tendency to stick . The only function it really has here is to impart a tiny bit of flavour and insulate the iron from some of the acidity of the tomato juices , which is n't necessary anyway . All in all , I find cast iron to be very good for chili and other stews primarily because of its heat stability , but it 's no panacea , and if you 're only using the pot for chili then you wo n't get many of the benefits ( in particular the beautiful " black " seasoning that accumulates after hundreds of rounds of greasing and cooking ) . So by all means use your existing cast iron for chili and stews , but I would n't recommend for anybody to run out and buy a cast iron pot just for that purpose .
I 'd like to refer you to my answer to the question about <URL> , from which I 'll summarize the relevant parts : Typical cast iron corrodes at a pH lower than 4.3 ; pure white vinegar ( 5 % ) has a pH of 2.4 and wine is around 3.2 to 3.8 . If you plan to use either of these in cast iron , you 'd better make sure they are heavily diluted , otherwise you may actually ruin your pot in addition to getting a pretty hefty iron supplement with your meal . Cast iron is still somewhat reactive at borderline pH ranges , i.e. tomato juice or sauce . It 'll leach out about 5 mg of iron for every 3 oz / 88 mL of liquid for typical cooking times . The typical human needs to ingest significantly more than 45 mg over a period of several days to become toxic , so it 's generally considered OK and even healthy to cook dilute tomato solutions in cast iron , but wine and vinegar are another story . Do n't fill your cast-iron cookware with wine or vinegar . A splash for sauce or deglazing is OK , but tossing a significant amount straight into the pan undiluted will ruin your cookware , and your health . P.S. Note that enameled cast iron ( Le Creuset , etc. ) is less reactive ; the specifics depend on the brand . If you have this type of cast iron , I suggest doing your homework before taking the risk .
There 's no point drinking wine and not enjoying it . The point of wine with food is that , if you enjoy the wine and enjoy the food , you 'll enjoy both together even more . But if you do n't enjoy the wine , you 'll enjoy the food less if you force yourself to drink wine with it . Is there anything you do like about wine ? If not , I suggest you ignore it for the time being . If you 're curious , you 'll come back to it in your own time , whenever you 're ready . If you 're not , it does n't matter : there 's nothing wrong with not liking wine . If there is something you like about wine , for example , the aroma or some component of the taste , I suggest you keep trying it but do n't force yourself . Taste it every now and again and , if you still do n't like it , wait until you want to try it again . This is what I did with whisky . As a teenager / young adult , I really liked the smell of whisky but did n't like the taste -- in hindsight , it was probably the alcohol content that was the problem . Every now and again I 'd have a taste from my father 's glass or from somebody I was drinking with at a bar . For a long time , I did n't like it but I still liked the aroma so I kept trying a couple of times a year . Eventually , I started drinking it . A few things to bear in mind about wine . Avoid cheap wine and do n't waste your money on expensive wine that you wo n't appreciate . Low price is n't a guarantee of low quality and high price is n't a guarantee of high quality but it 's worth spending , say , twice the price of the cheapest bottle if you 're at the supermarket . That 's likely to lift you into wines that you 're disliking because you dislike wine , rather than because they 're bad . Red wine , poured straight from the bottle often tastes rather harsh . Open the bottle half an hour or so before you want to drink it and let it sit in the glass for a couple of minutes before you drink . Wines ( especially red ) with just one or two grape varieties named on the bottle usually have simpler , less challenging tastes . Sweeter white wines will probably be more appealing to you than drier ones . Try something like a sauvignon blanc or unoaked chardonnay , rather than , say , a pinot gris/pinot grigio . Riesling can be anywhere from super-sweet to mouth-puckeringly dry depending on what the winemaker did . Supermarkets in the UK sell quarter-bottles of decent-but-not-amazing wine . That 's a good way to try lots of different styles without having to spend a lot of money or feeling that you 're wasting a whole bottle if you do n't like it . This suggestion is heresy but ... consider chilling red wine . Chilling tends to make harsher flavours less noticeable . If you find you like it chilled , try chilling it less . Ask a wine merchant . Specialist wine merchants love to talk about wine . Do n't be embarrassed to walk into one of their stores and say , " Hi . I like the idea of wine but I 've never found a wine I like drinking . " Their eyes will light up because this is a challenge to them to use their skills to make a customer really happy . If you buy a couple of bottles on their recommendations , you 'll be their favourite customer of the day , I guarantee . Doubly so if you go back a week later after liking what you bought . Go for it !
Purpose of Seasoning protect bare cast iron from rust make the pan surface non-stick How often to season the pan ? You 'll need to season it more when it 's new . Use it frequently and you 'll need to season it less often . Do n't cook beans or tomatoes in it at first ; if you do so later , you may want to re-season it . Regarding adding butter , you 're right : that would be for taste , not necessity . If seasoned properly , a cast iron pan is non-stick .
Maybe ! There 's one big potential issue : panini presses are hinged differently . There 's a bit of variation exactly how , but the effect is that the entire top can lift up , so that it can press down flat on whatever you stick in there . Waffle irons are just designed to be filled , so they hinge at the back . If your sandwich is much smaller than the waffle iron , you can put it in the front part ( as far from the hinge as possible ) , and it wo n't matter too much , but if it takes up a decent fraction of the area , it 'll be squeezed pretty tight at the back compared to the front . This will probably make it cook unevenly , and depending on what you 've got in there , might squeeze things out . Some panini presses also have better temperature controls than waffle irons , but that 's probably not as much of a concern . So I 'd give it a shot and see how it works , plan on possibly flipping your sandwich around halfway through , and do n't be too upset if it 's not pretty ! ( rfusca 's comment above is also good - if you 're able to take off the hinge , you 'd avoid the whole problem . )
Ice cream depends critically on the fat in the dairy to form the structure and mouth feel . Ice cream mixes there fore are typically fairly high in dairy fat . You have substituted a comparatively low fat mock cream . which simply does not have the fat necessary to create the body of the ice cream . In fact , the so-called homemade cream recipe is just thickening milk with gelatin , the thickening agent in ... jelly ( as they in British English , Jello in the US ) . It is no wonder that your product has a jelly like consistency . Also , gelatin is not stable for keeping its thickening ( gelling ) power when frozen . Derobert is also correct in pointing out that switching from a traditional churned ice cream to a hand stirred freezer method will also alter the texture radically , although it is likely to make it grainier and icier without the milk fat to help buffer the formation of ice crystals . Ice cream is a recipe where you do not want to substitute for the specific dairy called for in this way . Ice milk recipes do exist , and will perform better .
A chocolate souffle should be warm and gooey in the middle , if it is solid throughout it has been cooked too long . It sounds like you have it right , I would n't change it . If you want to prove it to her do a google image search on chocolate souffle , you 'll see what the result should look like .

Are potatoes ever used in Mexican or Tex-Mex dishes ?
Potatoes are very popular in some parts of Mexico . When I lived in Guadalajara , potato tacos were common , usually deep-fried . Diced ( and possibly pre-cooked ) potatoes with some seasoning added to a soft taco shell , then the entire thing fried together until crispy . After frying , such tacos ( whether with potatoes or other filling ) were cracked open to add lettuce or salsa or whatever other toppings/fillings might be desired , or salsa might be poured over the top , and eaten with a fork . One of my favorite local dishes was gorditas , which are basically a double-thick tortilla split at the middle ( like pita bread ) and stuffed with a filling of choice , and grilled . Diced and cooked potatoes were a common choice , often with beans or cheese as well . Potatoes are also common in Mexico prepared much the same as they are in the U.S. : Baked , or as french fries , or the ever-popular potato chip . Always with a Mexican flair , usually in the form of extra spicy seasoning or sauces added . I also had a " Breakfast taco " in Austin , Texas a couple months ago , which had potatoes . So there is some tex-mex food with potatoes , but I think this is probably not as common as it is in true Mexican cuisine . But then , Tex-Mex has never been a very close substitute for true Mexican food :) My best guess as for why potatoes are not common in Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in the U.S. is that potatoes are not considered an exotic/exciting enough food/flavor to be considered " special " by most people who frequent such places .
Butter can go bad . The oils will go rancid if exposed to too much light and heat for too long . This accelerates the process of oxidation , which happens even if you keep the butter in the fridge . Even in the fridge your butter will eventually go bad . Personally I follow the dates on all packages . I do so with an awareness that they usually tend to be conservative , which keeps me comfortable . Rancid butter in a taste test wo n't kill you , though . It 'll just taste bad . So you should be able to taste this butter to see if it is bad . While I recommend following the dates on packaging , here are signs that your butter has actually gone bad : discoloration melting ( which will happen outside of the fridge , you probably would n't see it ) sour smell sour and unusual taste
Dry rubs are one case that I can think of where dry is specifically necessary , so you can grind them up properly . The main advantage to dry herbs is that they 're available year round . When you 're dealing with winter dishes , dry herbs would 've been the norm to have used at that time . If you are going to substitute , you 'll need to add more ( typically about 3x as much , as the dry is usually more concentrated ) , and you 'll want to add it late in the cooking process , while dry herbs are usually added early . One exception to the rule is bay leaves -- you 'll still need to add them early , and you 'll want to reduce the number .
The coating you are talking about is potato starch that is browning on the bottom of the pan , similar to what happens to roux when it is prepared . If you deglaze the pan using alcohol , it will come right off without any effort ( water works too , though more is needed ) . As for how to get the potatoes not to stick , it 's important that the pan and the oil are quite hot when the potatoes are added to the pan . As described at <URL> , the hot oil encourages a steam barrier to appear between the potatoes and the pan , temporarily protecting the potatoes from sticking and encouraging the formation of a crust that will permanently keep them from sticking . Depending on the amount of potato being cooked , the amount of oil added to the pan will have to be adjusted for thermal mass , since the addition of uncooked potatoes will cause the oil to cool down very quickly .
Pasta ( by which I infer you mean dried , Italian-style semolina pasta ) is edible raw , right out of the package . It is not , however , palatable . If you soak it in water , it will hydrate and soften over time , but that is not the same as cooking it . True cooking also cooks the proteins and takes away that raw starchy taste . There is no way to achieve that without the application of some heat above about 180 F for at least a few minutes . See also : <URL> Note that in one of the answers to that question , Rumtscho points out that supermarket ramen noodles are precooked ( they are generally par-fried , sometimes par-baked ) and are much more palatable eaten straight from the package , or simply soaked .
Speaking as someone who 's had to prep ahead two garbage barrels of sweet potatoes for a giant gumbo event : If you 're just peeling them a few hours ahead , then just hold them whereever . Unlike russet potatoes , sweet potatoes ( especially garnet yams ) do not turn brown or lose texture on exposure to air . If you 're going to be holding them for a couple days , then drop them in cold water and refrigerate it . Or drop them in ice water and add more ice about twice a day ( this is what we had to do , it took 2 days to prep all the ingredients ) . Wrapping them tightly in plastic wrap might also work , but I have n't tried it .
If you heard people talking about " thick " vs. " thin " soy sauce , they were probably actually referring to dark vs. light soy sauce . Dark soy sauce does not actually refer to the colour . It does tend to be darker than natural fermented soy sauce , but if you 're comparing to the hydrolyzed kind ( the most common sold in stores ) , it will look about the same in terms of colour . What actually distinguishes dark soy sauce is that it is aged longer and has added molasses , which makes it thick , sticky and syrupy . Dark soy sauce does taste quite different from light soy sauce , even when it 's the same brand . Dark soy sauce replaces some of the saltiness of light soy sauce with sweetness instead , and in general just has a " bolder " taste . It 's usually used as a cooking ingredient , not a condiment . I 've heard , but ca n't verify , that it is more common in Japanese cooking than other Asian cuisines ( although I have used it with much success in Chinese and Thai dishes ) . I 've started to see a lot more ordinary grocery stores carrying dark soy sauce , but until recently it was difficult to find unless you went to an Asian grocery store , and may still be difficult in some regions . Unless the bottle specifically says dark soy sauce , it is light soy sauce . You should not directly substitute one for the other . As for your comment about the one you bought tasting too " hot " - you must have bought a chili-infused soy sauce or something . Ordinary soy sauce ( dark or light ) is never spicy-hot .
You might be stumbling about the fact that " <URL> " is more ambiguous that your Krapfen = donut conclusion . The small piece of yeast-based dough , often filled and/or fried . That 's the category your " Krapfen " and donuts fall into . In many dialects they are also called " Kreppel " . ( And a bunch of other names . ) Filled pasta dough , sweet or savoury , typically folded and/or crimped together . While an Italian would talk about " ravioli " , an Estern European about " pieroggi " and an Asian about " dumplings " , someone from Southern Tyrol or the Allgäu would call them " Krapfen " ( but also use the term for the variety above ) and in Jiddish cuisine it 's a " <URL> " . So if you want a donut , say so . The term krapfen wo n't mean anything to an English speaker ( check your favourite dictionary , I just did ! ) . But do n't be surprised if you are offered kreplach and get a ravioli , not a donut .
If cooled and stored properly ( minimize air space in the container ) , most soups will should last in the refrigerator up to 5 days . Do you really want to be eating the same soup that long ? I would suggest dividing your soups into smaller sized containers and freezing it so you have a wide selection available at any given time . Depending on the ingredients most soups can be succesfully frozen for long term storage . Dairy based items are more likely to curdle/separate after thawing so you 'd be better to add the cream/milk when you 're reheating it . Chunks of potato or pasta are likely to break up a bit and have a more mealy consistency so it would also be better to leave the potato out and add to it and cook when reheating .
According to Wikipedia , <URL> might not be a good idea . Leaves can be dried and ground to make filé powder , used to thicken gumbo .
Short answer : yes . Long answer : depends on what you 're cooking . Grilling some popular food items can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) HCAs , a family of mutagenic and cancer-causing compounds , are produced during the cooking of many animal products , including chicken , beef , pork , and fish . In January of 2005 , the federal government officially added HCAs to its list of known carcinogens . Cancer Project nutritionists determined that many commonly grilled foods contain alarmingly high levels of HCAs . This table lists the five foods containing the highest levels . ( Source : <URL> )
You can not ; they are full of solanine , which is poisonous . You can use the seeds however to grow new potatoes , though they wo n't breed true to the parent . This website has some great information : <URL>
Fundamentally , the reason for this substitution is that applesauce contains <URL> . In baking , the role of oil is to coat the flour , preventing it from combining with the water ( or other wet ingredients ) and developing <URL> . Gluten is what causes dough to rise , and also gives elasticity to the final product - what most people think of as " chewiness . " When you 're baking , for example , a cake , or even a pie crust , you want to limit the amount of gluten that develops . A cake or pie crust should be moist , light , and fluffy , not tough and chewy . When you bite into a cake and find it very dry and bread-like , that is because it has developed a lot of gluten . A good amount of oil or other fat leads to a lighter , moister , less-glutinous result . The pectin in applesauce can also , to a certain extent , help to inhibit gluten formation in a dough , but the similarities end there . I can not stress this point enough , and I 've seen many other online resources get this dead wrong : Pectin ( applesauce ) is not a straightforward or foolproof substitute for fat . The mechanisms by which pectin and oil work in this context are completely different : Oil is a <URL> . Lipids bind to starch ( including the ~ 75 % starch in flour ) and are <URL> - the traditional example of this is dew drops forming on the surface of grass or plants ( the latter being the hydrophobe ) . In a sense , oil forms a protective " shield " around the flour molecules . Pectin , on the other hand , is a <URL> , and specifically a <URL> . Pectin is not hydrophobic and does not actually protect the flour molecules . In fact , pectin is of the same family as starches , which are also polysaccharides . What 's really happening here is that the pectin competes with the flour for water . That means less water overall reaches the starch and gluten-forming proteins ( giladin and glutenin ) in the flour , and because of this , it is not able to develop as much gluten or gelatinize much of the other starch . What does all of this actually mean for you , the baker ? Quite simply , it means you have to be very careful with this substitution : Too much pectin can turn your recipe into a jelly-like consistency . Too little pectin will fail to prevent glutenization ( in other words , you 'll get bread ) . Pectin has the property of <URL> - meaning that once it starts to gel , it also starts to expel liquid , and your dessert will dry out or deflate over time . Pectin is actually water-soluble at high temperatures ( technically , it forms a <URL> ) , it just happens to absorb a lot of water along the way . Baking for too long , or at too high a temperature , will cause the pectin to break down and dissolve completely , making it useless . There are also several other problems ( or at least " gotchas " ) when making the apple sauce substitution : Applesauce is <URL> . It has a good deal of water and various proteins and acids , and even a certain amount of lipids . The exact quantities , however , depend on how the applesauce was made , so it is very hard to get precise control over the amount of pectin , and the textbook 1:1 substitution ratio is almost never correct . Another thing that applesauce contains is sugar - even unsweetened applesauce . You will almost certainly need to reduce the amount of sugar elsewhere in your recipe . This may be difficult , especially if the bulk of the sugar is used as a dry ingredient . Applesauce behaves somewhat similarly to oil , but do not even try using it as a substitute for any other fat . Butter , in particular , contains milk proteins which act as natural emulsifiers ; pectin does have certain stabilizing properties but is a rather poor emulsifier compared to butter [ citation needed ] . And it goes without saying that the flavour is substantially different from that of applesauce ; oil is " OK " to substitute for because it has very little flavour of its own . If you plan on using applesauce as a substitute for oil in a recipe that does not specifically explain how to use it as a substitute , then I strongly suggest you do two things : Do n't substitute the entire quantity . Use 1/2 oil , 1/2 applesauce , or maybe 1/4 oil and 3/4 applesauce . You will likely also have to lower the total quantity of oil/applesauce to approximately half of what it originally was ( give or take 1/4 ) . If you can , try this substitution on a small scale first , and experiment with the quantities of oil , sugar , and applesauce , before going all-out and putting it into the oven while your guests arrive . It 's very likely that on the first few attempts , you 'll end up with something that 's palatable , but nowhere near the quality of the oil-based recipe . Ignore these disclaimers at your own risk !
There is no such thing as " lower quality cream " although there are variations in taste . All milk has a slightly different water to fat ratio . In general , animal milk is 80 % water , 5 % protein and 5 % fat . Cream is the fatty part of milk skimmed off . Cream will typically be 35 % fat ( though in different cultures it varies from 20 % to 75 % ) . Cream also has some protein , and the rest being water Farmers are paid for the milk solids ( protein and fat ) , not by the volume of milk produced . Therefore quality milk is often referred to by how high the solids level is , not how flavoursome it is . Hygiene and storage conditions are usually government mandated , and follow international guidelines , especially if the manufacturer ever wants to export the product Butter is cream churned to remove most of the water and protein . Butter in most countries must have 80 % or more fat content to be called butter . The water and protein by-product is called whey , and is processed into other products The 1 % to 2 % salt added is a preservative and a commonly desired flavouring , regardless of the " quality " of the cream . You can buy unsalted butter , just keep it in the freezer for long term storage . Freezing butter has no noticeable effect on it .
Cocoa nibs are the result of fermenting the seeds from the cocoa fruit ( the size of a large grapefruit ) , and then roasting the whole cocoa beans , and then de-shelling them The de-shelling process tends to gently crack the contents into large pieces . Unlike other seeds and nuts this is acceptable as the product is going to be finely ground anyway You can also buy " raw cocoa nibs " , which are fermented , de-shelled , but not roasted . These have a different taste , and do not make good chocolate Roasted or not they taste interesting and are useful as a whole flavour item in salads , baking , drinks etc. . They are very high in fat so use with caution . The fat also has a very low melting point , so will make any warm liquid dish look oily They are not to everyone 's taste , unlike chocolate compound :-) In both these case the beans have been fermented on the ground for a few weeks . Non-fermented cocoa beans are not very nice ( I have n't ever had any though ) . From what I understand they compare to fermented beans like non-pickled olives are too pickled olives : - / Roasted cocoa bean nibs , and roasted cocoa beans Non-roasted cocoa bean nibs
More or less , yes . Just know that eggs of different species have different " flavors . " There may be some issues with substituting in dishes due to varying fat content of the yolks and such ... I 've had duck and goose egg quiches . I 've had fried quail eggs on toast . I have yet to try an ostrich or emu egg .
The one I hear most often in professional kitchens is nappe , which is the " coat the back of a spoon " test . That is the general starting point for an average sauce that you can use in a wide variety of dishes ; it is thick enough to cling to food without being stodgy . Beyond that , I 'm not familiar with other standard professional terms specifically for viscocity . Usually just thin , thick , stiff and so forth . Sometimes it is useful to talk in terms of percent reduction , as in " add 2 cups of wine and simmer until reduced by half " , although in many cases this is done more by eyeball than with precision .
I would consider the professional equivalent of the electric carving knife to be the meat slicer , i.e. the rotating blade device most often seen behind the deli counter . At home , to break down a roast bird , take the meat off of a lamb-leg , etc. , a good manual knife is most likely the proper tool . If , on the other hand , I have a large ham ( cooked or cold ) , or some other chunk of boneless meat that I want to slice more-or-less uniformly , then I will break out my electric knife . For the home user , it is a fairly practical device , not taking up too much space , etc. . But its uniformity and speed can not compare to the slicer . As to a professional kitchen , you may or may not find one there . Certainly in deli-type restaurants you would have them . In a more traditional restaurant they are not as concerned with quick production of sliced meat , so any slicing is probably done by hand .
There are several reasons for adding orange juice : The first is for flavor . The second is to act as an acid . Although in this particular case , the acid is already in the baking powder . All baking powder needs to act as a leavening agent is some kind of liquid . Unless you meant baking soda , in which case an acid is necessary for leavening . The third is to inhibit mold growth . The real reason vitamin C is added is as a dough enhancer , not for gluten development . Since this is a quick bread ( no yeast ) , gluten development is not a main concern . The fourth reason for the orange juice is to make a tender crumb . Because of the fructose found naturally in it . Sugars are added to baked goods as a tenderizing agent . This recipe sounds yummy !
The cooking snobs will say that butter is better , and even my fading taste buds can sometimes detect the difference . But much of the time you can make the substitute . BTW the reason for the 7/8 figure is that butter runs about 1/8 water . So you may have to use 7/8 cup of oil and 1-2 tablespoons of water . The biggest difference between solid fat and oil will occur when you see lines like , " Blend together with a pastry blender until you have crumbs the size of a pea . A pie crust made with oil will not be a tender flaky crust . However for bannock making in the bush , corn oil works fine as a substitute for lard . and it 's a heck of a lot easier to keep . A comment below mentions cookie recipes . For this to be successful , the flour to fat ratio has to be fairly high . Bannock is 1 cup of flour to 1-2 tbs of fat . This is small enough that the flour absorbs all the oil . Another signal : If the directions call for chilling the dough then there is enough fat in the mix that using oil would make the recipe way too liquid . I suspect this is the case with many cookies . Cake recipes usually do n't have as high a fat : flour ratio as many cookies , but cakes are often very fussy about ingredient ratios . So : Test before counting on it . It does work for bannock . 1 cup flour 1 to 3 tbs fat or oil 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder Tiny amount of water . If you are going to fry the bannock , go light on the oil . Mix flour and salt and baking powder . Mix in fat . Mix in just enough water to make a stiff dough that holds together . It is very easy to overdo . Knead only long enough to mix . Cooking : 1 . Shape into long strips about 3/8 " thick , wrap around smooth pole and bake over a 10 second fire for 15 minutes rotating slowly . ( A 10 second fire : YOu can hold your hand where the cooking happens for 10 seconds ) Pat out into 3/8 to half inch slabs . Cook in a frying pan over a 20 second fire for 5-10 minutes on a side . Pat out to 1/8 " thick . Drop into a bucket with 2 inches of smoking hot lard in the bottom . Lift out with tongs after 30 seconds . Method 1 will keep campers busy for a long time . Method 2 makes bannock you can use for a meal later . Method 3 is the fastest method , but it is dangerous .

How can I grow my own yeast ( sourdough starter ) ?
Most bakers refer to this as a starter and it is extremely easy to keep up . You will need a plastic bag or a jar to keep it in , a cup of warm water , and some flour . You can either grow some wild yeast or add a particular strain to the growth solution depending what you are trying to do with the yeast . Once you do that , just leave it someplace warm but not over 100 degree F . Then once a day , you feed the yeast by removing half and adding back a half cup of flour and a half cup of water . Once it starts foaming remove to the fridge and remember to feed once a week . It will be with you for the rest of the your time on earth . Also , that half you take out when you feed it ? Makes a great gift to other baking or cooking friends . Also , if you devolop a dark smelly liquid , just stir it back in , it is normal and nothing to worry about .
The mixture should lighten in both color and texture , and it should be ' fluffy ' . It should also increase in volume . The point of creaming is to incorporate the sugar with the fat , while at the same time adding air to the mixture . The air bubbles introduced during creaming expand during cooking , making the cookies rise and giving a lighter texture . Cookies baked with under-creamed butter would therefore remain fairly flat and dense .
Note that for maximum benefit I am answering the question regarding chicken stock first and at the end have included information on other stocks such as fish and brown chicken and veal stock . Properly made stock is made from bones only . If you cut up your own chickens then save the backs and wing tips in the freezer and use for stock . You might ask at your grocery store or butcher and be able to purchase backs from them if you want to make stock but do n't have enough . Chicken feet are rich in gelatin and can be added to the pot to help add body to the stock . Place chicken backs/wing tips in a large stockpot ( about a 3-4 gal . stockpot ) . Cover with cold water and place on stove . Bring to a gentle simmer for about 10 minutes . This is known as " blanching " the bones and is done to help dissolve the blood and other loose proteins from the soft bones . These proteins will form a gray scum on the surface . Once the scum has formed , drain off the water disarding it in the sink . The more clear a stock is the longer the shelflife as it 's the additional proteins making a stock cloudy that also cause it to spoil much more quickly . Return bones to the pot and cover again with cold water . Add a sachet ( cheesecloth pouch containing a couple of bay leaves , about a teaspoon of whole peppercorns , a handful of parsley stems , and 8-10 thyme branches or a teaspoon of dried thyme ) that 's been tied up with some string . Bring the pot to a very gentle simmer once again and allow to simmer for about 3 hours . After 3 hours add the mirepoix ( carrots , onions , celery ) . Plan on 1-2 lbs . of mirepoix ( combined vegetables ) per 8 lbs . of bones . I also like to add leeks as they not only add flavor but are supposed to help in clarification of the stock . Continue to simmer the stock for 1-2 hours . ( If you 're not going to be around to add the vegetables at that time they can be added with the bones but need to be cut in large pieces to avoid cooking down and disintegrating . I would typically start chicken and veal stock at night before leaving the restaurant and allow it to simmer overnight until the next morning . ) Strain the stock through a fine mesh strainer or several layers of cheesecloth . Cool the stock in a metal container ( another pot ) in an ice bath until cool to the touch and then place in storage containers and refrigerate or freeze . Once the stock has chilled the fat will have formed a solid layer on top of the stock . Carefully remove and either discard or use for sauteeing ( such as duck or chicken fat ) . Additional Notes : The same process would be followed for white veal stock ( not frequently used ) If preparing a brown stock ( roasted chicken , veal , beef , lamb , duck ) : ** These stocks are made by first rinsing the bones and then roasting in the oven at about 400 F degrees until medium brown ( think iced tea color ) . Once bones are browned , smear them with a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and roast for another 5 minutes or so . Be careful as the concentrated sugars in the tomato paste can cause it to burn and create a bitter tasting stock . After bones and tomato paste have roasted , place them in the stock pot and add the mirepoix to the roasting pan , tossing to coat with the fat that has rendered out and roast the mirepoix until lightly browned . Add the mirepoix about 2 hours before finishing the stock . Be sure carrots are cut rather large to avoid having them disintegrate and adding a strange excessively sweet taste to the stock . Recommended cooking times for stocks : - Fish : 30-45 minutes . Use lean white fish bones and heads . Lobster/shrimp stock is made from the shells and will usually yield more flavor if first roasted . Remove gills and eyes from fish heads to prevent clouding the stock . Do not use carrots in mirepoix or it will color the stock an orange hue . Use onions , celery , leeks , mushrooms , and sliced lemon . - Chicken/Duck : 4-6 hours - Veal/Beef/Lamb : 8-12 hours ( knuckle bones of veal will have the greatest amount of gelatin since the bones have n't hardened as much as those of beef ) Stocks should not be seasoned with salt as one of the primary purposes is for them to be a " stock " item that can be used for a variety of needs : soups , sauces , rice , etc. . The salt is added to the final preparation not the stock . If stock is salted and then used for a reduction sauce the resulting sauce will be too salty .
Put the bag in front of an air conditioner for a few minutes . Worked like a champ for Oreos and chips that went stale over a humid weekend in a desk drawer . This was a window unit - I arranged to blow the cold air into the bag . Was amazed with the results .
My <URL> just happened , and I have been able to propagate it by pouring the last few teaspoons from one bottle into the next ( after drinking half of the next bottle ) . It goes pretty slow using an open bottle ( too little circulation ) but it does go . I open the bottle every day or so and swish the contents around . It takes about 1 weak to even start smelling vinegary , and circa one month to really develop . I 've been sticking with the same variety of wine and not trying to diddle the sugar content . I still have not developed a mat-like mother , but there does seem to be a culture there . I 'm on the fourth generation now .
Despite the myths ( and some here will disagree with me ) , the large flavor molecules in brines do not penetrate into meats more than a milimeter or two at the surface . This is not the same with the salt , which will slowly migrate throughout the body of the cut . Marinades can add flavor , but it is again a surface treatment , mostly from the marinade literally sticking to the surface of the meat . Mops are the same idea . As you have mentioned , you can inject a liquid into the meat , and then it is inside , but it will not penetrate past where it is injected . Therefore , your best plan , depending on what the star ingredient you must use is , is to find a way to get it more intensely applied to the surface of the meat . Depending on what you have , this may be to : Incorporate it into your dry rub Incorporate it into your mop ; for liquids , possibly reducing it first ( for example , an ale ) to intensify the flavor without the bulk from the liquid Reduce it and inject it , knowing that the flavor will pretty much stay where it is injected Rules permitting , incorporate it into your sauce ( again , possibly reducing it for intensity ) The more bulk of the substance you can get to adhere to the meat , or inject into the meat , through these methods , the more powerful the affect will be . Since taste is closely related to aroma , I would suggest sticking to exterior treatments such as rubs and mops , where the aroma will trigger the taste perception more directly .
In the accepted answer to <URL> , it says that you can try wringing the pumpkin purée out in cheese cloth ; or in a comment , that you can let it drain in a colander .
Your technique is going to be critical here . Leaning scones are n't necessarily indicative of improper technique , but flat ones are . Keeping your ingredients cold is important when creating scones in every recipe I 've read or tried . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> as to grate the butter and then freeze the grated pieces and use a <URL> to provide layers . Many other recipes use cold butter ( frozen or simply very cold out of the freezer ) in chunks and a pastry blender to cut them in . Your milk should also be cold , not room temperature . You may also want to chill your work bowl and utensils . You do n't want your butter melting before those scones hit the oven . When your scones hit the oven and the butter does begin to soften and melt , it will leave behind layers of air in your scone which will help it to rise . You do n't want to handle finished scone dough very much . Use a light touch and minimal work . I 'd also check the date on your self-raising flour . The ingredients will lose their activity over time , causing the flour not to rise as well any more .
It seems like a lot of recipes recomend gelatin , which could add to the stretchyness . I frequent serious eats and a while ago they posted this recipe and they claim that it is great and stretchy . <URL>
If it has a shiny/reflective surface and does n't melt or bloom ( much ) at room temperature or hand temperature , then it 's already tempered . Virtually every packaged chocolate is already tempered . Untempered chocolate generally needs to be refrigerated for longer-term storage , so if a package does n't specify refrigeration ( and I 've never seen one that does ) , you can assume that it is tempered .
You are n't going to be able to get a sourdough starter from flour to ready-to-bake in 24 hours . You could easily make a poolish or pâte fermentée in that time , and get some of the flavor . You might also be able to use some yogurt whey or another source of lactic acid to get some of the sour flavor . Unfortunately , a sour starter is something that you kind of need to keep going and have on hand .
It 's actually a bit of an old wives ' tale that the yeasts colonizing your starter are from the air . Almost all of the yeasts in a starter are from the grains used to make it . This is why starters are frequently started with either whole grain kernels or grains like rye that are left mostly intact when milled . All of the microorganisms on the outside of the grain kernel are then included in your starter . As to leaving your jar open , I certainly would n't seal it up , especially if the jar is glass . The carbon dioxide produced by the starter could cause the jar to explode if it ca n't escape .
The first yeast was " just there " - in the environment , everywhere . People discovered very early on that leaving the dough ( or just a flour-water slurry ) out would lead to it getting " sour " and " bubbly " , thus leavening the bread : What we today call sourdough is in fact a mixture of yeasts and bacteria ( lactobacillae ) . The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation . ( M.G. Gaenzle : Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology ) Early sources are the Bible ( - > the explicit demand for of " unleavened " or " unsoured " bread during Passover suggesting that otherwise was the norm ) and sources from Ancient Egypt . The " modern " yeast that was explicitly added was mentioned by <URL> in his Naturalis historia as a foam skimmed from beer : In Gaul and Spain , where they make a drink by steeping corn in the way that has been already described - they employ the foam which thickens upon the surface as a leaven : hence it is that the bread in those countries is lighter than that made elsewhere . Source : <URL> . Pliny the Elder . John Bostock , M.D. , F.R.S. H.T. Riley , Esq. , B.A. London . Taylor and Francis , Red Lion Court , Fleet Street . 1855 . Sources from the 18th century describe how the <URL> ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) was used for baking , leading to the " specialized strains " of <URL> cultivated separately when the brewers switched to bottom-fermenting yeast ( S. pastorianus ) in the 19th century , which preferred cooler temperatures and was not as easy to harvest as the top-fermenting types . The use of separately cultivated yeast allowed to bake " milder " breads than the sourdough types with their typical acidic undertones but is restricted to certain flour types .
First off , it 's good to understand the difference between active dry yeast and rapid rise yeast . Active dry yeast is a larger granule of yeast in which the outer shell is composed of mostly dead cells entombing the dormant nougaty goodness inside . It has to be proofed to seperate out all the cells and rehydrate the interior active cells . Rapid rise yeast is a typically a combination of 2 different strains of yeast ( so those with a very discerning palate might be able to tell the difference , I 've never really tried ) . The granules of yeast are smaller and dried slower to preserve more yeast cells . Ascorbic acid is also added to push the yeast into overdrive a little faster . A great video that helped me a lot is <URL> I have noticed before issues with Rapid Rise yeast not proofing very well the second time around . Apparently it 's designed to give you one really good proof and then die out ( play hard and die young ) . Instant yeast however is Rapid Rise yeast without the hardcore party attitude . It 's what they use at the King Arthur bakery test kitchen , so that 's good enough for me ! They say to use them interchangeably , but many other sites I see show a difference of about 20 % . 2 Tbsp Active Dry yeast ≈ 1.6 Tbsp Instant Yeast
I have to admit that I have n't tried a lot of free-form jerky experiments so take what I say with a grain of salt . ( see what I did there ? ) Jerky is a double action meat preservation method . You soak the meat with way too much salt and then dehydrate it . Bacteria do n't stand a chance . As Alton says in that episode " Club med becomes club dead " . Not one of his best puns but it gets the point across . Salt ( or soy sauce , same thing ) is n't required for the drying process but it is important for long term preservation . I have seen recipes that try to reduce it but I would never leave it out altogether . I would expect a reduced salt recipe to not have the longevity that most jerky has - If stored in an air tight container it will last nearly forever . The non-salt ingredients do n't really matter as long as they wo n't oxidize or pick up bad flavors during dehydration . The type of sugar also does n't matter - although the recipes I prefer do n't include any . I honestly do n't know about viscosity - I would expect it to need enough liquid to carry the salt into the meat . That would take some experimenting . It is very important that there be as little fat as possible . The leaner the meat the better and do n't add any to the marinade . Fats will go rancid quite quickly when exposed to so much air . Lastly - I think I 've posted this recipe before as the answer to some other question but it bears repeating . This family recipe is my favorite by far and I use it as a starting point for any experimenting : Auntie Fern 's Beef Jerky 3 lbs . deer meat or beef , sliced thin 1 T salt 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder 1 T pepper ( I like coarse ground ) 1/4 c. soy sauce 1/3 c. Worcestershire sauce 1/3 c. liquid smoke ( hickory flavor ) Combine and marinade 12 hours . Drain . Dry .
Mold grows best in warm , moist conditions . It 's a fungus , not a plant ; light has nothing to do with it . Fresh air does n't really make it grow either , but circulating air does help reduce condensation , depriving mold of moisture . So you really do n't want to seal a breadbox - that 'll just help create a nice moist environment for the mold to grow in . Breadboxes are really just about keeping other pests away from your bread , while still being able to keep it at room temperature . ( It goes stale faster in the fridge . ) If you 're worried about mold growth , you probably just want to freeze some of the bread .
In order to store yeast for that period of time it has to be make inactive , and the process to do that yourself is challenging , time consuming , and you 'd need specialist equipment . It would be prohibitive in both time and cost , far above just buying yeast . You can of course make a starter by mixing equal amounts of flour and water plus some yeast , this will keep the yeast alive by feeding it , and you can keep it alive indefinitely by feeding it once per week . You add some of the starter to your bread and it supplies active yeast .
The problem could be the recipe . If you 're using a lot of lemon juice , then a lot of sugar to cover up all that acidity , you 're guaranteed to end up with something pretty soft . Have a look around at other lemon sorbet recipes , and see if you 're using relatively more . But if your recipe is sane , then it could be your process . Here 's how it could mess things up . Sorbet is basically sugar water with a bit of flavor . When it freezes all the way , unless it was churned as it froze , there 's going to be a tendency for it to separate into ice crystals and even stronger sugar water . Some of this may happen in your first freezing step . Then you 're pulverizing it in a food processor , probably giving it a chance to melt a bit . This is much worse than just leaving it out , since once it 's in tiny bits , there 's a lot more surface area exposed to air , and you 're continuously mixing it , bringing in warm air , and so on . Then finally , it refreezes . The part that managed to melt in the meantime is going to repeat the earlier process , except now there 's lots of space , so it 's even easier for ice crystals to form and force out the sugar . So I 'd definitely expect a tendency to end up with a runny sugar syrup component to your " sorbet " . ( If it 's at all grainy , this is probably what 's happening . ) If you 're determined to do this without any kind of ice cream maker , it 's going to be hard to avoid problems . You can certainly try to correct for it by using less sugar , though . You could also just make a granita - freeze it on a sheet , and scrape it off to serve .
Gloves are annoying and , much like condoms , do obscure sensation and -- in the case of kitchen work -- precision with your fingers . For those reasons I avoid them wherever possible . As a lifelong nailbiter ( from when I was about 9 until I was 31 ) , it was a habit that was really hard to give up . But it has been worth it , not just professionally . I know this is n't the answer you 're looking for , but : stop biting your nails .
Anything that 's hard to get off of your counter can make a good food coloring . Regarding natural sources , remember that you run the risk of also adding additional flavors so take that into consideration . Among other companies , <URL> makes all natural foods including colorful fruit snacks . What they use for the coloring in these snacks are : turmeric , black carrot juice concentrate , and annatto . ( I 've cooked with turmeric and annatto before and they DEFINITELY stain . ) Aside from Google searches , you could probably find practical natural food dyes by looking in the ingredient list from other all-natural foods . Back to your specific question about beets , this is from <URL> : 1 Put your fresh beets in a glass or enamel pan with just enough water to fully cover them . Bring to a boil and turn the heat down a bit to simmer for 30 minutes . Make sure the water does n't boil out . Take them off when the beets are not quite done - When a knife goes into them but they 're not as soft as you 'd like for eating . Remove them from heat . 2 Strain the beets , reserving the beet juice . Peel , slice and chop up your beets . Return them to the beet juice . Soak for four hours . 3 Strain the liquid out and take out 3/4 cup . Add your 2 teaspoons vinegar to this . This is your red dye . 4 Use canned beets and you can skip half of the work . Drain the can reserving 3/4 cup liquid . Add 2 teaspoon of vinegar to this and you 're done . You can still eat the beets , too . The fresh ones are n't terribly appealing after this .

How long can I keep a dessert out of the fridge ?
Since it is a custard , you should probably refrigerate it as soon as it is cool . A very sugary or acidic custard may be able to resist bacteria for a couple days ( see Bismark donuts ) , but unless the recipe was specifically developed to be stable at room temperature , then there is some risk of it going bad . If you have a fridge , there 's no reason not to use it . It may make the dough a little soggy , so you will want to find a way to store it to reduce condensation . Better yet , make just as much as you are going to eat/serve at one time , and do n't worry about this problem . <URL> <URL>

Biscuits are notorious for that ; they 're best eaten right away . If you want to preserve their original texture longer than 12 hours ( yes , that short of a time ) , your best bet is to freeze them as soon as they are cool and eat them within a month or two . Wrap them as air-tightly as possible . You can pop the frozen biscuits in a moderate oven or unwrap and give them an hour or so on the counter to defrost , then warm them . Either way , it 's best to serve them warm , they will seem softer and fresher that way . If you 've found a recipe you like and think you might want to make them frequently , mix the dry ingredients for multiple batches . If you can weigh the dry mix that you have just mixed , then you 're golden . You can make as many or as few biscuits as you want anytime just by using the same proportion of dry , fat and liquid as the original recipe . You can easily make a single biscuit that way or feed a crowd .
Truffles are a low acid food , and they grow underground , so they are at risk to have botulism spores present . Vacuum packing creates a low oxygen environment , which is what the botulism bacteria requires to grow and produce its toxin . Unless the truffles have been salted ( to 5 % by weight ) , acidified ( to a pH of 4.6 or lower ) , or frozen ( at all times after being vacuum packed ) , they are at risk for the growth of botulism . Some strains can grow and produce their toxins at refrigerator temperatures ( and most refrigerators have a temperature cycle that peaks in the more general growth range ) . While the growth is slow , it can occur . The risk is increased if the truffles have not been continuously refrigerated since they were vacuum packed . For this reason , mushrooms and truffles should never be vacuum packed and stored . You should discard these truffles . In the future , obtain your truffles from a reputable source ( which does not vacuum pack ) and use them fresh , or freeze them as botulism is not active at freezer temperatures .

It 's definitely an unusually long-lasting melon , although sources list a few different timeframes . <URL> says if kept in a cool , dry , frost-free place , they keep very well for several months , and reportedly over a year . <URL> increases that : If kept dry after harvest , a fruit can last several years .
<URL> gives you 3-5 days on cooked onions in the fridge - after that , tightly wrapped and airtight into the freezer .
Depending on the temperature in your fridge , cooked lentils will be safe to eat for 2 to 5 days when using a sealed container , filled with the cooking water . By immersing them , your lentils wo n't dry out and they 'll be ready to use whenever you need them - just drain the amount you need . If you 've got sufficient freezer space you could also freeze the cooked lentils . Just prepare a whole lot of lentils and divide them in individual portions to put in small freezer bags . Make sure you push out any air before sealing the bag . Freezed lentils will be fine anywhere from 4 up to 6 months . However , I would strongly recommend using dried lentils , which I 'm sure you 'll be able to find in Copenhagen . Just make a habit of soaking the amount of lentils you need for your breakfast and you 'll never have to worry about storing leftovers . It 's a lot cheaper too ! But above that , dried lentils tend to taste much better than canned lentils . :)
Eggs will last two to four days in the refrigerator . Source : StillTasty ( <URL> &amp; <URL> )
Up to 7 days ( homemade mayo as well ) . Egg whites/yolks out of the egg ( but not combined with the acid ) can last 3-4 days refrigerated , and eggs in-shell are good for 2-4 weeks depending on processing .
In <URL> , Lorenzo notes that steaks may end up raw in the center if you only leave 'em out for 10-15 minutes to come up to temperature . I recommend 30 mins , but it will probably vary on what room temperature actually is for you . From Weber 's Way To Grill , which recommends salting right when you take them out of the fridge , here 's Mr. Purviance 's take on why you should consider salting early : It 's true that salt draws moisture toward itself , but over the course of 20 to 30 minutes that 's a good thing , because the salt begins to dissolve into that little bit of moisture . When the steak hits the hot grate ... [ you ] create a delicious crust . Any moisture you might lose is well worth the flavor of that crust .
<URL> : 6 months at best quality . In my personal experience , it can last much longer and be just fine , though I think the longest I ever kept a box was a couple years , not 5 years like riotburn . StillTasty suggests that the concern after more than 6 months is lost potency , but I believe the potential to take on odors from the surroundings is much more of a concern ; store it in something airtight like you said , and you should be pretty safe from that . So I 'm sure it 'll last at least until next Christmas . And if you do get into baking , you might go through a box faster than you 'd think . Otherwise , it 's fortunately pretty cheap , and it does have other uses ( e.g. cleaning ) so it wo n't hurt you too much to just go for it .

To make a good baked cheesecake , I was taught the following , and it has ALWAYS worked : Start with room temperature ingredients . DO NOT over-mix . This is a significant cause of cracking , as the incorporated air tends to souffle . When baking , always bake in a bain-marie ( put your cake into a water bath for insulation ) . Bake half an hour at 300 ° F / 150 ° C. Then , turn off the oven , open the oven door , and rest for 30 minutes . Then , close the oven and bake 30 to 40 minutes more at 300 ° F / 150 ° C. My first pastry chef taught me this , and it always works . Also , over-baking will definitely lead to cracking ( due to the loss of moisture ) , and , as stated , over-mixing will as well .
Gravity is making the petals open . If you look at the shape of the petals their center of gravity is towards the outside of the bowl , but they are being held in place by something underneath . I suspect that it 's simply one piece of chocolate melted onto another . When the custard ( warm or hot ) is poured on it melts the bonds holding the petals in place allowing them to fall .
When I use fresh onions , we store the unused parts for up to a week in our fridge in either a ziploc or a sealable rubbermaid-style container . For particularly pungent onions they go in the crisper drawer to keep the smell from being too strong in the rest of the fridge , but usually they 're just on one of the shelves . <URL> 2-3 days but my personal experience says otherwise . Generally in our house , they do n't last long enough for the flavor to degrade too much , but they will get a little dried and the smell will get stronger over time . After a week , they should n't be bad in the sense that you 'll get sick - but you 'll want to use them in a meal where the onion is the star , as the aroma will take over the dish . Another option that I 'm a big fan of is to dice or strip the leftovers ( or , a 5 lb bag at once ! ) and freeze them on a cookie sheet ( instead of in a bag , where they 'll turn into a giant clump ) . Once fully frozen , dump them into a plastic freezer bag , and store in the freezer for easy access to a handful at a time . For most applications , you can defrost them right in the pan/pot/casserole as you cook , so they 're very handy and accessible . We do the same with peppers in our house for convenience .
The USDA recommends storing hard boiled eggs , whether peeled or not , for 1 week . I personally have kept &amp; eaten them after 2-3 weeks . I have also cracked one open that was no longer edible &amp; believe me - You will know when that happens ! The egg will will smell rotten &amp; you will have no question as to whether or not to eat it ! Some additional Info on storing eggs : Eggs should be stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees F , mainly to reduce the chances that any bacteria on the shell will multiply and cause a risk of illness . Buy refrigerated eggs and store them in the refrigerator as soon as your get home . However , even under refrigeration , eggs slowly lose carbon dioxide , which enlarges the size of the air cell and causes the yolk to flatten and the white to spread . Fresh Egg - Refrigerated raw shell eggs will keep without significant quality loss for about 4 - 5 weeks beyond the " sell by " date or about 3 weeks after you bring them home . Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days Fresh egg yolks ( unbroken and covered with water ) - 2 to 4 days Deviled eggs - 2 to 3 days Leftover egg dishes - 3 to 4 days

Blowing out happens because the extra expansion of the bread in the oven , called oven spring , expands further than the skin of the bread can accommodate . The protein sheets that make up risen bread can toughen when they dry out . When the bread is introduced to the sudden high heat of the oven the water and alcohol vaporizes , filling the loaf with gas . If the outer gluten sheets were allowed to toughen or if the spring is just to great then the sheets have to tear to make room . The tear will happen wherever the sheets are weakest . This seems to be usually in the ugliest spot possible for a blowout . It would be possible to reduce the spring by baking at a lower temperature but the spring is desirable and results in a lighter texture . The solution must come , therefore , in softening the gluten or controlling the expansion . Fat softens bread so this problem happens mostly with lean doughs . One possible solution for some breads is to increase the amount of fat in the dough . Keeping the surface of the dough moist will also help . Keep the dough covered while it is proofing and spraying it with water when it goes in the oven , and , if possible , having a humid environment in the oven will keep the proteins from drying out . The traditional solution with lean doughs is to allow the blowout to occur but control the direction . In this way the loaf can be both light and attractive . Slashing the surface of the loaf releases some of the pressure and allows the baker to have some control over the direction of expansion .
According to the <URL> ( emphasis added ) : Freezing is the easiest way to preserve pumpkin , and it yields the best quality product . Select full-colored mature pumpkin with fine texture ( not stringy or dry ) . Wash , cut into cooking-size sections and remove seeds . Cook until soft in boiling water , in steam , in a pressure cooker , or in an oven . Remove pulp from rind and mash . To cool , place pan containing pumpkin in cold water and stir occasionally ( So Easy to Preserve , 2006 ) . Pack into rigid containers leaving headspace , and freeze . They offer suggest a variety of cooking methods before freezing the flesh of the pumpkin , but you may find that roasting offers the least work and best flavor development . Pressure canning of cubed ( but not mashed or pureed ) pumpkin is also possible ( as pumpkin is a low acid fruit , boiling water canning is not appropriate ) . You should use only a <URL> if you choose to go this route . You can also make <URL> , although this does not to leave the pumpkin suitable for many recipes , and is only suitable if this the actual product you desire .
Getting the Vanilla from the bean to the taste bud takes time . While many will advocate the use of fresh vanilla beans ( as you have tried ) , I have always preferred the flavor that is granted from a good vanilla extract .

How to create the best veg noodles ?
Your main sources of flavour in any Chinese-style noodle dish will be : Garlic Ginger Chilli Spring Onion/Scallion Soy sauce Oyster sauce Rice wine / dry sherry Sesame oil Sesame oil has a very distinctive ' Chinese ' flavour . It is very strong so you only need a little . You should not use it for frying - think of it more like a seasoning . Add a teaspoon or so at the end of cooking and stir through .
In general , you can roast peppers to develop a richer flavor . Then skin the pepper and you can use it for salsas , sauces , or just slice/dice it up for a sandwich .
Yes , you should store them in a air-tight jar , and the best is to store the jar in a cool place in the house . The fridge is to moist for storing cupcakes . You can store them in the jar for about 3-4 days , but they wo n't taste fresh any more . So I would suggest if you want to store them longer then 1 or maybe 2 days , freeze them right after they cooled down from baking . If you use a topping , you can top your cupcakes when they are thawed .
It 's actually pretty straight forward and fairly easy to do . Build a fire . You are building a cooking fire , not a warm hands and look pretty fire . I use a <URL> . Wait for it to burn down so there are plenty of white coals . You do n't want lots of " fire " . Fire is pretty to look at , but more unpredictable to cook in then hot white coals . While the fire is burning down , wash and prep your potatoes to bake as you would normally . Wrap them tightly in tin foil . Once the fire is burned down to hot , white coals , toss the potatoes directly onto the coals . Wait until cooked ( roughly 40 minutes for an average sized potato , on an average fire , adjust accordingly ) . If you have a shovel or something , put some coals on to the actual potato as well , so you 're completely surrounding it . It 'll speed it up . If you do n't have anything handy to handle coals , make sure you flip them half way . Remove carefully and enjoy . The moisture of a potato , will allow it to cook without burning . Just make sure you wrap them with no exposed areas , in order to trap the steam .

Crack soaked nuts with a nutcracker . Place the nut in the grip of the nutcracker so that the seam of the shell is subjected to the direct force . Use minimum force necessary to split the shell when squeezing , in order to avoid crushing the nut kernel inside . Rotate the nut while squeezing so the shell cracks slowly . Extract the kernel from the shell . Allow the kernels of soaked nuts to dry for a few hours after cracking . Read more : How to Crack Nuts | eHow.com <URL>
You need to strain the stock and cool it until it 's 40 degrees F. or below before you refrigerate it . Leaving it to cool overnight on the stove is going to create a bacteria cesspool . The temperature danger zone is between 40 and 140 degrees . This is the range that is prime for the growth of bacteria . Food safety guidelines require that it cool to 70 degrees or below within 2 hours and then below 40 degrees within another 4 hours time . Total maximimum time that it should take to get to 40 degrees is 6 hours . Even if you get it cooled down now with all of the vegetbles and bones in it , the problem will be that you have to heat it back up in the morning to strain it as it 's going to gelatinze overnight ( provided it 's been cooked long enough to extract a good amount of gelatin - usually about 4-6 hours for a good chicken stock and 12-16 hours for veal/beef stock ) . When it 's reheated you 're running the risk that the carrots and other vegetables will break up into smaller bits and end up clouding the stock . Strain it and cool it down tonight before putting in the refrigerator . To cool quickly , either divide amongst several pans ( greater surface area is better than depth as it will dispel heat quicker ) or if you do n't have a BIG pot of stock , strain it and put it in an ice bath ( water and ice cubes ) in your plugged kitchen sink . If you make stock a lot , you can save plastic milk jugs and fill them 3/4 with water and keep in the freezer . After straining the stock you can place one of those inside the pot of stock to also help cool it from the inside out . In the morning you can then skim the layer of congealed fat from the top . If it 's chicken stock , save the fat for frying potatoes with extra flavor !
The two main issues with ground coffee are : The coffee losing its aroma . The aroma/flavor of coffee is quite volatile , and will evaporate very easily . The solution to this is an airtight container , with as little head room in it as possible . The coffee soaking up moisture from the air . This makes the coffee ... unpleasant . The best solution I 've found ( in a hot humid climate ) is to put it in the freezer . It is the nature of refrigeration to leech all of the moisture from the freezer compartment . In summary , the best I 've found is a small airtight box in the freezer .
It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic , it will rot quicker , so I wrap it in paper towels , then bag it ( but not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . For whole heads of lettuce ( iceburg , butter , red leaf , etc ) , I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels , then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer 's market . I then pull off leaves as I need it , and re-wrap it . It stores for well over a week this way . For mescalin mixes , arugula , or other individual leaves , I 'll wash them , dry them , then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on , then roll up the whole thing , and bag the roll ( again , not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . I can probably get a week out of it this way . ( all times assume you 're not buying from a store where it 's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it ; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer 's market ) So , to answer the specific questions : keep the bag open ; you do n't want moisture to condense inside the bag , as it 'll make the lettuce rot faster . I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole . If you 're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days , it probably does n't matter , and for loose lettuce , I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway . You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged , but damp will lead to it rotting faster .
Cut the sprout end off . Place the cut end on the board , slice the onion in half vertically ( i.e. place your knife on the root and cut down ) If the outer skin layer is nice and thick , pull it off from one corner . Repeat on other half . If the outer skin is papery , pull it and one layer of onion flesh off from one corner . Repeat on other half . If the first layer of onion flesh is slightly dimpled or has a kind of matte finish , it 's probably turning ' skinny ' . Strip that off too .
Marbling From my experience working in butcher shops , you want to first look for good marbling ( unless you are on a low fat diet ) . To illustrate : I prefer personally anywhere between No. 5 and No. 8 . No. 9 and up I find a bit excessive , though some people like it that way . I have had some below No. 5 and they were still good , though . Dry-aging From <URL> The process changes beef by two means . Firstly , moisture is evaporated from the muscle . This creates a greater concentration of beef flavor and taste . Secondly , the beef 's natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscle , which leads to more tender beef . Some higher-end butcher shops will dry-age their own beef ( at considerable expense ) but if you do n't have a shop nearby that does that , you can also <URL> . Other things I would recommend not to marinate fillet mignon and season it only lightly . If you plan on wrapping it in bacon , as many do , if you wrap it a day or even a few hours ahead of time the meat will absorb more of the smokiness of the bacon .
" Sea Salt ice cream " is the one I 've heard about . It 's literally flavored by sea salt . Online recipes are often themed around the game series Kingdom Hearts , in which a main character enjoys this treat . That ought to be enough to help your search :)
It is not only sane , it is safer than any other packaging you can make . At least here in Germany , meat from the supermarket is not just wrapped in celophane , the celophane is glued to the tray . The packaging is air-proof . And the air inside the packaging is not normal air , it is a mostly sterile atmosphere with a composition different from normal air , which hampers bacterial growth ( I think it has lowered oxygen content , but I 'm not absolutely sure on that detail ) . This means that 1 . no bacterial contamination is possible after the meat has left the packaging plant , and 2 . the bacteria already present in the meat when it was packed grow slower than normal . So if this is your type of package , do yourself a favor and leave the meat in it . I have n't frozen such packages , so I do n't know how big a problem they have with freezer burn . But it may become a problem in the long term , as the moisture from the meat will sublimate on the inside of the celophane . If this is not the type of package you get , and you have just plain clingy film wrapped around meat and a styrofoam tray ( I 've seen other products wrapped this way , but not meat ) , there is still no problem to freeze in it . The pad full of meat juices ( this is not blood btw ) is a good feeding place for bacteria , but the meat itself is as least as good as the pad , so you wo n't be reducing the risk if you remove it . By leaving the meat in the original package , you reduce the risk of additional bacterial contamination during transfer . And no other container will offer better food safety . You can still consider a transfer for reasons other than food safety . First , you can portion and/or preshape the ground meat before freezing , and then you 'll have to repackage it . Second , if the package is not tight enough , you risk freezer burn . But if these do n't apply , it is probably best to leave it in the original container - this is convenient , and not dangerous at all .
What I do is use a big plastic bowl . The bowl is about 18 " in diameter at the top and holds about 2 gallons of water . I fill the bowl about 1/2 to 2/3 full of blueberries and then fill it to the brim with water and leave the water running into it . As the bowl is filling and when it 's full I gently agitate the berries with my hands . Most of the chaff naturally floats to the top and spills over the edge of the bowl . As I agitate the berries , I also try to direct any leaves to the edge and pull any berries back from the edge . I lose a few good berries , but not too many and since I 'm dealing with a lot of them I do n't worry about it too much . As I 'm agitating the berries , I can feel a lot of the squishy ones and pull them out to look at them and discard if they 're too far gone . When most of the chaff is gone , I dump the berries into a colander and let them drain . I 've tried spinning them in a salad spinner , but for the amount of berries I 'm trying to process , I 've found that in order to remove any appreciable amount of water I can only put a small amount at a time in the spinner so it takes forever to spin them all . So I let them drain , and then since I 'm usually freezing these berries , I put some paper towels down on a tray and spread out a layer of berries . When they 're spread out I can pick out most of the squished or shriveled ones that I missed earlier , then I pull the paper towels out and freeze them . I have n't ever looked for one , but I 've always wondered if there 's such a thing as a colander or sieve or screen with really big holes - i.e. just slightly smaller than a blueberry - that I could just dump the berries into and rinse off all the debris . One big limitation to this technique is that it bogs down if you 're dealing with less than fresh berries . Picking out all the squished or moldy ones if they 've been sitting around too long is problematic .
The oil will always separate from the rest of the product . ( home made or natural/bio peanut butter will behave the same way ) When that happens , just spend some time and elbow grease to mix it back together again . if the tahini was stored in the fridge , it might take longer because everything will be harder . Just leave it on the counter for a while until it gets to room temperature before mixing it back together . ( after googling ) People suggest to keep the jar upside down and when you want to use it , just put it back straight and let it stand for a while , it will mix itself ( a little bit ) together again .
It 's a little hard to understand exactly what you 're asking , but flavor and fragrance scientists have been at this for a long time , and yes , there are people who specialize in flavor research , using methods like " collecting headspace " ( gathering flavor compounds ) and analyzing those with techniques such as gas chromatography . They work to figure out what the " most relevant " compounds are in a particular food . Seasoned professionals are usually able to recognize and name specific flavor compounds by smell . But with a few exceptions , most of those chemicals are n't super easy to just buy off of a shelf somewhere without consulting with IFF or a similar company . ( You can buy artificial vanilla , for example , and methyl anthranilate , the dominant flavor from concord grapes used in artificial grape flavoring , as a bird repellant ) . So for most of us without labs for fermenting synbio vanilla , we will find it more cost effective to use the original ingredient . Most foods have hundreds of distinct flavor compounds and fooling the tongue , and especially the nose , is n't super easy . But it can be done in some cases , sure . It 's worth noting that a great portion of how we experience flavor comes from texture in addition to the flavor compounds , however . Even when you buy a flavored chip that is meant to taste like steak or mango salsa or whatever , you 'll often find it a bit off , perhaps the food industry 's equivalent of the " uncanny valley " problem , thanks to texture and context differences .
That 's the same method I would use . If you have a salad spinner you could try giving them a gentle spin in there first . They are sturdy enough ( unless they 're over-ripe ) that they should handle a gentle pass through it .
Recipes As far as salsa recipes go , they 're all over the web . Check sites like <URL> or <URL> - - or <URL> ! Shelf Life Refrigerator . With regard to shelf life , according to <URL> , you 're only going to get 5-7 days out of fresh salsa in the refrigerator . Freezer . The same source says you can keep it for 1-2 months in the freezer . Use containers meant for storing frozen foods ( they make plastic lidded containers for this very purpose ) , and leave " headspace " in the container ( room for expansion as the liquid freezes ) . If you opt for freezing , you can use any recipe you 'd like . Food safety wo n't be an issue so much as quality would . For example , I would not recommend freezing a <URL> , though it 's great fresh . Canning . You also could pressure can your salsa . <URL> is the best resource to learn to can . If you opt for canning , be sure to follow a trusted canning recipe - you ca n't just can any old recipe . I would use one off the National Center 's site . Cost Comparison It all depends on what you make and the price of your ingredients , of course . If I can get cheap salsa at cost X and expensive , tasty salsa and cost 2X , my goal in making my own is to achieve great taste at a cost less than 2X . My homemade blueberry jam costs me about $ 2 per jar , much more expensive than generic jam ; however , good blueberry jam is about $ 5 at the store . Incidentally , I 'll be making salsa this summer once I can get lots of cheap tomatoes . Keep an eye on jessica.mcrackan.com late in the summer if you 'd like some real examples and cost comparisons .
Honey should be stored at 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit Honey is similar in to olive oil and should be storaged between 50-70 Degrees Fahrenheit according to <URL> : Similar to olive oil , honey should be stored at a cool temperature between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit . So , it 's best to store it away from your oven or stove . Also , it should not be refrigerated . Extreme changes in temperature will spoil the flavor of honey . Looks like this confirms that you may want to keep it in a cool place and away from hot temperature where it would cause honey to degrade in quality . <URL> continues : Remember Do not store honey in a refrigerator or near a stove or oven .

Fine mesh sieve is the usual way , but the way you describe it , yours is not fine enough . Look in professional stores for a " chinois " , this is the kind of sieve you need . But yes , it will take a long time . In classic restaurants , the stock will be cleared before going through the chinois . This is done by floating a rack of eggwhite which bounds the stray proteins . It is at least as slow as the cheesecloth , but more nerve wracking , because you have to do it manually , and it is rather finicky and can easily go wrong . I remember reading about a modern trick of clearing which used gelatine and freezing the stock without a mesh or a rack , but do n't know any more what it was . Maybe somebody else has read it and can supply the details . Edit I returned home and looked the freezing method up ; it is listed in the book " Cooking for geeks " . It contains the sentence As the water in the stock freezes , it will push the impurities into the gelatin The book also has pictures . They show that you do n't end up with fine protein sediment clogging your sieve and finest slit in the stock . The first picture shows the drip-freeze filtered stock compared to the same stock filtered at 100 microns , the difference is large . The second picture shows that after the procedure , what stays in the sieve are cohesive pieces of gelatine with the particles trapped inside , not a film of the scum . So it seems that there is a reason for freezing first . For home use , I just do n't bother clearing my stock , I just use a tea sieve to remove the worst of the protein . When simmered without allowing it to boil , this produces reasonably good stock without all the fuss .
The method I used in the past ( which might not be the best way ) is to lightly fry the food initially , drain it of all oils , and put it in the refridgerator until it is almost time to serve the large amount of food . Then you can finish deep frying the batches . The initial frying will dramatically reduce the time it takes to refry each batch . I found this was the best solution for myself as I was able to serve hot and ( almost ) fresh out of the deep fryer food to a large group of people at lot faster . I think the result is way better than if you had to store the fully deep fried food for 2 hours and had to reheat it up somehow .

Is it safe to eat a pork loin that has been refrigerated for 6 days ?
I once left a whole New York strip in the walk in cooler for two weeks and it was great . Chances are that the salt and acid in the marinade preserved the pork well enough it would still be safe to eat after six days . I would check for slime and foul odor . There are several other factors involved such as how it was handled before put in the refrigerator . For example , a piece of pork that was at room temp for one hour with a semi sterile knife trimming it might not last three days . I always go with whether it has an off odor or not . I find that meat which has aged a little in the fridge will have a more robust defined flavor . If you run your finger across it and feel any type of slime just get rid of it .
Gorgonzola , like any other blue cheese , is supposed to have mold . It should have blue mold radiating from " veins " through the middle , like so : Normally this pre-existing mold actually helps prevent other molds from growing , but if you see more than one type of mold ( especially a different colour like green or black ) , then you should throw it out , because it is a soft cheese . If it 's just the blue , it 's perfectly fine and expected .
A metal pan will not crack simply from cold liquid . If you heat it up to a very high temperature and submerge it in cold water , that 's not such a good idea . But deglazing is just a tiny amount of liquid . Now , aluminum is another story - if it 's hot enough and you pour cold water ( or cold anything ) on it , it can warp , even with a relatively small amount of liquid . And for Teflon and other " coated " cookware , you can ruin the coating that way . But heavier steel or cast iron - no way . If you 're really concerned , just keep the deglazing liquid at room temperature . Deglazing is usually done with vinegar and you keep that at room temperature anyway , right ? I deglaze my CI all the time with cider vinegar and have never experienced even the tiniest crack in 10 years . I 'm pretty sure it 's safe . It 's great , actually ; CI deglazes very easily , you just need a small splash of vinegar .
Are you using non-stick cookware ? Beware because there is a well-documented medical effect caused by the fumes released when various non-stick components are heated starting at about 300 ° F ( 149 ° C ) and beyond . <URL> You should always have something in a non-stick pan when it is over a flame .
OK - for my bona fides , I 'm a microbiologist and have made a career of quality control in food processing including meat processing so I know what I am talking about . There are two kinds of smoked pork chops , cold smoked and hot smoked . Cold smoked pork chops are n't heat processed , so they are n't cooked . They have the redder color and the more resilient , moister feel of raw meat . You are only apt to run into them in specialty meat markets or at small local butchers . These need to be cooked to 145F to be safe and palatable to eat . What you find in the grocery store and most meat markets is almost always hot smoked . It is heated during the smoking process and is fully cooked , just like a smoked ham . It looks and feels to the touch liked cooked meat . That sounds like what you have . If you are n't sure ask the butcher or meat department manager . They should know . If they do n't , buy your meat elsewhere . Having said all that , it is common to find the smoked pork chops in the meat case right alongside the raw pork . Being exposed to raw meat undoes the kill step the heat of cooking does to foodbourne microorganisms . Salmonella , e.coli and other organisms are easily transferred from utensils , trays and workers hands back onto the cooked meat . This could be done in the meat case , or in wrapped product it could happen in the back room where the chops are cut up and wrapped . Organisms that find their way onto the meat quickly grow and spread over the meat 's surface and may find their way into the interior of the cut through any break in its surface . Unless you are certain it has been factory wrapped , sealed and labelled rather than in the store you should treat it as raw meat and heat it to 145F before serving . At the least be sure the surface of the meat has been seared before serving . I just do n't trust the expertise and commitment to providing safe foods you are apt to find in a grocery store or butcher shop . On the other hand , if it looks like it came from a factory already sealed in plastic wrap I would feel certain it was processed on a line that only processes cooked meat and is promptly sealed . I would have no qualms about eating it cold right out of the package .
Actually , I think " the Internet " is wrong on this one , assuming that we are talking about proper caramel sauce . In most of candy making , you are very careful of crystalization . You are working with a supersaturated sugar solution , and it is looking for the slightest excuse to precipitate . Stirring will clump the sugar out of the solution into crystals . Some candy types need to be perfectly smooth , while others ( like fudge ) get their characteristic texture from careful management of crystal size . You should n't be stirring there at all . But once you have reached caramelization , you can stir . What you have in the pan is no longer a supersaturated sugar solution , but caramelization products mixed in a less-concentrated sugar solution . In other words , you have caramel , which is a substance quite different from sugar syrup . And it does not clump into crystals . It is amorphous in its structure , not a crystal , and it 's actually got some viscosity ( if you leave a clump a solid caramel around for years , it will flow a few centimeters ) . And you are not just dealing with pure caramel , but with caramel sauce , which also has lots of liquid added in the form of cream . So much liquid would have also prevented the sugar syrup from crystalizing if it had been added earlier . So , to summarize , you should n't stir a sugar solution during candy making , but you can stir both caramel and caramel sauce . It seems that somebody learned the rule about hot sugar solutions and decided that it applies in all kinds of candy making , without exceptions . But in fact , it does n't apply to caramel sauce .
Here is how you can find out further if your ginger has gone bad in the fridge : extra moist skin will peel off easily when touched and texture is slimy obvious blackish , dark yellowish skin aroma is no longer the fresh one , but rather a ginger aroma covered by a sharp unpleasant earthy smell/mixed smell . You can notice it 's going/gone bad . You may cut it in half and check the inside still . If it <URL> , then hard-peeling of the skin up to 2-3 mm can still leave you with good piece of ginger . But in order to store this now , you have to slice it , dry and put a zip lock . It can last for about a week . Ginger is a root and there are ways you can store it without even freezing . I have had the luxury to dig a ginger root when needed . However for the recent years we had been storing it either outside , in an indoor soil basket or in the fridge . All are proven methods that many are successfully using . Otherwise I would n't want to blabber ... Keep unpeeled ginger root in an outside rack , e.g. an onion rack , or in a dry place that has proper ventilation . You will see it sprouts and/or dries a bit , but it can last with flesh inside up to a month . You can cut the portion you need and keep it back in this place . This way it does n't get moist or turn into the texture that you encounter usually by storing in the fridge . Make sure the root is not damaged by slugs . Get some soil/sand into a bucket , and bury it in it like how you can store winter veggies . Store it in the fridge by wrapping it with a paper towel or a piece of paper or of thin cloth . Extra moisture will be absorbed by the wrapping .
I do n't think a pork sirloin roast will stand up to that kind of cooking very well . That is a very lean piece of meat , which does not lend itself to long cooking times at low temperatures . That type of cooking is best reserved for cuts of meat with lots of fat and/or connective tissue . If you put a pork sirloin roast in your cooker for 8 hours on low , you 're going to have one tough , dry piece of meat when you are through . You would be better served by cooking it in the oven at higher heat , for a relatively short period of time , like 400F for an hour or so . Bear in mind , you 're not going to get to a fall-apart tender state with a sirloin roast . This is n't a pork butt with which you 're dealing , which you 'd take up to an internal temperature of 195F or more . Rather , you 're going to want to target the safe temperature , and no higher . You want the meat to be juicy . Cut into thinner slices to achieve maximum tenderness .
My italian grandma does it , but says to really make sure they dry out . You can dry them out and then freeze them , if it makes you feel any less hesitant .
Yes , it is perfectly safe ( as long as you continue to thaw the meat in a safe manner , as in the refrigerator ) . The marinade will not begin to have much effect until at least the outer layers of the meat are thawed , but it will not otherwise have any side effect . It may get slightly better penetration due to the changes in the texture of the meat from ice crystals , but the effect should be negligible at best . In fact , you can freeze the meat in its marinade if you so choose , and know what you are going to use it for when you thaw . It will get the benefit of marination time until the outer layers are frozen , and then again during the thawing .
Yes , it certainly is safe to eat them , it happens all the time . They wo n't last quite as long in the fridge as ones which do n't crack , but as long as you eat them in a couple of days you are fine . They may look like nuclear mutants but they will taste the same .
I always used to reach in and grab stuff , but I would always put a piece of tape over the switch first .

-- Hair is a protein mostly <URL> Keratin refers to a family of fibrous structural proteins . Keratin is the key of structural material making up the outer layer of human skin . It is also the key structural component of hair and nails . There 's nothing special about it as a protein , so as long as it does n't wrap around your tonsils and get stuck in your throat , or contain dyes , hairspray etc. it 's safe to eat . However , the long stringy nature of the stuff can cause problems if you eat too much of it .
Yes , those spots are normal , they form as the nattou ages . They are amino acid crystals , and they are perfectly safe . Here 's a picture . They 're a bit crunchy , which you may or may not like . If you do n't like the dots , get young nattou and consume it before the crystals form . If you do like them , get more mature nattou . With younger nattou , you should be able to store it opened in the fridge for a few days before the crystals start to form . As you have experienced though , once they start , they grow quickly .
The only way I know is by adding some more liquid and warming the mixture , It may or may not improve things ... For what its worth , the consistency of the jam after cooking , tends to be related to the amount of sugar added for a given fruit , with hard skinned fruit typically requiring a slightly different process to soft skinned fruit . It 's also controlled by the amount of pectin added to the brew as well as the overall cooking time and temperature .
Sterno is gelled denatured alcohol . It is denatured alcohol ( a combination of methanol and ethanol ) so that you ca n't , safely , drink it , but it is still mostly alcohol , which will dissolve in water and clean up just fine . While I would n't dump a lot of it down the sink , you should have no problem with cleanup . And while Sterno is n't safe to drink , it wo n't be a problem if you touch it in cleaning up . I just double checked the Sterno site and they confirm water cleanup and say , additionally , that it is biodegradable .
Having just returned from Hawaii , I actually have a possible answer for you . There is a type of ginger that you can get there ( though it 's not all that common , far as I could tell ) that 's called blue ginger . It 's just like regular ginger , only it has the blue layer inside as you describe . There was a guy selling it at a roadside fruit stand when we were there . It should be absolutely safe to use . edit : I found a link to somebody talking about it . <URL>
It 's usually safe to eat the skins of potatoes . If there is a greenish tint under the skin , you 'll want to peel down to below the greenish bit . If you do n't , it could lead to solanine poisoning . See <URL> and <URL>
My initial guess was that there may be too much salt for the butter when it is at room temperature . However , 6-10 % salt content is considered ideal with respect to curbing bacterial growth , as well as the retention and preserving the integrity of flavor . I highly doubt that your butter is salted to such a high degree that it would actually Lacking further information , here are a few explanations Precipitant from within , due to high buttermilk content : One purpose of salting is to remove buttermilk . Perhaps you are using a high buttermilk butter , and as <URL> , if the butter was not properly worked relative to salt content you may be seeing either buttermilk or casein precipitant on the surface . Also , the buttermilk may not have been well washed out . Precipitant from within , due to improper salt/water mixology : Salt should be worked into butter around 58 ' F , " theoretically butter containing 15 % of water should be able to dissolve 5.4 % of salt " <URL> . It is possible that ( 1 ) the temperature was not sufficiently high ( i.e. to address addition of sea salt as opposed to table salt ) to turn the salt into solution , or ( 2 ) the carrying capacity of the water was exceeded and salt crystals remained , or ( 3 ) the churning cycles were not sufficiently long to incorporate the crystals . These three things would contribute to higher reactivity in the butter than if it were properly dissolved . See explanation of Mottled Butter below for more info . Precipitant from without , due to non-ideal elements in sea salt : Another explanation is that your sea salt had a high concentration of <URL> . Did you perhaps buy Mottled Butter ; Mottled butter is butter which is Uneven in color This unevenness in color may be due to several different causes . It may be due to specks of curd ( speckled butter ) and it may be due to certain organisms ( dappled butter ) . These causes of mottled butter are not very common in factories where the manufacture of butter is properly carried on . The most common fault of mottled butter is the improper incorporation of salt and the presence of an excessive amount of buttermilk . Mottled butter caused in this way is common ... Whenever there is undissolved granular salt present the moisture is attracted and the color deepened at that particular place <URL> My guess based on the maount of information you gave about the butter ( has sea salt , sweats at room temperature ) is not that anyone of these answers is distinctly responsible , but that it is a confluence of the various factors resulting in a mild mottling ( perhaps imperceptible to the eye or the palate unless you eat the whole block in one go ) that is both attracting moisture from the air , and pressing it out of itself . I am guessing that if you find the liquid problematic ( i.e. does it have a funny taste/smell ? ) you can put it in the fridge and it will stop sweating/weeping . Otherwise , you run the standard risks of fats and proteins stored with a mild curing at room temperature .

Why does fondue sometimes " curdle " and what can I do to prevent it ?
Cheese sauces will curdle more easily if they are not acid enough . I struggled with homemade mac-n-cheese until someone pointed this out to me . The <URL> is one solution to adding acid without undesirable taste .
I 'm going to ignore the actual icing ingredients for a moment here as I suspect they will be mostly icing sugar and a few neglible other things . So you now have roughly 1 cup / 250 ml milk 1.5 eggs 6 tblsp / 60g starch and flour a lot of icing sugar - > The egg means you need a heating step to get that mixture safe . If we ignore the sugar , we are looking at a basic pudding mix , albeit with somewhat skewed proportions . So some minor adjustments are in order : Add another 1-21 cups of milk , stir well . Heat slowly on the stove , stirring constantly until the mixture thickens . You 'll get some version of pastry cream / pudding . It will probably be somewhat floury and very , very sweet , but at least safe and basically edible . Once you have the pudding , you can use it as a base for desserts , cake fillings etc. , mixing with fruit or stretching it with yogurt could tone down the excessive sweetness . You can also use the thick pudding for a <URL> , which means you finally turn your mishap into a frosting again . 1 The math , very rough numbers as I do n't have the exact amounts you used : 1 tbsp starch / flour ~ 10 g For pudding , you 'd use 20 g / 2 tbsp per 250 ml / 1 cup . So if your guestimate is correct , use 3 cups milk in total . For a somewhat thicker pudding , use 30g / 3 tbsp per 250 ml / 1 cup .
Great question . the salt is not there for the taste of salt . A pinch of salt helps with the ionization process so your taste buds can pick up the tsate of the chocolate , ice cream , etc , better . I think this was discussed in an episode of Alton Brown 's Good Eats as well .

You are trying to add the yoghurt at too high a temperature . Let the dish cool to around 75 deg C before adding the yoghurt , and make adding the yoghurt the last thing you do before serving .
I used the method here before with good success : <URL> Basically you start with the eggs in the pan with cold water and bring the water to temperature , right when it reaches boiling you pull the heat back and let the eggs cook for 10 minutes . You do n't need a full on boil to hard boil the eggs .
It has been said : Better safe than sorry . You have n't measured the absolute sugar or acidity levels . Freezing it will do no harm . -- <URL> <URL> I 'm definitely not an expert with baking , but I 've worked with fruits in other contexts . The only time I would be worried about freezing would be if I added oil , like for a marinade or such . In your context I think freezing is fine , and sounds like it would be a convenient way to make larger batches to reuse throughout the year . PS : That puree sounds awesome , I might have to try that to marinate some chicken or pork chops !
It does n't compare at all - broiling is the US term for what is called grilling in UK . The heat source is above the food . In the US , a " grill " is used to mean a " gas powered barbeque " , as the Brits would say . The heat source is below the food .
If your jam has at least 1:1 ratio ( 1 kg of sugar per kg of fruit ) or more , you do not have to can it . Then it is so overwhelmingly sweet that bacteria can not live in it . If the jam has less sugar ( 1:2 are popular , 1:3 are found sometimes ) , then you have to either can it , or keep it in the fridge and consume it within a few days , similar to any other cooked food . Else , you are colonizing bacteria in your jam , and at some point , some of them will happen to be pathogenic and cause some unpleasant disease in whoever eats the jam . Canning is a process in which the jam is closed against any new bacteria ( that 's why you have to close the jar hermetically ) and then heated enough that most old bacteria are killed . After canning , you can keep the closed jars at room temperature without any new bacteria developing .
In a word : Science ! The <URL> of an egg contains a large number of complex <URL> , which are large molecules composed of chains of <URL> . The specific combinations and ordering of those amino acids cause the proteins to fold up on themselves into complex structures , which in turn <URL> . The bonds which interact between amino acids and fold the protein in a specific way are fairly delicate , and they can be " denatured " or disrupted by the application of heat , salt , or acid , which changes the shape of the protein . The bonds can also reconnect to other , different bonds when the protein is in its new shape . So , when you heat an egg yolk , the proteins eventually change shape and bind to each other in a specific way that causes the physical changes we refer to as " curdling " . <URL> . This can be avoided when the yolks are heated gently because it takes a certain amount of heat to completely denature the proteins , and it takes a number of unfolded proteins interacting to bind into a new " curdled " configuration . When you heat gently , you 're giving the heat enough time to dissipate throughout the food , so that it does n't exceed that temperature in any given spot and there are n't lots of fully denatured proteins all in the same place . The proteins may still be changing shape , but they have n't reached the shape or concentration where they can bind together and curdle . Which is good , because when they do bind together , those bonds are stronger than the bonds that originally folded the proteins . At that point they 're permanently curdled and no amount of cooling will un-bind them and allow the proteins to re-fold on their own . ( EDIT : ironically , I stumbled on <URL> today which describes how some scientists have managed to do just that with certain egg enzymes . Weird ! ) The final configuration can also be mediated by other proteins , sugars , etc. in the food . For example , in scrambled eggs the proteins in the whites and yolks combined set differently than either of them do separately . The cooking process can also be done gradually enough to produce a smooth texture even if the proteins are completely denatured . For example , in <URL> egg yolks work together with liquid butter to form a smooth emulsion ; even though many of the yolk proteins may be denatured , they ca n't fully set into a curdled matrix because the butter proteins , fats , etc. are also present . A bit more detail on how to prevent curdling in specific culinary applications can be found <URL> .
Regardless of type , all chocolate should be stored in a cool and low humidity ( dry ) place away from direct sunlight . It would be best to seal it in an air-tight container , because , as ElendiTheTall said , the cocoa butter in it will absorb flavors . Dark chocolate will last for years . Milk and white chocolate will last for a much shorter time ( a few months ) , because of their milk content . Improperly stored chocolate will develop bloom , which shows as a white or grey streaking or spotting on the surface . The spotting or streaking is cocoa butter fat separating and is a sign that the chocolate 's temper has been lost . This kind of chocolate is still suitable for any application where the chocolate will be fully melted ( most baking ) . It can even be used as the base ( non-seed ) chocolate for tempering with the seeding method , but it should not be used for other candy making .
The purpose of the beer ( and the vinegar ) in this case is to add some of the malty , fermenty flavors typical of longer-fermented or sourdough breads . You can either leave it out and replace it with an equal quantity of water or use a <URL> The carbonation from the beer might add a little extra lift at the start to establish some air cells and work the gluten a bit , but with an 18 hour room-temperature bulk rise , that benefit would be negligible . In most beers ( especially large US commercial bottlers ) there is n't enough active yeast left in the bottle by the time it is drunk to do anything either . The author of the original article ( Cook 's Illustrated # 90 , Jan 2008 ) added the beer and vinegar in order to add flavor to a bread recipe that already produced decent bread . My bread now had tang [ from the vinegar ] , but it lacked complexity . What I needed was a concentrated shot of yeasty flavor . As I racked my brain , I realized that beyond bread , there is another commonly available substance that relies on yeast for flavor : beer .
It is just the root of the coriander plant . Certainly at least here ( UK ) you can buy living coriander plants in the supermarket ; you could pull one out of the pot and use the root from that . Apparently you can also subsitute 2 stems of coriander for every piece of root called for in the recipe , but I 've never tried this .
I went into some detail with this in my answer to <URL> To summarize my points there and add some more ( simplified ) detail on the chemistry : Gluten is responsible for <URL> of dough , which is perceived as chewiness . The difference between bread , quickbread ( muffins/scones ) , and cake is largely due to the difference in gluten formation , with cake having the lowest amount and bread having the highest . It does not directly cause rising - the leavening agent ( yeast , baking powder , etc. ) is responsible for that . What it does do is form a protein network by <URL> , which not only results in the elasticity above but also traps gas and prevents it from escaping during the baking process . The " rising " in baked goods is essentially just stretching of the gluten network . This is why <URL> such as xanthan and guar gum can mimic some of the effects in gluten-free recipes ; although the mechanism is completely different - in essence , they 're creating a very thin gel . Gluten is also exceptionally good at both absorbing and retaining moisture ; it can absorb up to 150 % ( 1.5 times its own weight ) in water . One thing you 'll notice about typical wheat products vs. their gluten-free equivalents is that latter do n't last too long and have to be frozen or consumed quickly . Part of this is due to preservatives in commercial baked goods , but much of it is also simply due to the gluten retarding moisture loss . You can think of it as a kind of natural preservative . It 's activated by water and heat and is ( relatively ) slow-acting , which gives it a high tolerance with respect to time and temperature . This is why many people will tell you that bread is " forgiving " while cake and other low-gluten/gluten-free products are not . When baking without gluten , you will have to be very precise about all of your measurements . Its coagulation action is actually very similar to that of egg whites , and pure gluten ( AKA vital wheat gluten ) is sometimes actually used as a replacement for egg whites . A meringue is just heavily aerated egg whites and specifically protein ; gluten is basically doing the same thing inside of whatever you 're baking . Finally , it provides nutritive protein when eaten . Wheat gluten is about 75 % protein and all-purpose flour is about 10 % gluten . That means 7.5 % of the flour you consume is actually protein . Of course that 's nowhere near what you get from meat , but it 's still a significant contribution to one 's diet . In short : Gluten does a lot of things . Keep in mind when doing gluten-free baking that a lot of the substitutes only replicate one or two of the effects .
You rub the garlic in the pot to gain a subtle garlic flavour . Same idea as rubbing a sliced garlic clove on grilled bread , or on meat prior to cooking . Raw garlic is also moderately antibacterial in nature , so I suppose that could be a reason too .
I finally found the answer to this question : I was in the supermarket yesterday and on a can of lentils the ingredients listed on the side of the tin had the phrase ' firming agent ' in brackets beside the entry for calcium chloride .
When I first got my iSi I had wildly inconsistent results , including exactly what you 're describing . I 'm not sure if you 're just whipping cream or if you 're whipping other cream-based preparations , but the most common reason for this happening is that the liquid going in is n't quite , er , liquid . Any solid particles of any kind will almost assuredly cause sputtering , which is why they recommend that you strain everything through a fine sieve . Other things I 've learned about the iSi whippers to help prevent these inconsistent results : Ignore everything the instructions tell you about how to charge it . They 're somewhere between very misleading and complete nonsense . What I actually do is this : Screw on a charger as described . Shake it vigorously , as if it were a cocktail shaker . Let it rest for a moment , then shake again . Repeat the shaking 4-5 times . Finally , remove the charger and screw the cap back on . The instructions are full of ominous warnings about not being able to discharge it properly if you shake it too much because the nozzle will get blocked or something . Never happened . What 's far more likely is that the cream does n't actually whip fully or there are large air pockets . Do not err on the side of caution here ; many " external " iSi recipes such as those you find in the HRC actually tell you to shake frequently as the dispenser chills . I 'm not sure if I 'd do this with cream ( as opposed to a water-based foam ) but I ca n't stress this enough , do n't skimp on the shaking . If you need to chill it some more after charging , make sure to chill it on its side . The instructions are quite explicit about this and in this case they 're actually correct . Shake it again after you chill it and before you dispense any . This is very important and conspicuously absent from the instructions . You should n't need to shake as much as the first pass , but some of the gas does seem to separate over time . Start by dispensing the cream very , very slowly , until you actually see some come out , then you can apply more pressure as needed . If you squeeze the trigger as hard as you can right off the bat , you 'll just end up depressurizing the thing before any cream has a chance to come out . Every single time I 've pulled too hard , I 've ended up with spatters . Finally , make sure that you actually thoroughly clean it all between uses , including the tiny horizontal hole in the metal tube that you screw the tips onto ( I forget what it 's called ) as well as the socket that piece goes into . Any blockages whatsoever , no matter how small , can cause at least minor sputtering . Hope some of that helps . If you do all of that , you should n't have any sputtering issues . Last 7 or 8 times I 've used mine , I have n't had any .
Ripe pears range from as firm as soft wood ( think balsa ) to as soft as a sponge when ripe , depending on the variety . If your store-bought pears are hard for more than a week , then you bought ones which were picked too young and will never really ripen . This is a common issue with supermarket produce . Ripe apples are generally always firm , even when ripe . Soft apples are generally rotten , except for a few varieties which are primarily meant for cooking into sauce or fillings . This makes it more complicated to tell when they are ripe . Both apples and pears ripen much more slowly when refrigerated . Most fruit will ripen faster when put in an enclosed space with ripening apples , including other apples .
As SAJ14SAJ said , the best solution is to simply not live in a place like that - it can be a bit dangerous . But since you 're there , about the only thing you can do is get a decent fan and use it to direct air out of the kitchen toward rooms with open windows . Depending on the layout ( and the fans ) you may need multiple fans , and might want one of them to be a box fan in the window helping push air out . For things you think may be smoky , you might also consider cooking outside if possible , on a hot plate , a camping stove , or a small grill . ( Or you could just not do them at all . )
This deli meat you speak of is generally made of small scraps of mechanically-separated meat that are essentially " glued " together into a solid mass by enzymes that partially break down the tissue . This processed " meat brick " does n't really have the same texture as an intact muscle tissue , which has individual muscle fibers aligned along a " grain " that makes it pleasantly chewy . Folding/layering/rolling slices of processed meat gives it more of a texture and chew , and tricks you into thinking you 're eating an actual piece of animal muscle instead of meat-flavored jelly .

What does the refrigerator crisper compartment actually do ?
The crisper provides a somewhat enclosed environment , which prevents moisture from escaping as rapidly . Vegetables keep best at a certain humidity , higher than that typically found in the rest of the fridge , but not so high that condensation starts accumulating on them . Vegetables kept in too-dry air in the rest of the fridge will tend to dry out and shrivel up faster ; those kept in the crisper will retain their water and texture better , keeping them crisp . Leafy vegetables are also much more prone to drying out , since they have much more surface area , while hardier vegetables with a decent skin on them ( like bell peppers ) do n't dry out nearly as quickly . Fruits benefit somewhat from this as well , but do n't generally need as high a humidity as vegetables . Some crisper drawers have little sliders on them which vary the size of the opening to the rest of the fridge , letting you vary the amount of circulation and therefore the humidity ; you can adjust this to suit what you tend to store in the drawer . If you have two crisper drawers , both adjustable , then it might be a good idea to put fruit and hardier vegetables in one , and more vulnerable vegetables in the other .

Also , by always putting vegetables in the crisper drawer , you can prevent potential cross contamination between foods i.e. , the vegetables can never come in contact with raw meat , because they 're all in their own separate drawer .
More head = less carbonation , which will change the mouth-feel of the drink , albeit largely imperceptibly for most people ( myself included ) . Less carbonation will also change the actual perception of flavour ; it will taste sweeter , mostly .
Sorting means a few things : Remove foreign objects like small stones , other seeds , twigs ... that may have accidentally been packed with the beans . Remove damaged ( think insect damage , for example ) or otherwise shrivelled , infected or moldy beans and loose skins . Hint : Hollow beans and skins float up . Double-check for bug infections . Sometimes there are little hitchhikers , even if you have impeccable hygiene at home . It boils down to making sure you have nothing in the pot that does n't belong in your meal .
To start with , the red , or dark , juice from red meat is not , in fact , blood , which is a common misconception . Most blood is drained from red meat when it is butchered . It is , rather , a protein ( <URL> ) and a lot of water . It is an animal 's levels ( or lack of ) myoglobin , that determine whether it is a ' red ' meat or white . As for its safety after being frozen , this is discussed further <URL> . Beef stored in the refrigerator for more than 5 days will start to turn brown due to chemical changes in the myoglobin . This does n't necessarily mean it has gone bad , though with this length of unfrozen storage , it may have . Best to use your nose to tell for sure , not your eyes As your venison was frozen , rather than just refrigerated , as mentioned above , I would say you are more than safe to do a nose test , as recommended above .
Deglazing removes caramelized bits ( the " browned " bits ) from the bottom of your pan or skillet after cooking meats or vegetables . It is usually accomplished by putting stock , sauce , wine , or even water ( or really any liquid ) in the pan over heat after the pan has been emptied of whatever was cooked into it and any rendered fat and scraping the browned bits into that sauce with a spatula . The browned bits dissolve into your liquid to create an excellent sauce for whatever you just cooked in the pan .
In all cheese making and especially with young cheeses like cream cheese , fat adds a lot to the flavor and texture . You can skim off extra fat but your cheese will be thinner and less richly flavored . Shaking the cream in wo n't help if you are using a fermented method ( as opposed to using boiling and acid to curdle the milk ) because it will separate out again during the fermentation . Your thickened , fermented milk will be richer on top where the cream rose . It will mix back in when you drain the cheese and form it .
I suspect it means " ditto ( the above line ) " : <URL> seems to indicate that " do . " was an old way of abbreviating before the ditto mark ( " ) became widespread .
( Storage note : do not wash the bulbs before storing them ; place in plastic bag in the refrigerator . Wash just before using . ) Young kohlrabi is great raw . Peel first , then add to salads ( sliced or grated ) serve as part of a veggie platter w / dip grate it and add to slaw ( but after grating it , put some salt on it &amp; let it sit , then squeeze the water out of it ) puree it - here 's someone who really loves it pureed : <URL> Cooked kohlrabi can be steamed or boiled . Remove the skin after cooking . You can eat the leaves , if they are still firm and green ; use them within a couple of days . Wash the leaves &amp; remove the tough stem parts ( ribs ) . Blanch in boiling water for a couple of minutes , drain , chop , and serve with a bit of butter , salt , and pepper . A little vinegar or lemon juice is good on them , too .
One day on the counter at room temperature is approximately equivalent to a week in the refrigerator . When I used eggs at a rapid rate , baking every day , I always kept them on the counter , since they would not have to be brought to room temperature to beat easily to the ribbon or whatever . They should be good in the refrigerator for several weeks past their sell by date , or on the counter for several days . 6 hours is fine . ( All of the above is assuming they are in their shells , uncracked ... ) Out of the shell , eggs are highly perishable -- what the health codes call a " potentially hazardous " food . Do n't hold them for any length of time at room temperature . I would say no more than 30 minutes to an hour , less if you can . <URL> , but they do insist that the eggs are refrigerated .
Generally with baking you mix all the wet ingredients , then all the dry , then incorporate the latter into the former . This prevents clumping and helps make sure everything is mixed uniformly . In some recipes , adding the eggs ( often un par un , or one by one ) also contributes ( via the yolk 's supply of lecithin ) to emulsifying e.g. butter and milk together . The best way to find out , of course , is to experiment . Next time you 're making these cookies , make a double batch . Do one according to the recipe , and the other your way . Honestly with cookies I doubt you 'll see much difference ; they 're basically foolproof ( I have , when in a hurry , made chocolate chip cookies by dumping everything in the mixer , whacking it about with the paddle attachment , and then folding in the actual chips . Worked fine , basically ) . When it comes to baking things that are more finicky -- cakes etc -- I would follow the recipe directions .
Figs are <URL> that is , they will continue to ripen after being picked from the tree ( because they will start releasing ehtylene ) . However , contrary to other climateric fruits ( such as bananas ) this only works if the fruit is picked in the later stage of its developement . From : <URL> - Owino et al. , Plant Physiol Biochem . - 2006 The fig is a climacteric fruit and treatment with ethylene in the later part of stage II stimulates growth , accelerates the onset of the rise in respiration , induces ethylene production and promotes ripening . A typical respiration climacteric is not displayed by fruit harvested before the natural initiation of ripening on the tree . However fruit in which ripening had been initiated on the tree gave a normal climacteric rise and ripened fully after detachment from the tree . Thus in many aspects the fig behaves as a typical climacteric fruit , but as a result of its growth pattern , the ethylene production preceding ripening occur during a phase of active cell expansion . What many people suggest , is to put some olive oil on the eye of the fig . I have never done it , but apparently you only need a very small amount around the eye to hasten ripening . Here are two links to forums explaining this fig-oiling technique <URL> , <URL> Apparently this will speed up a lot the ripening of the fruits ( although some people seem to report they are less sweet ) . This works because olive oil will increase the release of ethylene from figs . From the same paper I cited above : It has been known since the 3rd Century BC that a drop of olive oil applied to the ostiole ( a process termed as Oleification ) of the fig fruit stimulates growth and leads to uniform ripening of fruits . The application of several vegetable oils such as rape seed oil , sesame oil , soybean oil , camellia oil and linseed oil also had similar effects as the olive oil whereas animal oil stimulated fruit ripening but the effect was less than that of the vegetable oils . It was also observed that refined olive oil was more effective in accelerating maturation of the fig fruit as compared to unrefined olive oil or other vegetable oils . [ ... ] A transient induction of ethylene was observed in fruit treated with olive oil , with ethylene production increasing a day after treatment and later declining
Your best bet is probably a specialty product intended to wrap chese -- that is , cheese paper . Cook 's Illustrated <URL> that ( for cheese in general ) , wrapping the cheese first in wax or parchment paper , then over-wrapped loosely with aluminum foil performs better than either alone , and almost as well as cheese paper . They report that the wax paper-aluminum foil wrap kept brie and cheddar almost as good as new for over a month . They also found that plastic ( either bags or wrap ) developed mold before any of the other methods . ( Unfortunately , unless you have a Cook 's Illustrated online subscription , you wo n't be able to see that link . )
Advantages of glass : you can see the product ... the container does not pick up any flavor or color from the product ... other than that , in this case ( refrigerator pickle ) there is no reason not to use your plastic . In fact , the only reason to use glass , that I can think of , is if you we going to can your pickles for extended shelf life . Then , of course , would would need Mason jars or equivalent . Fermenting , does n't have much to do with this question either . I often store homemade sauerkraut and kimchee in plastic quart containers without issue .
Cheese sauces will curdle more easily if they are not acid enough . I struggled with homemade mac-n-cheese until someone pointed this out to me . The <URL> is one solution to adding acid without undesirable taste .
Marinades and Rubs are " surface treatments " only , they do not penetrate deeply into the meat . A brine is a deep treatment , which does penetrate by way of osmosis . For a quick explanation of this see <URL>
You can indeed do what you ask - baking on the pizza stone with a steam pan . It works better to pour hot water directly in the pan when you put the bread in though , rather than just leaving water in the pan . You get a burst of steam and then a consistent small amount . It 's a method that Peter Reinhart advocates . The other common option - especially with high hydration doughs - is to bake it in a covered dutch oven for the first half . This approximates some of the effect of the earthen/stoneware . The steam from the bread itself keeps the environment moist . You certainly do n't need those pots for fantastic bread . Tonights loaf - no earthenware ;) ( I rushed it for dinner , so the crumb is n't what it could be . )
One method I found over time : Chop it into tiny pieces and stir fry it with bacon and onions ( also chopped up ) . Once that 's soft , leave it to cool , then mix it in meatballs in a 50:50 ratio . If some eggs and breadcrumbs are added a fine meatball is made that tastes a bit sweeter and veggy and is healthier . :)
It depends on what type of lettuce it is -- part of the issue is that if the lettuce is touching plastic , it will rot quicker , so I wrap it in paper towels , then bag it ( but not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . For whole heads of lettuce ( iceburg , butter , red leaf , etc ) , I just wrap the whole thing in dry paper towels , then shove it back into the bag from the grocery store or farmer 's market . I then pull off leaves as I need it , and re-wrap it . It stores for well over a week this way . For mescalin mixes , arugula , or other individual leaves , I 'll wash them , dry them , then unroll enough paper towels to spread the leaves on , then roll up the whole thing , and bag the roll ( again , not sealed ) , and keep it in my crisper . I can probably get a week out of it this way . ( all times assume you 're not buying from a store where it 's been sitting on the shelf too long before you buy it ; I get my lettuce when I can from the local farmer 's market ) So , to answer the specific questions : keep the bag open ; you do n't want moisture to condense inside the bag , as it 'll make the lettuce rot faster . I get better storage time with heads of letuce keeping them whole . If you 're going to be eating it all within 2-3 days , it probably does n't matter , and for loose lettuce , I find it more convenient to wash it as I re-pack it anyway . You never want to store lettuce wet ... you might be able to store it completely submerged , but damp will lead to it rotting faster .
9 bar is the " standard " , not 15 . This number has been reached after lots of trial/error with other pressures , and is accepted as standard by <URL> and <URL> associations and guilds . Some guys have even made <URL> . Professional ( also called commercial ) machines can give much more pressure , but control automatically not to give more . They kind of pumps they use are called rotary pump , and due to their construction , the flow rate is independent of the pressure ( which will remain quite constant ) . Home machines employ the cheaper vibratory pumps . In them , the pressure is indirectly proportional to the flow . To try to have a more constant pressure , and to make it independent of the flow rate , they are added overpressure valves . But they need to have pumps that give more than 9 bar , to assure that those 9 bars will get to the basket in the portafilter . You can see <URL> . So , when manufacturers advertise their vibratory pump machines having 15 or more bars of pressure , they are just doing marketing using the not always true motto " the more the better " .

Substituting butter for oil : Does it matter for baked goods ?
Butter is at most 82 % oil and the rest is water . So , you 're going to need to add more butter for the same amount of oil . Besides , you need to adjust the liquid content accordingly since you are going to have more water than you planned . If you are going to use the same amount of oil , then it will not make any difference other than the taste . Just make sure they are of same state ( i.e. melted butter instead of vegetable oil or vice versa )
No , it 's not worth the bother . Get a few cans of crushed tomatoes and simmer them slowly with whole garlic cloves and some chopped onion for a few hours until it 's thickened ( but not like paste ) . Season and you 're good to go .
Safe ? Or good to eat ? Pesticides usually do n't penetrate thick-skinned produce ( oranges , etc ) , so as long as you 're not using the skin , there 's not a lot to worry about . They 're not the best pumpkins to use for other reasons ( linked in comments ) . In summary , the smaller " sugar " pumpkin is better for cooking , if you have the option .
Transfer of heat . First you need a hot pan ( sprinkle some drops of water on the pan , it should sizzle ) . Then you add a drop of oil and swirl it around . When the oil forms a striated pattern , it 's hot . Then you put the meat in . The hot oil helps to transfer heat from the bottom of the pan to the meat . You only need a spoonful of oil .
I 'm going to assume this is an American recipe , as <URL> . With broiling , the oven only heats the top element in the oven , and you turn the element or burner up as hot as it can get . It 's not a specific temperature , as in most ovens , that would cause it to cycle on &amp; off . ( in fact , when broiling , you typically leave the door open specifically so the oven wo n't heat up so far that it decides to cycle the burner off to cool down ) . It 's about extreme high heat , from a single side . ( top in the US , bottom in the UK and Australia ) You typically need to pay close attention to whatever 's under the broiler , as it can go from golden brown to charred very , very quickly .
Yes , your <URL> contains water - which is perfectly normal . While oil is 100 % fat , butter is only around 80 % 1 fat plus some protein and ca. 15 % water . Regarding your question where the water comes from - If you look at how butter is made , it becomes obvious that the water was there from the beginning : You start with <URL> , which has a natural fat content of ( roughly ) 4 % and almost 90 % water . The <URL> that rises to the top or is separated by centrifuges contains about 1/3 of fat , some protein and still about 60 % water . The other result of this separation is skim milk - with only very little fat left . ( Values vary quite a bit , depending on the process and desired result . ) Churning the cream ( or in some processes , the milk ) further concentrates the fat content in the 80 % fat / 15 % water butter and separating it from the traditional buttermilk , which contains mostly water and proteins . And yes , if you heat the butter , this water will start to boil and sputter , especially if you use a hot pan . Heating the butter on low heat first can somewhat mitigate the effect as it allows the water to evaporate more slowly . If you want a pure fat butter product , you could choose <URL> , which has the water and milk solids removed . 1 This may vary , depending on national laws , customs and quality grades . Between 80 % and 85 % is a good ballpark number .
Especially regarding tomatoes , there can be some discrepancies on what coring means . In some cases , they mean to just scoop out the stem and the tough white bit under it , and in others they mean to remove the whole central bit with seeds . In my experience " cored " usually means just removing the stem and white bit , whereas " cored and seeded " means removing the stem along with the seeds and central part . This is just a rule of thumb , as recipe authors may vary on their usage .
They are just a " product number " , and it may vary for the same kind of pasta from a manufacturer to another .
If you want to turn your cold butter spreadable quickly , patience is about your only option . You can try microwaving it very briefly , and maybe on the " defrost " setting , but you run a strong risk of melting it too much . If I 'm thinking of the same thing you are , a butter conditioner is really just a unit that allows you to keep your butter in the fridge but still keep it closer to room temp -- so that 's more about storage than turning hard butter into spreadable butter on the spot . A storage option that allows you to keep your butter fresh for a pretty long period , but still leave it out on the counter so it 's soft , is a butter bell . You can look them up online -- many shops have them . It 's basically an inverted cup that sits inside a larger one with a little water at the bottom . The butter is packed into the inverted cup and stays put when you place the cup so the edges are under the water in the other cup . The water keeps air out so the butter stays fresh even at room temperature . You could do the same thing by mashing a bunch of butter into a teacup , then setting it upside down in a saucer full of water . If it 's too hot in your house , though , the butter will slip out of the inverted cup , so I mostly only use our butter bell in the winter . One thing to note about butter itself : Some butters are more spreadable at cooler temperatures . The Irish and French butters we can get here are much closer to spreadable at refrigerator temperatures than the regular US supermarket brands . I 'm not sure what the difference is , though .
It 's fine as written . Combining vinegar with baking soda ( or any acid with any base ) is usually done in baking to produce gas , which can lighten the finished product . This is an icing , which is applied after the baking process ; it 's not set to capture air bubbles , so any effect would be largely temporary and more easily produced through beating . The vinegar here is intended to mimic the tangy flavor of real cream cheese . The lemon juice has the same effect , but apple cider vinegar adds a different mix of acids , better matching the flavor of the real thing .
The term " bad " , when applied to cheese , can actually refer to a <URL> ( p. 14 ) , several of which are caused by improper or over-aging and only some of which are dangerous . The issues that you most likely need to worry about are : Moisture loss applies primarily to soft cheese and is probably the first negative effect you 'll see . In a sealed package , it will " sweat " as Ivo points out , caused by water evaporating and then condensing again on the packaging , forming little droplets . Unsealed , it will simply dry out and become hard . This is not spoilage , and the cheese is still perfectly good to eat , it just might not have as pleasant a texture and might have a slightly flat flavour . You can just cut off any hardened edges . Oxidation gives a slightly metallic taste but more importantly leads to rancidity - discoloration and a sour smell/taste . This is caused by light and is why you should store cheese in a dark place . If you left it in the car during the afternoon , it may have been exposed to a good deal of light . However , <URL> and wax paper in particular is an oxidation inhibitor ( that 's why cheese is often wrapped in it ! ) . Light exposure also would have been minimal at night . You 're probably fine in this respect , but use your nose . If it smells sour , do n't eat it . The chemical process itself results in peroxides and free radicals , which are obviously not good to eat , although there seems to be some debate about just how dangerous they are ( some say it raises the risk of cancer , although I 'm unable to find an authoritative source , and this might just be an urban myth ) . Mold is the most obvious form of spoilage and usually also the last . Although most mold is technically aerobic , many strains are capable of growing with very little oxygen , and I personally have seen mold growing on an unopened package of cheddar that I 'd forgotten about for several months . I 'm sure I do n't need to tell you that mold is n't safe to eat ; however , by the time there 's enough mold to be dangerous , you 'll be able to see it . Contrary to what Ivo 's post suggests , the mold you 'll see growing on spoiled cheese is not the same as the mold that the cheese was made with - some cheeses , like parmesan , are n't made with any mold at all , although they can certainly grow mold later on . The molds used in cheese-making are typically some variety of <URL> , which is safe to eat . The mold that grows weeks later could be anything , and is not safe to eat . Ivo is also partially correct in saying that the packaging does not prevent mold growth ; however , it does slow it down by restricting the available oxygen . On the whole , I tend to agree with the other answers that your cheese will almost certainly still be good after only 1 day . Keep in mind that cheese is thought to have been popularized as a <URL> before refrigeration existed - the whole idea is that it lasts a long while , usually well over 24 hours before food safety becomes an issue .
Capsaicin is oil/fat-soluble so try washing your hands with a little whole milk , or rub with sour cream or vegetable oil and see if that helps . Just as you can get it in your eyes if you rub them with your fingers , I 'm sure you can easily transfer it to your baby . I 'm just surmising here , not speaking from experience so if you try any of these , be sure to let us know how they worked ... or what you did instead .
Buttermilk has a delicious flavor that is not at all approximated by lemon juice . It 's true that lemon or vinegar with milk will clabber it a little and provide the acid that the recipe needs but the flavor will be distinctly lacking . Get some buttermilk . It 's inexpensive and has a longer shelf life than normal milk . It is also exceptionally easy to make . If you make it a standard part of your pantry you will find yourself enjoying life more ( or at least pancakes . )
I do n't think anything will be wrong with that milk . If it 's fresh milk , which I doubt , you should consume it in less than three days . If it 's pasteurized milk , which is much more likely , it 'll be unaffected . Signs of spoilage are a sour smell and sour taste . You should make a habit of always smelling your milk ( food ) before drinking ( eating ) it . If it does n't smell like you 'd expect , taste it . If it does n't taste like you 'd expect , ditch it . Milk is cultivated with lactobacillus , a bacteria that 's beneficial for us . So , even though milk may taste sour , it does n't mean that it 's undrinkable . In Holland , there 's sour-milk ( karnemelk ) , that some people consume ( I do n't like it , myself ) . Under the right circumstances , milk will turn into yogurt , thanks to the lactobacillus ... At any rate , if in doubt , throw it out .
I can honestly say I 've done this on many occasions . Especially for pizza dough , I defrost in the fridge for 24 hours in a cling filmed bowl which allows it to prove slowly through the day . Never once had an issue with it .
Flaxseed oil goes rancid quickly , and refrigeration slows down this process . So , yes , you should do as the label says ( usually a good idea anyway ) and keep it in the fridge .
Well you 're kinda right about it lasting a long time due to the sugar content . That will help the preserving process to the extreme . However , to be pratical you should be looking at how long the butter fat will survive in the fridge before it starts to take on funky flavours and looses it 's moisture . You 'll be fine in an air tight tub for a month or so but then flavour will suffer . If you freeze it ( it can be done but the quality will really suffer later ) you can get away with 4-6 months before freezer burn kills it . Honestly , I 'd just do smaller batches and enjoy the higher quality product . For what you save on time doing the larger batch , you 'll give up on taste and quality later .
You 've got to understand what the purpose of the ingredients is . In a crumble or streusel topping ( my go-to in the category is an apple crisp ) , the ( gluten/wheat ) flour , butter , and sugar are actually all binders/structural components . Taste/flavor is part of it , but as in your experiments in the other answer , you really ca n't vary one element wildly ( separate from the others ) without significantly changing the results . With that in mind , the butter in a crumble/streusel topping will affect the tenderness of the crumb ( similar to cake/pastry ) . Tenderness will also be affected by whether you used cold , melted , or softened butter ( or a non-butter shortening , like margarine or lard/Crisco ) . The tenderness goes to mouth-feel , which will affect how/when your tongue picks up on the diff flavors . Similarly , the temp/state of the butter/shortening affects how &amp; how much the sugar will dissolve/interact with it . Depending on what type of sugar you 're using ( granulated/white , dark/light brown , raw/demerara , liquid sweeteners like honey , corn syrup , molasses , or agave ) , cold/melted/soft butter will just have a different holding capacity for sugar , which cooks can take advantage of to " super-sweeten " or " under-sweeten " given fundamentally the same amount of sugar . And of course in a crumble , your perception of the sweetness of the finished topping will be impacted by the filling , since there 's ( delicious ! ) flavor interaction during cooking . So it comes down to ingredient preparation &amp; choice and cooking techniques - not just raw proportions . Cooking is a sort of applied chemistry - sometimes how you put things together is as/more important than what you put together .
" Commonly used " depends mostly on the culture , I 'd assume . There 's a lot of different oils , so I 've organized by use rather than try for a complete list . Some of the ones that you might find in a " typical American " foodie 's kitchen include : For frying : something with a high smoke point : peanut , sunflower , soy , extra light olive oil For baking ( muffins &amp; cakes ) : something with a mild flavor : corn , canola , " vegetable " , soy For baking ( biscuits &amp; pastry , or greasing a pan ) something solid at room temp : butter , shortening , lard For general pan cooking : olive oil ( any kind ) , butter , anything from the " baking ( muffins ) " list . update : this assumes sautéing heat or lower ; see ' frying ' for higher heat applications . For salad dressing : any nut oil , mild oil , or virgin / extra virgin olive oil For sauces : Butter . For finishing : something flavorful to drizzle over at the last second ... odds are , it 's extra virgin olive oil , but possibly sesame or a nut oil . Now , there 's regional differences -- in the south , it 's pretty common to save your bacon grease for cooking and to use shortening for frying . Lard 's still popular in hispanic ( and likely other ) cuisine , schmaltz ( rendered poultry fat ) is used in both Jewish and French cooking . Ghee ( similar to clarified butter ) , is used Indian cuisine ... and the list goes on . If you 're looking for a ' must keep on hand ' list -- a mild oil , extra virgin olive oil and butter will get you through most anything . Add shortening if you like baking , and sesame oil if you like to cook asian food , and you 'll be prepared for most anything .
This seems nonsensical to try with your home stove . You are correct , the rate of gas output is directly controlled by the knobs . In a typical home stove , drilling holes will not increase the gas output . It would affect the gas to air ratio , but I doubt it would result in an increase of temperature , and more likely a decrease .

What technique should I use to make latkes for a party so that I do n't have to stay in the kitchen ?
Number 3 will give you the best results . There simply is nothing as great in this world as a latke crisp from the frying pan , having spent but a couple seconds on a paper towel receiving the blessing of a few flakes of good sea salt . I 've never tried number 2 . If you do , please report back . Number 1 will not give you crisp latkes . They will still have the delicious taste of homemade latkes , but they will be soft , not crunchy .
As I understand it , when you combine high heat and vegetable oil you get a fairly stable polymer ( much like a plastic or resin ) . The polymer bonds with the surface ( which is porous ) , and results in robust surface . This is what we use to season cast iron cookware , but it 's less desirable on stainless and other lighter colour hardware . You can prevent the coating from forming by never allowing he oil to maintain a high temperature for long periods by itself . Keeping food in contact with the pan will both help keep the temperature down , and reduce the chance of the oil bonding with the steel . Cleaning the oil off once it 's formed is usually pretty simple : add water ( or soda water ) and heat for 10-15 minutes . Often the oil will wipe out ( or need mild scrubbing with an appropriate scrubbing pad ) . You should not have to use steel wool ( or a caustic cleaner ) , both of which can damage the smooth surface of many pans .
Peanut ( groundnut ) oil is a great option . In the US vegetable oil generally means soybean oil or a soybean oil blend . The main things are that it be neutral ( little or no taste of its own ) , with a high smoke point . On those scores , you ca n't do much better than peanut oil . I have not used rice bran oil . Yellow squash generally means this : ( the long one ) It can also mean the other yellow vegetable in the picture or this : What it is not , is butternut : That is a different flavor entirely . Yellow squash is more like zucchini , butternut squash is more like pumpkin . Welcome to Seasoned Advice .

The cheeses that just plain wo n't work in the fridge are those that make use of bacteria or mold with " special needs " . Swiss , camembert , and any blue cheese come to mind . The bacteria that produce the holes in Swiss need specific , relatively warm , temps for specific times . Likewise the molds on the rinds or through blue cheeses need warmer but still cooler than room temperature . Most semi-firm to firm cheeses can be aged just fine in a fridge . Many generic cheese recipes such as : <URL> or <URL> either say to age in the fridge or do n't give a temperature at all and just say " age in a cool place " . In particular cheddar or gouda like cheeses age just fine in the fridge . Parmesan should also work but I personally have n't had the patience to wait the year necessary to try it . Of course if generic-cheddar-like cheese is n't good enough and you want to recreate some particular cheddar that will be harder . Those recipes usually call for something like " Age for 6 months in this particular cave in France " . As for room temperature . I do n't know . Room temperature at my house is 80F and no cheese will work with that .
you might try forcing whatever it is into the cherries . This can be done under pressure , which you might be <URL> using a <URL> or maybe <URL> , or simply by vacuum packing the cherries with the soaking liquid . once vacuum packed you might be able to put in a pressure cooker to increase the pressure , but I 'm not sure what the heat would do to the cherries . EDIT : having read the recipe , I 'm not sure any of this would work .
I second the recommendation for Lukas Volger 's <URL> . I 've been working my way through it and have made several of the recipes so far , all of which have been good . However , I would say that not all of the recipes in the book work well for the grill . I 've been doing everything vegan from the Volger book with mixed results . Many of the recipes use eggs , but you can do them with just breadcrumbs and water as the binder . They come out pretty delicate that way and are better in a skillet and then baked , as Volger recommends . His tofu and chard burgers use some tofu that has been browned then pureed as binder . This works ok , but the burgers came out quite delicate ( but still delicious ) . Silken tofu pureed in the food processor gets a thick , creamy texture that could also be used as a binder . Eggs are by far the most common binder as they may be the best edible binder there is , since they are basically liquid protein , but obviously not vegan . For delicate burgers , I use this <URL> on the grill , which works great . You can find something similar at most kitchen stores . Another binder option is steamed rice , prepared like you would for sushi . It gets sticky and makes a great binder , though they 'll still be a bit delicate . I 've been making the beet , brown rice and black bean burger recipe from Volger 's book . I add bbq sauce and a paste of pureed rehydrated prunes , similar to the veggie burger at Hillstone/Houston 's restaurant and they come out really great . They work fine right on the grill , though refrigerating them overnight makes them a little sturdier . Another option is adding vital wheat gluten and water , aka raw seitan dough . This is what is done in the <URL> black bean burger recipe . I tried these straight on the grill also and they stayed together perfectly , as well as any commercial veggie burger . However , they were a little bland and could use some more seasoning . I have n't tried any of these in burgers , but some common binders in vegan baking are peanut butter , apple sauce and <URL> . I bet peanut butter would work well in a burger with flavors that work with peanut , like Thai flavors or chipotle . Falafel-style burgers also do n't need any binders , they stick together pretty well and can be grilled , though you may want to use a grill grid or something similar . Lastly , you can put a cast iron skillet or pizza stone on the grill - it 's common now for grilled pizza and will work for delicate burgers .
There are <URL> ( usually of Italian origin ) specifically made with olive oil . In breads , you can certainly use it , although there often is not enough olive oil for its flavor to truly be appreciated . New York style pizza dough , for example , is traditionally made with some olive oil .
Seems this is very common in Britain , where I come from , so google.co.uk did the business ! The recipe here allows storing in a cool , dark cupboard for up to six months , and it recommends leaving the eggs at least a month : <URL> This one looks good , and I like the instructions for eating ! <URL>
At a bare minimum , you 'll want at least one " flavoured " and one " unflavoured " oil . Olive oil is definitely the most common choice for a flavoured oil , and sunflower/peanut/canola oil all have pretty neutral flavours ( not to mention similar smoke points ) . Note that for good flavour you 'll want extra virgin olive oil , which also makes it unsuitable for frying/saut éing at high temperatures . So I would say that you already have the minimum requirement . That said , even the " unflavoured " oils have subtly different flavour characteristics due to their different fat contents , and you 'll want to take this into consideration if you like to cook in ethnic cuisines . A short list ( and keep in mind that this is partially subjective ) : Peanut oil : Asian cuisine , Mexican cuisine ( high-temperature frying ) Sesame oil : Asian cuisine ( stir-fry or deep-fry [ refined only ] ) Olive oil : Italian cuisine , French cuisine ( low-temp ) Sunflower or Canola oil : American cuisine , esp . deep-frying Grape seed oil : Decent substitute for any of the other oils Walnut/almond oil : Great for fried desserts ( watch the smoke point though ) .
Another route for day to day cleaning is vinegar . I use a spray bottle with half white vinegar and half water at night on my counter tops before bed . ( Use soap after cooking or prepping . ) The vinegar does a good job cleaning bacteria , mold , and germs . Once you get accustomed to the smell of vinegar , you will realize it deodorizes after the vinegar smell goes away . A nice touch is rubbing a lemon on the counter beforehand , but it really does n't do much other than smell nice and break down oil .
I 've found a <URL> on Walmart.com that has some interesting tidbits . For functionality alone , looks like a glass jar should do the job well . Something like this would have an advantageous shape to make cookies easier to reach , and the jar less prone to falling . One feature you may want to look for specifically would be an hermetic sealing lid , which would help keep moisture in the jar and slow down the drying . Same kind of jar that is often used to store flour , sugar , coffee , beans , etc. . Is light sensitivity a factor ? I do n't think it would be , in most cases , unless you kept your cookies in an area that is heavily lit by the sun .
I enjoy the fruity herbal teas as iced tea . I brew a cup and then pour it in a cup of ice . It is a sugar-free cool drink that tastes and smells great .
Do you weigh your flour ? If not , that is the one change that you can make that will make this problem go away . Most of baking , particularly at the commercial level , is based on ratios by weight . While there will be some minor differences in the amount of moisture in 10 ounces of flour based on the humidity , how much flour packs into a cup can vary a lot on humidity , how much you 've fluffed or sifted the flour first , whether you scoop or sprinkle ... you get the idea . If you do n't weigh your flour when you bake , then there are lots of possible problems that could have occurred that may or may not have had anything to do with the humidity . The only other " seat of the pants " solution is to know your recipe so well that if you notice that there is a problem , you 'll catch it early . Third rise is a little late to be adding moisture , so you would have had to have noticed the problem at the beginning . Weighing your flour and water solves many baking problems and makes you look like a pro . Since you are weighing , then " knowing your recipe and adjusting on the fly " seems to be the only real answer . I checked around and even <URL> In the situation you described I might have added a bit of water at the third rise , then let it have another rise . Another thought is that , possibly , the air being so dry caused the tops of your rolls to dry out some , so they were n't flexible and you did n't get any oven spring . A spritz of warm water across the top of the rolls during final rise and , indeed , in the oven ( I do it with my sourdough loaves , for instance ) helps the bread skin to be loose enough to not inhibit the initial oven spring .
Yes , it is just fine to bake a cake in a pan like the <URL> . A pan of that type may stick a bit more than a metal pan , so you might find <URL> to be of benefit . It 's unlikely that you will have any problems at all , but read Aaronut 's answer <URL> .
In general , unless the book or recipe specifically states something different , " salt " is assumed to mean " table salt " . If a recipe were to call for kosher salt or pretzel salt ( like as a topping for the loaves ) it would specifically call that out especially .
Reducing a mixture is simply boiling out water present in the solution . Adding a starch ( either cornstarch or other flours ) does n't remove that water but instead causes the starch to expand and " trap " some of the water . Cornstarch in particular <URL> when there is n't enough moisture in the base mixture , or if there 's too much fat or sugar present , so it 's not suitable for really rich sauces , for example <URL> . It also does n't work well in acidic mixtures like tomato sauce . The worst thing you can do for a cornstarch-thickened mixture is to cook it at a high temperature ( i.e. more than a moderate simmer ) or for an extended period of time . These will expand the starch granules so much that they pop , breaking the cornstarch and causing the sauce to thin again . So , be very careful of cooking temperature when using a cornstarch slurry . I have also found that cornstarch does n't respond very well to cooling and re-heating , so it 's not the best solution if you plan on saving some of the sauce for later use .
Reducing the amount of charcoal used in the Orion Cooker and cooking longer can produce a more tender result . Specifically , using 6 lb of a 12.5 lb bag of charcoal and cooking for 120 minutes for 3 racks produced ribs that were not quite as tender as desired , but much better than the normal Orion recipe ( 12.5 lb of charcoal for 70 minutes ) . The temperature profile was as follows : The above shows that the meat temperature was held between 195 and 205 for 60 minutes . This profile is not optimal for the most tender ribs , so additional changes toward lower/slower may improve the result . Note that the charcoal reduction required a minor modification to the equipement since unless the charcoal is adjacent to the Cooker 's wall , the wood chips will not smoke . The modification is shown in a you tube video entitled " Orion Cooker Charcoal Saving Mod And Improved Tender Rib Cooking " ( <URL> ) .
It really depends on what you are looking for in a cooking class . I can give you some thoughts from my own personal experiences , but I am sure there are many factors that you must consider , so you will get a variety of answers . I am assuming you are talking about recreational ( that is the industry term , as opposed to professional ) classes ; I do n't claim to have good advise for choosing professional programs to become a line cook or patisserie on a career path to being a chef or pastry chef . Facilities The cooking school should tell where their class is taught . A local community class in a high school home-ec room or in a community center will usually offer basic facilities ( although I imagine some will stun you ... ) Commercial cooking schools or businesses should have photos of their classroom for you to peruse , and will usually brag about the equipment they offer ( such as Viking stoves ... ) Look at the pictures , and ask if the environment will be comfortable for you . Level How advanced is the class ? If you already know how to temper your own chocolate , and own three dipping forks , you do n't want to take a basic workshop in chocolate . On the other hand , if you have never made a biscuit , you might not want to take an advanced pasty course where croissants and puff pastry the order of the day . Choose a class that is at the level you desire -- the course guide should make this very clear . Cleanup Find out if the school has interns , or other staff who do the cleanup . Commercial schools tend to -- otherwise , you might expect to be helped police and do dishes , especially in a community program like one hosted at a community center . You should be comfortable with the expectation . Curriculum or Menu Good cooking classes list exactly what dishes or items will be taught in the class in their class guide or curriculum . They should also specify the lessons learned or techniques applied . Often there is a theme , like " Valentines Dinner for Two " or " Pastry Intensive " Select classes that teach the techniques you want , and dishes you like . Duration Is it a one evening class , where you are in and out , and little is at risk , or a week long adventure where if you do n't enjoy the format or the instructor , you have lost a week 's tuition and a week 's enjoyment . I once did n't come back from lunch on the 2nd day of a five day course because I did n't like the instructor 's style . For longer classes , you might ask for guarantees of a partial refund if the instructor or style or presentation is not to your liking , before signing up . For day long and longer classes , find out if lunches or other relevant meals are provided ( at commercial schools , they often are , either cooked as part of your curriculum , or done by staff or interns for your enjoyment ) , or whether you bring your own . Often there is not enough time to go out for lunch . Presentation and Participation There are several main ways cooking classes are taught ; you want to be sure the style is one that you enjoy . Presentation only -- the instructor prepares dishes at the front of the room , and the students watch . Kind of like a cooking show on TV , but live and in person , so you can smell ( and maybe taste afterwards ) , and ask questions . Each person ( or group ) prepares some -- the class is broken up into groups or individuals , each of whom prepare one or more dishes from the menu . You might not get to do the dish you wanted from the curriculum , but you will get hands-on for something . Usually , the groups will share afterwards , so you get to taste everything . Every person ( or group ) prepares everything -- you will get to prepare everything listed in the curriculum , and usually eat it . Choose a format you are comfortable with , especially if you want to be sure you get to try a specific dish hands-on . Pacing When you evaluate the curriculum or menu , the manner of presentation , and the overall duration of the course , you should have some idea of how fast it goes . Make sure you are comfortable with the pace . If you like a slow and pleasant pace , you do n't want to be a in class where folks are expected to knock out their dishes fast -- although those are often more the advanced classes at commercial schools . Ingredients Find out whether you bring your own ingredients , or they are supplied . ( Most commercial cooking schools supply them , but community programs may not . ) Cost Cost counts . Need I say more ? General Talk to the folks at the school 's customer service line ( if they have one ) if you have questions . Take a short class at the school to evaluate the facilities and their general style before splurging on a longer or more expensive class . And bring your patience . By the nature of the beast , you often sit through things you know , or repetitions , or have to wait through lectures and demos before the hands-on portion . If you can , bring a friend to share the experience , gossip with , and generally have a good time , should you be so disposed . Bon
Go for 145 . 2 hours . Salmonella dies even at " low " temperatures ( from 135 ) as long as you cook it for longer . 135 for at least 87 minutes , will kill salmonella . However , I like it best when cooked at 145 for 2 hours .

How can you measure the caffeine content of a liquid at home ?
If you can find <URL> ( some nail polish removers ) , you can probably do <URL> .
Absolutely . I do it all the time , with great results . The easiest way at home is to ' <URL> ' the chocolate . Get it up to the proper temperature as best you can - 115 &#176; F/46 &#176; C for dark , 110 &#176; F/43 &#176; C for others . A thermometer obviously makes this easier . If you do n't have one , it will be just melted . Doing this in the microwave is more difficult than a double boiler because it 's difficult to tell when it happens exactly and you overshoot more easily . Stir on a double boiler till the right temperature , take the chocolate off the heat and stir in additional , finely chopped , high quality unmelted chocolate ( not chocolate chips ) . Now stir it in as the mixture cools , it should all melt and ' seed ' the crystals into the chocolate . You 'll want to test before you declare victory . At this point , if it 's wrong , just reheat , and reapply with more unmelted chocolate . To test , simply dip a spoon in and let it cool in the fridge for a moment . The thin coating on the spoon should be shiny and snapable .
Yes , you can do it without a press . Place a ball of dough between two layers of plastic wrap . Use at least twice the area of wrap that you think the final tortilla will be . Squish the ball flat with a pan , book , or your hand . Now use a rolling pin to roll the dough between the sheets of plastic . Make sure the thickness is even , and do n't get it too thin or it will break when you cook it . Bonus : you can store the uncooked tortillas in the plastic until using and they wo n't dry out .
You could try <URL> : Stick it in the freezer , and skim off the ice . Keep the ice , discard the liquid and melt the ice . If you had a freezer that you could precisely control the temperature , I believe there are certain preferred target temperatures , but simply checking on it frequently in a standard freezer should do the trick . The vacuum based suggestions also sound good , if you have appropriate equipment for that . Basically , you 're asking about distillation in reverse . Traditional distillation is primarily boiling , but there 's also a few traditions ( applejack , <URL> ) involving ice distillation . In ice distillation they 're after a higher alcohol product and keeping the liquid ( discarding the ice ) , but I believe if you switch which part you keep you 'll get the same results . Much like any other distillation , you may need to run through the process multiple times to get the desired result . With beer , the primary flavoring is from compounds extracted from hops , which react with oxygen to produce unpleasant flavors . By " unpleasant " I mean turning the bitter and tangy flavors into something more like wet cardboard . So depending on what you 're doing you may also need to protect your beer from exposure to oxygen . I believe with beer the real enemy is oxygen , with heat or light accelerating the undesirable reactions . Depending on the style of beer , esters and phenols may also be important to the flavor . In styles where those flavors are desired , it 's typically a wide mix , and it 's quite possible some of them will evaporate easier than alcohol or be harder to freeze . Note that no distillation method is " perfect " , with all distillation methods you 'll have water and alcohol in both outputs of the process , you 'll just have a greater amount of alcohol in the evaporated or unfrozen part and a lesser amount in the unevaporated or frozen part . Note also that in the US any <URL> .
I have n't tried this before but I found <URL> that shows you how . Cut into the mango , starting where the stem was and going around the long way , just in to the pit . Reach in with a spoon and scoop around the pit , separating one half of the mango from the pit . Then scoop the pit out of the other side .
I noticed you did n't mention beans , which are fairly common in minestrone . Cannellini beans are most typical , but you could experiment with others ( garbanzo , fava beans , etc. )
One reason to make your own butter is that you get distinctly different flavours depending on the type of cream you use . If you use fresh cream you get sweet butter which is popular in North America , Australia and Britain , but less easy to come by in continental Europe . If you use a cultured cream like Crème fraîche you get cultured butter , which is common throughout most of Europe . Cultured butter is slightly soured by lactic acid . It has a fuller , more complex flavour than sweet butter . If you decide to make it , be sure that you do n't use a cultured cream that includes artificial thickeners . The ingredient list should read something like " pasteurised cream , lactic-acid culture " ( apologies if that 's not accurate ; I 'm translating from Swedish ) . I have a couple of other reasons why I personally want to make butter . First of all my four year old son has been asking how butter is made , and this would be a great way show him . The second reason is that I 'm curious as to how real buttermilk tastes ( the buttermilk in the supermarkets is fermented milk ) . And last of all , I noticed that my beurre noir sauce was working out much better when I lived in Australia , so I 'd like to do some side-by-side comparisons with European butter .
For different food types there is no single correct answer , as it is very dependent on the specific microwave energy absorption and reflectance characteristics of each item ( food and container ) in the microwave oven It 's possible to put one item in which has a high absorbency and one with a low absorbency , and to have one fully cooked and the other still cold e.g. . A potato placed in a ceramic bowl , and a sausage on a glass plate , would result in a hot sausage , and a cold potato ( amusing sausage and potato are of same weight ) For similar food types a general multiplication is required , but not exactly by weight , as each microwave oven has an ' efficiency to food and weight ' exponential curve . You will find the result of this out by experience with the oven . This rule applies somewhat to normal thermal convection ovens too e.g. 250 g of potato takes 6 minutes in your microwave oven , then 500 g may take 9 minutes not 12 minutes , and 1 Kg may take only 12 minutes , until you reach the equilibrium point of no further improvement ( about 1 Kg for my domestic microwave oven )
Since I could see this being a cooking/food science question if you really wanted to play with this property of liquids in drinks , perhaps a quick answer is in order . This really would be quite well-suited to the physics stackexchange , though - this is a concept that 's quite describable by physics . To follow up on Sobachatina 's comment , the property you 're in fact looking for is surface tension ( which is reduced by surfactants like detergent ) . If you want to compare liquids , be they water , water + detergent , milk ( water + stuff ) , or even alcohol or oil , you just want to compare their surface tensions . Surface tension is in fact a measurable quantity , with dimensions of force per length . There are a couple of equivalent definitions : when increasing the area of the surface by a small amount , the amount of work ( energy ) required per area increase ; or when the surface is bounded by a line ( imagine a bubble film and string ) , the amount of force on that line per length . You should note that surface tension depends on the fluids on both sides of the surface . Most commonly we talk about surface tension of an arbitrary liquid against air , but surface tension against glass , plastic , or metal is commonly visible in your vessels and utensils , and surface tension between various fluids is of course visible when you try something like mixing oil and water . As for actual examples , Wikipedia has a <URL> with surface tensions of various fluids against air . Among them are a few potentially relevant for cooking : acetic acid + water ( though stronger than normal vinegar ) , ethanol + water , a very concentrated sucrose solution , and water . Note that the addition of alcohol or acetic acid substantially reduces surface tension of water ! If anyone can follow up with more data on surface tension of liquids commonly seen in cooking , I 'd be very interested ! It 's also possible to measure surface tension at home , though I 've never done it , and I 'm not sure how accurate you could get .
Sure . <URL> , and I think there was an episode of Good Eats that described the process pretty well , too . I 'm not sure what you can get at the butcher in India , but you 'll want to find the belly of the pig . What you do is rub the meat with a cure , which is a mix of salt , sugar , seasoning , and " pink salt " ( a curing salt that is part regular salt and part sodium nitrite ) . Leave it in your fridge in a ziploc bag for a week or covered on a tray , flipping it over daily so that it cures evenly , then rinse it off . At that point you can roast it in a low oven , smoke it , or hang it to dry .
With regard to your source that suggests adding lettuce will reduce foaming of the oil : it might be possible to use lettuce as a tool to scoop up surfactants from the surface of the oil . If you 're going to attempt it , I think the best time to do it would be when the oil is cool . An Introduction to Surface Tension Foaming is related to surface tension : for example , adding a <URL> ( such as soap in water ) to a liquid reduces its surface tension , which makes bubbles more stable . So to reduce foaming , you would need to increase the surface tension . Note that we ca n't increase surface tension by adding something to the oil : the only way to increase the surface tension of a liquid with an additive is to increase its overall density . To see why that 's the case , suppose for a moment that there were a magical substance that liked to stay on the surface of the liquid and caused higher surface tension . That higher surface tension would compress the liquid , and raise its pressure . That means any spot on the surface that had less of the substance would have less surface tension and less pressure , so the pure liquid would be pushed out of that spot and cover the surface . That process would result in the substance never actually being on the surface of the liquid , which contradicts our starting assumption , so no such substance can exist . Instead , such substances become distributed evenly throughout the interior of the liquid ... and , if they make the liquid more dense , that raises its surface tension . So , if we want to increase the surface tension of aging oil , the only way we can do that is by removing surfactants from the oil , assuming we do n't want to mix the oil with large quantities of something more dense . Surface Tension and Frying As J. B. Rossell explains in <URL> ( with credit to BaffledCook for finding the source ) , surface tension is very important in deep fat frying , beyond just the idea of foaming . Initially , oil for deep fat frying tends to undercook ( or takes longer to cook ) food , because few surfactants are present in fresh oil . Due to the high surface tension , the oil is less often in direct contact with the food being fried ( as little as 10 % of the time it is submerged ) , which means less heat transfer by conduction , less of a crust , and less oil present in the final product . As the oil gradually breaks down with repeated cooking , surfactants build up in the oil , reaching an ideal range which gives the preferred golden crust and moderate greasiness , with oil being in contact with the food between 20 % and 50 % of the time it is submerged . When the oil goes bad , the high quantity of surfactants results in too much contact between the oil and the food , resulting in greasy food that is overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside , and may have a bad flavor due to the rancidity of the oil , or contamination from the food being fried . Removing Surfactants First of all , I want to say that I 'm not sure I 'm in favor of trying to prolong the life of frying oil beyond its natural lifetime : the breakdown of the oil results in potentially cancer-causing free radicals , so I 'd rather err on the side of replacing the oil too often , especially if I 'm cooking for myself or loved ones . If you were going to re-use the oil anyway , you might be able to reduce the amount of oil that gets into your food by reducing the quantity of surfactants , but if you 're debating saving money by using your fry oil longer than you normally would , I 'd say a bottle of oil is cheaper than a trip to the oncologist 's office . Speaking of cost , I think a bottle of most oils used for frying is also cheaper than a head of lettuce , so I 'm not sure how economically viable this strategy is . That said , since surfactants ( SURface ACTive AgeNTS ) are attracted to the surface of the liquid ( they find a lower energy state by decreasing the energy of the boundary between two liquids or a liquid and a gas ) , they can potentially be removed by skimming ( or just pouring ) them off the surface . ( I expect putting the oil in a narrow bottle and pouring off some of the oil from the top would be a more economically viable solution to remove surfactants . ) Because crinkly lettuce leaves have a high surface area , its possible that just dipping lettuce in the oil and drawing it out might remove a significant amount of surfactant , especially if the surface area of the lettuce leaf is high in comparison to the surface area of the pot that the oil is in : the surfactant will attempt to spread evenly across the entire surface of the oil . If we assume the surfactant is attracted only to the oil/air boundary ( note : I have no knowledge of whether this is actually the case , or whether the material of the container matters ) , then when a lettuce leaf with a surface area equal to the surface area of the oil/air boundary is dipped into the oil , and then slowly removed , the oil covering the top of the pot and the oil covering the lettuce leaf will have roughly equal su
A lot depends on what kind of cheese you are making . I will assume that you are making a standard , medium-firm , rennet-set cheese . I have had the most success adding seasonings and herbs with the salt . That is - after the curd has set , been cut , and drained but before it has been pressed at all . Work in the salt and any other flavors before placing the curd in the mold . I imagine any herb or spice would work - it depends what flavor you want . I have used basil when I had a bumper crop . I have also used dried peppers . As to dry or fresh - either would work . As with anything if you use dry then use a lot less . I prefer fresh because it is more tender . Other cheeses might be a little different but as a rule of thumb adding with the salt should work . Mozzarella seems like it would be trickier because the kneading of the curd would change things .
All moving water has dissolved oxygen in it . That is what fish breath Dissolved oxygen is reactive , and will most likely extract more substances from the tea leaf , than without it . If these are the good flavour parts of tea , I do not know ? When you heat water it starts to release the dissolved oxygen . The more you heat water the more oxygen escapes You can buy tea making kettles that bring water up to 95 ° C ( 203 ° F ) , but not boiling , so as to decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen lost , but still making the water hot enough to brew tea . They also save energy :-) I use one of these , and am happy with it <URL> Some people " watch " their kettle , and switch it off just before the water boils ! It is a personal taste preference if tea tastes better when brewed in water with more dissolved oxygen or not
The most commonly used method is the Swiss Water Process : A batch of unroasted beans is soaked in hot water . Caffeine is water soluble , so it 's extracted from the beans . However , some of the other substances that give coffee its flavour ( " coffee solids " ) are also water-soluble and are also extracted . The first batch of beans is discarded and the caffeine is filtered out of the water/caffeine/coffee solids mixture by a carbon filter . Another batch of unroasted beans is added to the hot water/coffee solids mixture . The water is already saturated with coffee solids , so only the caffeine is extracted from this batch of beans . The now-decaffeinated beans are removed , the water/caffeine/coffee solids mixture is filtered again to remove the caffeine and the process can be repeated with another batch of beans or the same batch to remove even more caffeine . There 's no universal definition of " Decaf , " but it generally means beans that have had at least 97 % of the caffeine ( by weight ) removed .
Yes , but the trick is not to have the dough in the microwave when it 's on : place the dough into a wide , shallow bowl , and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap . Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water , and float a toothpick or a grain of rice in it . Microwave the water 'til it 's boiling . Place the bowl with the dough above the boiling water ; the water level should not touch the upper bowl . Close the microwave and wait . ( the plastic wrap is n't absolutely necessary ... but it prevents you from steaming the outside of the dough , changing its moisture content ) The toothpick ( or similar ) is necessary , as it prevents the water from heating above its boiling point and spontaneously boiling when you nudge it . .

When you cut any food you expose the cut surface to oxygen , which causes chemical changes due to oxidation . You also expose the cut surface to microbes and organisms which break down food . Both of these will impact the quality of cut meat or fish , so yes a filet cut from a whole fish just before cooking would be fresher and better quality than one cut some time before . The effect is not great , however . If you had a whole fish and cut one filet from it the day before , then cut the other filet just before cooking both identically I doubt you would be able to tell any difference between the two . To me the reasons for buying a whole fish as opposed to filets is cost and choice . A whole fish is easier to judge for quality than a filet , you can see whether the eyes are cloudy or clear , for instance . Buying a whole fish is cheaper than buying the filets off of it because it 's much less work for the seller , so you can save some cash doing it yourself . However , fileting a fish is not that easy . It 's perfectly do-able at home and there 's loads of how-to videos but it 's still pretty involved and hard to do that well without lots of practice . It 's also messy time consuming , so when you buy filets it 's for the convenience of not having to do it yourself . The important thing is to make sure it 's fresh whether it 's whole or already prepped .
If you never prepared the recipe as written ( which appears to be the case ) , you have no basis to tie the way it tastes when doubled to doubling it , rather than to the proportions of the original recipe . Based on many years of making many things in many sized batches , if I double a recipe and want it to taste the same as the original recipe , I double the cinnamon . I conclude that the most likely case here is that the original recipe had a lot of cinnamon , and that what you tasted is simply the way it tastes . Depending what travels the recipe might have had before you met it , there 's also a not-uncommon error that occurs with US measurements sometimes - the confusing ( by some transcriber in the past ) of T and t in hyper-abbreviated notation , which can make a factor of 3 difference ( T = Tbs = Tablespoon = 15 ml , t = tsp = teaspoon = 5 ml . ) The copy of the recipe you are looking at need not be hyper-abbreviated for this to have happened to it at some point in its past
I second Joe 's advice . Your pans may be too thin , that would make your dishes burn easily . You can test your pans with a simple experiment . Place a thin layer of water in your pan ( an eighth of an inch , or just enough to cover the bottom ) . Turn on your burner to high . If you have an electric stovetop let the burner glow before placing the pan on the burner . Watch how the bubbles form in the pan . If they are uneven over the bottom ( like in the picture ) , you have hot spots . If your pans have hot spots you need to stir more often and maybe lower the heat from what the recipe calls . Pans with thicker bottoms and made with good electric conductors ( copper or aluminum ) have fewer hot spots . Then there is what I call the Remick Maxim . Three years ago when I decided I would learn to cook better , I went through many cookbooks and asked a lot of people for advice . A great friend ( a French restaurant level cook ) told me the best advice he ever got was from the actress <URL> , a good cook herself . She said : & ldquo ; the secret to great food is to cook it in low heat . & rdquo ; Best advice I got on cooking .
If you need the eggs raw , you could submerge them in boiling water for 5 sec . That would kill any bacteria on the shell and the egg would still be raw inside . Put the eggs in cold water right away to prevent the egg from heating up by the residual heat in the shell . I have tried this many times and the eggs do not cook . If you are serving the eggs to very young children , pregnant women or someone who are sick , you should buy pasteurized eggs instead . But normally it 's safer to eat eggs from chickens you raise , than the ones from a factory , because they are more healthy and their immune system is well developed enough to kill the salmonella itself .

Why did my shrimp bisque turn out so broth like ?
I believe the answer to the question lies in the last paragraph of your question . If you had close to 4 cups of broth , 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half , plus onion purée ( which would be mostly water ) ; you 're pushing 6 cups of liquid , not including any wine or brandy that you may have used . For that much liquid you would need close to a quarter of a cup of flour , maybe more , to achieve a thick soup if roux is your primary thickener . Many bisque recipes are thickened much with a purée of the protein . Did you purée the shrimp or some portion of it ? Look at this <URL> , she uses 4 3/4 cups of broth ( in the final soup ) , 2 cups of half-and-half and a roux made with 1/4 cup ( 4 tbs flour ) . She also purées all of the shrimp , which causes a thicker soup than chunks of shrimp would , and adds tomato paste which would further thicken the soup . For what it is worth , it is the flour in the roux that thickens liquid ( an extra tablespoon of butter is not your culprit ) , and the liquid and roux must be brought together to a simmer for the liquid to properly thicken . In the case of Ina 's recipe , she fully thickened the half-and-half before adding the stock and shrimp purée , that 's how she gets away with the final line of hot , not boiling . I would be inclined to add the stock and the rest of the ingredients except the shrimp just after thickening the half-and-half and bring that to hard simmer before adding the shrimp . That would give me an opportunity to taste and gauge the thickness the soup before adding the expensive ingredient ( shrimp ) last .
Any number of things can go wrong . Is your flesh cut correctly , that is , against the grain ? Hint : if you see a string , it 's cut with the grain and will affect tenderness . Has your flesh properly aged ? Enzymes in the meat dissolve the tissue , making it naturally tender . 21 Days is recommended . You marinade too long . 15-30 minutes is <URL> for your cuts . You cook the meat too long . A thin slice should be fried on high heat for a short time . Restaurants get better meat . Fact of life . Edit : Basic sauté method . Heat the pan . The pan is hot when a drop of water becomes steam instantly . Add some oil and heat it . It should become very hot very quick . Look for wrinkles on the surface . Add the meat . When you see a drop of ' blood ' ( that 's plasma ) flip the meat . Retire the meat . [ Optional ] Add cold liquid to pan ( could be the marinade ) , clean the bottom of the pan . Lower the heat and make a pan sauce . Add the meat to the sauce for a minute and serve .
The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on . Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat . Give cast iron ample preheating time , and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan . That equals crispy . Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron . You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan . That alone probably would n't make much of a difference , but considering that you 're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes , the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan . That is not a friend of crispiness . You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature . I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan . Teflon , on the other hand , should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time . Some people go so far as to say that you should n't preheat it all . So if your beginning temperatures were about the same in the pans , they should n't have been . After you put in the potatoes , forget about it . You 'll never get the same kind of crispy sear with a teflon pan as you will with cast iron , even if you do n't know how to best exploit the advantages of cast iron .
<URL> When cooking seeds and nuts , you are essentially carmelizing various basic sugars and amino acids ( the components of protiens ) via the malliard reaction . This is what gives a grilled steak a different flavor than a boiled one , just like white table sugar has a different flavor from carmelized sugar via carmelization . When cooking anything you are trying to add flavor to , there is a point where it goes from tasty to not-tasty . Think of a charred steak or burnt caramel . Some items that we expect a certain amount of bitterness from ( coffee , chocolate , etc ) are pleasant to smell because they smell like they will taste ; a little bitter and likely robust . When you are expecting a buttery , nutty taste , the smell of chocolate or coffee may seem pleasant , but it tends to signify the seeds have cooked to that doness , which is probably not an ideal one for that item . A medium-well tuna steak may smell nice , but ( arguably ) wo n't taste as nice as a rare/medium-rare steak . You essentially burnt your seeds . ( no snickering ! ) I would recommend in the future you pull them out of the oven a few minutes before they smell like you want them to . They will keep cooking on or off the pan for a couple minutes due to residual heat .
To help get uniformly broken up ground beef : Choose an at least moderately fatty ( say 80-85 % ) grind , as very lean ground beef will tend to stick to itself more . Do n't compress it when you are bringing it home , as by setting other groceries on top . Do n't salt the meat before cooking , as salt tends to help it bind to itself . Break it up into chunks with your finger as you put it in the pan to brown . Do n't raise the heat too high , which leaves you less time to break it up as it browns . While it cooks , frequently break up chunks with your spoon or spatula The real key is the last one . There is always going to be certain variability in the size of chunks , unless you are very vigilant in breaking up the pieces fairly continuously . If you cook it in water , as per Cincinnati chili , you can get it very broken up , but it will be a different texture .

This is how shrimp is frozen for transit and sale . The packaging should have a weight that includes the ice aswell as the shrimp , and a weight that is shrimp only weight : The weight after they have completely thawed . There will also be a size grading . No of shrimp per lb or per KG based on whether they are HOSO Head On Shell On HLSO Headless Shell On or Peeled <URL> The ice coating prevents freezer burn to the shrimp , so they 'll be juicy when you defrost them rather than dry and hard ! If the have freezer burn they 'll be a opaque white discolouration on the surface . They 're still OK eat like this - they 're desecated / dried - they 're just really tough . Having said all this I am assuming that the packaging they 're in in undamaged , before I say that they should be fine !
The basis for any sort of Japanese soup dish is going to be dashi stock , a stock made of fish and seaweed . It has a much lighter flavor than chicken broth , so you might not have identified it easily . You can buy it in a powder form for convenience , and it can be sprinkled into other liquids rather than reconstituted . <URL> is for soba with a dipping sauce , but it 'll give you a good idea of the flavor profile you 're looking for : Dashi stock plus <URL> , which is made of soy sauce , mirin , and sugar ( and simmered so it 's not strongly alcoholic ) .
You need to 1 ) increase the emulsification , and 2 ) reduce the amount of time the sauce is very hot . You can try adding honey or mustard to the sauce , that will improve emulsification . You can also hit it with a stick blender which will do a much better job of breaking it up than can be done by hand . Also it may look ok after a few hours but who knows how much separation is starting to happen at a very small scale and will accelerate when it hits heat . Add the sauce at the last possible moment before plating . It is n't going to benefit from cooking , and it is n't going to marinade into the cooked food , so do n't have it in any longer than it takes for it to warm up . 20 seconds is probably all it will take .
Alternatively , the chickens may have been fed maize ( corn ) ; they market a specific maize-fed brand over here and the yokes of those eggs are a very deep yellow as well .
Gravy is supposed to be opaque and is a result of using flour as the thickener . If you want clear gravy , like what you would get in a Chinese restaurant , then you need to use corn starch or arrowroot as your thickener . But the opacity is considered to be a good thing . It 's the canned stuff you buy in the store that is clear .
Your question has two main parts , what 's elastic about gluten , and why do n't other plants have this unicorn we call a gluten protein . I 'll provide some background info first , but feel free to skip ahead to the spoilers if you like . Quick and dirty background on proteins ... All proteins ( like gluten ) are made of differing sequences , and number of about 20 or so basic amino acids ( glutamine , lysine , cysteine , arginine , isoleucine , just to name a few ) . So when we talk about large proteins like gluten , it 's sometimes hard to remember that chemically , we are talking about many-many amino acid ( AA ) molecules which link together . The way the AA 's link together matters because , the chemical interactions create the overall larger shape , and helps determine the physical properties of the final protein . If I did n't put you to sleep , or you want to geek-out on this stuff : resources regarding the secondary ( bonding between AA 's which creates alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets ) , tertiary ( AA side chain interactions and AA 's backbone ) , and quaternary ( 3D ) structures of proteins , pubmed is where you need to go . Glutens and what they are : Gluten is the main storage form of proteins in wheat . Gluten itself is a fusion of glutenin and gliadin protein units which belong to the prolamin superfamily ( prolamines are cool , look them up ) . Gluten subunits fall into three broad categories : High molecular weight ( HMW ) prolamines , ( glutenin subunits ) approximately 6-10 % of protein Sulfur-rich prolamins ( approximately 70-80 % of protein ) which include : gamma-gliadins , alpha-gliadins , and the B - and C-type low molecular weight ( LMW ) subunits of glutenin Sulfur-poor prolamins ( approximately 10-20 % of protein ) include : v-gliadins , and D-type LMW subunits of glutenin Variances in the spread of these proteins contribute to the way wheat varietals are utilized commercially ( like winter or summer wheats ... you have seen the variations available to buy on store shelves ) . The composition of gluten protein in whatever wheat strain that 's being used translates into differing physical properties ( elasticity , density , etc ) in the dough it makes . Where do the elastic properties come from ? Elastic properties in gluten come from the way the components of the protein matrix interact with water . The gluten proteins react with water in ways that other storage forms of protein can not , namely in the swelling/hydration bit . There are two things going on at the same time . The gliadin sections of the gluten protein contribute to the friction with which the hydrating liquid is able to move around in and near the protein matrices ( viscocity ) . The glutenin portion of the molecule is responsible for the elasticity or strength of the protein matrix . Glutenin seems to undergo reversible ( not as common as you 'd hope ) stretching because of the way it is folded . Why do n't any other grain proteins seem to have gluten ? I would like to point out this is more of a plant physiology/phylogeny question rather than one related to cooking . They just do n't have what it takes . The way different plants create the storage form of their proteins is determined by their specific DNA sequences within the genome . AA Structure , order ( N-C terminus ) and final shape of the proteins created by the plant are a result of the transcription , translation and post-translational modifications of DNA sequences in the plant .

I can think of several reasons why you might salt beer : Salt is a natural flavor enhancer , so you 'd be able to taste the hops and malt more Salt reduces perceived bitterness , so overly hopped beer would taste less bitter The salt crystals may nucleate bubble formation , giving the beer more head ( briefly ) I 've heard of it being done before , but never with good beer , only low quality swill . But then , since there were more quality problems with cheap brews at the time , this was probably a lot more common .

Without seeing the result and knowing your exact technique , my best guess is that you 're not using enough liquid , or that you 're using heat that 's too high . High heat will essentially fry the onions , like you would expect by dropping chicken or potatoes into a pan full of hot oil . Properly caramelized onions should take at least 20 to 30 minutes , I try to go for an hour whenever time permits . I actually stir as little as I can without allowing them to sit long enough to burn . Over-stirring should n't be a problem ; under-stirring may be . To start , you want the bottom of the pan to be covered with a thin layer of oil , and then make sure you stir the onions very well to coat them completely right after you toss them in . Begin with the pan on medium-high heat to get the oil up to temperature , once it ripples and you put the onions in you can lower it quite a bit . I rarely put it above 5 ( out of 10 , glass-top stove ) , and if I see things going crispy , I 'll often drop it to 4 . I 'd rather take more time and have softer onions . Are you adding any liquid along the way ? Sometime , when doing large batches , 15 minutes in I find that I do n't have enough oil in the pan , and I can see them starting to crisp up a bit more than I 'd like . When that happens , lower the heat a notch , and add a touch more oil ( or , as I prefer , a cube of homemade stock ) to the pan . It 'll take some practice , but eventually you 'll be able to know how much liquid to use instinctively . The reason I prefer stock for my " second add " is because I know the stock will evaporate off , as mentioned in the question you linked to , you do n't want to be pouring off flavor at the end of the cooking time , so evaporation is a good thing ! If you 're using cast iron , I recommend trying stainless steel , I get much better results with the latter than the former . I 'd guess that it 's because I can dynamically regulate the temperature better with the stainless steel - with cast iron , once you realize you 're at too high of a temperature , it 's hard to lower it quickly . If you need a step by step guide to start you off until you get a feel for everything , there is a great guide <URL> and another <URL> . The difference is that one recommends 1 teaspoon of oil per onion ; the other uses 3 tablespoons per onion . I find that for my kitchen , it 's somewhere in the middle ( I just eyeball so I ca n't give you an exact number , unfortunately ) - but if you try both methods on your stovetop you should be able to use that data to determine the right amount for you .
What are the primary causes of this ? The steam and other hot gasses that were puffing the cookies up either escapes or condenses . Without heat to create more steam , the cookies deflate . You get exactly the same effect with bread , quiches , and other baked goods . You can hear bread start to make a crackling sound almost as soon as it comes out of the oven , and the sound continues for some minutes until the bread has cooled a bit . Quiches are always quite puffy looking when they 're in the oven , but they start to shrink a bit as they cool . If you want your cookies to shrink less , you might try cooking them at a slightly higher temperature , or cooking them a bit longer , or perhaps not chilling them so much prior to baking . Bumping up the amount of egg white in the cookie may help , too . The idea is to get the structure of the cookie to set a bit more by the time you remove the cookies from the oven . That will , of course , cause the cookies to be less chewy and more crunchy .
I 've never made seitan , but just like when making bread , gluten needs water to activate . I do n't know the precise amount . Oil , if anything , has the opposite effect , coating the gluten molecules and keeping them from linking up , which is why we use fat in pastries to keep them from getting tough .
Expiration dates on milk are not intended for open containers . Any open milk is only good for 3-5 days . After that , it is not safe for drinking , and taste is not guaranteed either . Many people seem to not know that . Traditionally , you could only buy HTST pasteurized milk , which has 7-10 days of usable time altogether . It spent 2-3 days on its way to the customer , and if a milk opened on day 3 after production went off on day 8 , nobody wondered , because it was on or just before the expiration date . Today , you get also ESL milks and nut milks , which have a much longer life in the closed container . But once you open them , they start acting like any other food - they are only good for 3-5 days in the fridge , no longer . The expiration date does n't matter for open foods .
Assuming the cod was the same quality as before and you de-salted the fish in the fridge for 24 to 48 hours , then I would also guess overcooking . Rendering the gelatin at 45 & deg ; C ( as suggested in the paper <URL> ) should prevent the fish from cooking and give enough time to get it into the oil . You can always cook the fish in a separate step after you made the pil pil . Modern techniques for salting cod use less salt and create a product that will not be edible by future archeologists , so store in a dry cool place ( tightly wrapped in the fridge ) .
Edible ? Absolutely yes . Flavorful ? ... you should taste it and tell us . Seriously , do n't serve a meal to anyone , yourself included , until you 've tasted it and it tastes at least decent . ( Not trying to be snarky here , that 's literally the best cooking tip I was ever given ) Nutritious ? Probably somewhat -- that chicken muscle is primarily protein after all . Generally , soups are made with bones because bones ca n't be used for anything else , so it 's more economical to get soup-flavor from bones ( making the stock ) , then use meat for texture and to add variety to the liquid . I was taught to put meat into soups in the last hour of cooking . Many recipes I 've seen call for taking out the whole pieces of meat and shredding it or pulling it before serving it in the soup .

What is the proper way to use corn starch to thicken sauces ?
When making the slurry , stir cornstarch into cold water until it has the consistency of cream . This can be set aside until it 's needed , but be sure to stir it briefly before you pour it into the sauce to redistribute the starch granules in the water . You should pour it into your sauce toward the end of its preparation . According to McGee you should use roughly 2/3 as much starch as you would flour . If you are n't using a recipe , add your slurry a bit at time until it 's a thick as you like it . Also remember that the sauce will thicken a bit as it cools , so it should be a little bit thinner on the stove than you intend to serve it .
Restaurant supply stores carry degreaser , which will remove the brown baked on oil . However , that oil is n't hurting your cooking at all . It is the same thing that forms on cast iron skillets , but it is n't objectionable because you do n't notice the color against the black of the cast iron . If it works I 'd continue to use it . If you are thinking of changing , you might want to consider the cast iron Dutch Oven route . They hold their heat better than consumer deep fryers and a Dutch oven can do more than just deep fry . And they are easier to clean .
Place on non-stick sprayed foil ; broil for ~ 4 minutes in oven with some source of moisture or a glaze over top ( ie , you might take salmon and add a soy/mustard glaze ) to protect hydration levels .
It 's not too much water that makes them soggy , it 's cooking them for too long in the water . Thin noodles are virtually done as soon as they break out of their dry , tablet shape . As soon as this happens , take a noodle out and test it . Remember that cooking will continue even after you drain the noodles . You should drain the noodles well in a colander . If you are planning on stir frying the noodles , you need to first wash the starch off them - run the cold water tap over them and circulate it through the noodles with your hand ( carefully , they might still be hot in the middle ) . They then need to be dried as much possible - spread them out on a board , pat with paper towel , and leave for ten minutes or so before stir frying ( preferably in an empty wok - cook the rest of the stir fry first , then empty it , cook the noodles , and re-add the meat etc. )
For my daughters , I usually have a speedy porridge process that goes like this : Oats , sugar and water to cover ( we do n't use milk , but it would be the same ) in the bowl . About 3 minutes in the microwave , just to boiling point . This makes a fairly thick porridge , which is stirred for a minute to let steam out . Drop an ice cube into the bowl and stir until it 's gone . Voila , edibly warm porridge that is n't scalding hot . The whole thing takes about five minutes , and for the three of those that the bowl is in the microwave you can do other things .
Garlic flavors are soluble in oil , simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well . I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes . Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal . How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste . 5 tbsp of rice is n't much , for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough . With the garlic I grow I 'd add a few slices from a clove at most . Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards , The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain .
It might be there for body , but more likely for the umami kick that tomato past helps with . I bet you could leave it out with no ill effect ... otherwise , try some ketchup . You could also open the small can , use what you need and put the rest in a baggy in the freezer .
If the key issue is safety , I imagine the cans of the type you indicate are probably as safe as any others , assuming that you can clean them adequately . Those corners at the top are out of the reach of a bottle brush . They will have a lining to prevent them from being overly reactive . Still , I would not use them as they are going to be very difficult to clean , and you can not monitor the contents . I would recommend getting an oil dispenser specifically for the purpose , such as this type : They will let you see inside , and make it easy and clean to pour . With a funnel , you should be able to fill them easily , and they do n't have corners ( at the top ) out of reach of a bottle brush , making them easier to clean . Still , this type of dispenser is not meant for long term or bulk storage , as many oils and condiments should not be exposed to light and air ( although the dispenser minimizes air exposure , especially when it is below the fill line ) . You would use them for working amounts that you would consume in a couple of weeks . The containers tend to be made of glass , which you know is non-reactive .
<URL> recommends : Cover with a plate weighted down with jars filled with water or cover with a large food grade plastic bag filled with salt water ( 6 tablespoons salt per gallon of water . )
I never boil rice noodles . Just soak them in cold water for about an hour .
The General Mills site has the <URL> of the " original " pancake mix along with it 's nutrition facts . The serving size is 1/3 cup mix ( 40 g ) This means that one cup of the mix should weigh 120 g ( 4-1/4 oz ) .
The truth is , there really is no good way to reheat such sandwiches . The bread will have gotten soggy while the sandwich was in the refrigerator , and the densest part ( which requires the most energy to get hot ) is on the inside . The option which is probably the least poor is to use the microwave , as more of the energy will be transmitted to the filling directly than with other heating methods . This is still likely to leave the bread kind of mushy and rubbery . Your best option is to only buy the size of sandwich you want to eat , or to split one with someone . Note that you mentioned store bought subs . If the sandwiches are homemade , there is a good answer : do n't assemble them until you want to eat them . You can then toast the bread , and heat the filling separately , and then combine them , and thus have a very fine sandwich .
Clean it immediately , before anything has a chance to dry . As soon as I 'm done grating anything , I run the grater under water and wipe it with a sponge . Wipe with the direction of the blades , then run a little water inside it . Optional : put the grater in the dishwasher to clean fully .
Most basic mills with steel grinders will be OK What breaks them are Overly aggressive grinding ; just grind gently and your mill will last much longer Keep them dry ; do not use a pepper grinder over a steaming pot . Grind pepper into a bowl or plate , and then pour into pot Old peppercorns ; as they age and dry , they get tougher to grind , and wear most mills out pretty fast . Store peppercorns in very air tight containers , so they ca n't dry out more than they are meant to be dried Avoid those coloured peppercorn mixes ; whatever makes the light colours , are also very tough . Stick with plain black pepper Contaminants ; pour your peppercorns onto a white plate and check for small stones or twigs before loading into grinder . Also check for " insect parts " , most local food laws allow some of these , but who wants them ! I have gone through a variety of grinders over the years . Some expensive , some cheap . Price was not a factor , usage and care seem to have been Acrylic grinders generally die quickly , as the acrylic cracks as it ages . Solid metal or wooden bodies are better as they last longer in general , and keep the pepper in a light proof container ( which all food should be stored in , or in a light proof cupboard )
From <URL> I found that there are two major benefits to using a pie bird Prevent the pie from boiling over in the oven by allowing the steam created when the fruit filling or other contents are cooking to escape from inside the pie Support the pastry crust in the center of the pie , so that it did not sag in the middle Based on the site it seems that they can be put in any type of pie .
Well , it looks like I found my answer : <URL> is used for creating <URL> . Field corn includes a few types of corn ( dent , flour , flint , waxy ) . I 'm not sure if all types of field corn are used for masa de maíz , however . So , if anyone has a more specific answer , feel free to give it . I 'm guessing really any kind of corn could be nixtamalized , however ( but some kinds may be more ideal than others ) . Other kinds of grain besides corn can also be nixtamalized .
Your filling is basically a beef stew/casserole , so any cuts that suite long slow cooking are fine . They get cooked again while the pie is baked , so premium cuts will just be wasted The lower grade and ' off cut ' parts are what are most commonly used . Like rump , brisket , chuck , shank , neck etc Using a bench top slow cooker makes cooking this all very easy . The beef needs to be fully cooked before making the pie . An eight hour slow cook is fine You want the pieces to be a variety of sizes to fill out the pie shape , but make sure you have some at least the height of the pie filling . The larger pieces tend to be better , but that could be a matter of taste and culture You need to get rid of plenty of fat before and after cooking . A mouth full of fat in a pie is not nice . There is already plenty of fat in the gravy and pastry , so trim off all you can A good meat pie should have a solid layer of meat connected with gravy , not swimming . It should also not be so full as you ca n't eat it with your hands ( for a single serve pie ) without loosing half the contents Puff/flakey pastry works best and holds everything together Avoid overly strong flavoured gravies , you do n't want to hide the beef and pastry taste Before you attach the lid , place a slice of tasty cheese , or an extra generous serving of cracked pepper on top of the filling A respectable pie looks like this - thanks to Ponsonby Pies ( not made in Ponsonby anymore )
The two main issues with ground coffee are : The coffee losing its aroma . The aroma/flavor of coffee is quite volatile , and will evaporate very easily . The solution to this is an airtight container , with as little head room in it as possible . The coffee soaking up moisture from the air . This makes the coffee ... unpleasant . The best solution I 've found ( in a hot humid climate ) is to put it in the freezer . It is the nature of refrigeration to leech all of the moisture from the freezer compartment . In summary , the best I 've found is a small airtight box in the freezer .
To store fats , you should always use glass as plastics react to fats by absorbing some and perhaps discoloring or transferring flavors to your fat . Depending on use , I prefer to work with cold fat at the start as it has a much broader possible use and I do n't like to wait when I make biscuits , so I keep mine in the fridge . However , you gain very little extra life out of keeping it in the fridge and if you do n't keep it in a sealed container you run a very real risk of flavor transference there to . If you do n't make pastry dough or other such , your counter top is a perfectly acceptable place to store , as long as you use it up before it goes rancid . One thing to keep in mind is that fats can sometimes have very different shelf lives , so make sure you taste or smell before use , regardless of storage method .
The oil will always separate from the rest of the product . ( home made or natural/bio peanut butter will behave the same way ) When that happens , just spend some time and elbow grease to mix it back together again . if the tahini was stored in the fridge , it might take longer because everything will be harder . Just leave it on the counter for a while until it gets to room temperature before mixing it back together . ( after googling ) People suggest to keep the jar upside down and when you want to use it , just put it back straight and let it stand for a while , it will mix itself ( a little bit ) together again .

What is a substitute for mascarpone cheese ?
I found a highly rated <URL> on food.com . I have n't personally tried it , but it 's highly rated on that site , and is ridiculously simple . 1 16 oz block of cream cheese 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream Blend until smooth Try it and let us know ? :)
When I fancy fish and chips I tend to use either cod or haddock and create a rich beer batter . Serve that with some home-made chips and you 're set . If I want something lighter , but still with a crust , I 'd tend to go for mackerel . If that 's not available , I 'd be looking for seabass or snapper .
The most accurate substitution would simply be <URL> . It is concentrated rum with a huge kick of flavor , and much less alcohol . A little goes a long way . If you 're going to stick with a strong liquor my first choice would be a <URL> , it 's a similarly " sweet " liquor that tastes good in baking . Another good option would be <URL> . If you 're avoiding liquor , then you may be able to use vanilla extract . Non-alcoholic varieties are available . According to <URL> you can also use molasses thinned with pineapple juice . The rum is used simply for flavor .
When I am using skim powdered milk and want more fat , I just replace some of the water in the recipe with heavy cream . Your recipe does n't have water , it already uses milk and cream . You could replace a little of the milk with cream to make up the difference . However , with all the cream and butter in that recipe , I doubt you would be able to notice the fat missing from the dry milk . I would just use your skim dry milk and not worry about it .
It 's going to depend greatly on what you 're baking . Sugar serves several different purposes beyond just providing sweetness . Besides sweetness : tenderness by interrupting and minimizing gluten formation . Sugar promotes spread in cookies Retain moisture and extend keeping quality ( in baking sugar is actually considered a " liquid " ingredient due to its hygroscopic qualities - the ability to pull moisture from it 's surrounding atmosphere ) . Promotes browning and caramelizing Assists in aeration and leavening ( as in creaming butter and sugar to aerate the dough ) stabilizes egg whites Provides food for yeast growth and fermentation In some instances you might be able to use a syrup ( honey , corn syrup , molasses , etc. ) but not in all cases . For instance the granular nature of sugar is necessary for aeration of cookies and cakes because the jagged edges create air pockets as they pass through the fat . Syrups primarily serve the purposes of sweetening , browning , and moistening . Honey could be used in muffins that are being made using the muffin method ( aka two-bowl method ) because this method would use a liquid fat ( melted butter/oil ) but not in the creaming method ( producing a more cakelike structure from the creaming process ) . When using syrups you have to account for the addtional moisture that they provide . From : " How Baking Works " ( Paula Figoni ) " The National Honey Board recommneds the substitution for using honey in place of granulated sugar . This accounts for both the amount of water in honey and for its intense sweetness : use 1 pound honey in place of 1 pound granulated sugar ; reduce water ( or other liquid ) in the formula ( recipe ) by 2.5-3 ounces . " Overall , when making substitutions of ingredients that are critical to the structural and eating qualities you probably will not be able to replicate the same results with the substitution . In the end , it will often be a case of " what is the next best thing " and realizing there will be quality differences in the finished product .
Also known as a " bird 's beak " , it 's used for <URL> root vegetables ( turning them into little footballs ) and making fancy , delicate cuts when carving garnishes from fruit or vegetables . More practically , the curved blade is great for peeling round vegetables and fruit . It 's a complete pain in the butt to sharpen without a belt grinder ( or pro sharpening service with same ) , but gosh , it looks neat . Congrats on the fun present !
Personally , I 've switched almost entirely to <URL> for all types of stirring and scraping spoons . They do n't stain , they are fine up to quite high temperatures , they clean up easily and can go in the dishwasher . They are also wo n't scratch the surface of non-stick cookware . It is true that they do n't feel quite so nice as a good wooden spoon , but the convenience is outstanding . ( On the other hand , I stick with metal for the type of spatula one uses to flip a fritter , because silicone ca n't have a thin enough leading edge , it is too flexible . )
Capers are generally very salty , and not what you want as a peppercorn substitute . I think that black/white/red / madagascar peppercorn would be a fine substitute . The distinction between the different pepper flavours is very subtle , and not one to worry about much .
There is no single cut of meat that is universally used in Philadelphia . <URL> is common , and it may actually be the most traditional given the sandwich 's Italian origins ( top round is what is used in <URL> and <URL> ) . It is becoming more and more common to use <URL> , though , which is what is used in some of the most popular Philadelphian establishments ( e.g. , <URL> and <URL> ) , which makes sense given its higher fat content . As <URL> mentioned , you should be able to get your butcher to slice the meat into thin ( ~ 1mm ) pieces . If that is not possible , though , you can put an entire rib-eye roast into the freezer for a half hour or so . This will harden the meat without actually freezing it solid , and will make thinly slicing by hand much easier .
I do n't know whether it 's meant to be melted but it 's not how raclette cheese in France or Switzerland is usually like . Livradois is not a region I would spontaneously associate with raclette either . Having grown up in the Alps , I would personally consider raw milk raclette cheese from Savoie or Valais as the most authentic and those cheeses definitely hold their shape , even at room temperature . That said , raclette is not a protected name in either Switzerland or France so it 's produced all over the place and it 's increasingly common to find flavored variants ( with black pepper , mustard seeds , etc. ) I also know people who like to melt blue cheese or reblochon ( a soft cheese from the Savoie area ) under a table-top raclette grill so why not some other soft cheese ? Finally , note that what passes as the ' traditional ' way to prepare raclette is neither a table-top grill nor melting the cheese in a pot and dipping bread in it , fondue-like , but actually exposing the whole piece of cheese to some heat source and scrapping the melted bits as you go , as shown on the <URL> .
To answer in the language of the question asked : Medium holes with a cutting edge on bottom ( look like large raindrops ) : used for shredding . Small holes with cutting edge on bottom : used for shredding when you want it finer than the larger size . Outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides : used for grating . Wide holes that look like a smiley : used to slice things to an even thickness . As for recipes ... I generally do n't use the slicing portion too often , as I can get fairly consistent slices with a knife , but if you 're not so skilled , it could be used to slice potatoes for an au gratin ( might need to slice them in half first , is the slots are n't wide enough to fit the whole potato ) , or to slice firmer cheeses . It can also be used for slicing cabbage for coleslaw ( again , once cut down to fit ) , cucumbers or carrots for salads , etc. . As the blades are n't razor sharp , there are some softer items ( eg , tomatoes ) that it just wo n't work for , that you 'd have to do by hand or get a much more expensive mandoline . The grating side I only generally use for hard cheeses , when I need a more powdery texture than I can get with the shredding sides . I 've also used it for zesting citrus ( although it only works in large quantities , as you end up losing about 1/2 a lemon to the groves and it does n't release without a brush ** ) , and I 've used it for pulping carrots ( was mixing them into a sauce , and I did n't want identifiable bits ) The shredding sides are the ones I use the most , with the choice of side dependent upon what size I want the resultant shreds . I use it for firmer vegetables and fruits that I 'm baking into breads ( zucchini , carrots , apples ) , potatoes for hash browns , medium cheeses for firmer cheeses ( when I want this texture ) , etc. . Although a food processor can be used for this task , you have to consider a couple things ( besides initial cost &amp; space it takes up ) : it 's really easy to go and shred lots of cheddar cheese in a food processor , but it cramming all in there and fusing back together from the force and heat , defeating the purpose . Chilling the cheese helps , but you also need to keep dumping the work bowl out . If you have a strong arm and a small food processor , a hand shredder might actually be faster and give better results . When using a shredding disk for firmer things , you do more damage than by hand , resulting in lots of liquid being given off . Sometimes , this is better ... I have a potato kugel recipe that comes out very light as I can get more of the liquid out after having gone through the food processor ... so you may want to try both tools ( if you already own them both ) to see which one gives you better results . ** ... I 've heard you can wrap it in plastic wrap , use the grater , and then pull the wrap off to get it to release ; I 've never tried it , in part because I now have a microplane grater , but also because I 'd be afraid of getting bits of plastic in the food . I also want to say that I saw the trick the context of pulping ginger or garlic , but it 's been long enough ago that I do n't know that I can trust my memory
<URL> is a fantastic resource , and has probably <URL> out there at the moment . There 's also a lot of good stuff at the French Cullinary Institute 's <URL> . They 've got <URL> that 's quite enlightening . I actually disagree on the McGee recommendations . While it 's an excellent book , full of great info , I do n't think it 's a good starting point for molecular gastronomy ( in the sense of the cooking movement rather than the more literal sense )
For white wine , try : chicken broth/stock vegetable stock white grape juice ginger ale canned mushroom liquid diluted white wine or cider vinegar For red wine , try : beef or chicken broth/stock diluted red wine vinegar red grape juice tomato juice canned mushroom liquid A great list of substitutions for cooking with various alcoholic ingredients may be found <URL> .
No . Sweetened condensed milk has a 40 % sugar content . It is very sweet , suitable for desserts and such . It is entirely too sweet to substituted into a curry . The consistency is drastically different . Evaporated milk is about the same consistency as heavy cream . Sweetened condensed milk , because of its high sugar content , is more the consistency of a warm caramel . Also , they are different colors , evaporated milk is white , sweetened condensed is light brown .
Pretty much no , they are totally non-alike . The beauty of brisket is that it is full of connective tissue and other odd stuff that translates to succulence when cooked low and slow . Round is pretty much the opposite , it has very little in the way of interest .
<URL> suggests Pancetta which is another form of cured Italian bacon , usually without smoking . I think the primary thing you are looking for is cured but not smoked , as smoke will add a strong flavor that is completely missing in Guanciale .
I 've only had red amaranth , so apologies if that is distinct from the type you have access to . As I recall , spinach is a bit sweeter and the leaves are a bit softer so they break down more readily . Also I believe the stem on spinach is less fibrous . That said , they are both leafy greens and I 've yet to find a recipe so touchy that one leafy green ca n't be substituted for another .
Fenugreek seeds are intensely aromatic and go quite nicely in curries , and any dish where such a flavour is required . In the middle-east they use it quite a lot , often as a condiment . Highly used in spice rubs , pickles , marinades , anything where a strong spice flavour is required and often in puddings as an aromatic like nutmeg is used in English cooking . The leaves have a similar flavour , but not quite the same , you could use the seeds in their place adding them in to the spice mix if there is one , but the leaves I prefer personally . The flavour of methi leaves in thepla or in curry is wonderful in my opinion .
Decent port is not necessarily expensive ; you may find yourself spending more on the meat . For example , Sandeman 's Founders Reserve 750 ml runs about US$ 15 before taxes , Dow 's Fine Tawny 750 ml is about US$ 13 , and Graham 's Six Grapes Ruby 750 ml is about US$ 8 ( and this is just the start of the list ) . These are , perhaps , not the connoisseur 's choices , but they are hardly undrinkable . Depending on the laws where you live , you ( or your favorite wine shop ) can order any of these online from a variety of sources . Port has a unique character that is not easy to replicate with any other wine or fortified wine . If you are trying to replicate a result , do not substitute . If you really want something else that will serve the same role even if it will taste different , I would look to a Madeira , a cream sherry , or sweet Marsala ( depending on your tastes ) .
Please do not use a cooking wine . Those are awful . Pick a juice , any juice . I 'd say cranberry . You probably do n't want anything too sweet .

Can you reuse marinade used with raw chicken ?
Most reliable sources will warn you strongly against reusing marinades because they can continue to harbor bacteria . Even though the second batch of meat will be cooked , there 'll be lots of time for the bacteria to multiply in the meantime . ( And given the symptoms caused by foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria like salmonella , the risk is n't worth the few cents you 'll save on marinade . )
Yes you can and it is . Google <URL> and you will find plenty of restaurants that actually have it on the menu , like <URL> , <URL> or <URL> . I doubt that a restaurant would ( be allowed to ) have it on the menu if it 's unsafe to eat .
By hunting chicken in a game preserve ? ;-) <URL> The essence of poaching chicken is a gentle boil in water , stock or other flavorful liquid . I really like poaching chunks of chicken in a thin sweet-and-sour sauce , then thickening the sauce , adding pineapple chunks , and serving over rice .
In all cheese making and especially with young cheeses like cream cheese , fat adds a lot to the flavor and texture . You can skim off extra fat but your cheese will be thinner and less richly flavored . Shaking the cream in wo n't help if you are using a fermented method ( as opposed to using boiling and acid to curdle the milk ) because it will separate out again during the fermentation . Your thickened , fermented milk will be richer on top where the cream rose . It will mix back in when you drain the cheese and form it .
If you freeze it , the gravy may separate or curdle after thawing . Stir well , though , and it should be fine . Cooked meat will be less dry if frozen in a bit of gravy ... so if you have any leftover meat , that would be a great way to save both .
No , flour and starch are very different things . Starch is a molecule consisting of a chain of glucose rings . It is one of the main ways plants store energy . In practice , it is extracted from many different grains and tubers such as potato , wheat , tapioca and corn . Flour is a food ingredient made from milling a grain very finely , and frequently also removing the outer hull of the grain . If nothing else is specified , saying just " flour " denotes non-whole-grain wheat flour . It so happens that starch is a molecule present in large amount in many flours . Wheat flour is about 90 % starch , and rice flour is close to 100 % . But it is still incorrect to assume interchangeability , for the same reason that " pan " and " iron " are not interchangeable words even when you are holding a pan made from 100 % iron . In the cases where starch is less than 100 % , it is even worse to use the terms interchangeably , because the parts which are present in a smaller amount often determine the properties of the flour , making it act much differently than pure starch in the kitchen . For example , white wheat flour contains around 10 % gluten , which allows you to make risen bread with it . Update As for interchangeable usage : There are a few corner cases , as Jolenealaska 's comment point out . For example , there are applications where you only need the properties of pure starch , but you can substitute a flour which is not 100 % starch , and the remaining ingredients wo n't get into the way . Thickening is one such application , another one is preventing dough from sticking . But in general , you can not assume that starch can be substituted for flour or the other way round . You 'd have to know how it works in your recipe so you can judge if the substitution is possible . As for the word use , some starches do n't need to be extracted by a special process , because the plant part in question already consists of starch and nothing else . They are produced by milling this plant part , and they are both a flour and a starch at the same time . The prevalent use of the word " starch " or " flour " is then a matter of cultural accident , and , as David Richerby notes , it can happen that different languages or dialects pick a different term , but this happens rarely . The terms are usually distinct and not ambiguous , especially for plants where you use both , such as wheat flour and wheat starch . Appendix : nitty gritty details on the special case of corn The corn flour case is a very complicated one . There you have many words whose meaning can overlap : corn starch is only the milled inner part of the kernel . It is a flour which is also a starch . It can be modified , and then it should n't be technically considered a flour any more . cornflour is the UK term for the milled inner part of the corn kernel , as David Richerby points out . However , in many countries the word ( or its literal translation ) is used for whole grain corn flour , which is yellow , and chemically has other ingredients than pure starch . the milled whole corn kernel is sometimes also called polenta . polenta also can be a word for corn semolina , which is also a milled kernel , but the particle size is larger than a flour . yet another meaning of polenta is a pap cooked from a milled whole kernel of either size ( semolina or flour ) . the pap cooked from pure corn starch is never a polenta , it is a pudding or blanchmange . These words are also used when the pap is cooked from pure starch extracted from another plant .
I think some sort of mechanical aid to macerate the food is necessary for your project . Depending on what dish you attempt , there are few options . A ricer ( or food mill , depending on who you buy from ) is a manual device ( non-electric ) that you might run cooked potatoes or parsnips through . Many people do mashed potatoes this way . Depending how cooked your parsnips get , a hand blender ( or immersion blender , stick blender ) may work . However , all of this requires you to shell out some cash for a device . I 'm not sure , from your post , if that 's an option . If you 're going for ultra-smooth texture for a bisque or other soup , it might be worth it to get one of the small-bowl food processors ( just work in batches ) . Good luck !
Use a higher chicken-to-marinade ratio , so a small amount of chicken is n't sitting in masses of marinade . If you see chicken tikka marinading in a restaurant , you 'll note that is only lightly coated . Failing 1. , simply wipe off the excess marinade before cooking .

The only trick I know is to let it start to firm up before mixing in the fruit . You can pour a layer , let it slightly firm up ( it 'll be kinda a thick goo ) , add the fruit and the rest of the mix . ... but you do n't want to let it set up completely ; then you 'll just have two layers that have n't bonded well with fruit stuck in there . Exact time for it to gel depends on what temperature you 're resting it , and the size of the container you 're chilling it in ( mostly it 's a matter of surface to mass ratio )
Hooves are generally not eaten directly but make great soup . If you Google ' trotter soup ' , you will find recipes from many different culinary traditions , most of them middle-eastern or from the Indian sub-continent . This page has some typical recipes : <URL> Although trotter generally means pig 's hooves in the west , it 's used to mean any hooves in the east .
I 've been reviewing old family recipes , and I 've seen pickled onions called for in some soup , stew , and casserole recipes as an accent ; this may or may not be because my foremothers grew and canned loads of onions . It 's worth an experiment or two , I think !
Wilting in greens is triggered by temperature , pH , and salt content . To reduce wilting , you can cool the vegetables or shrimp , make the vegetables more acidic * , or decrease their salt content . My suggestion would be to cool the shrimp with an ice water bath or cold running water . This is the most traditional approach for shrimp salad . Alternately , you could apply an acidic dressing before topping , but wait to salt it until the shrimp have cooled to 140F . Alternately , wilting of vegetables adds a rather interesting variation in flavor or texture to a salad . This technique has been desirable and in vogue at various times . Why does this all happen ? Plant cells wilt when cooking breaks apart the cellulose-based cell walls , and allows water to escape , causing them to soften . To quote On Food and Cooking ( pp 282 ) : When the tissue reaches 140F/60C , the cell membranes are damaged , the cells lose water and deflate , and the tissue as a whole goes from firm and crisp to limp and flabby . Acids will impede wilting , because the cell walls are held together with hemicellulose , and it is " not very soluble in an acid environment " ( pp 282 ) . Table salt is a problem , because " its sodium ions displace the calcium ions that cross-link and anchor the cement molecules in the fruits and vegetable walls , thus breaking the cross-links and helping dissolve the hemicelluloses " ( pp 283 ) . Calcium has the opposite affect , so if you can use hard water or add calcium salts , do so . * Acidic solutions will reduce green colors ( On Food and Cooking , pp 280-281 ) , but preserve texture ( 282 ) .

I use beer a LOT for my cooking . As the others have said , you need to watch out for the bitterness , which can intensify when you cook and reduce it down . As such , I often cook with different beers than I drink . You can use the IBU ( International Bitterness Unit ) rating for a beer to get an idea of whether your favorite beer will be a problem . Personally , I use Guinness and other dark beers when red wine is called for in a recipe . The flavors are definitely different than the red wine version , but it usually comes out good . I also cook quite a bit with wheat beers and the kind of beers that people describe as " nutty " , like porters . America 's Test Kitchen looked at beers for cooking at one point and a " non-alcoholic " beer actually did really well : O'Doul 's Amber . I agree with them and tend to keep it on hand for cooking , even though I never drink it . It stays mellow and away from the bitter flavors when used for cooking . So , what do I cook with it ? Like most of the others , cooking bratwurst before grilling and cheese fondue , but I also use it for lots of other stuff . I have a baked bean version that uses 4 cans of beer and a couple of shots of whiskey and sits in a crock pot on low for 24 hours . I 've made this with all different kinds of beer and each brings something different to the results . ( <URL> ) I also like using beer in most of my stews . Throw beef chunks , veggies and beer in the crock pot in the morning and it 's a tasty stew when you get home . It works well as the liquid for braising pork or beef . In the winter , I 'll often throw a pork shoulder roast into the crock pot with a bottle of beer and let it slow cook all day . When it 's completely falling apart , I pull it out , shred it and add back as much of the beer as the shredded mess will hold ( which turns out to be far more than you thought ) . What results is a juicy sandwich option , which is really good , topped with mustard or bbq sauce . It comforts me when it 's too cold to deal with slow smoking pork ( I live in MN ) . I 'll also often take some of that shredded " drunk " pork to my baked beans and give the beans some extra dimension . We do a version of " bangers and mash " that I use beer in the gravy/sauce that I like . Beer and self-rising flour make for a really quick quickbread that has an interesting flavor profile . I particularly like using wheat beers like Leinenkugel 's Sunset Wheat , as the wheat flavors work well in a bread . Beers ( and hard ciders , which I actually REALLY like ) work well for marinades . Beyond that , I tend to find myself just tossing a few ounces of it into a lot of other liquids/sauces to add some flavor .
Because onions contain a lot of flavour compounds that we like , and which are synergistic with meats .
Yes , but the trick is not to have the dough in the microwave when it 's on : place the dough into a wide , shallow bowl , and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap . Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water , and float a toothpick or a grain of rice in it . Microwave the water 'til it 's boiling . Place the bowl with the dough above the boiling water ; the water level should not touch the upper bowl . Close the microwave and wait . ( the plastic wrap is n't absolutely necessary ... but it prevents you from steaming the outside of the dough , changing its moisture content ) The toothpick ( or similar ) is necessary , as it prevents the water from heating above its boiling point and spontaneously boiling when you nudge it . .
Marinades and Rubs are " surface treatments " only , they do not penetrate deeply into the meat . A brine is a deep treatment , which does penetrate by way of osmosis . For a quick explanation of this see <URL>
The problem is that you 're using a lid . Spatter screens keep the oil mostly contained , while still allowing any moisture to escape . A lid , on the other hand , collects the moisture on the underside of the lid . When you go to lift it , the water drops back into the oil , and causes increased spattering . You 're actually better off without a lid , if you do n't have a spatter screen . Yes , you 'll likely have to clean everything in the vicinity of the vessel of hot oil , but you do n't have the problems associated with the lid .
I discussed a similar subject in this question : <URL> Raw fish is n't safe to eat if it 's just been sitting around . However , the raw fish used in sushi/sashimi has been frozen ( typically flash-frozen ) in order to kill any parasites , making it as safe as any other food . Most distributors of sashimi also have their own methods and internal regulations to ensure food safety , but specifics are understandably hard to come by . Suffice it to say , it 's far safer to eat properly-prepared nigiri or sashimi than it is to eat an undercooked hamburger .

How important is the creaming process while making a cake ?
The purpose mixing the butter and sugar until creamy is to distribute air through the batter that will help leaven the cake in the oven . Skipping this step can create a denser cake . You want to add the air into the batter before adding the flour in order to prevent over mixing , which creates gluten ; causing a tougher texture . Beating the eggs until foamy and folding them into the batter or adding the eggs to the butter/sugar and beating until fluffy will also create a lighter texture . The sugar does not need to dissolve in the butter , but it should be evenly distributed . <URL> gives a good visual on how creamed butter &amp; sugar should look .

Depends on how fine you have shaved the rind/zest , you can consider candying it ( boil it in syrup till it become very transparent ) or dip it in chocolate after candying it . if it is too fine , then add it into your next chocolate recipe to get orange-flavoured chocolate ...
I immediately thought of this table , from the front of the muffin section in <URL> * : The baking times are for 375-400F ; most recipes will fall around that range . Note that the yields do n't necessarily match up to typical pan sizes ; for example , if you take a recipe meant for 12 regular muffins , you 'll probably have more batter than you need for a pan of 6 oversized muffins . Similarly , if your recipe says to bake regular muffins for 30 minutes , you might have to bake miniature ones a bit over 15 minutes . " Muffin cake " refers to baking in an 8-9 " pan of some sort - the author says that you can get away with it for any muffin recipe , but I 've never tried it ! P.S. I know this is for muffins , but cupcakes are fairly similar , so I think it 'll be about right ! * At least , I 'm pretty sure it is . I have a copy of just this page ( for the recipe next to the table , actually ) , from a book my mom has . I recognize the cover , I know we had that book , I think this was in it , and Google book search somehow found it when I searched for " fresh-lemon muffins " .
One kitchen I used to work in had a dry store that was basically a shed and in winter when the flour would be particularly cold we would always warm the flour before making bread . It always worked beautifully . The thing is you 're looking for the overall best temperature for your dough for the yeast to be active . So it 's no good mixing warmish water with cold flour - your dough temp will keep the yeast sluggish . That was our theory anyway .
This question has become blown out of proportion . I was just curious - then I started getting answers that quickbreads and cake are the same thing - which they " obviously " are n't . So I started doing my own research . <URL> says that the term quickbread was probably invented in the US after the discovery of chemical leavening . The Wikipedia references and some dictionaries corroborate this definition . Basically anything leavened with soda is quickbread . This does n't work . There are a great many things leavened with soda that ca n't be called quickbread . A good example is plain old <URL> . Obviously this is a semantic issue but one that needed solving . Two American cookbooks that I consider canonical recipe resources , The Joy of Cooking , and the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook , both have a separate quickbread section . In it are a variety of fruit breads as well as some biscuits and scones . On Food and Cooking muddied the water a bit by differentiating between quick breads such as biscuits and batter breads such as banana bread . These were grouped together , however , and contrasted against cakes . This book says that cakes are higher in fat and sugar and have a more delicate texture . Ratio , as linked <URL> , confused the terms a bit more also including a term " quick cake " but it differentiated between the different products with distinct ratios for the flour , fat , and sugar . With several competing definitions I decided to take an unscientific poll . I called 6 friends in Washington , Utah , Georgia , and Texas . I tried to find a variety of American cultures . Obviously it is biased by the fact that I know all of them . When asked " What is quickbread to you ? " without exception all of them replied " banana bread " When I followed up with : " What is the difference between that and cake " I received the following answers : " It is eaten at breakfast " " It has less sugar " " It is loaf shaped " " It is more dense " " It has a more open texture " My conclusion is that the historical definition of " anything with soda " is no longer useful . In cookbooks it seems to now be applied to chemically risen baked goods that : have as a rule of thumb a particular ratio of flour , fat , and sugar have less sugar than cake refers in particular to fruit breads , biscuits , and scones generally has an irregular vs uniform texture The popular definition ( among my extremely limited , unrandom sampling ) adds : tends to be loaf shaped And now I can sleep easily again .
First , double check that your oven temps are accurate with a thermometer that you can place in the oven . After that , two things I would try . . Rack Positioning I 've baked meringues at similar temps without browning . It could be the position of the rack within the oven ? If it was mainly the top that browned , move lower . If it was mainly the bottom that browned , move higher . Turn Off the Oven The other thing you could try is turning the oven off for the second stage of baking . I 've baked meringues at 200 degrees F for an hour before , then I turn off the oven , prop the door open for about 5 minutes to cool , then close the door for a few hours . Hope one of these give you the results you 're looking for .
I always let pizza dough rounds rise on a flat surface . A few options : Use plastic wrap or a large bowl covered by towel or plastic , as others have said . The dough can still stick to plastic wrap , but at least you 're not cleaning it off a towel . Invert a bowl over the dough that has a slightly larger diameter than the estimated final diameter of the dough . The dough will likely not dry out much , if at all . Make a proofing box with higher humidity . This is my preferred method . You just need a way to create a somewhat enclosed area of higher humidity . This can generally be accomplished with a cup filled with hot or boiling water initially . Some people use a microwave . ( Place dough in microwave along with cup of hot water . Shut door . Let proof . ) Others use a small oven . If you need more space , you can use an inverted large pan if you have one , or an inverted plastic bin . If you do n't have any of that and want to go really cheap , you can even make a larger box out of a cardboard box -- just tape up the bottom to " seal " very roughly , cut off the top flaps , and invert over your dough , along with the cup of hot water . It wo n't be a " tight seal , " but it will be enough to keep the dough surface moist for a while . ( For a very long proof , you can replace the water periodically as necessary . ) Professional bakers often have climate-controlled areas with higher humidity for these purposes . There are smaller proofing boxes manufactured for home use , though they tend to be quite pricey .
Because of the dairy products , you should n't leave it un-chilled for more than 4 hours . It 's always best to cover your food to prevent dust ( or cat fur , for example ) from covering it . Unless the frosting is really wet and gooey ( which might run into the cake ) , it 's OK to frost now .
<URL> describes the process by which yeast is commercially prepared in good detail for an overview . There are several stages of cultivation and growing and increasing the yeast biomass , culminating as its final steps : Treatments and packaging The yeast in the final trade bioreactor is concentrated by centrifugation and finally harvested by a filter press or a rotary vacuum filter , until it contains 27 -- 33 % of dry cell mass . The yeast cake is blended with suitable amounts of water and emulsifiers and cutting oils ( soybean or cottonseed oil ) to obtain its extrudable form . The yeast is then packaged and shipped as compressed fresh baker 's yeast , or thermolysed and dried to form various types of dry yeast . The dried yeast is packed under vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere . The packaging method varies among manufacturers and depends on the type of yeast product . Note that this process requires assorted items of industrial or laboratory equipment which may not be suitable to the home environment , including centrifuges and filter presses or vacuuum filters . If you really only want to preserve your starter strain without maintaining an active starter , simply drying a sample and then storing it in the freezer may be a better option . This process is described at <URL> .
Using the information from the links you provided and the information found at the <URL> ( your mileage will vary depending on brand ... ) and little math ( for the peanut 's sodium per 100g ) we learn that per 100g of each ingredient the sodium content is : Nutralite : 786mg/100g Amul : 836mg/100g Salted Peanuts : 430mg/100g If the <URL> calls for ( using the Amul ) : 4 cups of salted peanuts ( <URL> = > 600g peanuts = > 2500mg sodium ) and 2 tablespoons of butter ( <URL> = > 28g butter = > 234mg sodium ) So , loosing 2500mg sodium from the peanuts and only recouping 234mg sodium we need to add 2266 mg of sodium ... now , <URL> ... meaning that we need 5.6 grams of salt ... at <URL> means we should add about a teaspoon of salt . Mathematically , this ' makes sense ' , however given that the peanuts are probably to be added at the end I would suggest salting the peanuts directly and then mixing the peanuts ( with the salt added ) as directed . The process of creaming the butter may distribute the salt a little differently in the mix . I would suggest starting with 3/4 teaspoon of salt then adjusting taste .
Invert the bottom layer , top down , on a plate . Add the ice cream , but do not spread it to the outside edge of the cake . Top with the second cake layer , pressing gently . Then , using a sharp knife , slice vertically completely around the edge , removing the sloped edges of the cake . Surround the outside edge with a wrap of parchment paper or foil . Chill . After the cake is firm , you can slice horizontally to level the mound at the top of the cake , if you wish , before removing the paper/foil cuff .
I have halved cake recipes before without issue . The most complicated thing to worry about is halving an odd number of eggs , but <URL> addresses that . The finished product was indistinguishable from the full recipe . Edit One thing to note . In your specific case , because it 's a two-layer cake , halving is simple because you 're only cooking a single layer . Halving other cakes , such as a pound cake , or a bundt cake involves adjustments to the cooking time . A halved cake will cook much quicker , and could possibly need a lower temperature as well as a decreased cooking time .
What I look for in a good mixer are : A comfortable grip ( I 'm sure we 've all have painful wrists after whisking up eggs whites or similar ) Well made , sturdy parts . ( some whisks are strong others are just thin wire . ) Variable speed control The Watt rating . To answer your No. 2 question , watts are important . They measure how much power the machine uses . Higher watts will mean the machine does more of the work and your wrist does less of the work . The cheapest machines on the market are only good for whipping light foods like cream and mayonnaise . If you plan on mixing up heavy fruit cakes or bread doughs , you should choose a higher wattage machine . Paying for a good quality machine , if you can afford it , will save you money in the end . My mother has had the same hand mixer for over 35 years . She paid for a good one and it lasted . I however , like you , opted for a low price machine because I was on a budget , I am now on my third and this time I bought a sturdier model and I am much more satisfied with it . If I 'd bought the better machine at first , I 'd have saved myself # 50 or so over the time .
You ask about coating , but it is actually not very important . There are other criteria with much higher priority when you are making caramel or other types of candy . The important thing about pan when making caramel is even heating . Especially when making your caramel dry , you can not afford hot spots , because you can not stir . But if you are taking the candy into the later caramel stages , even heating becomes important for syrup-started candy too . You need a responsive pan if you are making caramel . Sadly , the most evenly heating pans are also the least responsive and vice versa . I would never make caramel on a resistive stove in iron , but I use a small enamelled Dutch oven for caramel on my induction plate . A good sandwiched steel with an aluminum core should offer a decent tradeoff between evenness and responsiveness on most stove types . You also need the correct size pan . If your caramel is less than 1 cm deep , it is very hard to handle without burning it . If it is deeper than 5 cm , there is too much of a heat gradient in the depth . Choose the pan diameter such that your caramel depth will be between 1 and 5 cm roughly . If you are going to add any kind of liquid to the caramel ( or butter ) , you 'll experience lots of foam . You need a deep walled vessel to catch this foam . Use a deep sauce pan or a small pot instead of a frying pan . You want 10 cm wall above the caramel level . Aside from a seasoned cast iron pan , I have n't experienced a coating adsorbing flavors . PTFE , ceramic , enamel , anodized alu or no coating - none of them matters . Use whatever you have handy . For cleaning , follow Elendil 's advice for dissolving the smears in hot water .
You can definitely still cook it on the barbecue , just do n't ' cook it as long because the heat has less distance to penetrate . You can also try flipping the pieces more often so each side is n't exposed to the heat for too long , it ca n't penetrate too far into the meat before it is flipped over and begins cooling . This should allow you to get some nice crusting on the outside and keeping it juicy in the middle . Get that bbq SUPER hot .
Mostly it comes down to practice . However there are some tips and tools that can make it a lot easier . If you have a cake stand ( the kind that spins ) then you set the cake on the stand and slowly turn it with one hand while cutting forward and back with the other ( trying to keep the cutting hand as level as possible ) . Another option is to buy a cake leveler <URL> - if you make a lot of cakes it can be very handy .
I have never made madeleines myself , but looking at the recipe and reading Elendil 's concerns about the batter running , I would think you could fashion an impromptu " madeleine pan " out of aluminum foil . It wo n't be the easiest thing in the world , and you 're not going to get the perfect shell look , but I think you 'll be able to get the right general shape and depth with a little craftwork . These look like something I would love to make , so I did a little research and a few people said they poured the batter into a sheet pan ( in a very thin layer ) and then cut them into squares after . Not exactly the same final product , but if you 're dying to use the batter I think it would still taste great . As Elendil suggested , the people who said they were able to make them on a cookie sheet found that they were very flat and crispy ( though still tasty ) .
Cook the chicken ahead of time . I doubt your pizza cooking time and your chicken cooking time will be a perfect match , and it is more likely than anything that your chicken would be undercooked . That would not be good for anyone . If you are worried about the chicken being dry on your pizza , you can try par-cooking the pieces instead of fully cooking them ( though that may be a little dangerous , too ) , or you can add the cooked pieces to the pizza after it has begun baking .
It is traditionally served with coffee when getting together with friends for coffee ; kind of like tea-cakes are served at tea-time .

What 's the difference between hollandaise , mayonnaise , and aïoli ?
<URL> , at its most basic , is egg yolk and oil , with a little vinegar , whipped into an emulsion . <URL> starts with oil and garlic , and sometimes vinegar or lemon . Some versions ( French-Provençal , apparently ) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise , but the yolk is not required . <URL> is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter , sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper . I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it , since it remains brightly yellow and thick . <URL> is a variation of hollandaise , which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter , and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot , chervil , and tarragon . Like an aioli , it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents . Adding terragon and capers , or tarragon and shallots , to a hollandaise ( or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce ) will produce a ' faux-bearnaise ' . The garlic defines the aioli , which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk . The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise , and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks ( which neither of the others require ) . The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise , while it can be flavored , it does n't have to be . The sauces are quite similar , though , and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name . The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle . Likewise , a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it , so the texture may be different . And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic . Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce . All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined , since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes . The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin , familiarity , and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference .
Whipped cream is whipping cream after it has been whipped . Whipping cream is just cream with at least 30 % fat content ( that would be called Light Whipping Cream in the US ) . Heavy Whipping Cream contains at least 36 % fat and up to 40 % and rarely ( in the US ) even higher . Until these creams are whipped , they are just liquid . After they are whipped , they 're fluffy . A way to know that whipped cream is " done " is that it holds " peaks " , like in the first picture . Higher fat cream will thicken more readily , and hold its structure longer . Other countries use different terms for various levels of fat in cream . <URL> Whipped Cream : Whipping cream :
I have just looked in the book " Thai Food " ( by David Thompson ) . Both are very similar . The main difference I can see is that there are souring agents in the red curry ( fish sauce and shrimp paste ) . These are absent in the panaeng which has peanuts as a major ingredient in the paste ( and nutmeg ) . The panaeng is also usually made with beef which is simmered in count milk until tender .
Here 's a report on an informally conducted taste test suggesting that there are indeed detectable differences between various vodkas : ( the report does not say so , but I suspect that much like wine , whether one vodka comes out as better as another one has little to do with its price , except at the very bottom end of the price range ) And , yes , there are differences -- a truth known by anyone in the liquor industry with a little sense . But one that is frequently forgotten -- partly because our government insists on characterizing vodka as a " colorless , flavorless , odorless " beverage ; [ ... ] That there are subtle , and sometimes dramatic , differences in flavor and odor between one vodka and another was driven home recently by a daylong seminar hosted by Absolut . [ ... ] Central to the event was a blind tasting of 12 different vodkas . [ ... ] The main lesson of the tasting -- or re-learned lesson , since many of us in the room knew it already -- is that the biggest difference between the flavors of various vodkas derives from the source material , and that difference is easily detected , if you pay attention . Vodka can be distilled from anything , but the most common raw materials are grain and potatoes , with a few using molasses and grapes and other things . Grape-sourced vodka typically has a fruitier character ; grain-sourced has the expected bready , yeasty and , yes , grainy notes , with the rye vodkas having more bit and spark than the barley or wheat ones ; and potato-sourced vodka has a rounder , sometimes buttery flavor . From : <URL> Another taste test conducted by the New York Times suggests the same thing : Delving into the world of vodka reveals a spirit unlike almost any other , with standards that make judging it substantially different from evaluating wine , beer , whiskey or even root beer . A malt whiskey should be distinctive , singular . The same goes for a Burgundy or a Belgian ale . But vodka ? Vodka is measured by its purity , by an almost Platonic neutrality that makes tasting it more akin to tasting bottled waters , or snowflakes . [ ... ] A lack of distinctiveness is a separate matter from a lack of distinction . The vodkas we tasted had character and their own flavors and aromas , even though the differences among them were often subtle and difficult to articulate . [ ... ] That being said , at the end of our tasting it was Smirnoff at the top of our list , ahead of many other names that are no doubt of higher status in stylish bars and lounges . [ ... ] The prices of these vodkas ranged from a low of $ 13 for the Smirnoff to a high of $ 34 for Potocki , a Polish vodka that did not make our cut . The Belvedere also cost $ 34 , but that was for a liter rather than the usual 750 milliliter bottle . Imported vodkas tend to cost more , partly because of taxes levied by various governments , currency exchange rates and , not least , marketing concerns : as has been proved in many industries , wine not least of all , raising the price of a product increases its status among consumers . From : <URL> As a counterpoint , here 's another report suggesting most people can not tell the difference : To summarize our findings , Given a particular brand of vodka , people prefer its taste after it has been filtered , but this is most likely because filtration reduces the alcohol content . Most people ca n't tell the difference between an expensive vodka with high alcohol content and a cheaper vodka with lower alcohol content . Our second experiment demonstrated approximately equal preferences for Pavlova and Ketel One . Although Pavlova contains 3-5 % less alcohol by volume than Ketel One , it is also 70 % cheaper , so it would seem a clear winner . From : <URL>
I addition to what Tabiasopdenbrouw said , and more to the point of usage/taste : Bacon is typically cut thinner and ends up crispier than pancetta . Both are often rendered for their fat before adding onions , peppers , etc. . . to the pan to pick up those pork fat flavors . Pancetta is often saltier in flavor though this is usually the case because the pancetta is cut thicker or into dices , so you get bigger bites of it and thus more salt . This is the biggest different between the two .
The problem is , both Sarge 's and Carmi 's answers are right depending on who is using the word . Some people use the word seasoning to just mean salt , some mean salt and pepper , and some mean " anything you want to use to bring the flavor to the desired point , including salt , pepper , lemon juice , spices , herbs , etc. " If you are dealing with someone in person , it is best to ask . With a cookbook , sometimes you can figure it out from context or from other recipes . Otherwise , you 'll have to make your own best call . In my own recipes , I will generally write " taste and adjust seasoning , adding salt and/or more lemon juice as needed " .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
First off , the terminology issue . So , can someone please clear up this fog ? What 's the difference between Microwave and Oven and Microwave Oven ? <URL> Both terms mean the same thing : an appliance that uses microwave radiation to heat food . Cooking food in this way is called " microwaving " . An oven , on the other hand , has a heating element which heats the air inside , which then heats the food . Cooking food in this way is generally called " baking " , though there are a lot of other things ( e.g. roasting ) you can also reasonably do in an oven . So if all you have is a microwave , then all you can do is microwave ( not bake ) . And if you have an oven , then you can bake ( but of course you ca n't microwave ) . There also exist combinations , which are capable of both microwaving and baking , i.e. they have a microwave emitter and a heating element . However , remember that in the US - and thus on much of the internet - something talking about a " microwave oven " likely does not mean this combination , but simply microwave heating . Names like " convection microwave oven with grill " , " combination microwave/oven " do refer to these combinations , though . I 've also seen " speed oven " . You may sometimes have seen people referring to these combination microwave/ovens as a " microwave oven " ( I think this may be common in Indian English ) , but that 's really just imprecise language . Some sites say that a " microwave " is only for heating or re-heating cooked food . Whereas , in " microwave ovens " , you can microwave and bake . Is that true ? It sounds like in this statement , " microwave oven " is careless language , referring to a combination microwave and oven . ( It does n't make any sense at all otherwise ; the two things are the same thing , so of course you can do the same things in them . ) So the question is really , what can you do in a microwave vs an oven , or a combination microwave/oven ? It 's true that microwaves are mainly used for reheating cooked food , and it 's true that they ca n't actually bake . However , they can do a lot more than reheat food ; there are a lot of kinds of cooking besides baking . For example , microwaves are great at simmering/boiling and steaming , and it does n't matter if the food was cooked already or not . The recipes you 're talking about are probably mostly in those kinds of categories , but if you 're interested , <URL> discusses in a bit more detail what works in microwaves . The big things that you can do with ovens but not microwaves are the things that actually need the steady dry heat of baking . You ca n't bake bread or cookies or roast a chicken in a microwave . Microwaves hold in a lot of steam and do n't get terribly hot , so you ca n't generally get things to brown or crisp up . They also do n't really hold a temperature like you need for baking , they just pump more and more heat into the food .
The difference for green onions will be most noticable if you do n't cook them . Instead , slice them up and use them for a garnish over the dish . The white portion of the green onion will still be oniony , but not quite as strong as a raw red onion . Slice them thinly and use for garnish if you really want to bring out the onion qualities of them . If you do n't want it too strong , then add them when you 're cooking . ( and you might not want to slice them as thin ) . The green portion gives a more mild onion taste but also some of the grassy quality that you might get from chives . I treat them like a fresh herb , chop them up , and add in them in the last minute of cooking or I do n't cook them at all . As for substitution ... I 'd only plan to do it if you were cooking for someone who did n't like onions , as they 're milder and come in smaller portions than bulb onions , so it 's easier to control amounts without any waste . ... and I 'd do it if I had them on hand but did n't have bulb onions around . If you 're just looking for a good way to feature the green onions -- grill them . Trim the ends off , clean off any dirt , give them a coat of oil , then toss them on a hot pan or grill . They make a great side dish . Other good uses are to add them into scrambled eggs , green onion pancakes , or press them into naan before cooking it . ... For the white onions , the opposite is true -- they 're generally stronger than red onions . Most people do n't serve it as a raw garnish unless it 's very thinly sliced and used in small amounts . It 's still used raw , but it tends to be blended into other things such as pico de gallo , or guacamole , where the pungency of the onion helps to balance out the sweetness of the tomatoes or richness of the avocado . I 'm having difficulty thinking of a dish where the qualities of the white onion would stand out , though . My only idea is french onion soup , because it just comes out lacking if you make it with sweeter red or yellow onions ... but unless you made them side by side and compared them , I do n't know that you 'd see the difference . You might try cooking them slowly over medium heat until they caramelize ... it 'd let you feature the onions without them being overwhelming , and it brings out some of their more interesting qualities .
It 's hard to know exactly what you 're referring to without any context of the event , location , or what you remember it tasting like , so I 'll give you my best educated guesses . If your pink tea sweet and fruity or floral , it was an herbal tea - <URL> , and not true tea . ( " Tea " actually refers to the plant whose leaves are used the beverage . Anything that is not made from the tea tree is usually called a tisane . ) Some varieties of tisanes that produce a pink liquid include hibiscus , rose petals , rose hips , strawberry . If the above is not the case , I suspect you 're referring to Kashmiri pink tea , sometimes called noon chai . Disclaimer : I ca n't find any authoritative sources about Kashmiri online ; my knowledge of the subject is anecdotal from my own travels in India as well as stories from people I know who have lived or traveled in South Asia . My understanding is that , like masala chai throughout South Asia , pink tea has some general guidelines but everyone customizes it according to taste or local custom . The basic distinguishing factors of Kashmiri pink tea compared to a " regular " black , green , oolong , or white tea are twofold : color and taste . As you mentioned , this tea is pink in color , which other beverages made from the tea tree are not . The pink color comes from the addition of baking soda . As for taste , pink tea tends to elicit mixed opinions about taste because it is salty ; most people around the world typically drink tea unadulterated , or sweetened , but rarely with the addition of salt . Pink tea shares many ingredients with <URL> , often including some or all of the following : Ginger Cardamom Cinnamon Peppercorns Milk or cream Sugar ( or other sweetener ) Unlike masala chai , which is normally prepared with black tea , Kashmiri pink tea uses green or oolong tea leaves . Ingredients included in Kashmiri chai that are not included in most other chai recipes : baking soda ( just a pinch ) ground pistachios and/or almonds salt white poppy seeds The final major difference is in the method of preparation . Masala chai can be made in a matter of minutes by boiling the water , then adding tea , milk , spices and boiling it all together for a few minutes before straining and serving . Kashmiri chai , on the other hand , takes 1-2 hours to prepare ( I believe the long boiling time is required for the baking soda to accomplish its task of turning the tea pink ) . I do n't know the exact process and could n't find any sources that seemed reliable .
Pies originally were specifically to denote enclosed items ( the crust sealed the item that was to be eaten ) . In many cases , the crust was n't actually eaten -- it was a nasty charred thing that was discarded . In time , pie crusts improved to the point at which you 'd eat the whole thing ... but the star was the filling , not the crust . Tarts , on the other hand , are closer to a shortbread cookie with some sort of a topping . The crust is typically a critical part of the item , rather than just being a container for something else . ( which in part is why people mention tarts being more shallow ; there 's a higher proportion of crust to filling ) . So , my best attempt at determining if I should call something a pie or a tart . Note that these are in order . ( as I 'm trying to make sure that ' pizza ' is a pie , not a tat ) fully enclosed by crust : pie full bottom crust , with a crumb or lattice top : pie no crust at all : not a tart , but not a pie , either . has no sugar or fat in the crust : pie chewy , flaky or crumb crust : pie not structurally sound enough to be picked up and eaten one-handed : pie was cooked in a tart pan : tart baked without a pan : galette over 2 " / 5cm tall ( not counting whipped cream or berries ) : pie less than 6 " / 15cm across : tart shortbread crust : tart ... I have no idea what I 'd categorize thing that did n't match something already .
Enchiladas are normally shredded meat and/or cheese rolled in corn tortillas , covered in red ( or green ) enchilada sauce and cheese , and then baked . Fajitas are normally strips of meat either grilled or sauteed ( often with onions and peppers ) . They can be used in tacos , burritos , or served on their own or with tortillas on the side ( corn or flour depending on preference ) . Tacos can be either hard or soft shelled and are usually meat ( shredded , ground , grilled etc ) with some sort of cold veggies ( like lettuce , raw onions , pico de gallo , etc ) and perhaps cheese etc. .
It mostly depends on the heat used . If you are cooking at a high enough heat that vegetables and thinly-sliced meats ( if using ) are cooked through in only a few minutes then it matches with the term generally used as " <URL> " . In this heat , if you stop stirring even for a moment , pretty much , the food at the hottest part of the pan ( at the base , near the flame ) will start to burn . It needs to be in motion constantly . That 's the stir part of the stir-fry -- constant motion up the curved sides where it is cooler and letting other parts of the food go to the bottom to the heat and around and around . A full dish of meat , veg , noodles , etc can be completely cooked start to finish in just about 5 minutes . <URL> demonstrates stir-frying baby bok choy in 2 1/2 minutes of cooking time for the veg , <URL> for 2 minutes , and <URL> at 3-5 minutes . <URL> should also be at a fairly high heat and generally with less oil ( although stir-frying does n't use a lot of oil either , usually ) . The heat is lower than what is implied by stir-fry . With sautéing you are still generally keeping things moving , but it does n't need to be quite as frantic . You can let things stop a moment , and it can help to let them start to brown and caramelize . To demonstrate , <URL> for sautéed baby bok choy cooks them for 7 minutes , <URL> for 9-11 minutes , <URL> cooking it for 4 minutes . The fastest of these is twice as slow as most of the the stir-fry or about the same as the slowest stir-fry . The slowest of these sauté recipes is nearly 3-5 times as slow as the stir-fry with fairly similar ingredients , especially similar to the slowest of the stir-fry recipes . But to be fair , <URL> I was , strictly speaking , abusing the term sautéing by conflating it with even more moderate temperatures ( which are more properly simply called " pan frying " ) . A kadai is a good implement to use for stir-frying , but a kadai can also be used for cooking at a slightly lower temperature . Simply using a kadai does not 100 % determine the end result will be either a stir-fry or a sauté or a gentle fry , or even deep-frying . It 's a versatile vessel . :-)
The previously accepted answer contains a good link , but not any information here on Seasoned Advice , so I thought I would write out a few things from my understanding after having developed an abiding interest in Cajun foods over the past decade . Basically , <URL> is a much broader term with a longer history . While it is perhaps inaccurate to say <URL> is a ' subset ' area and culinary style , it is more geographically - and flavor-specific than just saying Creole . The history of people and region identified as Creole ( on the American continents ) goes back a long ways , and Cajun is a more recent phenomenon . Creole can also refer to other peoples and regions other than just in the South/Central parts of North America , though such use in the United States is a distant memory . In the past century , the " Cajun " term has certainly attained an independent status as a self-identified people , region , and flavor -- the last no doubt owing to the flavor potency of their offerings . Which offerings , in my opinion , when consumed , are nearly always exquisitely enjoyable examples of perfection in the experience of food .
I found a link that will provide the explanation you are looking for : <URL> Here is a direct quote from the site : Masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater ( cal ) , soaked overnight , and then ground up while still wet . Sold in this form , it 's called fresh masa , and it makes the lightest , fluffiest tamales . In Mexico , it can be purchased at tortilla factories in two ways : with smooth consistency for making tortillas and , upon request ( if you are lucky ) , with a coarser consistency for making tamales . ( Be careful to differentiate between masa para tamales and masa preparada para tamales ; the latter , available at some tortilla factories and large Mexican groceries , is the coarse-textured masa mixed with lard and flavorings .
Hibachi are technically a traditional Japanese device used for heating one 's house . They are a basic , heat-proof container that holds charcoal . The cooking devices that many people refer to as " hibachi " are what the Japanese would call " <URL> " : I 'm guessing that the term " hibachi " was popularized in North America because <URL> . Somewhere along the way , primarily in North America , the term " hibachi " also started to be used to refer to <URL> : I 'm not sure when or why this started ; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that <URL> confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as " hibachi-style " . Among these , teppanyaki is most similar to <URL> , in which meat is cooked on large , round , cast iron griddles : ( Images taken from Wikipedia . ) If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin , it would likely be referred to as " <URL> " , which is believed to have some origins in <URL> . Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time , " Mongolian barbecue " was developed in the 1970s in Taipei , Taiwan . During that time , Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan , so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue . There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish " <URL> " and Mongolian barbecue , however , jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue .
If the milk is modified by removing the lactose , it is no longer considered milk , and must be sold under a different name , such as milkdrink . The fat content can be modified while still considering it milk however . The swedish FAQ of Valio ( the biggest dairy producer in Finland ) is very clear on this . <URL> I could n't however find the same quote in the Finnish FAQ ( Via google translate ) . <URL> While the legislation could in theory be different between the two countries , I believe this is probably regulated on EU level .
Biologically speaking , they are actually different species , but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions . For example , spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns . Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs , shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs . Their gills and body shape are different too . As far as cooking them goes , they are virtually identical and interchangeable . <URL> <URL>
There are three major properties an edible fat ( I am assuming you are not asking about inedible oils like petroleum based products ) has that affect how it is best used : Flavor Saturation Smoke point Properties Flavor The flavor of the fat is very important . So called <URL> ( like canola oil or refined grapeseed oil , or refined peanut oil , among many others ) have very little flavor and so are suitable for almost any cooking task , as they will not interfere with or compete with the other flavors in the dish . Other oils such as sesame oil are primarily used for the delicious flavor that they provide , and are almost more of a condiment than an oil for culinary purposes . In between are oils like olive oil and coconut oil which have a distinctive flavor , but also have good qualities for cooking . Many non-oil fats used in cooking ( like butter , or bacon fat , lard , or suet ) also have distinctive flavors . Saturation The level of <URL> in the fat controls how hard the fat is at room temperature . Most oils are fairly low in saturation , and are so quite liquid even at room temperature . The major exceptions among the vegetable based lipids are coconut oil and cocoa butter . Coconut oil is solid at room temperature , and cocoa butter is actually quite hard at room temperature . Note that while you only asked about " oils " , many common cooking fats not usually called an oil are much more saturated , including butter , lard , and hydrogenated vegetable oil such as the US brand Crisco . The level of saturation can affect texture of baked goods made with a given oil , and whether the fat is suitable for the creaming method or in making laminated pastry in baking . Saturated fats also resist rancidity better over time better than non-saturated fats ( although they are still subject to rancidity ) . Smoke Point The smoke point of a fat or oil is temperature to which it can be heated before it begins smokng . Oils which have a high smoke point ( such as grapeseed oil or peanut oil among others ) are more suitable for high temperature searing , or deep frying . Applications The oil for a given application is based on the properties it has . Cooking For general cooking uses ( by which I am inferring general sauteeing , shallow frying , greasing of casserole dishes , and so on is meant ) , normally you want a fat which is either : Neutral in flavor so as not to interfere with the dish . The neutral oils are all useful for this . Complimentary in flavor , to enhance the dish . Many cuisines have traditional fats which are flavorful , but are integrated into their cuisine , such as olive oil or butter . Saturation matters less ( as the fat can be melted before greasing a pan , for example ) , and smoke point is not terribly relevant unless the application is searing , in which case you want a very high smoke point . Depending on the application and the cuisine from which a dish derives , almost any oil or fat may be used for general cooking purposes . The major exception is sesame oil , which is so flavorful that it is used as a condiment , not a fat , for culinary purposes . Deep Frying The most important aspect for deep frying is smoke point . A low smoke point oil would break down and add off flavors to the dish ( not to mention making the kitchen smoky and setting off smoke alarms ) . Secondarily , for oils that are going to be reused over time , saturated fats such as hydrogenated vegetable shortenings break down more slowly , and may be considered advantageous . Generally , flavorful oils are not indicated , as the same factors that give them good flavor often give them low smoke points . Some good oils for deep frying include peanut oil , canola oil , or hydrogenated vegetable shortening . Dressing For most dressings ( by which I infer you mean salad dressings as used in many Western style cuisines ) , the most important factors are flavor and saturation . You want an oil with good flavor ( such as olive oil ) or neutral flavor ( such as the many neutral oils like canola , refined peanut , corn oil , and so on ) . Most dressings also need an oil which is liquid at room temperature , and thus low in saturation . The major exception is the class of hot dressings made with bacon fat . Many dressings are made from olive oil , or one of the neutral oils . Baking While you did not ask about baking applications , there are two types of baking which require a fat with specific properties : cakes made by the creaming method , and laminated pastries like croissants or puff pastry . These applications require a fat which is solid at room temperature , but still plastic enough to be manipulated . Generally , only butter and hydrogenated vegetable oil are suitable . Bottom Line The oil or fat you choose for any particular purpose will be based on what is best for that application -- but a good neutral oil with a high smoke point such as refined peanut oil or canola oil can serve the vast majority of culinary purposes most of the time .

Gazpacho is possibly Spain 's most famous chilled soup . The main difference aside form the temperature is that it 's raw , meaning that the soup is not actually cooked it 's just blended and chopped vegetables and occasionally bread . There is nothing inherently wrong with heating up gazpacho but it would lose its fresh texture and flavour which is why it 's chilled and according to Wikipedia was popular with labourers who used it to : " cool off during the summer and to use available ingredients such as fresh vegetables and stale bread " The main reason you could n't just chill a normal soup and call it gazpacho is because gazpacho is made up of by no means just tomato . It contains tomatoes , a bit of garlic , cucumber , occasionally bread , some vinegar for tang and a drizzle of olive oil at the end . If you wanted to make it your own ( after all you 're the chef ! ) you could add some Tabasco , bell peppers , spring onions or croutons at the end , basically anything you might find in a salsa dip . Use your common sense for what not to add but even in Spain they have variations that are not at all like what I would think of as gazpacho : in La Mancha they use it like a stew and add game ( usually rabbit ) and even wild mushrooms ! Hope this helps and gives you some inspiration , if you want a recipe a quick search on Google gives a multitude of <URL> .

How long do oven elements last under high usage ?
In theory the elements could last 10 's of years , there is nothing in typical electric element design that limits their life . I would expect modern oven elements to last at least ten years with daily use They may fail prematurely due to damage ( being knocked ) in the oven while hot , from surface oxidation due to improper cleaning , or because of slight manufacturing faults
Last summer was a long time ago . The National Center for Food Preservation has this to say about <URL> Oils may be flavored with herbs if they are made up for fresh use , stored in the refrigerator and used within 2 to 3 days . There are no canning recommendations . ... Pesto is an uncooked seasoning mixture of herbs , usually including fresh basil , and some oil . It may be frozen for long term storage <URL> is a serious enough hazard with oiled herbs that I 'd not trust a dash of lemon juice on top of the oil to protect me from getting sick after 9 months storage . You 're much safer freezing the stuff as recommended . Ice cube trays produce nice pesto cubes that you can store safely in a freezer bag for at least a couple years .
If it 's raw , stick with the best-before date on the label . If cooked , you have at least <URL> , regardless of whether it 's pork , veal , or regular beef .
Marsala is a <URL> , that is , a wine to which extra alcohol has been added . Therefore , you can store Marsala outside of the fridge , in a cool place ( 15-20 ° C ) , away from direct light . In these conditions a bottle can sit there for several weeks/months with no obvious degradation , as you would expect for fortified wines . Generally it is suggested to drink Marsala or similar wines , such as Porto or Banyuls , in the following 4/5 months , but I had bottles opened for a year or so and they were still good , although the flavour faded a bit . As for Marsala all ' uovo , it has pasteurized egg yolks in it , and even home-made recipes call for a pasteurization step . In general I would store home-made one in the fridge to be on the safe side , but do not serve it too cold . Commercial ones may also have preservatives ( aside from the added alcohol of Marsala ) in them , and are safe to leave in a cool place for several weeks .
The cheesecake kept for 1 year just fine with no discernible off flavors or other problems . I 'm a homebrewer and we wound up putting the cheesecake into the freezer section of our spare ' beer fridge ' . That freezer is pretty much only used for overflow freezer space , and the refrigerator section is used for beer bottles and kegs , and we have had a few apples in the crispers for most of the year , but that 's it . The freezer section was rarely opened more than once per week . The cheesecake had no off flavors , and only had light water crystallisation on the surface , which was not at all detrimental to our enjoyment of the cake . This was a plain ' real ' cooked cheesecake with graham cracker crust . So , for a ' good enough ' storage method , wrap loosely in foil and store in a freezer that is rarely used , and the cheesecake should be excellent for at least one year .
If your chicken burns , the issue is likely not that you cooked it too long , but that you cooked it too hot . How long to cook it depends on the total amount of meat , the size of pieces that it is in ( anything from bite sizes pieces for a stir fry up to an entire chicken ) , and how you 're cooking it - oven , saute pan , braising ... Roasting in the oven or braising in a stew are generally the most ignorable techniques - if you overcook a roast it may dry out , but wo n't burn , and if you overcook a stew the meat ( especially chicken ) may dissolve into shreds but burning is less likely . Since undercooked chicken can be unsafe , you should choose cooking techniques that are sure to fully cook the chicken without burning it .
Possible reasons : Horrible temperature control - this is simply a problem of cheap construction . One could theoretically build an excellent toaster oven with precise temperature control , but why would you ? Low thermal mass - If you get an oven to 400F and open it for long enough to put in food , the result is an oven at very slightly less than 400F , and which will quickly return to 400F . Do that with a toaster oven , and who knows what temperature you 'll get , or how quickly it will get to your desired temperature ( if ever , see # 1 ) . This is not a slam at toaster ovens , this is just due to them being approximately 2 % of the volume of a standard oven . Closeness to elements . It 's easy for toaster ovens interiors to vary by nearly 50F from middle to edge , simply based on distance to elements Now do n't get me wrong , I once made some kickin ' Oysters Rockefeller in a toaster oven , when I thought that they would be the difference between serving an appetizer and being allowed to serve breakfast the next morning ( wink , wink ) . If you know what you 're doing , and watch carefully and continually , a toaster oven can be an excellent source of high ( ish ) direct heat . But they are extremely difficult to control , and extremely unforgiving of errors . I ca n't think of a circumstance where a toaster oven would be my first choice of cooking tool ( and that includes microwave , campfire , plumber 's blowtorch ) .
[ Edited ] I think 10 hours would be safe enough for most food : the first couple of hours the fridge will still be quite cold , and after that it takes more than a few ours for most food to spoil . When I leave milk out of the fridge for three hours at room temperature ( say , 20 ° C ) , nothing happens . I do this often . And the temperature inside the fridge will never reach room temperature in those 10 hours . When it is really hot in summer , it might spoil after 2 hours outside the fridge , but otherwise it takes much longer . Cheese , food in jars , sauces , leftover cooked food : none of these are more sensitive to spoiling than milk . Fresh herbs are probably equally sensitive . Eggs are much less sensitive . The most sensitive kinds of food I can think of are probably raw meat and raw fish without preservatives . Smoked or salted meat and fish do not count : they can be kept much longer . I think even raw meat and fish will pull through , but you might want to apply the following tips to be sure . Tip 1 : put as much material in your fridge as possible . That will " absorb the cold " that your fridge feeds it while power is still on . Then , once power goes out , the " cold reserve " in your fridge will be significantly increased , so that the average temperature of the interior will stay colder for a much longer time . The higher the <URL> , the better . See <URL> for the best material ; water probably wins . So stuffing bags of water in every nook and cranny would seem like a good idea . Or else bottles . Tip 2 : if you have a freezer , stuff it with bags and/or bottles of water , and put most of those in the fridge once power goes out ( swap with some of the bags/bottles that were in the fridge ) . The freezer will probably do better , because it has much better insulation than the fridge . And put the most sensitive foods in the freezer maybe a few hours after power goes out ( or maybe later -- lest they freeze after all ) . Actually , start putting as much water bags/bottles in the freezer as you can several hours before power goes out , and move them to the fridge once frozen . They will remain half-frozen for hours and hours in the fridge , so they will add extra coolness to the fridge . This way you 're " saving up " cold from the freezer and increasing your cold reserve even more . Tip 3 : most refrigerators have a temperature slide/wheel/thing , which determines what temperature the thermostat aims at . You could set the slide to maximum power ( so lowest temperature ) a few hours before the power outage . Most people , including me , have the slide somewhere in the middle normally . The slide usually does n't mark the exact temperature , but rather some symbols . It is usually found inside the refrigerator . Tip 4 : cook and/or eat any raw fish and meat before the outage . I think it would not be necessary at all if you follow the above tips , but cooking your meat now may just be simpler . Then either store the cooked meat or eat it . Incidentally , I would n't half-cook any meat : that may actually increase the rate of bacterial growth if it does n't kill the bacteria completely . But something like salmon can be ( fully ) cooked first , reheated later .
The air pressure is lower at higher altitudes ; when you add extra flour to your baked goods , it prevents them from rising too quickly or too much . ETA ( about the water ) : Water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes , so the extra water called for in high-altitude baking is to compensate for all the water turning to steam faster than it would at sea level .
There are two levels to this question . If you are using modern whipping cream as a starting point , then the trick for a longer lasting whipped cream is stabilization . If this is some farm bought milk you are skimming the cream from , then you have the additional problem that your cream is not fatty enough . Modern creams are concentrated with a centrifuge . To get good whipped cream , whip it cold until it <URL> . Stabilize the whipped cream by hanging it in a cheese cloth in the refrigerator or by adding gelatin.To use the gelatin , dissolve 2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin into 2 tablespoons of cold water . Work out the lumps . After the gelatin expands , mix in a quarter cup of cream and heat the mixture to dissolve the gelatin . Cool over ice and mix a bit . Complete 2 cups of cream and proceed as you would to finish your whipped cream .
Convenience : It 's more convenient and easier to monitor the temperature inside the home . The oven has a thermostat , where the grill temperature needs to be monitored and adjusted manually . No smoke left : Is could be assumed that the smoke has been exhausted . Too much smoke : The smoke flavor could become too strong if finished on the grill .
Flash-freezing equipment would n't hurt , but for the normal home cook , the main things are to chill it as quickly as reasonably possible , package it with as much air removed as possible ( vacuum sealers help here ) in individual meal-sized portions , then freeze . Thaw in the fridge if possible , or by heating your vacuum-sealed bag in a water bath . ( Microwaves are pretty bad at heating frozen blocks of food and even with a lot of attention paid will tend to overheat part while other parts remain frozen . ) Choose recipes that work for the equipment you have , and adapt your weeknight process to combine the frozen ingredients with fresh ones . Soups , many sauces , chilis , beans and rice dishes freeze well under normal home conditions , as do some meat preparations ( the texture can change , and usually , the larger the cut of meat , the more likely it is that the change from freezing will be negative ) . Without flash-freezing , foods with a high water content tend to become mushy , so that the broccoli you steamed to perfection will most likely thaw out to be limp and potatoes may be mushy .
I have always made sure that I only defrost enough to meet the needs of the moment for sushi . If you cut the blocks into 4 to 8 rolls worth , they should defrost under running water in just fifteen to twenty minutes , just about the time it takes me to do a batch of sushi rice . That said , fish once defrosted will start to lose flavor immediately but will remain edible for 2 days . Once it starts to smell , get rid of it immediately , and I would play it very safe on that " starts to smell " the faintest whiff should be enough to send it to the bin .
The purpose - as with any cooked meat - is to let the meat firm up so it does n't release juices when you cut into it . In the case of a turkey it also helps to let it cool enough to not burn you when you are carving and eating it . Both of these goals will be met in 30 minutes to an hour . I do n't know why that chef would recommend 3 hours . At that length of time the turkey would start to approach room temperature and would be less appealing to eat as well as start the clock on the danger zone .
It 's definitely an unusually long-lasting melon , although sources list a few different timeframes . <URL> says if kept in a cool , dry , frost-free place , they keep very well for several months , and reportedly over a year . <URL> increases that : If kept dry after harvest , a fruit can last several years .

Well of all your listed ingredients the only two that can really ' spoil ' are the fresh basil and fresh mint . Honey never goes bad , and nearly any dried spice can last for a long time with just a degradation in flavor . I 'd say that if you washed and dried ( sanitarily ) your basil and mint before addition to this mix that you could get at least 1-2 weeks out of it unrefrigerated , and at least 1-2 months out of it refrigerated . Please note that this is just a ballpark estimate and you may have to do some trial and error to determine a more specific window . That said , I would n't be surprised if you could get a significantly longer shelf life out of it than my estimates . Update - I think the presence of salt does enough to " extend " the life of it . Another Update - Some Googling has informed that honey is in-fact a preservative . Apparently honey is a rather hostile environment for bacteria due to the production/presence of hydrogen peroxide . I still think my estimates are accurate , albeit a little conservative now . The best thing you can do is trial and error . Sources : <URL> <URL>
Hard cheeses ( e.g. parmesan ) will typically last several months in the refrigerator once removed from the packaging . The larger the chunk , the longer it will last . If mold forms on the outside , simply cut it off and continue using . There is no reason to throw-away good parmesan .
Well you 're kinda right about it lasting a long time due to the sugar content . That will help the preserving process to the extreme . However , to be pratical you should be looking at how long the butter fat will survive in the fridge before it starts to take on funky flavours and looses it 's moisture . You 'll be fine in an air tight tub for a month or so but then flavour will suffer . If you freeze it ( it can be done but the quality will really suffer later ) you can get away with 4-6 months before freezer burn kills it . Honestly , I 'd just do smaller batches and enjoy the higher quality product . For what you save on time doing the larger batch , you 'll give up on taste and quality later .
Umami comes from a very specific source : <URL> . MSG is a glutamate , so it is one of the best ways to add a bit of umami .

How to make boiled and partially fried vegetables palatable ?
I would do two things to make them more palatable . 1 ) Boil the briefly ( 5-10 mins depending on how hard of a veg they are ) in salted water . Something like a tablespoon of kosher salt per 4 quarts water . 2 ) After they are parboiled , I then will saute , simmer , or braise ( depending on the recipe/mood/vegetable ) in a highly flavored sauce or spice mix until they are cooked . So if I was cooking the carrots and ( green/string ? ) beans and wanted to use chili powder I would chop some onion and saute that in olive oil while the other veg parboils . Then , add 1-2 tbls chile powder to the onions ( and maybe some garlic , b/c everything is better w / garlic ) and let those flavors meld while you drain the veg . Once you have the veggies drained add them to the onions and spice w / a bit of liquid ( wine , beer , stock ; maybe 1/2 cup ) and let them cook on low until they are as done as you would like them .
You will get the roasty , caramelized flavors ; how much influence they will have on the overall flavor of your stew will depend on several factors including : How deeply you roast the them How much you add , proportionately , into the stew How strongly flavored the other items in the stew are Roasting the vegetables will also cook them , so you will want to add them to the stew much later , so they do n't overcook . If you google <URL> , you will find several recipes for inspiration . As to whether this is a superior , or heartier flavor , that would be a matter of opinion . You do n't mention roasting celery or onions ( partners with carrots in the classic mire poix ) , but these are also excellent candidates for roasting , as are all types of root vegetable .
I would use the oven . The dehydrator will obviously remove water , but it wo n't toast the granola like an oven would . You could always try super-dehydrating half a batch and ovening another .
The trick is to chill the Mars bar in a fridge for a few hours before cooking . Prepare a batter mix ( the kind you deep fry fish in ) and get your oil heated to temperature . Here 's a batter recipe I 've used before : <URL> ( You ca n't fault Delia ! ) You can use sparkling water to introduce more bubbles into the batter which gives it a nice texture . Remove the Mars Bar from the fridge and immediately coat in the batter and cook in the oil right away . Cook until the batter is golden and serve with a scoop of ice-cream . You can also do this with Snickers bars . It 's also worth trying with miniature Mars and Snickers bars . As a Scotsman I must apologise for inflicting this culinary delight on the rest of the world :)
There is a mid-strong correlation between starchy vegetables and root vegetables , but not a perfect one . Plants have many types of roots . Some of them are thin and fine , others are large . Their primary purpose is to extract nutrients and water from the soil and pass it up to the rest of the plant , but some plant families have started using their roots ( and underground parts of the stem , which non-botanists mistakenly call " roots " ) for storage purposes . This is why some plants have rhizomes , tubers and bulbs . Starch is a very efficient way to store energy in a small volume and without much risk of spoilage , so many plants employ it for that purpose . ( The other efficient carbohydrate-based storage molecule class is the sugars ) . So underground storage organs frequently contain high levels of starch , for example potatoes and yams . Over the centuries , humans have selected food based on mainly calorie density , taste , and obtainability . Starchy roots are better than many other roots for both calorie density ( explained above ) and obtainability ( it is easier to pull 100 clean gram of potato out of the earth than 100 g of dainty clover roots , for example ) . So many of the roots humans eat are , in fact , starchy . But we also eat other roots . Onion bulbs contain stored energy primarily as sugars , not as starch . Other roots like radishes are much less calorie dense ( their main macronutrient is still starch , but they have little macronutrients per unit of weight when compared to e.g. potatoes ) , but they are eaten for their strong , pleasant taste , and still easy obtainability . But a root is not the only place where a plant can store energy , and different plants employ other places . The fruit is a very common place . And while some plants store mainly sugars there , other store mainly starches . Botanical fruits ( some of which are called " vegetables " in the kitchen ) are eaten frequently , and are a major source of starch in the diet . Peas , pumpkins , chestnuts and plantains are all examples for high-starch fruit vegetables . Other fruit vegetables are like the radish - there is not much starch stored in them , but even less of everything else , so they are still considered high in starch . An example would be tomatoes . So , there are many non-root vegetables which are high in starch . You may want to note that starch needs to be cooked , while sugars do n't . So , if you have a dish of cooked root vegetables , most of them will be high in starch . Assuming that the waiter was n't bringing you a salad , it was probably a good decision to take out all root vegetables . But it is n't a good decision to stop at the root vegetables , because there are non-root vegetables high in starch . It could be that the waiter did n't know that , or that he knew it , but also knew that this specific dish does n't contain any non-root starchy vegetables . Whatever it was , you are better off by memorizing a list of the vegetables you ca n't eat , than by trying to follow generalizations of the kind " do n't eat root vegetables " .
The secret to crisp sweet and sour pork is mostly how you serve it Roast , BBQ , grill ( whatever you like ) the pork so it fully cooked , but on the lighter side of done . Cut into bite sized pieces If you want to deep fry ( not actually required ) use a thin and light tempura style batter ( flour , baking soda , beer mixed for ten seconds works OK ) . Drain well . This can be done the day before and keep it in an airtight container , but reheating is as much trouble as fresh deep frying . Remember , when using a thin light batter deep frying only takes a minute If not deep frying , finish and reheat under the grill ( broiler ) till it just starts to smoke Use a hot Chinese style serving platter and poor in all your sweet and sour sauce fresh from the wok . The sauce and the platter should be piping hot , it does n't matter if the the pork is not that hot Pile the middle of the platter with freshly shredded raw cabbage and onion . This should make a low flat island in the sauce just breaking the surface of the sauce . You can use wok fried capsicum , onion , carrots etc instead of cabbage ( not as good ! ) Carefully pile the pork pieces onto the island For extra zing add more shredded raw onion on top For a coastal style , and some fresh shredded coconut and/or mango ( not to everyone 's taste ) Serve immediately with a large serving spoon , so guests can scoop up the sauce and pork all in one go
I would recommend borrowing from the principles found in this post , which details how to " fry " chicken in a kettle grill : <URL> Two key takeaways here : 1 ) high heat , and 2 ) all ( or nearly all ) your food 's surface area is exposed to heated air . You 'll just replace " kettle " with " oven , " and put something under the rack on which you 're cooking your food to catch the stuff that drips away from it , and you should be good to go . It may require some experimentation to find the right mix of time and temperature for the food item you wish to cook , but it should n't take more than a few attempts to get it right , if not the first one .
Interesting question . Did search ' how do I make puffed rice ' . Came up with some interesting information . There are some writings that suggest that puffed rice can be made like popcorn ; get the moisture in the grains of rice to the correct level ( no idea what the level should be , experimentation should guide you I suppose ) and then ( depending on what source you read ) put in a popcorn popper , put it on sheets in the oven or fry it in oil . The history indicates that the first puffed rice made in the U.S. was actually shot from a cannon , after , I presume , being thoroughly soaked to some level of softness ; there was a cereal advert in the '60s that bragged " this is the cereal that 's shot from guns " . Am thinking that the softening of the rice , probably by cooking , and then putting it into a pressure vessel in which the pressure is allowed to rise to a certain PSI ( pounds per square inch ) and explosively releasing the pressure , causes the grains to boil or fizz or effervesce , gives them the light puffiness we see at the market . If I 'm reading the information correctly , the devices to make puffed rice are available Here is a link to a video showing the explosive creation of puffed rice by a traveling puffed rice manufactury on a bicycle in Taiwan ; <URL> Here are some other links , kind of vague , regarding non explosive puffed rice : <URL> <URL> <URL> This last link has some history &amp; speculation of how puffed rice has been made non explosively using hot salt , or sand ... did n't read all of the ideas . Have fun , and be safe .
Just to summarise the comments into an answer : To lighten the icing , you can add air to it by whipping , either by hand or with an electric mixer . It will probably be easier to do that if you loosen it a little with some milk or cream .
I suppose that depends on what you 're defrosting it for . The microwave ( on low power ) is safe and quick . The downside is that you 're using a microwave , which means there 's a good chance you 'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process , and you 're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour . The lower the heat , the less the impact of this , but it 's still a problem . If I 'm preparing the meat for marinating , stir-fry , etc. , something with a powerful or thick sauce , then I would n't worry about it , but if it 's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning , you might want to avoid this . Running it under warm water would seem to work , but I 've found that it takes forever to defrost this way ( the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen ) , and you 're soaking it in the process . This really is n't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it . I would use the microwave if desperate , but it 's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or , if you 're in a bit of a hurry , the sink . It takes longer , but it 'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness . P.S. . One other word of advice : If you 're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced , it 's best not to defrost it all the way . It 's easier to cut when frozen , and will defrost very quickly once it 's in pieces . I 'm mainly talking about the breast here , this does n't work so well with meat stuck to bones . Update : I 'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something . Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be immediately cooked after defrosting and that the defrosting is done over a period shorter than 2 hours . Raw chicken must not be kept at any temperature above 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) for more than an hour or so . Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge . Definitely do n't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water . As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly ( up to an internal temperature of 165 ° F ) , you 're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning , even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today is contaminated , for the record . If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason , then you need to either thaw it very fast ( using the microwave ) or at a very low temperature ( using the refrigerator or cold running water ) .
Trim your carrots , rutabaga , turnips , etc. to consistent sizes and put in a large saute pan . Add stock or water ( amount will depend on vegetables and their density along with quantitye of vegetables . Start with enough to come about 2/3 up the volume of veg . ) along with some salt , a couple tablespoons of butter and a couple tablespoons of sugar . Bring the liquid to a simmer and cover lightly with a lid or a circle of parchment paper . Simmer until vegetables are getting tender . Remove the lid and continue to simmer until liquid evaporates and sugar and butter create a nice glaze . Watch at the end to make sure the sugar does n't burn . Add any desired herbs , taste and adjust seasoning and serve .
You ca n't really substitute marshmallows in that recipe . I have had some luck with the following procedure : Get a good quality chocolate of the flavour you would like to use . Do not try chocolates with 70 % cocoa solids or more . They are good for some things , but not for this . Melt it in a double boiler . Do not make the chocolate boil or heat it directly ( some can do that but most people end up with burned chocolate ) . Remove it from the heat . Fold in 2 spoons of glycose syrup ( for regular nonmilky chocolate ) and mix fast . Let it cool and when it gets close to room temperature , put it in the fridge . For darker chocolates , use a bit more glucose and less for lighter chocolates .
I agree with @jwenting , 5-7 minutes in boiling water is the way to go . Remember to always put the eggs in cold water , if you put them in hot water you risk cracking the shell , especially if eggs are cold . Also , to avoid premature cracking of the shell , that may leave some egg white leaking out , add a spoon of vinegar ( should work with lemon juice too ) to the water .
Vodka by definition is a flavorless distilled alcohol , retaining any of the organoleptic properties of the grain or potato could be considered as ruining the end product . Potatoes are a good source of starch , but brewers yeast has a limited ability to break down starch into usable fuel ; its preferred fuel sources are relatively simple sugars like mono and disaccharides . In order to efficiently convert the starch in potatoes to sugar the potatoes must first be boiled so that the starches gelate . Once gelated , the potatoes are then Mashed-in with malted barley or wheat at a temperature around 150 ˚F so that the diastatic enzymes can break those starches into the sugars that yeast likes to eat . These same steps are used when making vodka from non-malted grains such as corn ( maize ) . Boiling the potatoes also helps reduce the number of surface microbes that could end up influencing the final product . Bacteria and wild yeast strains can lead to moldy , grassy , sour , and other unpleasant flavors that may necessitate multiple distillations to remove . Making a mash of raw , peeled potato would likely yield something closer to a sourdough starter with a mix a naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria producing a small amount of alcohol along with acetic and lactic acids , as well as other compounds .
Take double cream ( you want a 48 % milk fat , which is hard to get in the U.S. outside of a specialty market ; heavy cream has a 30-40 % milk fat content ) and shake it . Forever . To be more specific , after sealing your double cream in , say , a jam jar , shake it until you hear the sloshing sound of butter forming ( which will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour ) ; drain the liquid off and then rinse the butter until the water runs clearly over it . Squeeze your butter ( I use cheese cloth or a linen napkin for this ) to rid it of excess liquid ( excess liquid can lead to rancidity ) , shape it into a block , and wrap it with wax paper .
Round popcorn is just made from a different variety of popcorn , called mushroom popcorn . The " normal " kind is called butterfly popcorn , or sometimes snowflake popcorn . The two are mentioned in <URL> ( last paragraph of the linked section ) , along with a photo . It looks like it 's pretty easy to buy online , if you prefer it . Mushroom popcorn kernels are a little sturdier and easier to coat , so it 's well-suited for prepackaged popcorn and especially things like caramel corn , but at least to me that sturdiness is also a slight toughness , so I prefer the butterfly-style popcorn most of us are used to .
A lot depends on what kind of cheese you are making . I will assume that you are making a standard , medium-firm , rennet-set cheese . I have had the most success adding seasonings and herbs with the salt . That is - after the curd has set , been cut , and drained but before it has been pressed at all . Work in the salt and any other flavors before placing the curd in the mold . I imagine any herb or spice would work - it depends what flavor you want . I have used basil when I had a bumper crop . I have also used dried peppers . As to dry or fresh - either would work . As with anything if you use dry then use a lot less . I prefer fresh because it is more tender . Other cheeses might be a little different but as a rule of thumb adding with the salt should work . Mozzarella seems like it would be trickier because the kneading of the curd would change things .
A latte is similar to a cappuccino but with different proportions . It 's unsurprising that a similar method and equipment would be used . Cappuccino needs steamed milk to get the froth , so a coffee bar machine has a steam pipe . To boil the milk for a latte would require an extra piece of equipment and the associated space . Is perfectly possible to make an espresso-based drink with milk heated on the stove or in a microwave , that would be a close approximation to a latte -- possibly indistinguishable . But if you boil the milk , it will change the flavour .
If you add too much water your jello ( jelly in some parts of the world ) will not solidify . What I would suggest is looking for a non-sweetened gelatin mix and adding less sugar to it . Alternatively you could get gelatin sheets or powder and make your own from scratch . It 's not that hard to do and you get exactly what you want .
If you have a metal strainer then I Fill a large pot with water . Just enough so it almost comes up to the bottom of the strainer when you place it on top . Insert the strainer so it is balanced above the water . Fill strainer with vegetables and cover with a lid Boil Take off when the vegetables are steamed to your specifications Enjoy

How can I reduce the fat in a white wine and parsley sauce ?
Thickening with starch or flour instead of roux can be quite acceptable if some other rich flavors are added . Here is where the calories can be traded in : Good low-fat broth for part of the liquid . celery root or coriander root are particularly good ing . for veggie broth Puree , in small amounts add body and flavor . soft cooked onion is particularly silky and surprisingly mild Flavorsome oils , few drops instead of copious butter . Macadamia punches above its weight . Sesame toasted ( tiny amount ) or if feeling adventurous , pricklyash from Asian market . lower-fat ' milks ' can add luscious body instead of cream or 3 % dairy milk . Unsweetened Almond or coconut does n't overwhelm most sauces .
Vinegar , in general , has distinct acidic characteristics that will affect a recipe ; it 's often used for this reason . For instance , in marinades , the acid is used to break down muscle fiber and help flavor penetrate . In Cevice , the acid component is used to " cook " the fish . Additionally , the different types of vinegar have different flavor characteristics . I , personally , do n't much like red wine vinegar as I find it kind of bland . I much prefer balsamic or champagne . So the question you really need to ask yourself is , " will the flavor of the red wine over the white wine adversely affect my dish ? " You might ask the same question about the garlic . So subbing one type of vinegar for another is fine if you 're looking to replace the role of the acid in a recipe ( also why you can sub lemon juice ) . Whether or not you feel the flavor can be substituted is really just a matter of personal preference . If you do n't know ahead of time about the flavor , try it and find out for sure . To specifically answer the flavor characteristic for your question , I 'd say yes . Red wine is OK . As pointed out , swordfish is a hearty fish and should hold up fine . I probably would n't sub balsamic , would use champagne as a priority , would think long and hard about apple cider . If it was a lighter fish , I 'd be much more wary about red wine .
Refrigerate it and the fat will get on top of the water .
In Germany we have an old ( joking ) saying that roughly translates to " head off , tail off - bunny " , so your question is legitimate . But first thing 's first : There is no health risk involved if you ate the latest shipment of " meowling rabbit " . ( To cat lovers everywhere : This is no endorsement , I have a much loved and pampered cat , too ! ) The most obvious differences are head ( look at the teeth ! ) , tail ( short vs. long ) , and feet ( cat claws are quite distinctive ) . But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale , so we 'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy : Shoulder blades : Cats ' shoulder blades are rounded on top , especially in the front , making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts , rabbits ' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side . Femur ( thigh bone ) : A cat 's femora are straight , whereas a rabbit 's is more or less bent , especially pronounced in older animals . Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna ( forearm ) , but they might have been removed . Ribs : Cats ' ribs are " rounder " than rabbits ' ribs according to <URL> . I ca n't say by how much , but <URL> 's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie <URL> . Pelvis : The same source as above states that the <URL> ( = the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint ) is oval in rabbits and round in cats . I could n't find a good picture to show this , though . Here 's a rabbit : Source : <URL> And a cat :
American versions of Mongolian BBQ are often pretty sweet ( this does n't sound like an authentic recipe ) . More soy sauce ( or more of everything but the sugar ) would cut the sweetness . Chili oil would certainly give it heat , but is n't going to temper the sweetness much . Any of the following would offset the sweetness and be appropriate for this type of dish : Any tart apple ( a common ingredient in the Japanese version of Mongolian BBQ ) Onions ( not caramelized ) Rice wine vinegar
Opened wine spoils fast . Red wine lasts about 1 day , white wine lasts about 3 days . You can prolong this slightly by putting it in the refrigerator , but only by a few days at most , and it depends on the wine . It may be " safe " to consume for much longer , but the taste will be way off , even for cooking purposes . If you 've opened it - finish it . ASAP . There are exceptions : " Cooking wines " such as cooking sherry and rice cooking wine have an array of preservatives added and will keep for much longer . But do n't leave perfectly good Chardonnay just sitting around to oxidize .
It sounds like you cooked it too long , and additionally , the recipe may just be bad . If you managed to cook away all the liquid and end up with just wine-infused bacon , there was probably a point before then with a reasonable amount of liquid . Sometimes what people are going for with wine reduction sauces is really to have a lot of the wine flavor concentrated into some minced ingredients , with enough thickened liquid to hold it together a bit . If you crumble the bacon finely enough , and do n't reduce away all the liquid , you might find you like it like that . But it sounds like you 're looking for more of a liquid sauce , and at the point when enough liquid remained , it was too thin . I 'd might suggest just finding a more detailed , trustworthy recipe for a wine reduction sauce , and just adding in bacon ( and maybe taking out some other ingredients ) . Short of that , if I were going to try to do this without many extra ingredients , I 'd : Save the fat that cooks out of the bacon . Crumble the bacon very finely . Keep plenty of liquid when reducing . Whisk together equal parts bacon fat and flour and cook until the flour turns a bit golden . ( Basically , make roux with bacon fat . ) Whisk the sauce into the roux and cook for a bit longer . This is again a very fuzzy recipe . With the amount of fat bacon releases , you can definitly make more than enough roux to thicken plenty of sauce - depending on how much you reduce the wine and how thick you want the sauce , I 'm guessing you 'd only need a tablespoon or two of roux . If you feel you 've lost too much of the bacon flavor , see SAJ14SAJ 's answer for how to incorporate more of the fat without the sauce separating . ( In general , you have to be careful with vague recipes like the one you found - they 'll tend to assume you know some things , so if you ca n't fill in the gaps yourself , it may be best to find a more specific one ! And sometimes they 're just bad recipes . That one tells you to fry bacon in olive oil , which is really suspicious - you do n't need extra oil to fry bacon . )
I use beer a LOT for my cooking . As the others have said , you need to watch out for the bitterness , which can intensify when you cook and reduce it down . As such , I often cook with different beers than I drink . You can use the IBU ( International Bitterness Unit ) rating for a beer to get an idea of whether your favorite beer will be a problem . Personally , I use Guinness and other dark beers when red wine is called for in a recipe . The flavors are definitely different than the red wine version , but it usually comes out good . I also cook quite a bit with wheat beers and the kind of beers that people describe as " nutty " , like porters . America 's Test Kitchen looked at beers for cooking at one point and a " non-alcoholic " beer actually did really well : O'Doul 's Amber . I agree with them and tend to keep it on hand for cooking , even though I never drink it . It stays mellow and away from the bitter flavors when used for cooking . So , what do I cook with it ? Like most of the others , cooking bratwurst before grilling and cheese fondue , but I also use it for lots of other stuff . I have a baked bean version that uses 4 cans of beer and a couple of shots of whiskey and sits in a crock pot on low for 24 hours . I 've made this with all different kinds of beer and each brings something different to the results . ( <URL> ) I also like using beer in most of my stews . Throw beef chunks , veggies and beer in the crock pot in the morning and it 's a tasty stew when you get home . It works well as the liquid for braising pork or beef . In the winter , I 'll often throw a pork shoulder roast into the crock pot with a bottle of beer and let it slow cook all day . When it 's completely falling apart , I pull it out , shred it and add back as much of the beer as the shredded mess will hold ( which turns out to be far more than you thought ) . What results is a juicy sandwich option , which is really good , topped with mustard or bbq sauce . It comforts me when it 's too cold to deal with slow smoking pork ( I live in MN ) . I 'll also often take some of that shredded " drunk " pork to my baked beans and give the beans some extra dimension . We do a version of " bangers and mash " that I use beer in the gravy/sauce that I like . Beer and self-rising flour make for a really quick quickbread that has an interesting flavor profile . I particularly like using wheat beers like Leinenkugel 's Sunset Wheat , as the wheat flavors work well in a bread . Beers ( and hard ciders , which I actually REALLY like ) work well for marinades . Beyond that , I tend to find myself just tossing a few ounces of it into a lot of other liquids/sauces to add some flavor .
My grounds bin has a lid . So while the grounds still collect static , they do n't fly all over the place when I remove the bin from the grinder . Giving the bin few sharp taps on the counter top prior to opening seems to shake off most of what clings to the top and sides . Then I tap out the grounds , wipe out the bin with a napkin , and I 'm ready for the next morning . Beyond that , try switching up your coffee . The cheap " 8 O'Clock " stuff I keep on reserve is terribly staticy , while the beans I roast myself do n't have nearly the trouble . I tend to enjoy a lighter roast , so keep that in mind - you might benefit from grinding beans with just a bit higher moisture content ( of course , if you have a strong preference for dark roasts , this does n't help much ) .
You can also preserve herbs by wrapping them in damp paper towels ( either completely or just around the stems ) and then placing the bundle in an open plastic bag ( or one with holes poked in ) Replace or re-wet the towels when they get dry . It 's the equivalent of a vase without the worry about it spilling .
Yes . Make it again and do n't add horseradish . I 'm totally serious - no traditional hummus recipe in the known universe has horseradish in it . There is nothing you are going to be able to do to your existing batch to remove that flavor , other than diluting it , but I do n't think you 'd be able to dilute it enough to be worth the effort .
So , there 's no method to get sugar out of milk , as far as I know . You can look for milk products where some of the sugar is used up ( fermented , like Chris H mentioned ) , but this will significantly change taste and texture - sugar is a major part of what milk is , fats and sugars and proteins , and you 're removing most of the actual substance . You 're likely to do better with an unsweetened nut milk or rice milk , especially if you make your own so you can tweak to taste . These may have more fats , depending on your choice of recipe , but will likely have sugar closer to your desired range One thing you might try , if you 're really determined , is to dilute your milk ( maybe up to half ) and add artificial sweeteners . You 'll still get some of the flavor components from the added milk , and some sweetening to make up the difference in taste , but there will be less sugar because the actual amount of milk is less . Hopefully the added artificial sweetener might make it taste less watery , but maybe add just a half a pinch of salt if it still tastes too thin . in the end , ~ 6g sugar per cup , I guess ? Another possibility is to use unflavored whey powder to flavor the diluting water ( again , probably no more than half of your " milk " ) , then adding artificial sweetener to taste . The whey should have some of the flavors from the proteins in milk , and at least from the powder I checked it does n't have much of the sugar or fat you 're objecting to . It might help the diluted milk taste less watery . ~ 7g sugar , because I think the whey powder has a gram and a half per serving . Final possibility I thought of - you can maybe grab some creamer powder and use that to flavor your diluted milk ( again , not more than half and sweeten to taste ) . Or even use it on its own , if the flavor works for you . The amount of sugar is n't stated , but it has to be under 1g because that 's all the carbs there are per serving - though it does add a half gram of fat back in .
Yes . The important fat is the one the starch first goes into . The higher temperature reached by fats ( as compared to water or milk ) helps cook the flour , creating flavors . The liquid added later dilutes the mixture into a sauce . The liquid 's fats are not as crucial for the sauce 's thickness as the liquid 's proteins . I think of the cooked butter-flour mixture as a thickner that can be added to milk , broths , and even a saucy dish . The roux thickens way better than just a slurry of flour and a cold liquid . Jack Lang has written <URL> and the science is summarized in chapter 4 of <URL>
rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title . However , you can also address your problem the other way round . First , cook the soup until your noodles are al dente ( but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed ) . Take the big pot of soup off the heat . Second , take a small pot , and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater . Put it on the heat , and cook until the noodles are done . ( Alternatively , put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot , but I would n't nuke a good soup for no reason ) . Third , eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own . Fourth , freeze the soup from the big pot . Finis . Note that from a food safety point of view , you are better off with flash cooling the soup . But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free . Plus , 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling . If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people , you should probably prefer a rapid cooling .
In order to store yeast for that period of time it has to be make inactive , and the process to do that yourself is challenging , time consuming , and you 'd need specialist equipment . It would be prohibitive in both time and cost , far above just buying yeast . You can of course make a starter by mixing equal amounts of flour and water plus some yeast , this will keep the yeast alive by feeding it , and you can keep it alive indefinitely by feeding it once per week . You add some of the starter to your bread and it supplies active yeast .
My secret weapon is onion . Caramelize the onions first . This creates a natural sweetness . Always use ripe tomatoes ; if you can not then use canned . The canned are made from ripe tomatoes and tend to be a very good substitute . Also , the celery and carrot suggestions are very much a good addition - you are making a classic tomato sauce when you include the celery and carrots , 1 part each celery and carrot to 2 parts onion . Add the onions first to get the caramelization . I do n't get too fancy with herbs , usually one good fresh herb does it for me , basil or sage are two favorites of mine . There is a suggestion to add cream , why not use the parmesan end you may have in your fridge , it is dairy and allowed to slowly simmer in the sauce will lend a very nice flavor note . Acidic sauces are usually reserved for nights when I make a puttanesca sauce - it goes with the capers and calamata olives I add to it . Do n't forget to season with salt and pepper .
That advice is n't " wrong " and millions of people keep keep fish sauce in a cabinet for decades . Regarding safety , it 's generally OK to store fish sauce at room temperature for years , but that is n't recommended by government worrywarts for best quality . <URL> . Pathogens run in fear faced with this stuff , but it can ( rarely ) develop " offness " . It is conservative to even bring up this article from <URL> : The fish-sauce-making process is carefully controlled to prevent the growth of dangerous bacteria . First , whole , tiny fish ( predominantly anchovies ) are combined with salt in roughly a three-to-one ratio . The mixture is then tossed into either concrete or wooden tanks . Enzymes contained within the cells of the fish flesh degrade the proteins , fats , and other molecules into amino acids ( compounds responsible for the deeply savory flavor in fish sauce ) , eventually liquifying the solid tissue . The salt accelerates this process , known as protein hydrolysis , by causing the fish cells to open up , which releases the enzymes . The briny conditions in the tank keep most microbes and all pathogens at bay , but some harmless , extremely salt-tolerant bacteria , known as halophilic bacteria , survive . These occur naturally in the guts , mouth , and skin of the decomposing anchovies . They too break down the fish proteins , yielding various acids , alcohols , and nitrogen compounds that give fish sauce its characteristic cheesy , meaty flavors . But by the end of fish sauce 's six - to twelve-month fermentation period , the salt has managed to kill even the hardiest halophilic bacteria . At this point , the clear , amber liquid in the tanks is filtered , and any sediment is discarded . The fermentation process does such a good job of killing off bacteria that no pasteurization is required . There is no legal requirement in the U.S. for fish sauce to bear an expiration date , but most manufacturers put dates on the label anyway , since people are more inclined to trust foods that tell us when they should be discarded . These dates tend to be three to four years from the date of manufacture , which is actually on the conservative side in light of industry guidelines . The Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods in the ASCA Countries ( published by the Association for Science Cooperation in Asia , a science-policy organization ) ascribes to the condiment a shelf life of five years . This is is n't to say fish sauce will always be good , either before or after the use-by date ( though you should always refrigerate it after opening ) . It can deteriorate in quality over an extended period of time due to chemical reactions , resulting in color changes or the development of " off " flavors . On rare occasions mold or yeast might develop on the inside surface or lip of the bottle where there 's excess moisture and less salt . These growths are usually innocuous , but as with any food , if it looks strange , smells strange , or tastes strange , you should throw it out . So , grudgingly , I say throw this batch out 'cause it 's fuzzy . But do n't lose any sleep over it . Next time buy a bottle that you 're likely to use within a couple of years and keep it in the fridge after opening .
No , it 's not unusual at all . See <URL> for examples where nuoc-mam is used to marinate chicken , or just type nuoc mam marinade in Google :) There are a lot of examples , including <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , or even <URL> marinated ( as well as <URL> , of course ) with nuoc-mam ( and most of the time lemongrass ) , and a fair share of them are recipes by ' natives ' from South-East Asia , not only fusion food addicts ( even if <URL> ! ) . Some salads like goi tom or goi ga also involve nuoc mam marinade .
There 's no point drinking wine and not enjoying it . The point of wine with food is that , if you enjoy the wine and enjoy the food , you 'll enjoy both together even more . But if you do n't enjoy the wine , you 'll enjoy the food less if you force yourself to drink wine with it . Is there anything you do like about wine ? If not , I suggest you ignore it for the time being . If you 're curious , you 'll come back to it in your own time , whenever you 're ready . If you 're not , it does n't matter : there 's nothing wrong with not liking wine . If there is something you like about wine , for example , the aroma or some component of the taste , I suggest you keep trying it but do n't force yourself . Taste it every now and again and , if you still do n't like it , wait until you want to try it again . This is what I did with whisky . As a teenager / young adult , I really liked the smell of whisky but did n't like the taste -- in hindsight , it was probably the alcohol content that was the problem . Every now and again I 'd have a taste from my father 's glass or from somebody I was drinking with at a bar . For a long time , I did n't like it but I still liked the aroma so I kept trying a couple of times a year . Eventually , I started drinking it . A few things to bear in mind about wine . Avoid cheap wine and do n't waste your money on expensive wine that you wo n't appreciate . Low price is n't a guarantee of low quality and high price is n't a guarantee of high quality but it 's worth spending , say , twice the price of the cheapest bottle if you 're at the supermarket . That 's likely to lift you into wines that you 're disliking because you dislike wine , rather than because they 're bad . Red wine , poured straight from the bottle often tastes rather harsh . Open the bottle half an hour or so before you want to drink it and let it sit in the glass for a couple of minutes before you drink . Wines ( especially red ) with just one or two grape varieties named on the bottle usually have simpler , less challenging tastes . Sweeter white wines will probably be more appealing to you than drier ones . Try something like a sauvignon blanc or unoaked chardonnay , rather than , say , a pinot gris/pinot grigio . Riesling can be anywhere from super-sweet to mouth-puckeringly dry depending on what the winemaker did . Supermarkets in the UK sell quarter-bottles of decent-but-not-amazing wine . That 's a good way to try lots of different styles without having to spend a lot of money or feeling that you 're wasting a whole bottle if you do n't like it . This suggestion is heresy but ... consider chilling red wine . Chilling tends to make harsher flavours less noticeable . If you find you like it chilled , try chilling it less . Ask a wine merchant . Specialist wine merchants love to talk about wine . Do n't be embarrassed to walk into one of their stores and say , " Hi . I like the idea of wine but I 've never found a wine I like drinking . " Their eyes will light up because this is a challenge to them to use their skills to make a customer really happy . If you buy a couple of bottles on their recommendations , you 'll be their favourite customer of the day , I guarantee . Doubly so if you go back a week later after liking what you bought . Go for it !
One method I found over time : Chop it into tiny pieces and stir fry it with bacon and onions ( also chopped up ) . Once that 's soft , leave it to cool , then mix it in meatballs in a 50:50 ratio . If some eggs and breadcrumbs are added a fine meatball is made that tastes a bit sweeter and veggy and is healthier . :)

Why do Duck eggs have longer expiry than Chicken Eggs ?
Interesting question , tried to search and it is very hard to find any real answer , I did find <URL> which speculates that since duck eggs have thicker shells they have longer shelf life .
( 1 ) Taste . When you salt your eggs DOES affect taste because it affects the way your tongue comes into contact with the salt . If you salt your eggs before or during cooking , some of all of the salt dissolves in the water that is in the eggs ( raw eggs , overall , are roughly 75 % water ) and is dispersed over the surface of your eggs while they cook . When you salt your eggs after cooking , crystals of salt remain on the egg and , when these crystals come into contact with your tongue directly , they produce a brighter salty taste . So basically , the way your tongue registers saltiness depends on concentration , not just amount . Think about how differently a pinch of salt tastes directly on the tongue as opposed to the way that same pinch would taste if dissolved in a drop of water . So ... the tongue registers a brighter salt taste when it comes in contact with salt directly . That does n't mean that salting eggs after cooking is better - it means that it affects perception of salt differently . Go with whichever you prefer personally . ( 2 ) Texture . Whenever I have a question about food science , I consult Harold McGee 's book " On Food and Cooking , The Science and Lore of the Kitchen . " He states unequivocally that salt DOES NOT toughen eggs . According to McGee , the only egg preparation that is harmed by the addition of salt is and egg white foam ( whipped egg whites ) . So from the standpoint of texture , salt whenever you feel called to do so . Controlling the heat when you fry an egg is the single more important factor in determining the texture of your cooked eggs .
The function of the chord , that is attached to the yolk , is to hold the yolk into place . To have the most uniform baking possible , you remove the chord . However , I never do . I keep it in with the rest of the whites and I 've never had any problems with the finished products . So you can : toss it keep it with the yolk ( a little bit of whites with the yolk is not bad , the other way around is ) keep it with the whites since it does not contain fat , it will not stop the whites from being whipped It 's up to you .
I ran across a good resource while looking into duck eggs . I 'll let it speak for itself : The higher protein in Duck Eggs means they must n't be overcooked , or the whites will go tough and rubbery . Some people say they will be too tough if you completely fry them : they advise to rather partially fry them then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan , cover and let the steam moderate the heat and finish cooking them . Most people , though , seem to say they do n't notice a difference between fried chicken and Duck Eggs . Swapping Duck Eggs interchangeably in recipes for chicken eggs : some people say you ca n't ; others who substitute all the time say nonsense , it 's fine . When the Duck Egg whites are beaten they will come up a bit higher owing to the protein . They take a minute or so longer to start frothing up , but then make up for lost time . There 's a great deal more information on the page as well : <URL>
There are a number of reasons why the flavor of tomatoes changes during both the cooking and drying processes . The first is that when drying the tomatoes , farmers and processors will dust the tomatoes in fairly high levels of salt , which helps to keep harmful microbes and insects from eating into the fruit and causing rot and infections . The second is that when drying anything , you need to remove the water from the flesh of whatever it is you 're drying . This causes all of the flavor molecules to become more concentrated . The resulting flavor is more intense because there is simply more flavor per bite . The final and probably most important ( and beautiful :) reason is chemistry . Tomatoes play house to something like 400 volatile aromatic compounds - that is , molecular structures that change and break apart during the acts of heating or drying . While I do n't have the EXACT science in front of me right now ( and ca n't seem to find it on the interblags ) there 's strong indications that it has quite a bit to do with the structure of sulfur-heavy amino acids , c6 volatiles , and glutamic acid breaking down over the course of the drying process - due to the evaporation of water and introduction of salt - and changing into different aroma molecules . All of these , taken together together have a profound impact on the flavor profile of sundried tomatoes .
The short answer is " No , " it 's definitely not a US-only problem . Since the question makes comparisons between the US and Europe , I will focus mainly on those two areas . Unfortunately , it 's hard to estimate illnesses from eggs only , because frequently Salmonella outbreaks from eggs are due to how they are handled in the kitchen and what other foods they may contaminate . If we just look at Salmonella cases overall , the most recent figures I could find <URL> list : 88,715 reported ( confirmed ) cases , 23.4 cases per 100,000 population 9,830 hospitalizations 65 fatalities The most recent figures I could find <URL> list : 7,307 reported ( confirmed ) cases , 15.2 per 100,000 population 2,029 hospitalizations 30 fatalities ( Note : these figures appear only based on a sample of the US population , so I 'd pay attention to the incidence rate per 100,000 when comparing with the EU numbers . ) The problem , of course , is that in both the EU and the US the number of reported cases is only a small fraction of the total . <URL> estimated that only 1 in 58 cases of salmonellosis is reported , which would suggest an annual incidence of perhaps 5 million cases . The CDC report from the US linked above estimates approximately 1.2 million cases every year . Given that the population of the EU is around 500 million and the US is about 325 million , the incidence of Salmonella poisoning appears to be roughly double in the EU compared to the US , but again these are only estimates . ( Also , it 's notable that that last study says the incidence rate in various EU member states likely varies between about 16 per 100,000 and 11,800 per 100,000 , which is obviously a huge range . Some countries are much more safe than others . ) Now , the question is : how many of these cases can be linked to eggs ? Most studies suggest that eggs are the most common carrier of Salmonella leading to illness . From the above EU report : Salmonella was rarely found in table eggs , at levels of 0.3 % ( single samples ) or 1.0 % ( batch samples ) . The most important source of food-bourne Salmonella outbreaks was , however , still eggs and egg products . In the US , <URL> estimated somewhere around 180,000 illnesses annually from eggs , but <URL> estimated that the proportion of foodborne illnesses associated with eggs decreased from 6 % in the late 1990s to 2 % in 2006-2008 . This was all before the new <URL> passed in 2010 . ( That link estimates 79,000 Salmonella cases annually associated with eggs before the rule . ) Compare that <URL> , which estimates 5.4 million cases of Salmonella in 2010 , about 17 % of which were likely attributable to eggs , or 928,000 cases in 2010 . Given the differences in population , that suggests that Salmonella cases caused by eggs were about 7 times more prevalent in the EU compared to the US in 2010 . That 's the most recent year I could find decent figures for eggs alone to make a comparison . ( Note that incidence various significantly across the EU member states . Those countries that have stricter policies , like the UK 's vaccination policies , have much lower numbers . ) Estimates of the fraction of eggs in the US contaminated with Salmonella have often suggested a number around 1 in 20,000 ( or 0.005 % ) , based on a <URL> . But that was before the new egg safety rule was introduced , and the numbers are likely somewhat lower now ( given more frequent monitoring of infected flocks and their removal from production ) . With all of that said , I sense in the question and the links provided a skepticism about US egg policy in general . Just to clarify a few points related to those sources : Chickens are much more likely to be vaccinated in the EU compared to the US , but the percentage of infected chickens still varies significantly from country to country in the EU . Improper egg washing is a problem , but guidelines for appropriate temperatures , etc. have become much more strict in the US over the years . Egg washing is most definitely NOT just done for appearance . The US successfully lowered its Salmonella rates significantly earlier than many European countries through egg washing and refrigeration . Similar gains in safety have only recently been attained in Europe mostly through vaccination instead . The vast majority of Salmonella cases from unwashed eggs come from shell contamination . Without washing eggs , the only way to ensure safety is to make sure the exterior is n't contaminated in the first place ( which means ensuring chickens are n't infected in the first place , e.g. , through vaccination ) . The last report I linked from the European Food Safety Authority states in its abstract : " An effective way to minimize any increase in risk during extended storage is to keep the eggs refrigerated both at retail and the household . " The practice of not refrigerating eggs in the EU is likely a major contributor to the higher incidence of Salmonella cases mentioned above . In the US , refrigeration is required partly because of the washing process as
Please see the full answer to <URL> , excerpt below : When you break the eggs into the pan , you will notice that the yolks are surrounded by a higher rounded portion of whites . The secret is to take your fingers and pinch this pile of whites gently until it breaks and the whites in this membrane will redistribute evenly in the pan . From your description , the chef most likely cracked the eggs into a bowl rather than directly into the pan , but that should n't make any difference .
There are two main base recipes for ice cream . French style ice cream contains egg yolks , which help make it soft , rich , smooth , creamy , custardy . Philadelphia style ice cream ( sometimes called American style ) has no eggs , and relies on the fat in the cream to keep it soft , but will still never be as rich and smooth as French style , and will still tend to freeze harder . You can make pretty much any ice cream in either style , including the pistachio-almond you want to make . You can look around for recipes without eggs ; I would n't be surprised if you manage to find one one . Or you can simply use a Philadelphia style base , and look at one of the recipes you found to see how to add the pistachio and almond . Depending on how rich you want it , you 'll want 2-3 cups of heavy cream for each 1 cup of milk ; about 3/4 cup of sugar should work , depending on how sweet you want it . If that 's not rich enough for you , you can even replace the milk with cream . ( You could also just go find a recipe for Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream and use that as a base - it does n't get much simpler than that . ) ( P.S. . You could also try gelato , something like <URL> - it uses corn starch as a stabilizer instead . )
<URL> by Janet Bailey says : Keep stored eggs covered . Eggs readily absorb odors from , and lose moisture to , the air circulating in the refrigerator . The best container for them is the carton you bought them in . Do n't use the open egg racks in the door of the refrigerator . The rack is too warm and unprotected . Store eggs with their broad , rounded ends up . This position helps the chalaza keep the yolk centered in the white , away from the air pocket where it might encounter unfriendly bacteria . The rounded end of the egg is also less likely to break when accidentally bumped . Do n't wash eggs before you store them . If they have been coated in oil , you would be washing away that valuable protection .
Of course you can store them in the fridge . When things start to smell bad , you should toss it . From what I remember off hand , every pancake or cornbread batter recipe I 've read says about a week is safe .
By your definition , I would cook them all at one time . From there you have a couple options . Leave them in the shell and peel when needed . This keeps out a lot of the air which extends the shelf life to 2 weeks , but can dry them out a little making the texture a little harder . Immediately peel and dry them as best as possible . Put them in a Zip Lock along with a dry paper towel on the bottom to catch any extra water and condensation . Remove as much air as possible . The texture is much better , but your shelf life if approx . 1 week and is a little smellier . ( also can put zip lock into a covered container ) Lol . Food stores now sell eggs this way . Either way you may want to let them sit on the counter long enough to take the chill off , so it 's not as hard . For me it does n't matter , I can eat them any old way . LOVE EM !
Bearing in mind the salmonella statistics given above. , yes it is safe to eat raw eggs so long as you are not very young , very old , or immunocompromised in some way -- e.g. HIV , chemotherapy , leukemia , etc. .
True free range eggs are noticeably different in terms of yolk colour ( a much deeper yellow ) and taste . Free range chickens are allowed to supplement their diets with naturally found grubs , inscets etc. . You might find this of interest : <URL>
By " it stays longer " do you mean that the egg stays good longer or the membrane/air pocket stays around longer ? I do n't know why you would care about the air pocket so I 'll go with the other . Orientation is not going to noticeably affect egg quality . I do n't use egg cartons . I store my eggs in plastic tubs ( carefully ) . The eggs end up in a random orientation and there is no noticeable difference between any two eggs . I have heard to people storing the eggs differently to center the yolks in preparation for boiling . This is purely a cosmetic thing .
Well , it makes the eggs go further for one ... But it also produces softer , creamier results . You 're moving toward something like a custard or quiche . If you like your eggs very stiff , this is probably a bad idea .
First off I want to point out the term " fresh " . While some containers might keep milk from spoiling for longer , it may not taste as nice . Several things might be why : 1 . ) Plastics leach flavor and odor into the milk . <URL> , not wax since about the 1940s . I would say this is likely the biggest impact -- I 've always found plastic containers make drinks and food taste downright funky . <URL> are made of <URL> . The FDA considers this material safe , but just because something is safe does n't mean it does n't impart a flavor . <URL> showing glass having least effect on taste : " ... overall , the development of water off-taste occurred least in glass containers and most often in high density polyethylene containers ... " 2 . ) <URL> Ice cold milk tastes better ( fresher ) to most people . The thing is , it 's not actually colder while in the fridge . <URL> That means heat can transfer through it faster than plastic . The <URL> demands equilibrium , so while your hand makes the milk hotter , the glass of milk makes your hand colder . Because of glass 's higher thermal conductivity , it does this faster than plastic and we sense the glass as being colder . So while it 's not - actually - colder and would n't keep the milk from spoiling for longer , it would affect our perception of how cold it is and therefore also the taste . Packaging of milk varies so a thicker glass bottle might also keep the milk colder while it 's sitting on the counter vs most thin plastic milk jugs . There are a lot of variables with packaging so it really depends on what you 're comparing . 3 . ) <URL> Permeability : <URL> Starting in 1937 the <URL> used to be one of the main statutory tests for checking if milk was bad by checking how much oxygen is present in the milk . This lets you know how much aerobic bacteria is in the milk ( bacteria that requires oxygen ) . <URL> While we do have newer , better tests for handling milk in bulk refrigeration these days , it 's important to note for a long time this was a large part of measuring milk quality . 4 . ) It just takes time to process , test , and ship milk . You mentioned it yourself -- usually to get a glass bottle you have to get it from a dairy , something local and closer to home . So it has n't traveled as far . Also , while it 's not legal everywhere , some people will sell raw milk in glass bottles so there is n't even time wasted <URL> or testing the milk . <URL> . Still , some people might prefer the taste while it 's still good . Processing is done to kill bad bacteria ( so it 's not a bad thing ) , but it does take time that eats into shelf life . Milk delivered to you may only be a few hours old . The processing itself can effect the flavor of the milk . Processing plants can hold milk for up to 3 days . 5 . ) In many areas , the companies that bottle with glass are the ones that are making higher quality milk in the first place . Glass is expensive , and usually only people who are willing to pay more for higher quality milk are going to be the same ones who pay for a higher quality bottle . Glass bottles are good for the environment and so some people are willing to pay more for that . <URL> uses about half as much energy vs plastic counterpart . Note here that glass does n't automatically mean " better milk " . 6 . ) <URL> In a 1980 study , subjects were blindfolded and asked to tell whether the beverage they were drinking was flavored orange . Only one in five could . But when they were allowed to see what they were drinking , each of them identified the orange flavor . And when a lime-flavored drink was colored orange , nearly half of respondents thought it was flavored orange You also see this with high-end restaurants -- they put a lot of value in how the food is plated , going as far as using a ruler to get a perfectly straight line , and wiping up small drips to make the food look perfect . Our vision influences our taste . Since most glass is translucent and most plastic containers are not , there 's a good chance this influences taste as well .
The theory is that washing the chicken ( or any fowl ) removes all of the contaminates from the surface and cavity of the bird ( ie salmonella , etc. ) . People will be in one of two camps - 1 . those that have been told to do all of their lives , so they do it , and 2 . those who do n't because it is really not necessary . You cook your birds to a certain temperature internally for a reason , that is to kill all of that stuff . Really , the truth of the matter is that there are far higher risks in washing the bird and spreading all of those juices all over your sink ( thus contaminating the sink and possibly some work surfaces ) . There is no increase in flavour , there is no practical reason to bother . Professionally , it is not done . However , having said that , the one time I do rinse and pat dry is when I am applying a rub . It ensures that the chicken is dry and I can effectively rub , instead of the rub turning to a paste .
Salt or acid is often added to the water when boiling eggs to denature egg whites faster should there be a crack and a leak . I have not read anything that experiments whether this is effective . It also sounds like " do n't wash mushrooms " or " pasta must be cooked in a ton of water " kind of old wives tales .
Alternatively , the chickens may have been fed maize ( corn ) ; they market a specific maize-fed brand over here and the yokes of those eggs are a very deep yellow as well .
Cook the pancetta on a large pan , so that it fries in its own fat . It must turn red , but do n't cook it too much as you are going to cook it a bit more later on . Open two eggs . If you like the color of the carbonara intense , throw one white away , and keep one white and two yolks . Put them in a bowl , then add grated parmigiano and mix with a fork . The amount of parmesan should be at least the same volume of the eggs , maybe even more ( twice does not hurt ) . This will give you a rather firm but still flowing compound . Firm is better than too liquid . Cook the pasta . Spaghetti is the norm for carbonara , but also penne is a good choice . Get them " al dente " or some second later , as you prefer . Drain the pasta and put it in the pan you used to cook the pancetta ( where the pancetta still is ) . Pour the egg/cheese mix on top of the pasta and put the pan on gentle heat , while you continue moving and mixing . Detach any layer of cooked egg from the bottom of the pan while you mix . The perfect carbonara must not be liquid , and it must not be clumpy solid , so keep mixing or you will get a pasta omelette . Once you are done , turn off the heat , and take spaghetti up with a large fork , so to disentangle them while you transfer them on the dishes . move them in the dish with a small oscillating movement to disentangle a bit more . Continue like this for all the dishes you have to serve . At the end you will have the pancetta remaining in the pan , and you put it on top of each dish . Add more grated parmigiano and some ground black pepper and eat as soon and hot as possible ! Additional notes : try to stay a bit scarce on salt in the pasta water , and do not add salt to the egg . The fact is that the pancetta is already pretty salted , and you risk to obtain a very salted final result . Carbonara should be salty , but not too salty . I heard about modification with butter and cream , but I have never seen them used , at least in my family and circle of friends .

Effect of adding wet ingredients to dry when making bread ?
The main issue you will face is the extra mixing allows for additional gluten development . In some breads , this could create a risk of over-kneading , which could make the dough less workable , more prone to tearing , and more difficult to get the proper rise . Challah is a basic egg enriched bread , so other than the eggs themselves ( which are fairly effective at helping prevent over-kneading ) you do n't have a great deal of protection . The worst case scenario is that your bread will be a little flat and crumbly ; the best case is that you are still well within the tolerance window and it will be just fine . Edit : I will leave this for reference , but I was thinking of brioche : in a very sweet , fatty bread like brioche , this risk is minimized . The fat and sugars in the dough act as barriers preventing the glutin-precursors from interacting as frequently or as easily , making it much , much more difficult to over knead . The main reasons for the traditional order of dough assembly are : As you no doubt realize , it is much easier to incorporate the liquids evenly into loose flour , rather than a partially formed dough The yeast acts on the ingredients present , so sometimes ingredients which inhibit yeast growth are held back until after a fermentation phase You want time for all of the flour to be fully hydrated -- normally , in yeast raised doughs , this is hardly an issue .
Slashing the skin of a loaf creates a weak area . When the oven spring occurs the dough will expand through that weak spot . Expansion will be limited in the stronger , unslashed areas . Conceptually this is fairly simple . Leave the skin unslashed in the direction you do n't want the bread to expand . In the case of a checker slash on the surface of a boule - the edge stays stronger than the entire center so the expansion is forced upwards . In practice , with different loaves , it may be difficult to predict exactly how the physics will occur . You can start with traditional slash patterns that you see on professionally produced bread . For example , on long loaves , such as baguettes , the slashes are short , at a slight angle to the length , and overlapping to promote lengthening of the loaf . Whereas on wider , football-shaped loaves the slash may run parallel to the loaf to widen it a little . As a demonstration I baked two loaves this weekend . They were identically formed as small football-shaped loaves ( batards ) . One I slashed at an angle , the other parallel with the length .
The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water , and what is dissolved in the water , into the meat . I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine , and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast . The difference , deep into the meat , will be noticeable . It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat , but the oils and dissolved parts . That is why you heat and steep the water before cooling it for brining .
You should n't have any problem . Bacteria need sufficient water to survive , a few drops wetting the sugar are not sufficient for them . As far as I 'm aware , even old-style jam ( 1 part fruit to 1 part sugar , boil some of the water out ) is shelf-stable . Even if you are close to the limit , it 's still not too concerning . The good news is that , when you preserve something with sugar , and get a bit too low on the sugar , it 's not bacteria that colonizes it first , it 's mold . The mold can be toxic on its own - but it 's nicely visible . So , as long as you do n't have a sticky mass and see mold growing on it , the sugar should be safe . It can be hard to work with though - we have an old question on getting lumped-together brown sugar out of the container , if you need it .
I think you will get the ' best result ' out of ' par baking ' your rolls . I have done this myself , though not for shipping . It is simply easier to make a large batch and then store them for use as needed . IMHO rolls are best served hot and fresh , and while re-heating fully baked rolls can recapture some of the glory that is fresh baked bread , allowing your customers to finish bake a partially baked product will give them the convenience of truly fresh rolls on demand . The technique ( and recipe , for my part ) I picked up from Alton Brown , in the episode of Good Eats : <URL> . Alton 's recipe for <URL> includes a par baking option : For Brown and Serve option : Assemble rolls as above , but bake as follows . Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake until the outside of the rolls just begin to set but have not browned and the internal temperature is 185 degrees , about 30 minutes . Remove and cool on the pan for 10 minutes . After 10 minutes , remove the rolls from the pan and place on a cooling rack until they are room temperature , 30 to 40 minutes . Place the rolls in bags and freeze for up to 3 months . To Finish : Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thaw the rolls for 60 to 90 minutes . Spray a sheet pan with nonstick spray . Place the rolls on the prepared sheet pan and bake until the rolls reach an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. Rotate the pan halfway through baking , 10 to 12 minutes . Remove the pan to a cooling rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving . The key ' take-aways ' that you will want to apply are : Bake to internal temp of 185 ° F Cool to Room Temp Freeze for up to 3 months
I did actually do two batches with the two methods within a few weeks of asking the question . Just cooking it all together , then removing the skins and seeds with a food mill , is definitely a lot faster . Removing the skins first then pureeing , so that you only remove the seeds later ... well , though it is easy to remove the skin from each individual grape , time-consuming is an understatement unless you 're making small quantities . It took me a few hours for ( if I recall correctly ) 10-15 pounds of grapes . Including the skins has a moderate effect on the texture - it 's slightly thicker and more opaque . You get the feeling there 's just more stuff in it . As long as you 're cooking it fairly long , though , there 's not a very noticeable difference in flavor . On the other hand , if you 're using a recipe with pectin instead of cooking it down until it sets , I definitely prefer having the skins in , for both flavor and texture . So there 's some personal preference involved ; I do rather like the texture with the pureed skins . But if you 're doing large quantities , and the grapes are on the small side , and you do n't have help , you might want to skip it .
There are several reasons for adding orange juice : The first is for flavor . The second is to act as an acid . Although in this particular case , the acid is already in the baking powder . All baking powder needs to act as a leavening agent is some kind of liquid . Unless you meant baking soda , in which case an acid is necessary for leavening . The third is to inhibit mold growth . The real reason vitamin C is added is as a dough enhancer , not for gluten development . Since this is a quick bread ( no yeast ) , gluten development is not a main concern . The fourth reason for the orange juice is to make a tender crumb . Because of the fructose found naturally in it . Sugars are added to baked goods as a tenderizing agent . This recipe sounds yummy !
The way you 've described is precisely how I melt chocolate . If you have a double boiler , that 's even better , but a bowl on top of a pot is fine too . I can only think of two things that might be affecting the quality of your end result : Is the bowl big enough ? The melting bowl should be larger than the pot if possible ; you want the steam to be forced under and around it . Is the water temperature reasonable ? You want it to be at a simmer . If it 's rapidly boiling , the heat is too high . As long as you keep those two things in mind , your chocolate should melt fine ! Edit : Thought of one other thing : It 's possible that the steam is actually rising above the bowl , then hitting something ( like your range ) , condensing and then falling back into the bowl as water . You should n't even be getting much steam with this method , but just in case , turn your fan on , to make sure you are n't getting any condensation .
Given that the frying of a cube of bread is a test for oil temperature , I suspect one or both of two things are happening here - 1 The oil is not at the correct temperature when the cubes of bread are dropped in it ; and 2 The oil temperature drops when you add too many cubes in at the same time so some get burnt and some end up soggy for the single time duration you 're cooking them for . Suggested solutions - 1 Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature for the level of browness you want the cubes of bread to be fried to . 2 Do n't over-crowd the pan . Fry them in batches , ensuring the oil temperature rises back to the correct one before the next batch is fried .
Your ribs will have a lot less flavor if you do not use a dry rub . However you can minimize some of the time ( and only a bit of the flavor ) by putting on the rub , wrapping in foil , and immediately putting them in the oven or on the grill . The process of putting your rub together probably takes only about 5 minutes - it 's the fridge time that takes a while . Sitting in the fridge allows some of the flavors to permeate , and if you used a more permeable material could allow your ribs to air out a bit . These are good things , but for my rib recipe I do n't put the ribs in the fridge and they still taste great . I also do n't put the barbecue sauce on until about the last 20 minutes of oven time , when the foil comes off and the sauce goes on . Until then the ribs stay in the foil . I looked up North Carolina ( which uses a sauce that is n't tomato based in the eastern part of the state ) , South Carolina ( a mustard sauce ) , Texas , Memphis ( which uses no sauce ) , Kansas City ( tomato based-sauce that is rather sweet ) - all of them used a dry rub even with wide variations on the sauce and for both beef and pork ribs .
There are two main base recipes for ice cream . French style ice cream contains egg yolks , which help make it soft , rich , smooth , creamy , custardy . Philadelphia style ice cream ( sometimes called American style ) has no eggs , and relies on the fat in the cream to keep it soft , but will still never be as rich and smooth as French style , and will still tend to freeze harder . You can make pretty much any ice cream in either style , including the pistachio-almond you want to make . You can look around for recipes without eggs ; I would n't be surprised if you manage to find one one . Or you can simply use a Philadelphia style base , and look at one of the recipes you found to see how to add the pistachio and almond . Depending on how rich you want it , you 'll want 2-3 cups of heavy cream for each 1 cup of milk ; about 3/4 cup of sugar should work , depending on how sweet you want it . If that 's not rich enough for you , you can even replace the milk with cream . ( You could also just go find a recipe for Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream and use that as a base - it does n't get much simpler than that . ) ( P.S. . You could also try gelato , something like <URL> - it uses corn starch as a stabilizer instead . )
It 's an issue of thermodynamics . When you 're cooking food , the food cools itself off through evaporative cooling and the energy being used to cause chemical changes in the food ( eg , caramelizing sugars ) . If you have too much food in the pan , the balance is overwhelmed by evaporative cooling , and thus you can only get to the boiling point of water . To change the equation , you need to do one of the following : Use a more powerful heat source . Cook less food at a time Reduce the amount of moisture in the food before cooking it . You 'll often see advice for # 3 -- such as patting dry steak or chicken before grilling it , as without it , you wo n't get good browning . You ca n't do that when you 're dealing with sauces . You can try cooking less , but with sauces you cause more problems -- if the pan size is the same , the area for evaporation is the same , so you do n't really improve the balance . With a sufficiently sized burner , you can actually heat sauces above the boiling point , as you 're putting in energy faster than evaporation can cool it . This which will change the chemical reactions that occur , thus the resulting chemical compounds and the resulting flavor of the food .
Kneading dough has a few functions . First , it distributes the ingredients together evenly and allows the flour to become hydrated . As the flour starts to absorb water , enzymatic reactions occur and some proteins begin to mesh together . The two most important in this process are glutenin and gliadin . When these proteins start to get tangled up together , they form gluten , which is the protein that allows bread dough to stretch and trap gas bubbles produced by yeast . These reactions will occur on their own to an extent , as in no-knead recipes , but kneading accelerates the process . Kneading also allows you to control the texture of the bread . A vigorous knead can help to produce a bread with a fine crumb as the kneading an tighten the gluten , keeping the air bubbles more uniform . Doing short kneading periods ( or folds ) spaced by time for the dough to relax and rise can give you more extensible dough which can help give you a more open crumb structure . Finally , kneading is sometimes used to add inclusions to the dough that would disrupt it 's activity if added to early . This can be things like seeds , which would cut gluten strands if included too early in the process , or things like butter in a brioche , which would shorten the dough if included before the gluten had already developed .
Yes , it certainly is safe to eat them , it happens all the time . They wo n't last quite as long in the fridge as ones which do n't crack , but as long as you eat them in a couple of days you are fine . They may look like nuclear mutants but they will taste the same .
I 'd do one or more of a few things : Treat it like the dough in <URL> , in which you sprinkle flour on top , then pull off a portion you need , then shape quickly into a ball , developing the outer skin , keeping the freshly floured side out . Chill down the dough , so it 's firmer and easier to work with . ( and then do # 1 while it 's still a bit cold ) Put it into muffin pans or similar for baking , so you do n't have to worry about it holding up on its own or even attempting to shape it . ( if you can shape it a little bit , you can then put it into a pan with enough of a lip to give them some support as they rise ; they might spread into each other , but you can typically break them apart after they 're baked ) In general , I find that kneading dough in a mixer ( unless specifically called for in a recipes ) always needs more flour . Basically , when you 're kneading normally , you might work in 1/2 cup or so of extra flour . And there are the issues with knowing what the proper way to <URL> if the measurements are given in volume ( cups ) and not by weight , which will easily throw off any bread recipe .
To release the bone marrow , which is excellent source of protein and has medicinal properties .
Oil definitely changes the crust , and whether or not it 's " better " depends on what you 're going for . Oil in the dough tends to give a softer and thicker crust , while a lean dough tends to give a crisper and thinner crust . Other dough ingredients that tenderize include milk and eggs , and there are plenty of web pages listing " dough enhancers " that give various effects . Again , it all depends on what type of crust and crumb you want .
Professional bakers use straight razors . Chances are they are sharper than your knife , and easier to keep that way ( or cheaper to replace , at least ) . Also : wet the blade before making slashes . This helps lubricate the blade as it cuts , and keeps the cut bread from sticking .
Chia seeds can be used without soaking , but they absorb a LOT of liquid and create a gel . If this is n't accounted for in your recipe , they could cause the finished product to have an odd texture . At the very least , I 'd add extra liquid to your batter and let it sit for a few minutes to check it 's consistency before you use it .
In baking , doubling sometimes is accurate , sometimes not . Yeah , that is a non-answer , but is true . It is not unsafe to double , or halve , but sometimes results will vary . You hit a point which could cause a slight issue , even distribution . Changing volume of a recipe with an ingredient which is distributed over the surface might affect the distribution ratio , though in this case I think it would likely be minor . Other issues can arise in doubling would be if the dough needs to breath . Thermal reactions can often affect results when doubling or halving recipes as well . The cooking time adjustments are often obvious , but cooling can be less obvious but disastrous at times , and any resting times needed may be skewed . All of that said , with allowing for baking time , and a little experimentation , most recipes can be safely doubled or halved , but tend to start breaking down beyond that , going for tripled , 4 times , etc tends to get progressively poor results without a lot of trial and error . It is certainly worth a try though . And alternate or fallback if you do not like the results of doubling is to make two separate batches , which you know will be correct .

How warm must dough be in order to rise ?
Optimal yeast growth happens at around 37 degrees Celsius ( 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , but dough will rise at any room temperature . As the temp rises , the yeast becomes more active , which is why you 'll sometimes see recipes call over overnight rests in the fridge , where activity slows or stops . Yeast dies at anything above 50 C ( 122 F ) . The important thing is knowing the temperature and , if you 're really particular , the humidity in the air around your proof . This information is used for the sake of timing consistency , more than anything else .
According to <URL> : Whole fruits can be stored for a month in a cool , dry area , or refrigerated up to two months . The seed pips can be frozen in an airtight bag up to one year . Fresh juice should be refrigerated and used within two to three days . In my experience in a very dry climate ( Colorado ) after a couple weeks the skins become desiccated and very hard -- you need to saw through them with a serrated knife -- but the seeds are still mostly unaffected . They will shrink somewhat , but still remain unspoiled and flavorful . However , if you refrigerate them , ensure that you do not let them get too cold . According to <URL> : [ ... ] exposure to temperatures below 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) during storage and transport for longer than 4 weeks is a major cause of deterioration [ ... ] The minimum safe storage temperature is 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) for up to 8 weeks , if decay is not a problem . For longer storage , the temperature should be at 7 ° C ( 45 ° F ) to avoid chilling injury , but decay [ ... ] and weight loss may become a limitation . Sorry that the photo is not better quality .
The goal is to keep the surface of the bread from drying out . A wet towel works fine but plastic wrap is cheaper and easier than constantly cleaning wet towels . I have used both methods and have n't noticed a difference in the bread produced . In very dry climates , when I made bread with multiple rises I sometimes had to redampen the towel which was an added inconvenience . Lately I have been proofing large batches of bread in a large stock pot and just use the lid of the pot as the only cover .
You need to make sure you use the right measurements when translating recipes from the US to the UK as the UK uses imperial measurements which are different from US measurements . There are also differences in cream fat content and egg sizes . Teaspoons and tablespoons are the same , so do n't worry about them . First , pint measurements , as the UK does n't use cup measurements . The UK pint is 20 % bigger than the US pint , so if you are using UK pints to measure you may be getting ratios wrong . Use Milliliters instead when translating . 1 US Cup is 237ml ( I round up to 240 ) . If you use UK pints as a measure instead of US you wo n't have enough baking powder in the ratio . In fact , I find UK baking powder and bicarb a bit weaker than US powders , so I increase those measurements a bit anyway . What works for me is the first time I make a US recipe in the UK I weigh the dry ingredients and use weights every time I make the recipe after that , I can fine-tune it that way . US light cream is between 10-30 % butter fat , and heavy cream is about 36-40 % . UK single cream is between 10-30 % fat , whipping cream is about 36 % , and double cream is 50 % fat . So if you are right that US heavy cream is UK whipping cream , but mixing 2 parts UK double and 1 part single works just as well as many places do n't stock whipping cream . I doubt that your results come from the cream you are using though , the fat contents are n't that different . One thing that could be different is the flour you use . US and UK flours are n't completely the same . For my biscuits in the UK I buy 00 or purpose milled pastry flour , which is finer and better for pastry than the bog standard stuff . If you ca n't find it pick the flour with the lowest protein content you can find . Hope this helps , let the forum know your results if you can .
Since my pizza dough recipe makes three 12 " pies and I usually make two at a time , I regularly freeze extras just as you did . To thaw , I have used both the countertop and refrigerator method . Thawing on the countertop produced the best results . The dough rolled as usual and the crust ( a thin one ) was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside after baking .
As eggs are a very versatile ingredient : when substituting , it is important to determine whether the eggs are being used as a leavening agent or binder ( or both ) . In recipes where the egg is used primarily as a leavening agent , I have used a mixture of baking powder ( not soda ) , water , and vegetable oil in a 2:3:3 ratio , though you may want to experiment with the proportions depending upon your recipe . You may also need to vary the amount of other liquid in the recipe . Where the egg is used primarily as a binder , you could use banana , applesauce , or gelatin , depending upon the recipe ( obviously , you 'll probably want to avoid the fruits in a savory recipe ) . I 've used , and been thoroughly disappointed with , the available commercial " egg replacers " and do n't recommend them for any purpose . I 've heard of using flax , but have no personal experience with it . However : as the father of ( and resident chef for ) a young child with egg and milk allergy , it is my experience that successfully substituting for eggs is very difficult . For breads in particular , I do n't even bother with recipes that call for eggs or milk , and favor those that use the basic 3 ( 4 ) : flour , water , yeast ( salt ) .
The usual materials used in an oven ( no matter if electric or gas ) are almost all food-safe non-melting materials used for cooking vessels . If you can use it on a stove top , it should be OK for the oven too ( unless it has a handle from a different material ) . Metal . Oven pans are made from non-reactive metals ( like stainless steel ) or reactive metals with a protective layer ( e.g. seasoned cast iron ) . Do n't use metal vessels which have non-metal parts , like wooden or plastic handles ( except for oven-rated handles , like the phenolic handles on Le Creuset enameled cast iron , which are rated for up to 200 ° C ) . Else , all metallic pans and pots meant for stove top are good for the oven . Also , pay attention to temperature : PTFE ( non-stick ) coated vessels should n't be heated above 250 ° C. Ceramics . If glazed , you should make sure that the glaze does not suffer under high temperature or does not leach dangerous chemicals into the food under high temperatures . There are many glazed ceramic pans meant for the oven , such as lasagna pans , quiche pans , tagines , gyveches , etc , and you can be sure that these are oven-safe . You can also use table porcelain for some limited scenarios , e.g. poaching an egg in an individual serving of soup , but do n't risk your finest porcelain , and do n't do it if the plates are decorated with adhesive designs . If unglazed , you should make sure it is intended for the oven , some types of earthenware may be damaged by the heat . The ones meant for the oven ( like römertopf ) should be fine . Glass . If it is borosilicate glass ( sometimes called Jena glass ) , you can use it in the oven . Do n't subject it to temperature shocks , use room-temperature glass pans ( do n't layer a lasagna the day before in a glass vessel and then bake it straight from the fridge ) , and do n't put them in too hot an oven ( up to 200 ° C should be OK ) . You ca n't determine if it is borosilicate glass or soda lime glass from its looks , so here you have to be sure that the manufacturer markets the vessel as oven safe . Silicone . Food-grade silicone is great for baking and practically indestructible ( unless you cut it ) . If the manufacturer gave a temperature range , go by it , I 'm not sure it will hold up at above 250 ° C , but it is no problem in the normal cake and pastry baking range . Plastics . Some plastics may be able to withstand heat , but you ca n't usually recognize that from their looks , and you do n't know if there may be other problems ( such as melamine , which releases toxic chemicals when heated ) . In theory , I would trust a big manufacturer who markets a plastic pan explicitly as oven-safe , but in practice , I have n't seen such pans . So do n't use plastic vessels in an oven . Wood . Do n't use wood in an oven . It should n't be able to catch fire at normal oven temperatures , so it is not a hazard , but the heat will damage your vessel . While it will still be usable ( especially if you take care to wet it beforehand ) , it will lose its smooth surface , and it will probably warp . Glued wood can also split along the glue lines . If you have a cheap bowl you do n't mind damaging , you can use it in the oven , but I do n't see why , when other materials are much better suited .
Depending on what meat and cut you are brining , and how you intend to treat the meat after brining . You may need to experiment , anything from 50 % to 100 % of the time your recipe book suggest . Search for brining guidelines and other useful information , there are a large community that have a lot of knowledge and experience .
Most of the popular ingredients for BBQ sauce ( vinegar/ketchup/sugar etc. ) tend not to mix very well together . I know whenever I 've made BBQ sauce , placing all of the ingredients into a pan together they tend to separate and are difficult to combine . Heating up the ingredients , however , causes them to combine better , and after a short time cooking they will bind together and give a more consistent texture/taste . Otherwise the different ingredients may continue to separate even when mixed , and you may find clumps of sugar that have not dissolved into the liquid etc. . It 's quite possible your BBQ sauce recipe does n't need cooking , so long as things are substituted ( like sugar for sugar syrup or honey ) in order to combine better , but this may well give an incorrect texture because of the change in ingredients . Therefore if the ingredients you use can be combined without being heated , it 's likely that it does n't need cooking , however you may end up with an uneven flavor . As pointed out in a comment by @ToddWilcox , there may also be constituent ingredients that do require cooking , such as garlic or onion , in order to achieve the correct flavor so that they do not taste raw . Some sauces may also specify being cooked simply to make them thicker or more concentrated , as adding thickening agents such as flour may affect the taste , particularly if it is uncooked . So whilst there are some BBQ sauce recipes that may get away with being uncooked based on their ingredients , there are others that will definitely require cooking .
There is a lot of water in the milk . The high heat turns the water into steam . The egg and flour contains proteins and gluten that forms a " net " . The steam ca n't escape without pushing the net upwards . This makes the dough rise . It helps that the container is a narrow cylinder .
It 's been a while since I made sushi but 2 tablespoons does sound a little on the ridiculous side . Various other recipes use similar amounts ( to each other ) : <URL> : 1 tsp salt ( for 1/2 cup vinegar and 4 tbsp sugar ) <URL> : 1 tbsp kosher salt ( for 2 tbsp vinegar and 2 tbsp sugar ) <URL> : 1 tsp salt ( for 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup sugar ) <URL> : 1/2 tsp salt ( for 2 tbsp vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar ) In fact , although sushi rice recipes tend to vary significantly with respect to the proportions of rice , vinegar , and sugar , they are all remarkably consistent on the amount of salt . The Alton Brown recipe calls for a tablespoon , but 1 tbsp of kosher salt is in fact equivalent to 1-2 tsp of table or sea salt . Even on the Epicurious recipe , the 1/2 tsp is only for 1 cup of rice - you 'd double it to the same 1 tsp for the standard 2 cups . I assume that the recipe you 're looking at must have meant 2 tsp and not tbsp , but I think even that is too much ; I would stick to the 1 tsp used in almost every sushi rice recipe I 've ever seen .
You should have no problem refrigerating the dough . I have done it with chapatti dough , which is essentially the same thing , without a problem . It 's only flour , water and salt after all . You might find it a little hard to roll out straight from the fridge but nothing some brute force and ignorance ( or letting it warm up a little ) wo n't cure .
If you are handy with electrics and electronics , linking a heating element to a PID controller is probably your best bet for stability . This will give you quite stable temperatures . You can find many sets of instructions by googling <URL> , which is a very similar application , although higher temperature ranges are usually the goal .
Oil or fat is absolutely not necessary to cook rice . I suspect you may have been taught the pilaf method where the rice is first sauteed in oil or butter , and then liquid is added and the rice is fully cooked . The purpose of the pilaf method is to add depth of flavor . When making pilafs , additional herbs , spices , or aromatics ( such as onions ) are often included . If you have been taught to add oil without the sauteeing , then the only purpose of it would be to add flavor . It wo n't really help prevent sticking , and is n't needed for the rice to cook properly . There are many methods to cook rice in addition to the pilaf method , and many to do not require any fat . Simply boiling or steaming in water is completely traditional in many Asian cuisines . In some cuisines , the crusty rice that sticks to the bottom of the pot or rice cooker is actually highly prized ( see Wikipedia 's <URL> article ) . You can mitigate the crusting of the rice by making sure to use the lowest flame or heat setting that will keep the rice steaming . I actually prefer to put the whole pot in a moderate oven , rather than do it on the stove top . You can also use the pasta method of simply boiling the rice in water , and then draining it when it is done to your liking , to completely avoid the crust . This will result in less sticky rice since the surface starches will be left in the boiling water . I understand this method is popular in some parts of India and Pakistan .
Most bacon home curing methods you will read use a semi-dry cure where the bacon is covered in a cure mixture then allowed to sit in the resulting brine made of salts , sugars , and exuded liquid from the meat . This is probably due to the fact that most people are more comfortable using their fridge and are also only making a small amount of bacon . The key to what you are looking for is dry curing with drainage . By using a cure mixture which includes nitrates ( traditional ) or nitrites ( modern ) as well as a draining board or table you produce a quickly cured meat product that is stable and can be produced at higher than fridge temperatures . The drawbacks are that the final product will have a greater loss of meat weight due to the loss of water , the product will have more pronounced flavor , and will be saltier but it will also be better preserved . This method is best for meats that will not be cooked but smoked and air-dryed or just air-dryed . It is the best curing method for people living in hot climate or having no refrigeration . In the South , bacon and ham production is something that was traditionally done in the late Autumn to take advantage of the natural cooling to reduce spoilage during the air drying portion of the curing process . The second traditional foodway that allowed bacon to be a staple in the South was the use of <URL> . Method : To guarantee continuous supply of salt and uninterupted curing of the meat , the dry curing is performed in a few stages . The cure ingredients should be thoroughly mixed . The mix should be rubbed into the meat at a ratio of 1:100 , curing salt mixture to meat , by weight . During this initial salting of the meat , it is important to thoroughly cover all surface of the meat piece with the salt mixture , because the high salt level and the cooler temperatures are the only means of protection against the growth of spoilage bacteria . Then the meats would then be packed tightly in a container with larger pieces like hams on the bottom and smaller pieces on the top so that each piece will retain its shape . The meats are packed skin down . Liquid drawn from the meat will accumulate on the bottom of the container and if the holes were made it would drain off . ( If you want to experiment with smaller amounts of meat you can perform this part of the process on a flat tray set at an angle to allow juices to drain away or in a perforated pan . ) The rule of thumb is 2 days of curing for each pound of original meat weight . Flip the meat after 3 days , and then again every 7 days thereafter , making sure that there is salt covering the entire surface . ( For bacon that would be stored for a long time or subject to higher temperatures they would most likely overhaul the cure , replacing the salt mixture 1 or more times during the process . ) After curing is complete , the meat pieces must be rinsed in fresh water to remove any crystalized salt that accumulates on the surface that would prevent sucessful smoke penetration . Blot dry then hang the meats or place on wire mesh to dry overnight . Store meat in a refrigerator or cool root cellar overnight or for up to 2 days . Allowing the bacon to dry uncovered in a cool place the night before you plan to smoke it encourages smoke retention through <URL> formation . At this point you would smoke the bacon and then let it air dry in a cool barn ( during Autumn and Winter ) or a root cellar . Like country hams , the bacon would likely be stored by hanging it in the root cellar in a muslin sack . Bacon produced this way is saltier than modern bacon . If you find it too salty , you can blanch it in simmering water for 30-60 seconds immediately before frying to reduce the salt . <URL>
Your metal bowl sitting in your 70 ° F room is 70 ° F ( at least , if its been sitting there for a bit ) . Your plastic bowl , or glass bowl , or ceramic bowl , or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70 ° F. They 're all actually the same temperature . Now , given , when you touch the metal bowl , it feels cooler than the plastic one . This is because your finger is n't 70 ° F , and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than ( say ) plastic . If the dough is room temperature , it wo n't matter -- heat is n't flowing out of it . The dough itself does n't generate much heat . If your dough started above room temperature , it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl . But , if you wanted to keep it from cooling , putting it in a warm place is much more effective . A stainless steel bowl is fine . I 'd avoid aluminum ( and copper , if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing ) due to them being reactive , especially if you 're making sourdough .
Vodka by definition is a flavorless distilled alcohol , retaining any of the organoleptic properties of the grain or potato could be considered as ruining the end product . Potatoes are a good source of starch , but brewers yeast has a limited ability to break down starch into usable fuel ; its preferred fuel sources are relatively simple sugars like mono and disaccharides . In order to efficiently convert the starch in potatoes to sugar the potatoes must first be boiled so that the starches gelate . Once gelated , the potatoes are then Mashed-in with malted barley or wheat at a temperature around 150 ˚F so that the diastatic enzymes can break those starches into the sugars that yeast likes to eat . These same steps are used when making vodka from non-malted grains such as corn ( maize ) . Boiling the potatoes also helps reduce the number of surface microbes that could end up influencing the final product . Bacteria and wild yeast strains can lead to moldy , grassy , sour , and other unpleasant flavors that may necessitate multiple distillations to remove . Making a mash of raw , peeled potato would likely yield something closer to a sourdough starter with a mix a naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria producing a small amount of alcohol along with acetic and lactic acids , as well as other compounds .
Keep the fats as cold as possible before you start . Done right , it will more than compensate for the warmth of hands , blender/processor parts , and ambient temperature . Having somewhat chilled your choice of fats , separate them into small , 1 inch sized pieces , working with copious flour to keep them from sticking to one another . Place this in the freezer overnight . This allows the blade to chew up even near-frozen bits . I have n't noticed much degradation with this method , though I would n't the leave fats in for much longer than that . Mix your dry ingredients together . Put the thoroughly chilled fats in a blender/mixer , leaving some room . Then , using only as much dry ingredients as necessary , pulse the fats until you have pearls slightly smaller than fish gravel . This works especially good for blenders where the ingredients tend to get stuck at the bottom . If you get the chance , stow the blended stuff in the freezer while you work with the next batch . Once you have completed the blending en masse , you can add the rest of the dry ingredients . You should have a uniform texture to the whole mixture . Add water until the dough comes together with limited kneading . Wrap and return to fridge as soon as possible .
If you insist on using a damp cloth , you have to make it wet again and again , so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times . Much easier is plastic wrap , which does n't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl . Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously wo n't work . My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid . It does n't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of " stretch and fold " or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough .
Short answer : Steam . Long answer : Proteins in egg whites are almost uniquely suited to making foams of tiny bubbles , then stretching like a web of bungee cords as the water inside these bubbles turns to steam in the oven . Therefore , the critical element in making your souffle rise is the skill with which you whip the whites into a foam to the correct degree ( just to stiff peaks , not over-whipped ) , followed by integrating ( folding ) that foam into the dense , flavor-filled base . There are a few tricks for augmenting the rise -- e.g. , using a pinch of tartaric acid in the whites , using a copper bowl -- but if your technique is poor , these things wo n't make enough of a difference . Alton Brown ( " Good Eats " TV show ) has an excellent program explaining the whole thing , including some basic chemistry , available free on YouTube : <URL> <URL> By the way , you said that a successful souffle must rise above the vessel . While rising high is a major goal , I would not limit success to that event . Last night , I made chocolate souffle that only crested the vessel a little ways ( not the ideal " double the volume " ) , but each bite was still ethereal and decadent at the same time . Everyone 's plate was clean . THAT , to me , is a successful souffle .
end question
