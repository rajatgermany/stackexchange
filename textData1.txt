To make Gluten free pancakes , can I just substitute regular flour with Gluten free flour ?
It depends on what you mean by gluten-free flour . If you are buying a gluten-free flour mix that it labeled for all-purpose use then you should be able to substitute that and get a reasonably good result . Substituting straight rice or almond flour in a standard recipe will not work well , because the mixes have a blend of ingredients designed to make it perform similar to flour . It may take some recipe/flour experimentation to get it as close to what you are used to , but will definetly make something edible . There are also various almond-flour based pancake recipes which work well .
There are cultured soy and coconut milk products ( generally sold with yogurt ) which can be used as a sour cream substitute ; it 's frequently advisable to add a little extra vinegar or lemon juice as these products do n't generally provide as much kick as real sour cream .
If there 's leavening in the cake ( baking soda or baking powder ) that gets activated once incorporated with the rest of the ingredients , and you substantially overmix , you may lose some of its power as you help the gas escape from your batter . Unless you 're whipping it vigorously , you 're not going to be bringing enough air into the batter to make up for it . This is pretty much like letting the batter sit out on the counter for a while before baking , except faster .
Authentic flour tortillas use lard . For an authentic taste , use that , or consider using shortening or butter since they are solid at room temperature like lard . You also might want to consider increasing the fat in your recipe . Fat will coat the proteins of your flour and keep the gluten network from forming so easily . I was also taught when making tortillas to let the dough rest for an hour after kneading and before rolling/pressing . This helps everything relax . After cooking each tortilla , put them in a pile with a clean towel over them . The tortillas will sweat liquid , helping them to soften up . You can also put them all in a heat-safe bag ( paper or microwave safe plastic ) for sweating . When storing your tortillas , make sure to store them in a bag and not in the open air . If your tortillas are too small , you should be able to roll out a larger piece of dough . Part of the texture issues might actually be from you rolling them too thin . If you are used to working with dough your ideas of thin might be different from the overstated ones found in recipes . Try rolling to various thicknesses .
I would go out an buy some . Dough textures for gluten-free breads are fragile and the result of extensive testing with various non-wheat flours ( at least , good ones like Serious Eats are ) . None of the other flours you have available will have the same water absorbsion or starch content which rice flour does . If you substitute , you 'd have to make the recipe several times in order to recalibrate it . Besides , rice flour is generally pretty useful if cooking for someone who ca n't eat gluten . So you 'll use the rest of it . And if you can find it in a bulk foods store , it 's quite cheap .
Yes , and it is very easy . I do it all the time . You only need a very simple calculation . You do n't even have to be precise . If you do want precision , you will have to find out 1 ) how much of your flour protein is gluten , 2 ) how much of your " vital wheat gluten " is gluten , and 3 ) how much gluten content you need for your recipe . Then use a simple rule-of-three calculation to get the amount needed to add . I usually do n't bother , because 1 ) and 2 ) is information which is very hard to find , and due to the large difference in gluten weight and complete weight , imprecision from not using true proportions is minimal . What I do is : Look up the protein content of your flour ( usually printed on the package ) , for example 9.6 grams per 100 grams Look up the gluten content needed for your bread recipe . If it is not specified , 12.5 % is usual for bread flour . Add the difference in vital wheat gluten . In the example above , add 2.9 g of vital wheat gluten per 100 g of flour . This does n't produce exactly 12.5 % gluten content , but I think that it is within the tolerance of most recipes ; indeed , not all commercial flours are exactly 12.5 % , they vary with brand and season . I add the powder to the flour and mix it well before making the bread . If I am using a preferment , I add all the gluten to the preferment and make the non-fermenting part with AP flour only , so my gluten can benefit from longer autolysis . I have no direct comparison with " true " bread flour , as I have never used it . But my breads requiring bread flour turn out good for my standards . There is no problem with bad distribution , the dough turns out very smooth and evenly elastic . There is a pronounced difference to using AP flour only .
You can absolutely do this . I do it in <URL> , for example . A good trick to boost the flavor even farther is to add non-fat milk powder to the butter as it browns , to supply even more protein for the Maillard reactions .
The main things that can go bad with flour , assuming it is properly stored are : Rancidity Insect infestation If you do n't see any insects , and it still smells good , you should feel free to use it . If it smells off or nasty -- trust me , your nose will tell you -- then you will want to discard it . The actual date on the bag is only a guideline .
Yes . The important fat is the one the starch first goes into . The higher temperature reached by fats ( as compared to water or milk ) helps cook the flour , creating flavors . The liquid added later dilutes the mixture into a sauce . The liquid 's fats are not as crucial for the sauce 's thickness as the liquid 's proteins . I think of the cooked butter-flour mixture as a thickner that can be added to milk , broths , and even a saucy dish . The roux thickens way better than just a slurry of flour and a cold liquid . Jack Lang has written <URL> and the science is summarized in chapter 4 of <URL>

Instant flour has the advantage of speed and ease . You can pretty much always do without - but for home cooks in a hurry , it can be an easy solution . Its used for sauces , but sometimes recommended for pastry work because of the ultra low protein content . Normally , when adding flour to a sauce you 'll need to make it into a slurry or roux and mix in correctly to avoid lumps . Then you 'll need to cook it for a bit to get rid of the ' flour taste ' . With instant flour , its just pour and stir - no clumps , no waiting . My understanding is that this is ultra low protein flour that as been flash hydrated , cooked ( possibly with steam ) , dehydrated , and then finely ground . This means its pretty much ' ready ' to use - it wo n't taste ' floury ' since its already been cooked and the superfine particles are supposed to not clump . ( It may also contain some malted barley flour as a dough conditioner ) . You could try ( this is just an idea ) making it at home by basically repeating the above process - steam cake flour , dehydrate , grind ... but I do n't know why you would . If you going to do all that , just make a slurry or roux or use cake flour . This <URL> lays out a few interesting uses . Using it for crepes because it will hydrate quicker . Using it for pastry work when you can get pastry flour and you do n't want the bleachness of cake flour .
You can not easily cool and reheat a decent sized lasagna in 3 to 4 hours and get down to 4C for any length of time to make it worthwhile It was mostly sterile from the baking process . If you leave the oven door closed it will stay clean and warm for a few hours . Simply be re-heated 30 minutes before serving . You could under-cook it slightly to allow for this , but for lasagna is usually improves with more cooking You could also consider leaving the oven on low , and keeping it hot till serving time . This may degrade some foods , it depends on what 's in it . Keep it above 70C ( 160F )
What you are looking for is called wholemeal flour . Here 's a quick US to UK baking translation guide . US on the left , UK on the right : All-purpose flour = plain flour bread flour = strong flour ( both have extra gluten ) whole wheat flour = wholemeal flour 1 stick of butter is 113g ( get a scale , trust me ) 1 large egg = 1 medium egg
Salt serves two primary purposes in baking : To regulate yeast Salt kills yeast . The addition of salt to a yeast leavened dough prevents the little beasties from growing completely out of control . To enhance and mask specific flavors Salt is almost a universal flavor enhancer . Virtually anything that tastes good , will taste better with salt . What typically comes as a surprise to people is that this holds true with sweet things too , particularly chocolate . The addition of even a tiny bit of salt can make a sweet dish significantly sweeter . It also serves to mask the taste of raw flour . Update Also according to <URL> salt affects the strength and shelf life of baked goods .
I use a liquid oil instead of a spray oil ; you 're far more likely to get hot spots with a spray , which is bad for any kind of cooking . That stuff works better as a grease than an actual cooking oil . I also tend to have pretty good success by frying the tortillas up to just a hint of golden-brown ( dark brown spots is overdone ) and then finishing it off ( i.e. to melt the cheese ) in a low-heat oven . As an added benefit , if you 're making a largish batch then that makes it easy to keep them warm until they 're all ready to serve . YMMV , but I find this to be the case for a whole lot of stovetop cooking ; with the direct heat , it 's very easy to dry foods out before they 're cooked to the stage you want . It 's far easier to control the heat in an oven and just use the stove for an initial ( or final ) fry/sear .
Robert Cartaino 's answer hits a main point : sourdough cultures are adapted to what they are typically fed . When switching flours , it may take a while for the culture to adjust . The starter may seem a bit sluggish at first . That said , I would NOT recommend trying to start a wheat culture if you already have a healthy starter that began with rye . There are two main reasons . First , rye is particularly rich in certain sugars and food that natural yeasts tend to like , so rye starters naturally tend to look more " lively " than wheat starters , especially in the early stages of a starter . Part of what you may be seeing in your transition to wheat is simply less activity produced because the food source is less rich in nutrients , not necessarily because the yeast and bacteria ca n't digest it . Second , a lot of recipes to generate new starters recommend using rye at the beginning , regardless of what you ultimately plan to feed the starter . Because it provides a strong food source for young cultures , it 's usually a lot easier to begin with rye ( perhaps this is why you did ) . In my experience , it tends to take new wheat starters at least twice as long to get strongly established compared to rye , and there 's a higher chance of failure if you do n't use a good recipe . For both of these reasons , some people even recommend always feeding your starter with rye flour , even if you tend to make wheat-based bread . Since many people have success doing that ( and I have personally ) , I do n't think you need to begin a whole new culture with wheat alone . If your starter really is sluggish ( and not just a little less active than it was with rye ) , you can help your starter to adapt to the new food . I 'm not sure what your typical feeding routine is or what the hydration level of your starter is . But the general thing to do in these circumstances is to dilute your starter and feed it large quantities of the new food . For example , if you maintain 200 grams of your starter normally , I would discard all but maybe 40-50 grams and then add enough new flour and water to get back to 200 grams in whatever your usual proportion is . ( Some people would be even more extreme in diluting the starter and cut the starter proportion even further . ) Within a few days of feedings like this , you will have strongly selected the yeast and bacteria that thrive on whole wheat and your starter should be strong again . After a week of feedings like this , I doubt you could distinguish the performance of your starter from one that was begun on wheat . ( Note that the specific microorganisms may still be slightly different , but your starter should do a fine job raising dough and providing flavor . )
Short and sweet ... Use cake / pastry flour . At 5-7 % protein vs. 11 % for AP vs. 13 % + for bread flour , that means a lot less gluten formation . This protein , when mixed with water and subjected to mechanical working is what produces gluten . The higher the protein percentage , the ' tougher ' ( due to the gluten ) the final product . Always use cake or pastry flour when making any type of cake , even brownies . And a little extra egg wo n't hurt , either .
You could use sugar substitutes but you should take care to use one that is heat stable . Sugar Substitute with Stevia as main ingredient can be used but you need to inquire to what ratios you would need to use your specific brand with . Acesulfame Potassium is heat stable but is 200 times sweeter than regular sugar . The general rule of thumb I was taught is 1 gram per quarter cup of sugar . Sucralose : Granulated sucralose can be used as an equal-volume substitute for sugar . ( Raw sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar , so you 'd use less , but the granulated form contains fillers to bring it up to the normal volume . ) There may be some considerations in making ice cream with this as when using this for baking the baking process is accelerated to a certain degree . Be careful with this one . Saccharin and Aspartame should be avoided because they are heat sensitive . Other more natural sugar substitutes include honey , fruit juice concentrates and refined fructose .
Once you have learned to recognize good dough consistency by feel , you might decide to add more flour . This is because even when you weigh , your texture can be influenced by small changes in the gluten content in your brand and batch of flour ( it is a natural product after all , and the difference between 11 and 11.5 % is already noticeable ) and by the humidity of your storage room . Before you have learned to recognize the perfect texture by feel , only use additional flour to prevent sticking to utensils , unless it feels terribly wet and flows everywhere ( but then you probably measured wrong ) .
Honey is your real binding agent here , not maple syrup . You can substitute the sugar-free syrup but be aware of what 's in it - according to the ingredients , it 's mostly <URL> , which is both a <URL> and a laxative . Now , ordinarily , I would n't tell people to worry about the digestive effects of sorbitol , but that 's a seriously large quantity you 'd be adding , so if any of you have sensitive stomachs , beware of eating too much of that trail mix at once . The other property - humectancy - means that what you end up with is going to be moister than what you 'd get with pure maple syrup . That may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes . Since your issue seems to be a lack of availability rather than a problem with sugar itself , I 'd personally substitute generic pancake syrup , sugar syrup or even corn syrup instead . Or , if you 're really keen on the sugar-free stuff , you can use less of it and add more honey because the sorbitol will help keep the whole product moist . If you really want to cut down on the sugar , you can also use agave nectar , which is a fairly close substitute for honey ( a bit thinner ) , and could also stand in for maple syrup if used in combination with another syrup and perhaps some maple extract or maple flavouring . It wo n't be the same flavour , but , texture-wise , it should be a pretty close match .
