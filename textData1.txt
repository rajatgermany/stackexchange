To make Gluten free pancakes , can I just substitute regular flour with Gluten free flour ?
It depends on what you mean by gluten-free flour . If you are buying a gluten-free flour mix that it labeled for all-purpose use then you should be able to substitute that and get a reasonably good result . Substituting straight rice or almond flour in a standard recipe will not work well , because the mixes have a blend of ingredients designed to make it perform similar to flour . It may take some recipe/flour experimentation to get it as close to what you are used to , but will definetly make something edible . There are also various almond-flour based pancake recipes which work well .
There are cultured soy and coconut milk products ( generally sold with yogurt ) which can be used as a sour cream substitute ; it 's frequently advisable to add a little extra vinegar or lemon juice as these products do n't generally provide as much kick as real sour cream .
If there 's leavening in the cake ( baking soda or baking powder ) that gets activated once incorporated with the rest of the ingredients , and you substantially overmix , you may lose some of its power as you help the gas escape from your batter . Unless you 're whipping it vigorously , you 're not going to be bringing enough air into the batter to make up for it . This is pretty much like letting the batter sit out on the counter for a while before baking , except faster .
Authentic flour tortillas use lard . For an authentic taste , use that , or consider using shortening or butter since they are solid at room temperature like lard . You also might want to consider increasing the fat in your recipe . Fat will coat the proteins of your flour and keep the gluten network from forming so easily . I was also taught when making tortillas to let the dough rest for an hour after kneading and before rolling/pressing . This helps everything relax . After cooking each tortilla , put them in a pile with a clean towel over them . The tortillas will sweat liquid , helping them to soften up . You can also put them all in a heat-safe bag ( paper or microwave safe plastic ) for sweating . When storing your tortillas , make sure to store them in a bag and not in the open air . If your tortillas are too small , you should be able to roll out a larger piece of dough . Part of the texture issues might actually be from you rolling them too thin . If you are used to working with dough your ideas of thin might be different from the overstated ones found in recipes . Try rolling to various thicknesses .

Sautéing vs Frying vs Caramelizing -- what 's the difference ?
I 've never really considered there to be a real difference between sautéing and frying . They both mean to cook in a hot pan with a little bit of fat . However there is n't a lot of consistency online . It does n't look like there 's any sort of definitive answer here . Some points of view : <URL> , although frying might involve slightly more oil . The terms are essentially interchangeable . This is the top hit on a google search " sauteing frying " ( although this question is on the first page ! ) . <URL> , sautéing involves jumping the food while frying involves a little more oil and less flipping or stiring of the food . Here 's <URL> for this definition . This definition makes a delineation between pan frying and shallow frying . <URL> and involves partially submerging the food in oil . Food is normally breaded first . There 's no distinction between frying and shallow frying . This is Martha Stewart 's definition . As you can see , it 's really all over the map , and that was just from the first page of the google results . I think we 're getting in to issues with language changing beneath us . However , I think the safest bet is probably that sautéing involves a lot of stirring , frying does n't , and I should consider refining my own definitions . Caramelizing ( which fortunately does n't have any of the same confusion ) is a process that happens during cooking when sugar oxidizes . There are many different ways that you can achieve this effect . One of the ways is to sauté or fry ( depending on your definition ) something until the water sweats out and the remaining sugar heats up . So the answer is that you are caramelizing the onions by sautéing ( or maybe frying ) them .
If you use frozen you will not have the option of having a thick cheese soup with more crisp broccoli ; i.e. if you were considering adding the broccoli toward the end after blanching it for a more toothsome floret , this would only be fruitful with fresh . I am unsure about the blogspot link in Sebiddy 's post , but my experience with frozen broccoli is that it gets the job done but not very well . As a point of logistics , using frozen without first thawing will net you a hearty release of water from the broccoli if you do n't thaw first and may cause your mornay some heart-ache if timed poorly .
Soy sauce , sake or mirin and sugar are the usual ingredients in a teriyaki sauce . The rice wines in particular are vital for an authentic teriyaki flavour . So the question is somewhat moot : onions are n't usually found in teriyaki sauce anyway . The onions naturally add flavour to your marinade : if you like it , leave them in , if you do n't , take them out . The onions wo n't have any major chemical effect on the marination process . Personally I would ditch the olive oil , replace it with toasted sesame oil and add garlic and ginger for a more rounded and authentically flavoured East Asian marinade .
If I were to guess , it would be that the ones that call for a lively simmer are sauces , soups , or other thicker liquids . The lively simmer in that case would refer something close to a light boil . For instance , tomato sauce simmers even when you have it on low , but if you were to cut the temperature up to a medium low , it would bubble much more actively and to me would be considered a lively simmer .
Use a vegetable peeler to peel of large strips of rind . That way , it 'll be easier to remove once you 're done steeping . If you do n't mind it being mildly alcoholic , steep them in vodka and then strain the vodka into the lemonade .
With regard to your source that suggests adding lettuce will reduce foaming of the oil : it might be possible to use lettuce as a tool to scoop up surfactants from the surface of the oil . If you 're going to attempt it , I think the best time to do it would be when the oil is cool . An Introduction to Surface Tension Foaming is related to surface tension : for example , adding a <URL> ( such as soap in water ) to a liquid reduces its surface tension , which makes bubbles more stable . So to reduce foaming , you would need to increase the surface tension . Note that we ca n't increase surface tension by adding something to the oil : the only way to increase the surface tension of a liquid with an additive is to increase its overall density . To see why that 's the case , suppose for a moment that there were a magical substance that liked to stay on the surface of the liquid and caused higher surface tension . That higher surface tension would compress the liquid , and raise its pressure . That means any spot on the surface that had less of the substance would have less surface tension and less pressure , so the pure liquid would be pushed out of that spot and cover the surface . That process would result in the substance never actually being on the surface of the liquid , which contradicts our starting assumption , so no such substance can exist . Instead , such substances become distributed evenly throughout the interior of the liquid ... and , if they make the liquid more dense , that raises its surface tension . So , if we want to increase the surface tension of aging oil , the only way we can do that is by removing surfactants from the oil , assuming we do n't want to mix the oil with large quantities of something more dense . Surface Tension and Frying As J. B. Rossell explains in <URL> ( with credit to BaffledCook for finding the source ) , surface tension is very important in deep fat frying , beyond just the idea of foaming . Initially , oil for deep fat frying tends to undercook ( or takes longer to cook ) food , because few surfactants are present in fresh oil . Due to the high surface tension , the oil is less often in direct contact with the food being fried ( as little as 10 % of the time it is submerged ) , which means less heat transfer by conduction , less of a crust , and less oil present in the final product . As the oil gradually breaks down with repeated cooking , surfactants build up in the oil , reaching an ideal range which gives the preferred golden crust and moderate greasiness , with oil being in contact with the food between 20 % and 50 % of the time it is submerged . When the oil goes bad , the high quantity of surfactants results in too much contact between the oil and the food , resulting in greasy food that is overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside , and may have a bad flavor due to the rancidity of the oil , or contamination from the food being fried . Removing Surfactants First of all , I want to say that I 'm not sure I 'm in favor of trying to prolong the life of frying oil beyond its natural lifetime : the breakdown of the oil results in potentially cancer-causing free radicals , so I 'd rather err on the side of replacing the oil too often , especially if I 'm cooking for myself or loved ones . If you were going to re-use the oil anyway , you might be able to reduce the amount of oil that gets into your food by reducing the quantity of surfactants , but if you 're debating saving money by using your fry oil longer than you normally would , I 'd say a bottle of oil is cheaper than a trip to the oncologist 's office . Speaking of cost , I think a bottle of most oils used for frying is also cheaper than a head of lettuce , so I 'm not sure how economically viable this strategy is . That said , since surfactants ( SURface ACTive AgeNTS ) are attracted to the surface of the liquid ( they find a lower energy state by decreasing the energy of the boundary between two liquids or a liquid and a gas ) , they can potentially be removed by skimming ( or just pouring ) them off the surface . ( I expect putting the oil in a narrow bottle and pouring off some of the oil from the top would be a more economically viable solution to remove surfactants . ) Because crinkly lettuce leaves have a high surface area , its possible that just dipping lettuce in the oil and drawing it out might remove a significant amount of surfactant , especially if the surface area of the lettuce leaf is high in comparison to the surface area of the pot that the oil is in : the surfactant will attempt to spread evenly across the entire surface of the oil . If we assume the surfactant is attracted only to the oil/air boundary ( note : I have no knowledge of whether this is actually the case , or whether the material of the container matters ) , then when a lettuce leaf with a surface area equal to the surface area of the oil/air boundary is dipped into the oil , and then slowly removed , the oil covering the top of the pot and the oil covering the lettuce leaf will have roughly equal su

Are bay leaves dangerous to ( unwittingly ) eat ?
There is no reason to worry . The worst thing which can happen is that a piece of bay leaf , being somewhat hard , can lodge somewhere in your digestive system , necessitating a trip to ER . But a medical paper on the topic starts its discussion section with the sentence " Reports discussing ingestion of bay leaves have been exceedingly scant " . They only cite 10 references in the period 1950-1990 , and most of these are general studies of foreign bodies in the esophagus , not specific studies of bay leaf ingestion . Given how often bay leafs must find their ways into people 's digestive systems ( they feature in our food ) , it is safe to conclude that only a tiny fraction of ingested bay leafes cause problems , else there would be more studies mentioning such cases . The same is true for side effects different from mechanical obstruction : if this had happened , somebody would have published it . The paper I mentioned is " Bay Leaf Impaction in the Esophagus and Hypopharynx " by Stephen K. Buto , MD ; Tat-Kin Tsang , MD ; Gerald W. Sielaff , MD ; Laurie L. Gutstein , MD ; and Mick S. Meiselman , MD. . Sadly , it is n't freely available ( I could read the full text because my uni has a subscription ) . I guess that if you are working as a cook , your workplace may decide that even if the chance for a customer choking on a bay leaf is something like one in a million , they 'd rather instill removing bay leaves from dishes as a policy . Probably prudent , although there are more important risks to care about .
There 's nothing magical about garlic that causes it to be especially prone to botulism - it 's just commonly found as an example because it 's commonly used to prepare flavoured oils . All low-acid foods must be acidified or pressure-canned before long-term storage . Storage in oil creates an anaerobic environment which further promotes botulism , and room-temperature storage is even more risky . Chili peppers are low acid , like all peppers , so yes , they 're a risk .
First and foremost , for both types remove the white core , which is the most bitter part . Some recipes omit that bit of instruction , assuming the reader knows this . Next , the bitter compounds are water soluble , so soaking the cut leaves for half an hour or - if applicable - blanching will remove excessive bitterness . ( Yes , you will leach out vitamins , but it 's either one or the other . ) Good produce matters in this case , too : fresh chicory / endive is only slightly bitter . If the heads have been exposed to light and warmth , they turn increasingly bitter . So if you can , buy them from stores where they are kept in dark boxes and choose firm , plump ( = fresh ) heads , then store them in the fridge at home . I would assume a similar mechanism for red chicory / radicchio , but it 's not kept dark . But again , pick firm heads . And then there is preparation : A quick stir-fry will keep the bitter compounds inside the leaves , long braising will tend to extract them into the sauce , making the whole dish being percieved as more bitter . If that 's too much for you , blanch first . Also , adding sweet or caramelly notes ( a generous pinch to a spoonful of sugar in the frying pan ) or aceto balsamico can mitigate the bitter taste .
Hooves are generally not eaten directly but make great soup . If you Google ' trotter soup ' , you will find recipes from many different culinary traditions , most of them middle-eastern or from the Indian sub-continent . This page has some typical recipes : <URL> Although trotter generally means pig 's hooves in the west , it 's used to mean any hooves in the east .
It 's safe because freezing greatly slows ( if not completely arrests ) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil . It does n't kill them , it just puts them in ' stasis ' . The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated . If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date , best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP , and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting . The main hazard is in that defrosting . At no point should the chicken ( any part thereof ) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours . The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge . You can also defrost it under cold running water , providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark . Of course , you can also cook the meat straight from frozen . There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts . Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe , especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat . You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature ( 170 ° F/75 ° C ) .

How do I make the panko bread stick to my egg-coated chicken ?
Panko wo n't stick to chicken ( too dry ) , but will stick to egg . Egg wo n't stick to chicken ( too smooth and non-absorbant ) , but will stick to flour . Flour will stick to chicken . Dredge first through flour , then through ( well beaten ) egg , then through panko . It 's a tricky combination , but if you do it right the results are excellent . Any dry spices you want to put in can go in the flour . While I do n't know for sure , I would certainly would n't include any oils in the coating , as none of flour/egg/panko will stick to oils .
It is simply that the microwave heats primarily the water molecules , causing the bread to steam . A normal oven heats all of the molecules of the bread , and by the time the water is heavily steaming you will have pulled it out of the oven .
I think you will get the ' best result ' out of ' par baking ' your rolls . I have done this myself , though not for shipping . It is simply easier to make a large batch and then store them for use as needed . IMHO rolls are best served hot and fresh , and while re-heating fully baked rolls can recapture some of the glory that is fresh baked bread , allowing your customers to finish bake a partially baked product will give them the convenience of truly fresh rolls on demand . The technique ( and recipe , for my part ) I picked up from Alton Brown , in the episode of Good Eats : <URL> . Alton 's recipe for <URL> includes a par baking option : For Brown and Serve option : Assemble rolls as above , but bake as follows . Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake until the outside of the rolls just begin to set but have not browned and the internal temperature is 185 degrees , about 30 minutes . Remove and cool on the pan for 10 minutes . After 10 minutes , remove the rolls from the pan and place on a cooling rack until they are room temperature , 30 to 40 minutes . Place the rolls in bags and freeze for up to 3 months . To Finish : Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thaw the rolls for 60 to 90 minutes . Spray a sheet pan with nonstick spray . Place the rolls on the prepared sheet pan and bake until the rolls reach an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. Rotate the pan halfway through baking , 10 to 12 minutes . Remove the pan to a cooling rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving . The key ' take-aways ' that you will want to apply are : Bake to internal temp of 185 ° F Cool to Room Temp Freeze for up to 3 months

Egg-whites in a carton are usually pasteurized . Pasteurized eggs are not great for meringue because the heat from the pasteurization process negatively affects the proteins in the whites that make for good meringue . With a lot of whipping ( and more cream of tartar or other stabilizers ) pasteurized egg whites ( whether from pasteurized eggs or from cartons ) can make meringue though it most likely wo n't be as stiff as those from non-pasteurized eggs . I would suggest getting regular eggs and trying to use the left-over yolks for something like creme brulee .
If you are using a additional containers or surfaces in the oven for baking , you should absolutely pre-heat it with the oven . Use an IR thermometer to measure the actual temperature of the container - a dutch oven or heavy stone will take longer to come up to temperature than the air in the oven will , so the oven will claim to be preheated sooner than it is actually ready . Remember that temperature and heat are two different things - one of the benefits of using a baking stone or dutch oven or other " heavy " thing is that it stores a lot of HEAT . Air at 450F and Cast Iron at 450F contain very different amounts of heat , and it is heat that will bake your bread . You can tell that they have soaked up as much heat as they can when their temperature is close to your oven set-point , which will take a while . The only possible exception to this would be if you are just using a thin sheet metal steam tray to cover your pizza stone to trap steam , since it has so little thermal mass . A thin tray could probably be put over the bread without preheating the tray since it wo n't absorb or store much thermal energy . To prevent burning , choose containers with a good , solid handle , and get quality oven mitts , preferably with long-ish sleeves to protect your forearms .
You can give your candies hard shells by dipping them into a melted mixture of one part water , two parts sugar , and 1/2 part corn syrup . Melt those ingredients together over medium to medium-high heat until the sugar has totally dissolved and the mixture is at the hard crack stage ( 295-310 & deg ; F. / 146-154 & deg ; C. ) . Remove your pot of glaze from the heat and place it into a waiting metal bowl of ice water . Once the glaze has stopped bubbling , begin dipping your candies immediately . Once dipped , set them on an appropriate , lightly greased surface to cool ( use a flavorless oil or kitchen spray for greasing ) . You 'll want to skewer your candies to dip them ; never attempt to dip candies into hot glaze by hand . You 'll also want to set everything up for dipping before you make your glaze : have your bowl of ice water ready ; have a greased tray or marble slab/counter ready to receive your dipped candies ; have your kitchen to yourself ( distractions are n't good when working with hot glaze ) . Your glaze will cool very quickly , so work carefully but efficiently .

What takes over the functions of gluten in gluten-free bread mixes ?
To summarize the <URL> and provide a framework for answering : ' Gluten is responsible for elasticity of dough , which is perceived as chewiness ' , ' The " rising " in baked goods is essentially just stretching of the gluten network ' , ' Gluten is also exceptionally good at both absorbing and retaining moisture ' Dough 's rising is catalyzed by the yeast eating sugar and giving off gas , the gas becomes suspended in the gluten network which has body from absorbed moisture and is restrained and stregthened by the salt . The end . In the absence of gluten , there is no network for the gas to lift . However , when you add xanthum or guar gum , their qualities as hydrocolloids <URL> . <URL> , gelatin also produces flex and supports a smoother texture ( common complaints about gluten-free breads refer to their grainy texture ) . <URL> from the gluten free dough you 'll get a sopping wet mess that does nothing ; using flax and chia seed will pull it back into shape . Both seeds , when milled will gel andprovide the meringue-type ( though not as effective or durable ) effect . <URL> , hence it 's addition to the King Arthur 's gluten free flour mix . ' When baking without gluten , you will have to be very precise about all of your measurements ' , as gluten is more forgiving due to its slow-acting nature Yep . In gluten-free baking one must substitute precision for not precision . Over kneading can be fatal especially in recipes with flax and chia . ' Its coagulation action is actually very similar to that of egg whites ... gluten is basically doing the same thing inside of whatever you 're baking ' Gluten allows you to replicates the function of eggs in some use cases . Flax and chia eggs as well as Ener-G egg replacer are common vegan replacements to eggs , but as this question is simply about gluten-free baking the answer is to just use an egg ; some recipes call for one , some do n't . However , there is no likely use case where the functionality of an egg being replicated by gluten would preclude using an egg . ' Finally , it provides nutritive protein when eaten . Wheat gluten is about 75 % protein ' : Yep . Get protein somewhere else . There are 2 grams of protein in a slice of white bread , have an ounce of black beans . ' In short : Gluten does a lot of things . Keep in mind when doing gluten-free baking that a lot of the substitutes only replicate one or two of the effects . ' : The combination of multiple agents is generally necessary to provide the same functions . If you look at <URL> , you 'll see that the bread flour alone contains a super-fine flour , potato starch and tapioca starch . The recipe calls for xanthum gum and an egg in addition to the tapioca and potato starches . There you already have four ingredients doing the work of the gluten .
Sugar has a few effects in bread : It helps make it soft and tender by absorbing some of the water and slowing down the formation of gluten strands . It feeds the yeast , resulting in a faster rise . Via caramelisation , it aids in the browning of the crust . It acts as a preservative , keeping the bread fresher for longer ( though 1tbsp probably does n't make a lot of difference ) . It does have some effect on the flavour .
Wheat and ( other grains ) contains the two protein classes <URL> and <URL> , which together can form the composite protein <URL> . This process requires water and is influenced by a ) the amount of water available and b ) the mechanical process of kneading . Thus a strong gluten network ( as desired in bread baking ) is acchieved by either dilligent kneading wet flour for a certain time ( - > <URL> ) or a higher hydration ( = wetter ) dough and longer resting times , aided by the - > <URL> technique . On the other side of the spectrum are flaky and crumbly goods like shortbread , pie crust and bisquits - here you try to avoid excess gluten formation . There are two ways to do this , usually employed both : Adding fat to the dry ingredients before adding any liquid . The fat ( butter , oil , lard ... ) " protects " the flour from " getting wet " once liquid is added , thus inhibiting gluten formation . Using only a limited amount of liquid and no kneading and gentle handling of the dough after the addition . So to answer your question : There is only very little water in your butter which could trigger the development of gluten . Therefore you can " rub " your butter/shortening / ... in without much influence on gluten formation . Once you add liquid ( egg , ice water , milk , depending in your recipe ) , you need to be careful .
In general , unless the book or recipe specifically states something different , " salt " is assumed to mean " table salt " . If a recipe were to call for kosher salt or pretzel salt ( like as a topping for the loaves ) it would specifically call that out especially .
I do n't believe you would want to try to leaven bread with beer only , though you could certainly use it as a flavoring . First , the amount of yeast still present in a brewed batch of beer is very low . Beers that have been <URL> ( or bottle conditioned ) will have more than others but , particularly with high gravity beers ( beers with a lot of alcohol ) , a lot of the yeast has died due to the alcohol content or been removed by the manufacturer to clarify the brew ( yeasts make beer cloudy ) . Plus , beer yeast and bread yeast are very different things : From the info <URL> : Different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce different proportions of carbon dioxide and alcohol . Baker 's yeast is a blend of several strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chosen for their flavor and ability to make carbon dioxide , which causes bread to rise . Brewer 's yeast is made of strains chosen for their alcohol-producing ability and tends to have a bitter flavor . Brewer 's yeast is considered an inactive yeast while baker 's yeast is an active yeast . In an active yeast the yeast cells are still alive , whereas they are killed in the process of making inactive yeasts , like brewer 's yeast . Brewer 's yeast is used to brew homemade wines and beers , while baker 's yeast makes bread rise . You ca n't brew alcohol with baker 's yeast and you ca n't leaven bread with brewer 's yeast .
Honey is your real binding agent here , not maple syrup . You can substitute the sugar-free syrup but be aware of what 's in it - according to the ingredients , it 's mostly <URL> , which is both a <URL> and a laxative . Now , ordinarily , I would n't tell people to worry about the digestive effects of sorbitol , but that 's a seriously large quantity you 'd be adding , so if any of you have sensitive stomachs , beware of eating too much of that trail mix at once . The other property - humectancy - means that what you end up with is going to be moister than what you 'd get with pure maple syrup . That may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes . Since your issue seems to be a lack of availability rather than a problem with sugar itself , I 'd personally substitute generic pancake syrup , sugar syrup or even corn syrup instead . Or , if you 're really keen on the sugar-free stuff , you can use less of it and add more honey because the sorbitol will help keep the whole product moist . If you really want to cut down on the sugar , you can also use agave nectar , which is a fairly close substitute for honey ( a bit thinner ) , and could also stand in for maple syrup if used in combination with another syrup and perhaps some maple extract or maple flavouring . It wo n't be the same flavour , but , texture-wise , it should be a pretty close match .
High fructose corn syrup is a preservative . While sugaring your ketchup is good for flavor , HFCS is great for shelf stability , as is the vinegar . The reasons you typically see HFCS in American Ketchups is that it is ( 1 ) heavily subsidized and domestic and cheap , ( 2 ) farmed by the same companies making the tomatoes , and ( 3 ) a preservative . Also , it helps to improve flow while maintaining viscosity . Sugar generally can be used to cut the acidity in a tomato dish without inhibiting the taste or outshining the tomato . My stepfather had digestion issues with high acidity meals and swore by a teaspoon or two of sugar to help aid the stomach issues . Likewise , the acidity of ketchup may well be mitigated by all the sugar .
I have not found that there is a definitive answer , the most common I know is that it depends on what you like for a pizza dough . I know many people who use a common bread dough for pizza . I personally find that too " bready " , but they like it that way . When I first learned , I was taught use a basic french bread recipe and add a couple Table Spoons of oil then allow to rise in cool environment rather than warm . Many use a higher gluten flour , but if you prefer a more cracker like thin crust then whole grain and a extra pinch a salt and immediately cook after rolling out with only one rise . If you like a thicker , chewy crust , then I suggest letting the dough do a second 10-15 minute rise after you have it ready for toppings but before you put them on . Most times what many of us consider a better pizza crust , regardless of if we like thin , thick , crispy , chewy , or some odd combo is one with smaller fermentation bubbles which calls for slower rising than bread . Higher gluten , a more elastic knead , a bit extra oil and a pinch of salt can all help get this . Starting with a regular break dough would restrict you down to only being able to go with a slower rise in my mind .
Both the Santoku and French knives will work for the same types of things , so a lot of it comes down to preference . Santoku knives are lighter , so this can lead to less hand strain and quicker cutting . One thing that the Santoku are very good at is very thin slicing of vegetables , for two reasons : first , as you point out , you do not use a rocking motion , but rather chop down in one motion , which with practice can be quicker and more efficient . Second , Santoku knives usually have a much thinner blade angle ( around 15 degrees vs 30-40 degrees on a French knife ) . This is because one side of a Santoku is flat , and the other side is beveled ( like a chisel ) , so you only sharpen one side . To accommodate this thin blade the Santoku knives will be made with a harder steel , which helps maintain blade sharpness , but may increase the propensity for chipping if misused , and also makes them harder to sharpen . Still , personal preference dictates which knife to use . Many people prefer the Gyuto style of knife , which ( roughly speaking ) combines features of both Santoku knifes and French knives . They are made of a hardened steel , are sharpened on both sides , but maintain edges around 22-26 degrees . The Gyutos , like the Santokus are fairly light . Gyutos also have a rounded belly but it is less pronounced than on a French knife . There is much more to be said , but basically the thing to do is get your hands on some knives and start experimenting -- see what you like !
Harms ? Meh , that 's silliness . You can make your own fizzy water if you 're so inclined . <URL> . If you really do n't want fizzy , then just substitute still water in any of the recipes in a search for <URL> . Choose recipes that use soda water , club soda or seltzer water , not ginger ale . Ginger ale adds flavor , you want recipes that stand without that flavor . EDIT : Just to be clear ; soda water , club soda or seltzer water are all just water , injected with carbon dioxide to make bubbles ( carbonation ) . So by substituting regular water for soda water , club soda or seltzer water all you 're losing is the " fizzy " . ( Club soda may have a tiny amount of something like baking soda to neutralize the decrease in PH caused by the carbonation , <URL> gets further into it , but for all practical purposes , they are all just bubble water . )

Why is there so much baking soda in scones ?
When I made scones for the first time , I also found the taste a bit unusual . The recipe I used specified a total of 11 g baking powder and baking soda per 250 g flour , and also 5 g salt . I used less salt , but the taste is definitely unusal for people accustomed to continental Kleingebäck . I can see two reasons for this . First , the dough for scones is quite unusual , something between cookie and pastry . It is a lot tougher than the usual soda-leavened dough . So I guess that it needs additional leavening power in order to create a light texture , unlike the semiliquid batters which raise without a problem . Plus , it gets no help from egg whites the way some cakes do ( in fact , my recipe specified egg yolks only ) . The second point is one you already mentioned in the question . It seems that the English tradition is to eat scones with cream and jam . I tried it with my own scones , and the combination was quite good . I do n't eat much jam , as it is too sweet for my taste , but the pairing with the bland scones was really nice . A sweeter or richer vehicle would have made the whole thing overwhelming .
Sort of . If you have sesame seeds on hand , grind some up . You could also use toasted sesame oil , and even combine it with the ground seeds . You can also use all-natural peanut butter . Do n't use mass market crap with sugar and other additives . The ingredients should list only : peanuts , salt . Obviously , this will taste like peanuts . It will still taste good in a hummus , but it will be a distinctly different hummus than with tahini .
It 's to prevent caking . See , for example , <URL> : It is not recommended to substitute confectioners sugar for granulated sugar . Since confectioners sugar has a much finer texture , and it contains a small percentage of cornstarch to prevent caking , substituting can give you unexpected results . Many shredded cheeses include corn starch for the same reason .
<URL> ( UK usage ) are a quick bread , usually moderately sweet . They are baked on a sheet pan , sometimes sliced into wedges , sometimes cut into rounds or other shapes . They are similar to , but sweeter than American style biscuits . Biscuits ( UK usage ) or cookies ( US usage ) are very small , flat cake-like confections , usually rich in butter and sugar . They are also baked on sheet pans , in individual portions typically only a couple of inches across ( although sizes vary widely ) . They come in a myriad varieties and flavors . Typical flavorings are vanilla , chocolate , nuts , citrus . Some of the simpler varieties allow the butter flavor to come through . Biscuit ( US usage ) or tea biscuit ( UK usage , one variant ) are a type of quick bread charactarized by flat , flaky layers . They are typically cut in rounds a couple of inches across , and tend to be about an inch tall . They are usually only very lightly sweetened if sweetened at all . Tea biscuit ( UK usage , another variant ) or teacake are biscuits or cookies traditionally served with tea . They tend to be fairly neutral in flavor . Muffins ( UK usage ) or English muffins ( US usage ) are small yeast-raised breads which are griddled in rings , rather than baked in an oven . They tend to be a couple of inches across , and about half an inch tall . They are often split and served toasted . Muffins ( US usage ) or American Muffins ( UK usage ) are a quick bread , usually moderately sweet , baked in single serving portions in muffin tins ( the same pans used for cupcakes ) .
Butter traditionally has salt in it as a preservative , mainly to stop bacterial growth on the residual whey , and to slow fat rancidity Modern butter has a much lower amount of salt than is required for shelf storage in the pre-electric era . Now we have refrigerators , salt is not required at such a high level Butter with no salt has nearly half of the shelf life of modern salted butter Processed sugar is a modern ingredient , and therefore there is no culture in having it in butter . Sweet yoghurt and milk are all " new " inventions Using salt as a preservative is as old as recorded history . Many cultures used salt to preserve fruits , as well as meats and vegetables
This is n't at all exclusive to eggs , searing off a really cold ( fresh , not frozen ) steak will get you a tough steak . Unless the recipe depends on the behavior of a protein as refrigerated , proteins are better to work with at room temperature . Think of the egg yolk and white sort of like ice cream ; the warmer it becomes , the more distinctly the viscosity changes . Beating cold egg whites to stiff peaks is one heck of a workout :) Cold yolks are also very likely to result in ' broken ' emulsions . In your specific case , cold eggs simply wo n't incorporate into the mix in a manner that 's consistent with what the recipe previously produced . The difference would depend on the recipe , but in most cases , not subtle . Things would be denser than ideal , or just simply not hold together very well . It really depends on what you 're doing .
The recipes that I have seen did n't have much sugar and it is universally in the dressing . The dressings are mayonnaise based and a small amount of sugar gives them another facet to their flavor . This dressing reminds me of a simple coleslaw dressing which will include the mayo and sugar as well as buttermilk and lemon . Because the sugar is in the dressing it will apply to all the layers equally so there is no particular layer that should be sweetened more than the others . Keep in mind that this salad is southern cuisine which tends to value flavor over nutrition . Sometimes to a fault , of course . The sugar serves no mechanical purpose . It will eventually pull some the liquid out of the vegetables but , as there is so little and the dressing is not mixed in , the effect would be negligible . If you prefer the salad to be less sweet and are not worried about authenticity feel free to leave the sugar out . Alternatively if you would like to throw authenticity to the wind altogether you could leave in the sugar and add buttermilk and lemon juice to the dressing and give the salad more of a coleslaw-like zing .

Do I have to wait for frozen steak to defrost ?
You can cook steaks from frozen , it is just a matter of adjusting cooking times . They will take longer to cook . But you have saved several hours in defrost time . I take my frozen steaks and sear on both sides , then finish them off in the oven for about 16 mins depending on cut , or with a thicker cut for about 18 to 20 mins . America 's Test Kitchen has experimented with this idea and says that the steaks taste better cooked from frozen ( <URL> ) . I have to watch the temperature otherwise the steak might get a little tough , but I always preheat the oven . For me , 180 ° C.
I suppose that depends on what you 're defrosting it for . The microwave ( on low power ) is safe and quick . The downside is that you 're using a microwave , which means there 's a good chance you 'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process , and you 're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour . The lower the heat , the less the impact of this , but it 's still a problem . If I 'm preparing the meat for marinating , stir-fry , etc. , something with a powerful or thick sauce , then I would n't worry about it , but if it 's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning , you might want to avoid this . Running it under warm water would seem to work , but I 've found that it takes forever to defrost this way ( the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen ) , and you 're soaking it in the process . This really is n't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it . I would use the microwave if desperate , but it 's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or , if you 're in a bit of a hurry , the sink . It takes longer , but it 'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness . P.S. . One other word of advice : If you 're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced , it 's best not to defrost it all the way . It 's easier to cut when frozen , and will defrost very quickly once it 's in pieces . I 'm mainly talking about the breast here , this does n't work so well with meat stuck to bones . Update : I 'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something . Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be immediately cooked after defrosting and that the defrosting is done over a period shorter than 2 hours . Raw chicken must not be kept at any temperature above 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) for more than an hour or so . Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge . Definitely do n't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water . As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly ( up to an internal temperature of 165 ° F ) , you 're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning , even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today is contaminated , for the record . If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason , then you need to either thaw it very fast ( using the microwave ) or at a very low temperature ( using the refrigerator or cold running water ) .
Not safe enough for me to try it . Potatoes actually contain a very dangerous toxin called <URL> . This toxin is concentrated enough in the green parts in the plant to cause solanine poisoning . This includes the sprouts/eyes , and the potato itself if it 's green . This <URL> from the New York Times health guide indicates that it is something to be taken seriously . Per this article , if the sprouts have been removed , and the potato is not green then it is safe to eat as far as solanine poisoning is concerned . However , a potato as far gone as you have described sounds disgusting . A soft potato is on its way to going bad . Where I am from , potatoes are cheap enough that it 's just not worth the gross factor for me to eat a potato that has 10 cm sprouts and is squishy . I do eat potatoes that have little nub sprouts on them and that are slightly less than firm , after removing the sprouts of course .
Using the information from the links you provided and the information found at the <URL> ( your mileage will vary depending on brand ... ) and little math ( for the peanut 's sodium per 100g ) we learn that per 100g of each ingredient the sodium content is : Nutralite : 786mg/100g Amul : 836mg/100g Salted Peanuts : 430mg/100g If the <URL> calls for ( using the Amul ) : 4 cups of salted peanuts ( <URL> = > 600g peanuts = > 2500mg sodium ) and 2 tablespoons of butter ( <URL> = > 28g butter = > 234mg sodium ) So , loosing 2500mg sodium from the peanuts and only recouping 234mg sodium we need to add 2266 mg of sodium ... now , <URL> ... meaning that we need 5.6 grams of salt ... at <URL> means we should add about a teaspoon of salt . Mathematically , this ' makes sense ' , however given that the peanuts are probably to be added at the end I would suggest salting the peanuts directly and then mixing the peanuts ( with the salt added ) as directed . The process of creaming the butter may distribute the salt a little differently in the mix . I would suggest starting with 3/4 teaspoon of salt then adjusting taste .
The bone structure is an excellent clue -- each of these three cuts have completely different bones -- and you should be able to learn to distinguish the muscle structures easily as well . ( There 's almost certainly a price difference , too -- I 'd expect a shoulder steak to be the cheapest , followed by leg , then loin and rib . ) I 've made some quick structural drawings , and I 'll try to describe them in detail . Rib and Loin <URL> The loin is a long piece of muscle running alongside the backbone and atop the ribs . It will be cut vertically , giving a oval/oblong cross-section somewhere around 4 " diameter . That oval is solid muscle , although there may be some streaks of fat . There will usually be another strip of muscle above it , and a strip of fat along the top and one side ( this was the pig 's insulating back fat ) . Opposite the fat will be a rib bone , if it has n't been removed . The bone will not be split , but it will be cut short at some point . It is convex towards the fat , and usually has some of the fat running down along its length . If the rib is there , the steak ( or " chop " ) will have a smaller oval of muscle below the loin , separated by fat , which would otherwise be served as part of the rib meat . As the cuts of the loin move backwards towards the leg , the tenderloin may begin to be incorporated , and the rib will disappear . The tenderloin is perhaps half the loin 's size , and appears on the opposite side from the loin of a slice of the backbone , which has a rib-like sideways protrusion . This cut is the " porterhouse " , also known as the " T-bone " if the steak were beef . It may also be called a " loin chop " , as opposed to the " rib chop " from futher forward . Rib/loin chop summary description : oval/oblong of solid meat with a strip of fat at one side , possibly an intact bone on the opposite side , curving towards the fat . Possibly two ovals of meat , one half the size and on the opposite side of a protrusion of split bone from the larger . Ham or Leg <URL> The part of the leg you 're getting for steaks is the upper part , i.e. the thigh , sliced horizontally . This has a single cylindrical bone -- the femur -- running through it , which will be around 1 " diameter and off-center . The thigh is basically oval in cross-section , and made up of several large muscles , with fascia ( silver skin ) and a small amout of fat between them , so you will see four to half a dozen large pieces of muscle in the steak . There may be a strip of fat along one side , and perhaps even some skin attached to that . A leg steak is the same cut as a " ham steak " , although " ham " is often used to mean that the meat has been cured , and possibly even cooked . Leg summary description : Oval-shaped steak with a circular slice of bone off-center . The steak is composed of half a dozen sections of meat , possibly separated by thin strips of fat , and may have a strip of fat on one outer side . Shoulder or Blade <URL> The shoulder is a beautiful cut of meat on a pig , made up of dozens of pockets of marbled muscle , connected and wrapped by intermuscular fat , as well as an extension of the loin . Like leg , a shoulder also has just one bone , the blade ( which connects via a socket to the arm-bone near the bottom of the shoulder ) . The shoulder blade ( scapula ) is somewhere in the center of the shoulder , and is , as you would expect , a thin , arrow-head-shaped formation , with a flat ridge running down its center ; from the top , it looks a bit like U +22 A6 : ⊦ . ( This protrusion or spur points to the outside of the pig . ) Therefore , a slice across this shoulder muscle will be made up of several pieces of white-streaked muscle , held in a web of fat , and it will either have a fully-enclosed thin segment of bone in it , or a split where the bone was removed . With the bone left in , I believe the cuts are usually made horizontally , and the muscle segments may appear larger ( they are mostly longer than they are tall ) . With it removed , the slice could be made vertically , in which case you will see more , and smaller , pieces . There may also be a strip of fat along one side of a shoulder steak ; this is the same under-skin fat that you saw in both other cuts . Shoulder summary description : Vaguely rectangular piece of meat , with a thin slice of bone in the center . The bone may have a perpendicular ridge . The meat is in many small pieces and is webbed with fat . For less diagrammatic images , this <URL> seems to have some good photos of the various cuts , grouped by the section of the pig .
Overly sour yogurt is a sign of inconsistent inoculation Check the type of culture you are using , and ensure you are keeping the yogurt above 37C for more than six hours . The yogurt should finish as a solid lump that resists pouring , not a thick liquid , or a lumpy paste Pouring off the whey and straining the yogurt makes it more creamy and taste sweeter Thickeners are not required , just complete inoculation For sweet yogurt dishes I mostly use sour berries ( blackberry , raspberry etc ) so it is expected to be somewhat sour anyway
This is how shrimp is frozen for transit and sale . The packaging should have a weight that includes the ice aswell as the shrimp , and a weight that is shrimp only weight : The weight after they have completely thawed . There will also be a size grading . No of shrimp per lb or per KG based on whether they are HOSO Head On Shell On HLSO Headless Shell On or Peeled <URL> The ice coating prevents freezer burn to the shrimp , so they 'll be juicy when you defrost them rather than dry and hard ! If the have freezer burn they 'll be a opaque white discolouration on the surface . They 're still OK eat like this - they 're desecated / dried - they 're just really tough . Having said all this I am assuming that the packaging they 're in in undamaged , before I say that they should be fine !
Paneer can be used as is . Sometimes it is fried to extend shelf life . Cooks will also sometimes fry paneer until it is slightly brown and then put the fried cubes of paneer in hot water for a few minutes . This makes paneer very soft . If you do cook paneer , it will not melt , like most other cheese varieties , because it 's an acid-set cheese .
Recipes for preserving tend to be very specific . They 're calibrated to balance factors like pH and sugar content in the final recipes , and of course to minimize the risk of spoilage . In general , you should always follow the steps as written in your recipe . What I 've generally observed is that jam-type recipes do n't always include the final boiling step because the jam is already cooked ( edit : and because <URL> , the sugar content is generally high enough to be inhospitable to bacteria ) . That differs from canning fresh fruits and vegetables which are largely raw . The purpose of the boiling step here is to kill off pathogens before they get a chance to settle in and spoil the contents , as no matter how well you clean them , there are likely to be some spores , bacteria , etc. remaining . Even a tiny initial population can grow and spoil your preserves over the length of time they 'll be put away . So , initial sterilization is always required to clean the jars themselves . The second boil <URL> the contents . If you 've already done this as part of your preparation , as with a jam , then it most likely is n't required . It probably wo n't hurt , especially if you plan to put up your jams for an extended period of time ( i.e. months or years ) but you 'll have to weigh the convenience of skipping that step against the potential risk of spoilage . That said , let me state again for the record that if your specific recipe says to include the final boil , then there 's likely a very good reason , and you should follow that instruction .
That 's perfectly fine , assuming the meats were cooked properly originally . If you look up people doing bento lunches , they use freezer staples a lot ; often , if the item is small enough , it can be packed in a lunch still frozen and be defrosted by lunchtime . However , if you 're talking about a whole steak or chicken breast , you 'll want to stick it in the fridge overnight to let it defrost first .

Can I use thicker pastry dough in place of fillo / wonton wrappers / lumpia wrappers ?
Phyllo dough , in particular , comes in several thicknesses , from the thinnest which is used for baklava up to horiatiko ( country ) style which is used for rustic pies . You can substitute , but there is definitely a noticeable difference and I think you 'll appreciate why a good traditional recipe calls for a specific type . Saveur has a <URL> . Also , keep in mind that although phyllo is very thin and tends to tear , in many cases a small amount of tearing is no problem . You are making multiple layers and any small imperfections will disappear . Just be sure to keep the pieces you are n't currently working with covered so they do n't dry out too fast . For wonton wrappers , they are also often available in at least two thicknesses in good Asian groceries . Again , there are traditional uses for each . When using them in a non-traditional context such as ravioli , you 'll have to decide for yourself which you prefer .
What you want is cream with 35 % -40 % milkfat , and no gelatine or other stabilizers for whipping . If you use a lighter cream , then it will not have the rich , creamy texture , and evenly thick consistency you seek . In fact , if you use a light enough cream , it will not thicken properly . Now we enter the murky realm of regional naming differences , trying to find the appropriate kind of cream ! In Australia , this would be called pure cream ( 35-56 % milkfat ) ... which might be the same as " cooking thickened cream . " Read the label and make sure it is just cream , not gelatin or foam stabilizers like " thickened cream " . It could also be labelled " single cream " too ( ~ 35 % milkfat ) . In America , we call it heavy cream , or heavy whipping cream , and it is defined as 35 % + milkfat , and is generally around 38 % . In the UK , <URL> I found the uses a mixture of milk and " double cream " ( cream with 48 % + milkfat ) . They mix 100 mL whole fat milk + 426 mL of double cream . The final milkfat content is somewhere around 40 % . In the rest of the EU , the same procedure appears to be the best bet , since I ca n't find clear names for heavier creams besides double cream ( which appears to be the same as the UK ) . Edit : You may also be able to get a good result using straight double cream . I 'm looking at a French recipe that uses it . The catch is , of course , that while the minimum fat content is specified , actual fat content in double cream can vary considerably , potentially giving erratic results .
The cooking snobs will say that butter is better , and even my fading taste buds can sometimes detect the difference . But much of the time you can make the substitute . BTW the reason for the 7/8 figure is that butter runs about 1/8 water . So you may have to use 7/8 cup of oil and 1-2 tablespoons of water . The biggest difference between solid fat and oil will occur when you see lines like , " Blend together with a pastry blender until you have crumbs the size of a pea . A pie crust made with oil will not be a tender flaky crust . However for bannock making in the bush , corn oil works fine as a substitute for lard . and it 's a heck of a lot easier to keep . A comment below mentions cookie recipes . For this to be successful , the flour to fat ratio has to be fairly high . Bannock is 1 cup of flour to 1-2 tbs of fat . This is small enough that the flour absorbs all the oil . Another signal : If the directions call for chilling the dough then there is enough fat in the mix that using oil would make the recipe way too liquid . I suspect this is the case with many cookies . Cake recipes usually do n't have as high a fat : flour ratio as many cookies , but cakes are often very fussy about ingredient ratios . So : Test before counting on it . It does work for bannock . 1 cup flour 1 to 3 tbs fat or oil 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder Tiny amount of water . If you are going to fry the bannock , go light on the oil . Mix flour and salt and baking powder . Mix in fat . Mix in just enough water to make a stiff dough that holds together . It is very easy to overdo . Knead only long enough to mix . Cooking : 1 . Shape into long strips about 3/8 " thick , wrap around smooth pole and bake over a 10 second fire for 15 minutes rotating slowly . ( A 10 second fire : YOu can hold your hand where the cooking happens for 10 seconds ) Pat out into 3/8 to half inch slabs . Cook in a frying pan over a 20 second fire for 5-10 minutes on a side . Pat out to 1/8 " thick . Drop into a bucket with 2 inches of smoking hot lard in the bottom . Lift out with tongs after 30 seconds . Method 1 will keep campers busy for a long time . Method 2 makes bannock you can use for a meal later . Method 3 is the fastest method , but it is dangerous .
Soy sauce , sake or mirin and sugar are the usual ingredients in a teriyaki sauce . The rice wines in particular are vital for an authentic teriyaki flavour . So the question is somewhat moot : onions are n't usually found in teriyaki sauce anyway . The onions naturally add flavour to your marinade : if you like it , leave them in , if you do n't , take them out . The onions wo n't have any major chemical effect on the marination process . Personally I would ditch the olive oil , replace it with toasted sesame oil and add garlic and ginger for a more rounded and authentically flavoured East Asian marinade .
Coconut oil has a low smoke point ( 177-204C depending on processing ) . Ghee has a smoke point of 252C . The effect of this is that it will be quite hard to stop the oil burning . But that 's not to say it would be impossible - softening onions and garlic in butter or olive oil is common , and they have lower smoke points still . But the texture from frying at a lower temperature will be quite different . It may also affect the flavour of your spices . In addition , the coconut oil will change the character of your curry significantly . That may not be a bad thing . ( all figures from <URL> )
My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well . It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily " broken " . I 've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it does n't take to cookie cutters , but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz ( or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle , sprinkle with your finger tips ) cold water on it . ( Like adding water to pie dough ) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in . Repeat until it just stops breaking . Do n't go overboard and make it gooey . I 'd use water over oil or milk because it 's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process . Such minuscule amounts of water should n't yield a detectable change in the end product . If this is a consistent problem with the recipe , in the future I 'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps .
The closest thing is to combine equal parts of ground cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , and black pepper .
Absolutely , go ahead and use it . I always ignore the " white and light green parts " instruction anyway , and use the leek up until the point where it feels dried out instead of firm and fleshy -- well into the dark green parts -- and it 's always delicious , even when cooked for significantly less than several hours .
Traditional dough will not freeze well . You have to par-bake it . In the US , the & ldquo ; freshly baked & rdquo ; bread sold in most supermarkets is par-baked dough . This is risen dough , which is then baked for 70 to 80 % of the usual baking time , cooled , frozen , and shipped to the supermarket , where it is baked again until golden . You could do the same . A par-baked baugette is a bit denser than a traditional one . Freezing the dough before baking it kills most of the yeast preventing it from working during the first stages of baking .
For this dish , you 'll probably want to use a low-end extra-light oil ( since it 's being heated quite a bit ) , and then drizzle in nicer extra virgin oil to finish the flavor after the pasta has been tossed into the cheese , oil , and spices . The rule of thumb is to have two kinds of olive oil : High-grade , richly flavored extra virgin olive oil ( for finishing ) Extra light , not extra-virgin olive oil for use as a cooking oil . You can use a cheaper oil for this -- many people choose to use a later pressing , crudo or " pure olive oil " ( in the US ) kind . The high-end oil is for adding it to sauces and drizzling on mostly-finished dishes to add that rich flavor . You 're looking for something with a lot of taste , and it 's a good idea to get small amounts of pricier oil . Getting small bottles means you 'll be using fresher , more flavorful oil because it has n't been open for long . Plus , you wo n't need much to finish dishes . Note that for this use , you want to add the oil near the end of cooking , as heat will alter and weaken the flavor . The low-end light olive oil should be of neutral or light flavor , and will be more tolerant of heating than extra-virgin . Because it has a much higher smoke point than extra-virgin grade oil , use this in recipes calling for heating up olive oil . If necessary for flavor , add some of the good stuff near the end of cooking .
If you 've baked your puff pastry in the past at 375 then it 's probably not a temperature problem , however I usually bake it between 400-425 degrees ( 400 convection or 425 in standard oven ) . Lower temperatures are n't a problem for the baking aspect as it will still cook through . The problem lies in the fact that the heat wo n't be significant enough to generate the steam needed for expansion . Egg wash could be a culprit as it should only be used on the top and not allowed to run down the sides where it will seal the edge together and keep it from rising unevenly .
You can certainly use a Dutch oven ( DO ) for cooking sauce . A good DO is probably one of the most versatile pieces of equipment in the kitchen . It cooks , it bakes , it even fries ! It will certainly make sauce and the high sides will even help prevent splatters . I would n't worry about the lack of a long handle , the weight of the DO will keep it stable . If anything , the weight is its primary fault . A good DO is also a heavy DO . It can be a bit daunting to lug out every time . Since you mentioned Le Creuset , I 'm assuming you 're talking about enameled cast iron - not ' normal ' cast iron . And hence have n't addressed that you certain sauces and such may not be well suited to ' normal ' cast iron , but enameled is fine all around . Can you use a enameled Dutch oven for sauces ? Absolutely . Should you ? There are less weighty options , but at the end of the day it will make the same sauce .

How to caramelize white sugar without burning it ?
It is perfectly normal for sugar to turn dark brown when making . If it turns even darker , it is because it has been burning too hot . <URL> , so you want to get there gradually . As for the color , many recipes call for to make it smoother and tender , but only incorporate it after the crystals are fully dissolved and you 're ready to take it off the burner . I 've seen a few youtube videos with just sugar and water for sugar cages ...
I 'm specifically answering your question " Is it okay to use a microwave in convection mode without the turntable ? " -- Yes . Your own answer points out the reality that if a pan is too large then the turn table will simply hit the sides of the microwave oven and then stop turning . There is nothing wrong with this . There is nothing wrong or damaging to have a metal tin touch the metal sides of your oven . How was your baked items bottom ? If you can sit your tin up so there is air flow under your tin , then you will improve the baking efficiency and it will bake more evenly . CAUTION : If anyone else is reading this question and wondering about their own machine , then you really need to take caution about the " convention only " mode . You have to make sure there are NO microwaves in this mode or else your metal will conduct and you could have a serious explosion or break your microwave oven .
So with gravy , you are talking about a scorched taste . Once you smell it , it is probably too late to salvage it . If you want to try , the best course of action is to remove it from the heat ( obviously ) and carefully ladle off as much of the top of the pan as you can , leaving the scorched part on the bottom . Then taste what you ladled off and see if it is really edible . In my experience , people try to convince themselves that the scorched flavor is n't really there , but it is , and once it is , all is lost .
Yes , onions contain sugar , just like most fruit and vegetables . It is not simply a common phrase , it is true caramelization . They have 4.24 g of sugar per 100 g in total ( wet weight ) . For dry weight 40 % is sugar . See <URL> for more details .
In the normal cooking time of a quiche ( 20 to 30 minutes ) , the crust does n't really get soggy from the filling , even if it is quite liquid , as is expected for quiche Lorraine . So , you can without problem cook your quiche without first blind-baking the crust . The difference will be in the crispness of the crust : if you try to get it crispy , you should prebake , if you do n't mind it being rather , well , " plain " , you do n't . The only real reason for me to blind-bake a crust is when you put something on it that wo n't be cooked ( tartelettes ) , that will only get grilled or that will be baked less that it would require to bake the crust ( meringue tart ) . Most of these examples are fruit tarts , however .
The only difference between regular whole wheat flour and white whole wheat flour is the variety of wheat from which it is ground . Regular whole wheat flour is ground from red wheat while white whole wheat is from a lighter pigmented wheat and thus the lighter color . In both cases the germ is still intact and thus as Jonathan Campbell stated , it will go rancid more quickly than white flour . Keep it in a cool dark place and use up quickly if you ca n't refrigerate or freeze it . When you keep it in the refrigerator or freezer and plan to use it for yeast breads , remember to allow it to warm to room temperature before using for best results with your yeast .
I found the solution which suits me : I first boil the milk , water , and jaggery together in quantity mentioned in the question . After the mixture reaches boiling point , I switch off the gas stove and throw in 2 table spoons of tea . I close the lid of the vessel and let the it sit on the gas itself for 6 minutes . After 6 minutes , I strain the tea and the result is a non woody strong hot tea . I think it is important to let the covered vessel sit on the gas because otherwise the tea will cool off in 6 minutes .
I wo n't claim that this is universal , and I probably would n't try it with scotch bonnets or ghost peppers , but this is what I do with poblanos , seranos , jalapenos , and the like : Treat them like any other vegetable when you prep , using good knife skills , and a well sharpened knife -- good skills minimize how much you touch the product anyway . Do n't touch your eyes or face or anything you do n't have to . When you are done , wash your hands in soapy water . Here is how I would dice a jalapeno ( I like the red ones the best ) or similar small pepper . For this , I would use a paring knife . For a larger pepper , like a poblano , I would use chef knife or a santuko : Cut off the stem end so only the fleshy part of the pepper remains . It will be a little cone . Optionally , cut a tiny part of the tip , to make it easier to separate the flesh , but it is not absolutely required . Cut a a slit into the side of the pepper through the flesh and into the cavity ... then ... continuing the same motion ... ... turn your knife parallel to the flesh , and run the edge of the blade around the inside of the pod so that you are essentially peeling the skin from the core of seeds and membranes . This is much easier to do than to describe in text . Discard the seeds and membranes . Unroll the pepper , skin side up , and flatten the flesh of the pepper out , so it is like a piece of paper . It may split a little when you do this , that is fine . It is easiest to flatten with the outside facing up , but easiest to cut with the outside of the skin facing the cutting board . Turn the pepper sheet over , so it is skin side down . Cut it into long , thin strips -- juliennes . Cross-cut the juliennes into dice . If you want a hotter product , and a more rustic one , with a small pepper , you can simply : Cut of the stem end . Slice the remaining pepper into circles or coins , thinly . If you want very hot dice , you can then : Pile up the coins , and chop through them several times in the standard rocking motion with a chef 's knife .
Sugar acts as a stabilizer in the heating process of eggs . It acts as a bit of " insurance " to keep the eggs from curdling under the moderate heat during the cooking process . It is a necessary component in making citrus curds .
It 's really a question of taste . It 's not going to hurt you , but there will be some undesirable effects . For example , to cook turkey properly , it must come to an internal temp . of 180 . If the meat is frozen , it is going to take a lot longer for the internal temperature to rise that high , so the outside of the bird will be somewhat overcooked ( compared to roasting a thawed bird ) . That meat will be much tougher than it would be otherwise . If your question is querying as to whether it will cause ill health , then no , it will not . My mom does it all the time . Her roasts are tough , though . I have done this , but only when I am braising the meat , or using a slow cooker , which will cause the meat to be tender either way .
You want to use a gentle heating method . For this sort of thing , I prefer steaming . It will gently bring up the heat of your food without wringing the moisture out of it . This is especially helpful if it 's already cut into relatively small portions , such as slices of breast meat . Spread everything out on a single layer on the steamer basket before hand . Warming drawer would be my second choice . Slice , add a few teaspoons of water , and cover and add to your warming drawer , set to your target temperature .
White sugar was commonly used as a preservative in the past , in much the same way as salt . It 's wildly hygroscopic ( like salt ) , and an excellent desiccant , so if you packed something in it , it would accelerate the drying process . This is actually the origin of fruit jam and fruit preserves , which are still common today , even after better methods of preservation are available . Salt was more common simply because many things like eating/living in WET sugar , so you had to be careful with how much water was in the thing you were trying to preserve . But as long as the sugar was dry it 's an extremely hostile environment for bacteria and little crawly things . Kept dry , it will last forever .
Heston Blumenthal has brought his unique scientific approach to bear on this recently . The main pointers for a perfect poached egg are as follows : The egg must be fresh . A fresh egg has a thicker , more gel-like albumen . As it gets older , this becomes watery , and so just disperses throughout the water when you add it . To test if your egg is fresh , place it in a jug of cold water . If it floats , it 's not fresh - the egg has had time to absorb air through its shell . A fresh egg sinks and stays sunk . The water temperature should be 80ºC / 176ºF exactly . You can measure this with a sugar or probe thermometer . The egg should be at room temperature . The egg should not come into contact with direct heat , so put a plate or small bowl on the bottom of the pan , bottom up . Once the water ( in a medium to large saucepan ) is up to temperature , carefully add the fresh egg and cook for 4 minutes exactly ( for a large egg of the domestic chicken , Gallus gallus domesticus ) . Drain and serve - the white should be set but not rubbery ( a drawback of using vinegar ) and the yolk should be creamy and rich .
Making a cake before around 1910 always required at least an hour of work beating sugar into butter : this incorporated air bubbles into the mixture . But since then , there have been a number of remarkable changes to the process . The first was the arrival of modern cake shortening , which has smaller fat crystals that trap small air bubbles , which stay in the batter . They also have a much wider temperature range at which it has the right solidity , and these days manufacturers fill shortening with preformed bubbles of nitrogen ( around 10 % of the volume ) and up to 3 % of the shortening weight is replaced by bubble-stabilizing emulsifiers . The second major innovation was the arrival of cake flour : a soft flour low in gluten that is very finely milled ; in the US it is strongly bleached with chlorine , which also lightens the end result by various means , but the EU and UK disallow the bleaching step , so manufacturers there use different processes such as heat treatment . These two improvements , together of course with mechanical mixers , have lead to not only less work when making cakes but also lighter , more fluffy end results , and the ability to use more sugar without the batter becoming to heavy . Finally , because the mixing process fills the batter with bubbles , cake recipes typically either for no chemical leavening or for less than other batter recipes do . ( All of this information is extracted from pages 555-557 of the excellent On Food and Cooking by Harold McGee . ) So the answer to your question seems to be : mass-produced cake mixes use the incredible advances in food technology of the twentieth century in general , not so much chemical leavening specifically .
Yes , you can do it without a press . Place a ball of dough between two layers of plastic wrap . Use at least twice the area of wrap that you think the final tortilla will be . Squish the ball flat with a pan , book , or your hand . Now use a rolling pin to roll the dough between the sheets of plastic . Make sure the thickness is even , and do n't get it too thin or it will break when you cook it . Bonus : you can store the uncooked tortillas in the plastic until using and they wo n't dry out .

how to curb the smell of fish ?
i have found that a lampe berger works well to eliminate strong scents after cooking ( http://www.lampeberger.us/ ) -- after all , they were originally invented to help reduce the odors in hospitals and mortuaries ! ( you can read about their history at wikipedia : <URL> ) . i use mine after a night of deep frying food to get that smell out . i 'm pretty certain it would work on fish just as well .
It was called <URL> , and indeed the ancient Romans used it , as did the ancient Greeks : Garum was prepared from the intestines of small fishes through the process of bacterial fermentation . Fishermen would lay out their catch according to the type and part of the fish , allowing makers to pick the exact ingredients they wanted . The fish parts were then macerated in salt , and cured in the sun for one to three months . The mixture fermented and liquified in the dry warmth , with the salt inhibiting the common agents of decay . Garum was the clear liquid that formed on the top , drawn off by means of a fine strainer inserted into the fermenting vessel . The sediment or sludge that remained was allec . Concentrated decoctions of aromatic herbs might be added . Flavors would vary according to the locale , with ingredients sometimes from in-house gardens . Like the fish sauce of today , it was extremely high in glutamic acid , AKA umami . In <URL> the author says : There appears to be no historical mention of fish sauce being used in Asia before the Early Middle Ages in Europe , which oddly enough is around the same time its use was dwindling in the remnants of the Roman Empire . That begs a question , right ? Did the concept travel , or did Asians develop it independently ? Greater minds than mine are working to definitively answer that question : ... flowed from west to east and was eagerly adopted by Asians on the Silk Road . The recipes for garum changed and adapted as they moved east and became nuoc mam and nam pla according to cultural preferences and what gifts the Asian seas had to offer . Archaeologists and food scientists are working to confirm these flows and linkages ... The production of garum and Asian fish sauce is virtually the same as well . Fresh fish and salt in some proportion ( recipes vary widely from 5:1 to 2:1 ) are layered in barrels , clay pits or earthenware crocks . Because of their large size , tuna were cut up before fermenting to prevent putrefaction , but most fish -- especially the small species are processed whole and intact . In Rome , oregano and other herbs were added at the production phase for both flavor and to suppress bacterial overgrowth , but this step is largely omitted in the production of Asian sauces . The vats are then left to ferment -- sometimes covered or sometimes uncovered ( Carthaginian and Roman ) in the heat and stirred every few days to a week to ensure even enzymatic digestion of the fish .

Play it safe . It has been said : You probably will be ok , but the safer method is just to cook it the night before and refrigerate it . Toss the whole thing in an insulated lunch container , and you should have no problems . Even if the temperature creeps up into the danger zone , it should n't be there more than an hour or two before lunch time , and should still be cool enough not to cause an issue . -- <URL> <URL> I happen to disagree with this advice , personally . While it may be OK , is this something worth trying to find out ? Here is an excerpt from an <URL> Growth rates of pathogens are highly temperature dependent . Ordinarily , pathogenic bacteria growth is relatively slow at temperatures below 70 ° F ( 21.1 ° C ) . In most cases , growth is very slow below 50 ° F ( 10 ° C ) , and 40 ° F ( 4.4 ° C ) is below the minimum growth temperature of most pathogenic bacteria , although there are some exceptions . On the other hand , pathogenic bacteria grow relatively fast at temperatures above 70 ° F ( 21.1 ° C ) . Think of a real-world example , say a soda can . You get the can out of the machine at a temperature around 35 ° F-40 ° C , which is refrigeration temperature . You set it naked ( i.e. , no " can cushy " ) on a table and just leave it there . Within 1-1 .5 hours or so , it will be very close to room temperature , which on average is about 70 ° F to 73 ° F. That 's when your fish will begin growing bacteria more rapidly , which it would continue to do until you are ready to eat it . TL ; DR At the very least put and ice pack or other method of absorbing heat inside your lunchbox . Always play it safe when it comes to pathogens .
If you are speaking of a salmon filet , you must remove the pin bones one by one . The easiest way to do it is with tweezers or needle nosed pliers . This <URL> demonstrates the technique : Run the back of your knife across the line where the bones are , from tail to head , to make them pop out more . Pull each bone , on an angle towards the head of the fish
I think the Albacore and Sea Bass are both great ideas . I 'm not sure about the Swordfish . It would be fine in the Crudo or Ceviche , but I do n't know how it would be as Sashimi . Fish that I 'd look at for this are : Yellowtail Halibut Tuna Sea Bass Scallops ( to think outside the " fish " box a little ) Salmon I 'm not sure if those are " in season " for you , and I ca n't find a good resource to determine that . I 'd suggest getting a list of 5-6 fish and heading to your local fishmonger / farmers market / or Whole Foods and ask what 's in season . Personally , I 'd do Tuna , Yellowtail , and Scallops if you wanted to do 3x3 .
I would do it the other way round , I 'd fry the sausages first , then add the veg . This has a few benefits as I see it : - The sausages will brown more evenly , purely aesthetic but some people will think they are not cooked if they are not brown . You 'll get the oil out of the sausages so you 'll have a better idea of how much oil to add when you add the veg , if any . The veg will sweat down in the sausage oil which is likely to be much nicer than the other oil You can cook the sausages on a really low heat to start with so that they really get sticky and caramelised , then when you add the veg back in you can add a spoon of water/vinegar/stock to deglaze the pan an get that lovely sticky sausage goodness all over your veggies , which will be delicious . You could optionally take the cooked sausages out of the pan and do the veg separately , or keep 'em in there , I 'd probably take them out so I could turn the heat up a bit without having to worry about the sausages . I 'd say that when you do add the veg you want a thin ( 1mm ish ) layer of oil in the pan . Depending on the pan this is probably a tables spoon or 2 . You probably do n't need to scale up as if you are cooking a bigger batch you will probably use a bigger pan , and so a similar depth of oil should suffice . If you are using the same pan , but with a deeper amount of veg , then I would add a little more , but I would make the depth of oil in the pan proportional to the depth of veggies . Remember the golden rule . You can always add , you can never take away . And once the veg start to cook down and the volume decreases then the oil ratio will be higher , so start out with a little less than you think , just enough to coat the veg when tossed in it .
Assuming you are n't very unlucky and happen to download a series of bad recipes I think it 's one of a few things . It 's possible you could be undercooking your goods . Fully cooked baked goods should not taste like flour . It 's also possible that you could be mixing insufficiently . If this were the case though you 'd likely have some cookies that were n't floury . The most likely culprit though is packed flour . If you are using volume measurements ( most likely given the source ) for flour , it 's quite possible to use nearly twice as much flour as the recipe intends simply because your flour is packed down more than the author 's was . I recommend using either a food processor or a sifter to sift your flour adequately before measuring . Do n't undo your sifting by rapping your measuring cup on the counter either ! Simply scoop , scrape to level and dump it in the mixing bowl . See Also : <URL> <URL> <URL>
Yes , you can roast the beans some more . However the results will probably not be great . Roasting results in quite a bit of smoke . If you are going low tech , I would do it in a wok in a very well ventilated area . It 's pretty easy to set off smoke detectors . A stove top with a range hood might be good enough if you have a particularly good range hood . Outside with the wok on a BBQ is probably best . Roast over a low heat and stir continuously . You want to get the beans as even as possible , trying not to burn them . The beans will continue to roast after taking them off the heat . So stop one or two roast levels before the desired colour and tip your beans out into a colander and continue stirring to cool . The residual heat will cook the bean some more . To aim for a desired roast level , compare the current roast colour to your desired roast colour and maybe to a roast level chart . Google image search " coffee roast level chart " . Guesstimate the roast level that is one or two levels below your desired colour to stop at . Once again there will be a lot of smoke .
Salt itself does n't really have a perceptible odour . However , salt added to other ingredients will usually react with some of them , which will indeed cause a change in the dish 's overall smell . There are several different reactions involved : Salt will draw fluids from most fruit , vegetables and meats . The fluids have an odour that was previously trapped within the food 's structure and is now available to your nose . Salt makes a fluid more acidic , which causes all sorts of changes . For instance , the difference in smell ( and other properties ) between a fresh cucumber and a pickled cucumber is mostly due to the brine , which is water with a high salt content . Salt may facilitate other chemical reactions in the organic molecules of the dish . Obviously , different molecules have a different smell . Each of these reactions may occur separately or together , depending on the specific ingredients used and a host of other factors , of course , but salt can definitely cause a change in the smell of a dish .
The strongest smells in mayonnaise should be vinegar and egg . There should n't be any yeast , and therefore any yeast smell , so that is a bit concerning . I am not sure what might imitate a yeast smell . I do n't know how to counter the smell since I am not sure what the origination of the smell is . Does it taste okay ? Is the texture okay ? I do find that homemade and store brand mayonnaises have pretty different smells in general .
I discussed a similar subject in this question : <URL> Raw fish is n't safe to eat if it 's just been sitting around . However , the raw fish used in sushi/sashimi has been frozen ( typically flash-frozen ) in order to kill any parasites , making it as safe as any other food . Most distributors of sashimi also have their own methods and internal regulations to ensure food safety , but specifics are understandably hard to come by . Suffice it to say , it 's far safer to eat properly-prepared nigiri or sashimi than it is to eat an undercooked hamburger .
Getting the Vanilla from the bean to the taste bud takes time . While many will advocate the use of fresh vanilla beans ( as you have tried ) , I have always preferred the flavor that is granted from a good vanilla extract . In my opinion it is stronger and better distributed throughout the dish . Whether you buy or <URL> I think you will get a more consistent and rich flavor that way . ( note : thanks to @rfusca for providing the extract link in a <URL> )
Cook on a lower heat , in a pan with a thicker base , to distribute the heat . Check every now and again , and add water if the soup has become too thick . Also , the occasional stir can only help . Consider buying a slow cooker -- there are very cheap models that do the job well .
There are two safe ways to defrost , one more rapid than the other . First method is to defrost in the refrigerator . This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F , in the safe zone . This will , also , take a while . Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water . The water does n't have to run rapidly , but it should change regularly . This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air ( water is a better conductor of heat than air ) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time . If you are not going to cook it immediately , then return to the refrigerator . If you are deep frying , there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried , but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong .
If you want to cure your fish ( basically a brine without moisture ) it is dependent on the thickness of the meat mostly . If it 's as thin as 1/4 " , it will take approximately 1-2 hours . If it 's more around 1 " thick , it could need 3-8 hours . If you use a dry-cure method you do n't have to worry about having too much salt because once you 're done , you just wipe it off . If done incorrectly ( ie . not enough time ) , you should notice a difference in the colour between the edge and the interior . Typically , the colour becomes more pale . The main purpose of the salt is to dehydrate the meat , not necessarily drying . If you use a brine , it obviously wo n't become dry .
I have noticed that basil changes its taste as it ages , but not as to get bitter . On the other side , I like a bitter taste , so I often overlook ( overtaste ? ) bitter notes to which other people show a strong reaction . Try getting some fresh basil and comparing the taste/aroma of the fresh and the old one , maybe it is really just the aging difference you perceive as unpleasant . I regularly use the stems when I have fresh basil . Generally speaking , you can not deceive your brain to not perceive bitterness ( unlike sourness , which is counteracted by sweetness - the pH value of Coca Cola ( 2.6 ) is lower than that of tomato juice ( 4.1 ) , but the soft drink is perceived as sweet , not sour ) . But if you mix it with another basic taste , the combination might feel much better than the pure bitter taste . The other strategy would be to just dilute with something bland , in order to reduce the bitterness intensity . Most adults actually like some bitterness if it is not too intense . The third option would be to use something with a very strong flavour to mask everything , e.g. add lots of raw onions and/or garlic , or just make it so hot you do n't actually pick up much of a taste . I am not a fan of this solution , but your mileage may vary . As for a taste combination , which taste should you pick ? Strangely , people tend to think that a sweet taste is well suited to somehow " mask " bitterness , which I can not confirm . For me , both tastes , bitter and sweet , stay there , and one does n't mask the other , they just create a specifically unharmonious combination . In my experience , bitter + sour is a much better combination ( think grapefruit , cranberries , or tonic water ) which can even allow for a small amount of sweetness , without making it clash . But it is also good to make a combination of bitter + salty taste . While umami can be combined with bitter too , it does n't diminish the unpleasant sensation of the too bitter . As for your specific problem , I often eat basil dips , only I tend to base them on feta cheese . I sometimes add sour cream or other dairy products , but usually less sour cream than cheese . I think that it will be a good solution for your problem , as it will both complement the bitterness with a strong salty taste , and dilute the bitterness concentration as you will be using lots of it . I also almost always add lemon juice ( should help for the bitterness too ) and a dash of olive oil ( which should n't affect the taste , only the aroma ) . Another ingredient which does well in a basil dip are green or blonde olives , if their salt level is not too high . For a basil dip , I usually throw everything in a bowl and smooth it with the immersion blender . If you are n't sure that you 'll like the taste , try tasting a spoon of your current dip with a small piece of feta and/or an olive before committing more ingredients to something you 'll ultimately throw out .

can Tilapia replace salmon in recipes and taste good ?
It depends on the recipe . As Jefromi said , salmon does have a different flavor . Specifically it has flavor . Tilapia does n't really have much flavor at all . More importantly , salmon has about <URL> as tilapia . Salmon holds together better than more fragile white fish . This makes grilling salmon much easier than other fish which fall apart . If your recipe highlights the flavor of the fish , or relies on the fat or cohesion of salmon then you should not make the substitution . On the other hand if your recipe calls for baking in a pan and uses other flavorings , such as lemon , that can overpower the flavor of the fish , it would be a good candidate for substitution .
If really want to substitute for that coconut oil in this particular application , you want a pure , relatively flavorless , saturated fat . This will be one that is solid at room temperature . That means commercial shortening , such as the US brand Crisco . Update : cocoa butter itself , of course would be ideal , if you can get it . But , then you would want to temper it . In that case , well , see below ... However , in my opinion : Your best bet , if you are willing to do the necessary work , for a crisp true chocolate coating is to use ... pure chocolate . Nothing else . The trick is to ensure that your chocolate is in temper . ( You can read more about it within the <URL> ) . This means that it is melted and then cooled in such as way as to ensure the cocoa butter forms the most desirable crystals , which have a melting point near mouth temperature , and a smooth , crisp bite . You can google many detailed articles on how to temper chocolate , with many variant methods . For example , here is one from <URL> . For small batches at home , I have found the following method to be very successful , using 100 % real chocolate such as Merkens or Ghirardelli ( or many other brands ) . That is , chocolate that is made of nothing but cocoa butter , cocoa solids , sugar , flavoring , and maybe some lecithen . You do n't want other fats . In general , you should avoid chocolate chips ( which may not be true chocolate ) unless you know your manufacturer actually uses 100 % true chocolate in their chips ( a small number do ) . Break the chocolate up into small chunks ( maybe 1/2 inch or 1 cm in size ) Place in a glass microwave safe bowl . The purpose of the glass bowl is to absorb the heat from the chocolate , and then keep it relatively stable and warm . Place the chocolate in the microwave at very low power . I use level 2 on my microwave . It will take a very long time , maybe 8-10 minutes , even to be partially melted . This is okay . Every so often , stir the chocolate so it is heating fairly evenly . ( The glass bowl also helps by adding thermal mass ... ) Keep microwaving on low , until the chocolate is almost all melted , checking more and more frequently as you get close . When the chocolate is about 90 % melted , take it out and let the residual heat from the bowl and the chocolate melt the rest . Do one last stir , so that the various crystal types and seeds are evenly distributed , just in case some small part of the chocolate went out temper in this process . Again , I emphasize , patience and going slow here is the key . This method trades time for complexity . The key to this method is : commercial chocolate is already in temper . By barely melting it ( and I mean barely ) , we keep it temper . We do n't have to do all the hard stuff with thermometers and carefully regulating the temperature up to melt the bad crystals , then down to seed the good ones and so on . Once you have your tempered melted chocolate , you can use it to coat candies , cookies , or ( one of my favorites ) stir in a crunchy breakfast cereal , coconut flakes , or nuts to make little candies ... the applications are endless .
If you do n't fancy cooking in aluminium foil ( kind of takes the point away ) , you need to make sure you have a super clean , extremely hot grill . Why ? Clean ( No tasty burnt fat from the burgers ) , flesh sticks like #### to a blanket . You can get away with it when cooking steaks because they are just so much stronger . So get a wire brush and clean an area for fish cooking and keep it clean :) . Hot , as hot as you can pretty much . You want the second that Salmon ( or other fish ) hits the grill for it to blacken . It 'll help make sure the flesh is no longer ' fleshy ' and again less likely to stick . Do n't try lifting it till ' you know that underside is like a pink and black Zebra on it 's underside ( 3-4 min ) . When it does come to lifting you could really do with a nice sharp fish slice , not a blunt fat ended egg slice . Good luck .
Not being aware of your location , some general tips : 1 ) Buy your fish from a fishmonger , and tell him/her what you are using it for . You want to do business with somebody who 's business is selling fish and only selling fish . They are going to know what 's been stored to eaten raw standards in a way that the just above minimum wage fish guy at your grocery store does n't . 2 ) Do n't buy it early . Buy it the day you mean to consume it or the day that you going to prep it . This question can help walk you through <URL> 3 ) Take a cooler to get your fish . You have to maintain the freshness , that means not allowing it raise in temperature anymore than you have to .
That white stuff is albumen , the same protein that makes the white of chicken eggs . The albumen is part of the salmon 's blood , which means that your fillet was fresh . A trick for dealing with it was developed by Bruno Goussault while collaborating with chef Michel Richard from Citronelle in DC : soak the salmon pieces in an ice cold brine . The <URL> that told the story recommends soaking the salmon fillets for ten minutes in a 10 % brine ( by weight ) . To make the <URL> , dissolve three tablespoons of Kosher salt for every cup of ice cold water and make as many cups as you need .
If you are really set on doing this , just use the same amount by weight or volume , preferably peeling the tomatoes first . ( Cut an x in the bottom , dip in boiling water for 10 seconds , pull off the peel ) . You 'll have plenty of liquid coming out of the tomato , do n't worry about that . But honestly , I do n't recommend doing this . Fresh tomatoes that are any good are so good uncooked that it is a waste , and fresh tomatoes that are n't good wo n't get better by cooking them . Even Mario Batali says you should use canned tomatoes for cooked sauces .
Essentially , it 's like a giant chicken with a " deeper " and more distinctive flavor . The main reason I like them ( other than the flavor ) is the sheer quantity of meat you can get from one roasting session . One could roast multiple chickens for a similar effect , but with a turkey you only have one skeleton to pick meat off of , so it goes faster . Leftovers can be frozen and/or reused in all sorts of ways ( sandwiches , soups , casseroles , etc. ) . taste The breast meat of turkey is a little different from chicken , but they have a similar texture and both tend to be rather mild in flavor compared to game birds . If you had access to a wild turkey , the meat will be gamier . The dark meat of the turkey ( particularly legs and wings ) is generally much more flavorful than chicken , with a " deeper " flavor that some people love and others dislike . ( This may be the reason for the increasing popularity of whole turkey breasts sold by themselves in the U.S. , which can be roasted like a whole bird , but do n't have the " other parts " that are seen as less desirable by many . The vast majority of people I know tend mostly to eat turkey breast meat , usually served with gravy and stuffing . ) I 've seen turkey wings and legs sometimes offered at Southern U.S. BBQ joints ; when slow-cooked , they are a bit of a " Southern delicacy . " On most farm-raised turkeys I 've had recently , the thigh meat does n't have as much of that " rich turkey " flavor that I seem to recall in the past , but it has a more distinctive flavor than the breast meat . Internal organs ( " giblets " ) also tend to have a stronger flavor than chickens , if you 're into eating livers , gizzards , hearts , etc. . There 's often more fat in various parts of the bird than in typical U.S. chickens , which adds to a richer flavor . However , there 's usually not as much fat as found in other common U.S. poultry ( particularly duck and goose ) . appearance When prepared and ready to buy at a butcher , turkeys essentially look the same as any large poultry . They are often much larger than chickens , easily going to 20 lbs . ( 10 kg ) and more . There are some differences in proportions and details that you 'll see when cutting up or eating . In particular , the legs and wings have a bit more connective tissue and bony/cartilage bits than a chicken , since it 's a larger bird and needs more support . This also tends to make the leg and wing meat a bit " stringy , " which may be the reason for the slow-cooked versions I mentioned above , allowing time for the meat to break down more than when just roasting the whole bird . The meat is also a bit darker in color than chickens , particularly noticeable in the " dark meat " sections . cooking If buying a whole bird , most people in the U.S. essentially prepare it as they would make a large chicken , which usually means roasting in the oven . They are usually cooked at somewhat lower temperatures than chicken , to give time for the whole turkey to cook without drying out the exterior . Given the long roasting time for such a large bird , there 's been a bit of a trend recently to cut up the turkey so it lies flat ( " butterfly " or " spatchcock " ) , which allows it to cook faster and potentially more evenly . Other than that , one can often buy individual turkey parts and use them in similar ways to chicken parts , keeping in mind the longer cooking time required . They can also be used ( as with other poultry ) for soup meat , etc. .
You could probably get away with pork shoulder , although you will want to consider that the texture may not be what you want -- it may either have too much fat and connective tissue , or it may fall apart too much , depending on how long you braise it for . You will probably have to alter your cooking times , I 'd imagine . Pork hocks are somewhat similar in texture to the shank , so that a possibility . Though you will probably run into the same availability problems . It may take a small amount of modification , but your best bet may be to go with country-style ribs . They are tender and flavorful when braised , and are readily available in any grocery store .
If you can not find these ingredients , it will be hard to get this type of icing made . The first thing is the liquid glucose . If you used any old thing labelled " syrup " , chances are that it contained water , and this is what made your mix a sugar . Liquid glucose is mostly sugar , with almost no wetness to it . Substituting something very wet will not work . Things which will work instead of glucose syrup are agave syrup , treacles , corn syrup , mollasses , golden syrup and honey . You should be aware that most of those will give you a more or less strong coloring and will have a bit of taste on its own . It depends on the type of your cupcakes whether the taste fits them . Corn syrup and golden syrup will be the best alternatives , but they are also less popular around the world . The other thing is the sugar . It absolutely must be in a powdered form . Crystals wo n't work . If you have a food processor , just put the crystalized sugar in there and process it . Use it immediately , or it will fuse together due to air moisture . But you may still be able to find icing sugar . It is just another word for powdered sugar , and it is used in Middle Eastern cuisine ( your profile says Lebanon ) , for example for dusting lokum , but also in some halva recipes . If you can find a confectioner who does these things , you can ask them for a source of powdered sugar . If you can not find ingredients which produce an acceptable quality of icing , you can also try other types of icing recipes for decoration . Most do use powdered sugar for easier incorporation , but some are made with sugar dissolved in a liquid .
The exact reason depends on the particular ingredient and recipe . Some common ones include : General temperature . By having all of the ingredients at room temperature , the time it takes to bake the overall item ( s ) is easier to predict , leading to better , more consistent outcomes . Egg whites Egg whites form the protein network that creates the foam when whipped more easily at room temperature than they do cold , so will whip up more quickly and with more volume . Butter Butter is often desired slightly cooler than room temperature , for its plastic properties ; it incorporates air for the creaming method best slightly below most room temperatures . Otherwise , it is easier to spread or incorporate when warmer . Cream cheese Easier to mix with sugar or other ingredients at room temperature than when cold .
Moka coffee pots work well if you use them every day . This way the oils that the coffee leaves inside them do not have the opportunity to go rancid ( all fats go rancid eventually ) and impart that horrible taste to your coffee . If you use them every day , it is true that you do n't really need to clean them , except to remove calcium scale buildup . If you use it rarely , like in your case or the frequent Moka pot left at a vacation house , you need to clean it with dish detergent and a scrubby sponge , you do n't need anything harsher . Make sure that you get all the coffee brown oils out . Yes , it is an unpleasant job . Make sure you rinse it well before putting it away to dry , you do n't want to simply replace the bitterness with soapiness . ... and this is the Italian doctrine ! :-)
Food processors are wonderful kitchen tools , but they have only existed for a relatively short while . The techniques used prior to their invention still work , but are much more labor intensive . Use a <URL> . Use a mortar and pestle . The results can then be forced through a sieve of <URL> if desired to get a smoother result . You have not mentioned in your recipe whether the beans are cooked . I am guessing that they are from the other ingredients they were to be processed with . If so , the food mill should work very well . If they are not , and you are essentially making a bean flour , the mortar and pestle would be more appropriate , although a lot of work .
My bread machine recipe books come with conversion instructions to make the bread traditionally . Here is a link to a site that will do the same : <URL> Best of luck with your bread making !
I guess it depends on what the substitution is for . Certainly if the butter is just for flavour , it 's a reasonable substitute ( I think I 'd use slightly more yogurt ) . But 9 times out of 10 , fat is the main reason the recipe is calling for butter ! Yogurt can not substitute for a fat ( butter ) because it has very little fat . If you lower the fat content of a baked good then you 'll generally end up with a product much denser and less flakey . So if you feel you must do this for some reason , then I would increase the sugar in the recipe to compensate ( sugar inhibits gluten formation and will help to make the result less chewy ) . The other thing you 'd better keep in mind is that yogurt is naturally sour and will become even sourer when baked at a high temperature . The longer you bake , the more sour it will become , so you might need to amp up the sugar significantly to maintain the proper flavour . So for the most part , no , yogurt is really not a substitute for butter or any other fat . Obviously this is partly a matter of personal taste , and if you 're happy with the result , then continue doing what you 're doing - but I think I 'd definitely hesitate to eat a cake that was baked with yogurt instead of butter .
It 's not entirely clear if this needs to be cooked after being wrapped . If you can cook it beforehand , and you really want something that has no taste at all , then you ca n't do much better than the technique Adria uses his <URL> , which is basically to create paper-thin sheets of gelled agar and gellan , cut them into circles , and wrap . Of course the technique makes it trivially easy to adapt to other shapes and sizes . If you really want them totally sealed , a torch or even a smear of very hot water should do the trick , it 'll gel again as it cools . If this needs to actually be baked or fried , then I 'd go for dumpling wrappers or gyoza wrappers , which are just circular versions of spring roll skins . This is exactly the application they exist for , and there are various kinds of rice-based skins that are so thin , they 're actually translucent : It goes without saying that white rice is pretty bland and wo n't add much flavour of its own . The Cook 's Thesaurus also has a <URL> ; if the above do n't work , maybe one of their other suggestions will suit your fancy .
Swai and catfish are biologically related , but Tilapia is a Cyclid and as such quite far removed . I think the biological relation is not all that critical to their similar taste which you dislike though . The taste of fish relies on a few factors such as : Their living environment ( Fresh , brackish , salt water ) The type of soil on the water bottom ( silt , sand ) The diet of the species ( other fish , water based plankton or bottom dwellers ) Catfish is a bottom feeding freshwater species and likely to have a relatively similar taste to other species that share their living environment and diet . As such I 'm willing to bet you also do n't like the taste of Carp very much . Perhaps the solution lies in finding a fish that has a similar texture to Catfish but is a sea dwelling fish eater . That way you might get the appreciation from your eaters while being able to enjoy your own dishes more .

What are some good tips or techniques for using a carbon steel wok on electric coil range ?
I wok on an electric stove and have found there 's a few tips to really help - its not perfect , but it helps : Preheat , preheat , preheat . Before you start any of your prep , put your wok on the stove and crank the heat . Let it heat up before you do anything at all to it . Make sure everything is at least at room temperature . We often use frozen stir fry veggies , but we thaw them out first and they 're at least at room temp before they go in . The same goes for meat . For sauces , we 'll often microwave it so that its a bit warm before it even goes in . If you have a screaming hot wok , and you add cold food - then for a long time it will only steam the food . Do it in batches . Do n't crowd your wok until everything is already hot . If you 're doing meat and veggies - do the meat first , take it off , let the pan reheat , and then do some of the veggies . Work in batches so that the pan temperature does n't drop and give it time to reheat between batches . Assemble it all at the end .
They 're something leaf-like . If you look closely , you 'll find that they are n't just markings , they can be pulled away from the stem . There does n't seem to be a lot of agreement about the best name ; you 'll see " scales " and " leaves " in plenty of informal contexts , and " bracts " in some ( but not all ) more formal contexts . On Food and Cooking says they 're bracts , and actually mentions why they might be there : The stalk does n't support ordinary leaves ; the small projections from the stems are leaf-like bracts that shield immature clusters of feathery photosynthetic branches . That cluster inside them is what makes them <URL> : In botany , a bract is a modified or specialized leaf , especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a flower , inflorescence axis , or cone scale . <URL> . That 's a bit vague about where it actually is on the plant , but there 's an image later in the article making it clear what they 're referring to : <URL> Oddly , <URL> goes into a bit more detail : In asparagus ( Asparagus officinalis ; Asparagaceae ) , the scales found on the asparagus spears are the true leaves . If the thick , fleshy asparagus spears continue to grow , flat , green , leaflike structures called cladodes develop in the axils of the scale leaves . That does match the definition of bract . Asparagus is only tender enough to eat when pretty young , though , so perhaps when you eat it those cladodes have n't developed yet . That 's still the purpose of the scales , though . In any case , it sounds like " scale " vs " bract " may just be a difference in precision and perspective .
Let 's start with the assumption that Safety is never in the balance . Safety has to be taken into account for any method that we use and that means that we want to keep any food that is time and temperature sensitive out of the danger zone . The danger zone is the temperature range from 40 degrees F to 140 degrees F . If you have plenty of time , letting the turkey defrost in the refrigerator is safest and easiest , since there is little that you have to do . The turkey is always out of the danger zone and all you have to do is put it in the refrigerator . However , it can take a very long time , 24 hours for each 5 pounds of turkey weight ... 4 days for a 20 pound turkey . Assuming you have n't planned that far ahead , the other safe method is to defrost in the sink with cold running water . The water does n't need to be pouring out , just a steady stream so the water turns over regularly . Water is a better conductor of heat than air , so the turkey will defrost more rapidly than in the refrigerator . The danger zone is why you do n't want to defrost the turkey using warm water , or just sitting on the counter . In either of those cases , the outside meat is warmed into the danger zone before the inside defrosts , so you have some of the meat ( the part that is most likely to have come into contact with contaminants ) in a temperature range that promotes bacterial growth .
Amchur does n't give much of a flavor other than sour , at least , not in the amounts I use of it . It does have a bit of a distinctive aroma , but really , to me , it is just a fairly neutral sour flavor . The easiest , most neutral substitute would be citric acid powder . Unfortunately , they do n't usually give concentration/strengths on the packaging , but comparing Ball Citric Acid for Canning to the powdered amchur from the Indian store , it 's pretty close . I think the citric acid tastes a tiny bit lemony , but not enough to make a difference . Also , the amchur powder I buy is generally quite finely ground , and the citric acid is generally in crystals . If you are doing something like a spice blend ( e.g. , chat masala powder ) you would probably want to grind the crystals up to match the texture of the rest of the spices . Depending on what you 're making , there are quite a few substitutions , but most of them would be more obscure than ( or at least as obscure as ) the amchur , and all would be less neutral . Also , amchur is dry , so adding something liquid might affect your recipe . ( Easy to adjust if you are adding to something liquid , of course . ) In many Indian dishes , most of the Indians I know simply do use lemon juice when they want to make something sour , especially for northern dishes . This really is quite common , and nearly every Indian cook I know in the US has a large bottle of lemon juice in the fridge for every day use . If you 're making something South Indian , tamarind pulp or paste is often the souring agent of choice , but it is distinctly not neutral . It has a distinctive flavor and will also darken things ( in a somewhat yellow-orange-brown range ) . Some regions also use dried kokum fruit in the same way ( classic Maharashtrian aamti , for example ) , but I would say it is even more distinctive than tamarind , and it also will darken it ( with a dark grey-green-brown range of color ) . For both kokum and tamarind , you soak the pulp in water and add the soaking water without the pulp to the dish . You can also usually find tamarind concentrate ( a tarry paste ) but I 've never seen anything like that for kokum . One more option I just thought of is using some other unripe or sour fruit . Amchur is made by powdering dried green mangoes . You can actually sometimes find dried green mangoes at places like Trader Joe 's and if it is unsweetened , a small piece of that can certainly be used , but it seems that any fruit that is firm and sour should work , such as an unripe plum or a very tart apple . In that case , I would suggest either cooking with a small piece or two of the fruit in the sauce ( if there is one ) and removing it later or you could try to crush it and press some juice out . The problem here would be in figuring out the correct amount to add , but I think you could start from the dried-to-fresh conversion rates for herbs .
Roast Date Coffee starts to degrade fairly quickly . If you can find someone who roasts locally , that 's ideal . The closer you are to the roaster , the less shipping and handling and the more likely you are to get quality coffee . If a company is roasting something to be shipped nation wide , they have to make certain sacrifices . So like @Max said , look for a Roast Date . Within the last week or two is ideal , a couple months is decent . Origin For places like Tim Hortons ( Canada ) , McDonalds or Starbucks , they are looking for a very consistent taste every time . This is easier to do with a Darker Roast as you hide some of the nuances of specific crops . Often these will be from multiple origins to " blend " to a consistent taste . There are still many acceptable coffees that are blended like this . However , if you look at many of the Artisianal Coffee Places , they often tend to go for a light or medium Roast . They 'll also tend to advertise a specifc farm and country . The reason for this is that with a lighter roast you can taste more of those specific notes in the bean . Some places in my opinion go to far and under roast it . I find in this case it actually comes across as overly sour . So this is entirely up to you what you prefer or are used to . Packaging You want something that was vacuum sealed at the roaster . Coffee reacts with oxygen and degrades as soon as it 's roasted . Vacuum sealing it immediately , slows down that process . So this means avoid anything in a bulk bin in a coffee shop or grocery store . You also want to buy something that is a whole bean . As soon as you grind it , it also starts to degrade ( within minutes ) . You can find a ceramic burr hand grinder for about $ 30 . Personal Notes ... For me , I have a few local roasters that I really like , but for my daily cup I ca n't afford to buy them regularly either . So basically , I look semi-local ( for me it 's anything in western Canada ) for a medium roast from a company that can tell me where they got their bean . I look for words like " single origin " and " fair trade " and yes , even " organic " . I do n't actually care if it 's Organic , but I 've found these companies often care about their product more . When I get the coffee I like to be able to taste something unique in it . I 'm not sitting here looking for " hmmm this tastes of elderberries and caramel by the ocean in the fall ... " that 's a little too much for me . That said , if it just tastes like generic " coffee " , then I 'm not really interested . Not to say that any of this guarantees their quality ... so buyer beware . I do n't think specific brands fits with this site , as it 's too specialized/localized , but hopefully that gives you something to look out for .
Can I convince you that electric is better ? No , I ca n't , because I do n't think it is . The issue I have is related to how long it takes to warm up ( and cool down ) . Electric cook tops just do n't respond quickly . Little too hot ? Too bad , nothing you can do about it ( in time to save a dish that 's starting to burn anyway ) . Not hot enough ? Check back in 2 or 3 minutes . I find this particularly irritating when a recipe requires varying heats while cooking . Sorry I do n't have better news for you .
It 's not a " cheat sheet " , and is rather too big to stick to your fridge , but I highly recommend the book <URL> , which is an encyclopedia of exactly these associations . What ingredients does any particular ingredient go with ? How do you cook it ? Absolutely terrific book !
