What is the Beggs/Mueller emergency spin recovery technique ?
From <URL> , the Beggs/Mueller technique ( also sometimes called the " hands-off " spin recovery technique ) is : Power -- Off . ( presumably they mean " to idle " , and not " stop the engine " ) Remove your hand from the stick . Apply full opposite rudder until rotation stops . Neutralize rudder and recover to level flight . So essentially the same technique as PARE , except instead of neutralizing the ailerons &amp; pushing the nose over you put your hands in your lap : Power : to idle Ailerons : Put your hands in your lap . Rudder : Full opposite the direction of spin until rotation stops . Elevator : Your hands should still be in your lap ! The big advantage to the Beggs/Mueller technique seems to be that with your hands off the stick there 's no chance of the pilot panicking and yanking back on the stick/yoke and prolonging the spin . It 's predicated on the fact that the nose will fall naturally in a stall , breaking the stall and putting the plane into a slight dive . I ca n't say as to whether the Beggs/Mueller technique will work in all aircraft , but it should work in any plane that tends to naturally recover from a stall ( i.e. one where the nose naturally falls when the plane is stalled ) and has otherwise-conventional spin recovery characteristics . That covers every plane that immediately comes to mind , but it 's possible there are some with a canard configuration where spin recovery is n't conventional , and the Beggs/Mueller technique may also not be ideal .
There is no one simple measure of " busiest " when it comes to airports , there are usually ( at least ) three . Busiest by passenger traffic - defined as total passengers emplaned and deplaned , with transit passengers counted once Busiest by cargo traffic - loaded and unloaded freight and mail measured in metric tonnes Busiest by traffic movements - total number of landings and takeoffs of all aircraft The most recent statistics produced by <URL> are from 2015 . By passenger traffic the top 3 are Hartsfield -- Jackson Atlanta International Airport , USA Beijing Capital International Airport , China Dubai International Airport , UAE By cargo traffic Hong Kong International Airport , Hong Kong Memphis International Airport , USA Shanghai Pudong International Airport , China By traffic movements Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport , USA O'Hare International Airport , USA Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , USA ( Aside : Wow , those Americans like their traffic movements - 8 of the top 10 are USA ! ) There are a few non-standard claims too . They are interesting , if not winners . Memphis International is the <URL> , and as such was the highest freight airport for a number of years . <URL> is the busiest single-runway airport ( There are actually two runways , but only one is ever in use ) Whitman Airport hosts an <URL> which temporarily raises it to one of the busiest airport in the world for that short period . The <URL> ( Heathrow , Gatwick , City , Luton , Stanstead &amp; Southend ) host the most passengers annually for a single city 's airports combined . ( Do n't get me started on Southend being a " London " airport - it 's about 20 miles from what could sensibly be called London ) References : <URL> <URL>
As you measure temperature moving at high velocities , your outside thermometer will measure a higher temp than what is actually outside ( what a non-moving thermometer would get ) . That 's because as the air rams into your thermometer it gets a little bit compressed , and that makes it heat up a little bit . Amazingly , some smart people have even calculated how much that " ram rise " is , and you can actually compensate ( well , in theory ) from the indicated temperature to calculate what the actual outside air temp is : $ $ Ram ~ Rise = SAT \ times0 .2 \ times { M } ^ 2 $ $ Where $ SAT$ is Static Air Temperature in Kelvin , $ M$ is Mach number Problem is , not all instruments will compress that air in the same way , and not all of them will pick up this Ram Rise entirely . So they will publish a $ K$ , a ram-rise-coefficient ( also called recovery factor ) meaning how much of from the theoretical Ram Rise they actually pick up . ( OAT/SAT ) Static Air Temperature = noted as $ T_S $ , actual temperature of the air outside , the same your thermometer will pick up if you were not moving ( say , in a balloon ? ) ( RAT ) Ram Air Temperature = noted as $ T_M $ , actual measured temperature by your instrument . $ $ RAT = SAT + k \ times { Ram ~ Rise } $ $ ( TAT ) Total Air Temperature = noted as $ T_T $ , total temperature as measured by an instrument with $ K$ - coefficient of $ 1 $ . $ $ TAT = SAT+R am ~ Rise $ $
" Wilco " is short for the phrase " <URL> , " meaning that the speaker will follow the instructions to which they are replying . <URL> places the origin at 1938 , some time after the invention of radio , likely in military usage . Although the phrase " roger wilco " is sometimes used , <URL> since the " roger " ( <URL> ) is implied .
Assuming that you 're asking about intercepting the glideslope from above rather than the localizer , the answer is that it is definitely NOT recommended . There are at least two significant problems if you do this . First , is the fact that at high vertical angles there can be false glideslopes . Looking at the diagram below , if you 're coming at the glideslope from above and the needle starts to move , are you intercepting the real 3 & deg ; glideslope or the false 9 & deg ; glideslope ? <URL> The diagram above is the best I could find , but it has one error . It shows a " Flag no signal " at 6 & deg ; . Actually what you 'll have there is another false glideslope , but one which has reverse sensing . You can , of course , do a reasonability check if you know your distance from the runway , or you could compare your vertical speed if following it with what you know your vertical speed should be , or on the 6 & deg ; line a command to go up when you know you should go down would be a hint , but it 's unwise in my opinion to put yourself in a situation that increases your work load that much during an instrument approach . You asked about GPWS warnings . None of the aircraft I flew that had GPWS would sound a GPWS warning just from receiving a false glide slope . However , all of them would have sounded the GPWS if you followed a false glideslope and were close to the ground because doing so would give you an excessive sink rate . A second problem with approaching from above is that the vertical angular width of the glideslope as measured from needle full down to needle full up is very small . As I remember only about one degree . Whatever it is , though , the point is that if you descend into the glideslope with a vertical speed of only a few hundred feet per minute greater than the glideslope itself is descending , the needle is going to go from full down to full up very quickly . Without working it out , I 'd guess that if you 're inside the outer marker you might well miss its movement if your instrument scan had you away from the needle more than a second . In the late 1970s a friend of mine was flying a charter in a Cessna 310 . He unwisely decided to intercept the glideslope at Salem , Oregon from above . The aircraft hit the ground in the vicinity of the outer marker , killing all aboard . During the accident investigation , the NTSB found from radar data that he had a descent rate greater than 1,000 fpm going through the glideslope .
In short : the 24 bit address is critical on the technical layer of Air Traffic Control , but it is not used in the operational level . For identification of aircraft and association to flight plans , the air traffic controllers and the flight data processing systems rely mostly on the Mode A code and the aircraft ID ( call sign ) transmitted by the transponder . The ICAO 24-bit aircraft address is an essential element of the way Mode S radar and TCAS work . Before Mode-S radar , only modes A and C were used by civil ATC secondary radars . Mode A and Mode C are unaddressed ; every transponder receiving a Mode A or Mode C interrogation will reply * . This causes two problems , garbling and FRUIT . Garbling is caused by the overlap of replies from multiple transponders . A transponder replies on 1090 MHz in the from of a number of pulses . For Mode A &amp; C , there are at most 12 pulses between a set of framing pulses . When multiple aircraft reply to the same interrogation , these pulses mix up and it becomes difficult to find out which transponder sent which pulse . This leads to false altitudes or false squawk codes . FRUIT ( False Replies Unsynchronised to Interrogator Transmission ) is caused by replies that are triggered by other radars . When multiple radars operate in an area , transponders can be quite busy and the radar is easily mislead by a reply to another radar . In addition to the timing ( range ) being wrong , the reply can be Mode A ( squawk code ) while the radar interrogated Mode C ( altitude ) . There is no way to see what kind ( A or C ) reply was sent . To overcome these problems of Mode A/C , Mode S was introduced . Mode S is quite different from Mode A/C and requires a more sophisticated radar and transponder . It uses the 24 bit address to distinguish responses from various aircraft and to interrogate specific aircraft . Most Mode S interrogations are addressed ; the interrogation contains the unique 24 bit address of the aircraft it is interrogating . This reduces the probability of garbling since other aircraft will not reply Unaddressed Mode S interrogations will solicit replies that contain the address of interrogator ( radar ) . This prevents FRUIT since the radar can verify that the reply is correctly addressed . Unlike Mode A/C which does not have any error checking , a Mode S reply contains a 24 bit CRC check code . Mode S Altitude and identity ( squawk ) replies have their own identifier so they can be distinguished . Mode S radars can be operated in clusters and coordinate between them who is interrogating which aircraft at which time . This further reduces the message load and garbling / fruit probability . For TCAS , the Mode S address is used to distinguish replies for various aircraft in the vicinity of the own aircraft . The TCAS transponder interrogates omnidirectionally ( in all directions ) and get 's replies from all direction . Again , this is very susceptible to Garbling and FRUIT . Whilst TCAS can work with Mode A/C , for its reliability and coordination of resolution advisories , the 24-bit address is crucial .
Short answer If a single range should be stated for ACAS II , it would be the reliable range of 14 NM , even if targets can displayed by current TCAS II up to 30/40 NM . Reliable means here : a track can be established with a probability of at least 90 per cent for aircraft within the surveillance range . The reliable range of 14 NM is achievable with a ground plane antenna a power of 250 W and a Mode S sensitivity of -- 74 dBm . Diversity of ranges There are different range values that can be considered : Overall pulse detection range is 30 NM . Reliable surveillance range is 14 NM . Recommended RA range is 12 NM . Guaranteed range is 4.5 NM . The range must be limited because it impacts the number of transponder addresses to be stored for a given transponder density as well as the number of interrogations within a volume , hence radio spectrum use and reliability . ACAS II recommendations by ICAO ACAS II ICAO recommendations are found in <URL> , Airborne Collision Avoidance System ( ACAS ) Manual : Interrogation pulse detection range is 14 NM for Mode A/C and 30 NM for Mode S . The equipment should have the capacity for surveillance of any mix of Mode A/C or Mode S targets up to at least 30 aircraft . Surveillance must be reliable within 14 NM , with an aircraft density of 0.3 aircraft per square NM within 5 NM ( and up to 142 aircraft within 30 NM ) . The equipment should assess as possible collision threats only those targets within a maximum range of 12 NM . No target outside this range should be eligible to generate an RA . As density increases , reliability decreases . If the overall target count ever exceeds the surveillance capacity at any range up to 14 NM , the long-range targets may be dropped . The system reliability is guaranteed within the minimum range of 4.5 NM . This radius is deemed adequate for providing protection for up to 500 kt encounter . TCAS version 7.1 TCAS II is the sole implementation of ACAS II which fully comply with ACAS II . The reference ( paying ) documents are : <URL> ( RTCA ) and <URL> ( EUROCAE ) . From the EASA document <URL> TCAS II can simultaneously track up to 30 aircraft , within a nominal range of 14 NM for Mode A/C targets and 30 NM for Mode S targets . In implementations that allow for the use of the Mode S extended squitter , the normal surveillance range may be increased beyond the nominal 14 NM . However , this information is not used for collision avoidance purposes . This is confirmed in FAA document <URL> TCAS has a requirement to provide reliable surveillance out to a range of 14 nmi and in traffic densities of up to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile . [ ... ] TCAS can simultaneously track up to 30 transponder-equipped aircraft within a nominal range of 30 nmi .
While there probably is an " ideal " attitude to impact water , and it would be nice to crash-land with exactly the correct attitude ... it 's very much a secondary consideration . By far the most important thing , when landing on water , is to land slowly . As such , your aim should be to land ( / crash ) with whatever attitude gives the lowest possible ground speed/descent rate at the point of impact . If that means a " normal " flare , do a normal flare . If that means a harsher flare with a tail strike , do that instead . The point is that you 're in an emergency situation , and your biggest priority is to get the speed right : you likely do n't have the luxury of trying to fine-tune your angle of impact and flare . Additionally , you always have the risk of over-flaring and stalling into the water instead , which is a worse end result . So yes , it may - with some airframes - be beneficial to have a tail strike , but you 're far better off just keeping the aircraft under the best control possible and reducing your speed as far as possible
What is the purpose of runway grooving ? The channels help to remove water from the runway . They also provide an area for the water to build up . With out these channels the water runs the risk of forming a thin surface covering the runway which can be very dangerous . As mentioned by john here in the comments this is usually known as hydroplaning and is the same as what happens to a car . How does the airport drainage system work ? This is a bit of a guess but I assume they work like any other road drainage system and it will depend on where the airport is located . <URL> that you may find of some interest . Here is <URL> , it 's a bit long but should cover what you are looking for . Why do airports remove rubber from the runway ? Tires obtain the best friction when they come in direct contact with the runway surface . Excess tire rubber that wears off and sticks to the runway can affect the tire/runway interactions . <URL> covers the main points pretty well .
As soon as there 's a fire on board , the absolute top priority is getting everybody out as soon as possible . Aircraft are designed in such a way that , even after a crash landing ( or other serious malfunction ) , the passengers will have a minute or two to evacuate before conditions in the cabin become toxic ( fire , smoke , etc ) ; this is done by using flame-retardant material and burn-through protection , but in an intense fire these wo n't protect the cabin for long , and once they fail no-one will be able to survive inside the aircraft for much longer than that . Smoke inhalation and oxygen deprivation kill just as effectively as being burned . Therefore everyone has to be able to evacuate from the plane within 90 seconds , even assuming the plane is packed to the gills with passengers , and half the exits are inoperative . Given that the aircraft may be damaged after a rough/crash landing , some of the doors may be unusable ( due to fire or smoke just outside them ) , it may be dark in the cabin , and people may be injured and/or panicking , it 's vital that nothing slows down the evacuation . To get an idea of what a 90-second evacuation of a fully-loaded aircraft looks like , see the video of the <URL> - and these passengers were calm , uninjured , and prepared . If passengers take hand luggage with them this is slowed down : The time it takes to get it out of the overhead bins ( with everyone else crushing against you to get out ) . Carrying the luggage down the aisle ( without tripping , hurting yourself or anyone else - again , look at the A380 video , and imagine trying to do that with a suitcase ) . If you lose your luggage , everyone behind you will have to climb over it to get to the exit . Maneuvering your suitcase around the corner to the door , not getting it stuck on the door frame , with people behind you literally shoving you out the door . Plunging down a very steep slide the height of a two-storey building ( or more , in case of the A380 's upper deck ) at high speed , with your suitcase flailing around . At best it whacks you on the head , at worst it punctures and deflates the slide , which given the crush of passengers behind you will probably lead a few people to plummet from the aircraft doors straight to the ground . Assuming you 've made it to the ground , there is someone else plunging down the slide right behind you . If your suitcase slows you down even a little , they will plow right into you , and soon you 'll have a crush of people at the foot of the slide . In this specific case , the fire was fortunately not serious enough to defeat the cabin fire protection before the last passengers had evacuated - but as <URL> said , there are unfortunately other examples where the passengers were not so lucky . To illustrate the risk of fire after landing : <URL> ran off the runway at landing , and despite having little fuel on board , the resulting fire completely destroyed the aircraft ; luckily , everyone evacuated in time . Once there 's been a major malfunction , there is no way to tell how much time you have left to get out - fire can spread very very quickly - and so you have to get out as quickly as possible . Taking luggage with you endangers your life and that of your fellow passengers .
As Lnafziger says , a conventional landing is impossible for anything more than a tiny aircraft STOL aircraft ( Carrier ' runway ' length : 200m ) . As you state however , if it was an emergency , the aircraft carrier has a special net which it can fold up to stop planes , and since it can stop an F18 Hornet , it could probably take your Cessna as well :)
Rotor is the generic name for something in rotation . It can be used for a propeller , the rotating wing of an helicopter , the rotating elements of a compressor or a turbine , etc. . Rotor ( rotating ) is the antonym of stator ( stationary ) . Propeller blades are airfoils ( small wings ) which accelerate air to create lift and thrust . Sometimes a propeller is referred as a propeller disc to designate the whole disc swept by the blades , and the inner cone . <URL> <URL> . Propeller blades are fixed on the rotation axis , except for the pitch angle . Rotor blades ( rotorcraft ) are not fixed , they have some freedom in flapping and leading-lagging . <URL> Source : <URL> These freedom degrees are necessary to prevent vibrations due to varying forces encountered by a blade during a full turn . Rotor blades of a gas turbine are like propeller blades , though for the turbine itself they may work by " impulse " and by reaction ( acceleration by converging nozzle ) , and more generally by a mix of both principles . <URL> Often the inner part of a rotor holding the blades is referred as the rotor disc . Blades of a turbine engine are fixed like blades of a propeller , though in some cases they are not locked on the disc mechanically , but dynamically by the centrifugal force . The distinction between rotor and propeller is more a matter of custom . Rotor is quite generic , you ca n't be wrong using it for a spinning device . Propeller is rather specific to the mean of creating horizontal thrust within a fluid and with the objective to move an object . A house fan is not a propeller . You may find a similar distinction between ( aerodynamic ) lift ( and drag ) and thrust , created by the same phenomena : Fluid acceleration . The distinction is here in the way the aerodynamic force is symbolically broken down into geometrical components .
The locks release and typically the gear falls free into place . It is often aided by hydraulic motors ( i.e. to overcome anything that might be trying to hold the gear up , such as slush from the takeoff runway that froze after the gear was in the well ) , but most landing gear will freefall into place within a couple of seconds even without hydraulic assistance after the uplocks are released . What you 're probably hearing is the sudden onset of the wind noise -- when retracted the landing gear is streamlined , but when extended there is now an open cavity where the gear had been , and this open area in the fuselage creates a lot of wind noise from the suddenly turbulent airflow . Going from a relatively quite state to a loud one suddenly gives the impression of a " bang . " This is possibly enhanced by whatever noise is made by the uplocks that hold the landing gear in place releasing , and perhaps some louder noise as the initial moments of the gear extension may be noisier than the steady-state noise of being fully extended . Also , the noise due to the turbulence will subside as the airspeed slows , and extending the landing gear often comes during a phase of flight when the airspeed is being reduced in preparation for the final approach segment and the subsequent landing .
I have recently flown on a China Eastern A330-200 from Shanghai to Beijing and that noise was heard around 10.000 feet both on the way up and on the way down . It sounds awful ! Everybody was rather worried , including myself who , despite being a frequent flyer , had never heard that noise . At first I thought it was some fatigue issue of the aircraft skin while " inflating " as internal pressure increased . But a few days later I flew on a Cathay Pacific A330-300 from Hong Kong to Jakarta , and after hearing that noise again , I asked a flight attendant who told me it was likely ice crystals in the air conditioning tubes that form when the outside air is very humid . She said she heard it many times and it 's considered normal on A330 's .
An airway ( Victor or otherwise ) is just a standard route for aircraft to fly on in the national airspace system - for all practical purposes they are literally highways in the sky ( with the lanes being stacked vertically rather than horizontally ) . This is part of the paradoxical logic of how ATC provides separation services for IFR aircraft : " You have to put them together to keep them apart . " -- In an environment with no radar , or in crowded airspace , having everyone following a standard routing ensures that you know what each plane is going to do . If you have 10 aircraft all flying along an airway and each separated by altitude or time you know they wo n't hit each other We define the attributes ( width , minimum altitude , etc. ) of a victor airway mainly for purposes of obstacle clearance : A VOR has a specific degree of precision in its measurement , and if we assume the maximum distance from the VOR ( the widest degree of arc ) and the maximum allowable " slop " in the VOR receiver/indicator in the aircraft that means an aircraft that thinks it 's " on the airway " will be somewhere within a given width around the defining radial : For Victor airways that width is 8 nautical miles - 4NM on either side of the centerline radial - or 4.5 degrees if the VORs are more than 102 nautical miles apart . Those numbers may sound like they 're arbitrary , but they are n't : If the VORs are exactly 102 nautical miles apart then the width of the airway at the 51 nautical mile midpoint between the two VORs is - you guessed it - 4 nautical miles . The further apart the VORs are the wider the center of the corridor becomes , accounting for the fact that a degree of arc gets wider as you get further from the VOR . Airways are an IFR construct so if we continue on the assumption that the plane is in the clouds and the pilot ca n't see anything then within the airway corridor the aircraft needs to be clear of any obstacles ( towers , trees , etc. ) , and of course it needs to be able to receive the VORs that define the airway . The combination of those factors and a few others will determine the minimum altitude at which a given airway can be used . Note that much like ground highways airways are not always the most direct or convenient way to fly from one location to another . In particular the Victor airways are defined by VOR radials ( or the intersections of such radials ) , but they 're not always a straight line between two VORs . As an example , take a look at <URL> : The airway I picked ( V451 ) will take me from Groton VOR ( GON ) to La Guardia VOR ( LGA ) , but it bends in three places on this route : CREAM , KEYED , and NESSI ( not labeled on the sectional , but its the bend southeast of Bridgeport ) . A straight line between the two VORs would be the 265 radial from Groton direct to La Guardia : A much shorter distance , but not a " standard " airway routing .
Yes , for a while : Capt. Al Haynes , after <URL> on United Flight 232 . <URL> I was lucky enough to have dinner with Al Haynes a few years ago , and he told me that he had a very difficult time overcoming the guilt of the disaster . The talks he gives have been a way of coping . ( As a side note , he also donates all the money he receives from the talks to the survivors of the crash ) . Capt. Haynes has said the same thing in various interviews : The Seattle Times : Haynes said it took many sessions with a psychiatrist to overcome his survivor 's guilt . He resumed flying three months after the accident ; mandatory retirement at 60 followed two years later . <URL> NY Mag : It was very hard to get past the guilt of surviving . My job had been to get people from point A to point B safely , and I did n't do it . I felt that I had killed them . I had a lot of psychiatric help at the hospital and afterward . Finally , one psychiatrist said , " You 're not going to find an answer . You just have to accept that it happened . " <URL> AvWeb : Haynes said , at the time , that he remained troubled by the accident and constantly wondered if there was something he could have done , some overlooked decision that would have saved all aboard . <URL> Before his death , <URL> said something similar : " To find out 112 people did n't make it , that just about destroyed me , " Fitch once said . " I would have given my life for any of them . It was a really tough time . " <URL>
This headline made the news this week : <URL> : The passenger , Ann Kristin Balto from Tromsø , noticed the highly disconcerting leak as the plane was taxiing to the runway -- before it actually took off . After alerting the stewardess , the flight was immediately cancelled . So fuel leaks are one thing you could look out for !
What should a pilot do ? Follow the checklist ? Is there any checklist ? There are many such checklists in the intertubes and whole books have been written on the subject Here 's the start of one for <URL> For comparison , here 's one for a <URL> Are commercial jets buoyant ? Yes , initially , if substantially in once piece . We know that because several intrepid pilots have tested this idea ( obligatory hat-tip to <URL> ) . It makes sense that the fuel tanks in the wings , especially once emptied of fuel , are buoyant . The wings are obviously capable of supporting the fuselage . The fuselage is a pressurised tube and should be buoyant too , until the passengers and crew start making large holes in it .
I work as a fixed-wing pilot for a hospital-based Air Ambulance program . Let me add my experience to the ATC orders accurately cited by Pondlife 's answer : the <URL> call sign ( the old " Lifeguard " is still used when filing the flight plan ) indicates a need for priority handling . ATC is often helpful in providing us with priority routing . This includes giving us direct clearances , moving us up in the landing que , allowing us an unrestricted approach speed , and otherwise expediting our flight . However , ATC does not always provide priority handling , and I have often experienced ground delays of 5-10 + minutes as ATC apparently prioritizes other traffic , including air cargo and the like . This is rarely a big problem as patients are typically stable , but it can be frustrating when priority handling is expected . However , if medical staff determine that a patient is in critical condition , we will announce this to ATC -- typically accompanied by a request for a specific clearance or change to a previous clearance . This announcement re-iterates our need for priority handling and indicates the urgency of the situation . In this way we can work with ATC to best care for the patient . We will often make such an announcement when checking on with approach control for their information with no specific accompanying request . Occasionally , however , we will need to request such priority handling because ATC has issued us speed restrictions or delaying vectors to put us behind other traffic . ATC is very good at working with us when we do need the priority handling . In other words , ATC usually automatically gives us priority handling , but when they do n't -- and we need it -- we ask for it and they are very good at working with us to provide the priority handling .
Other than extra braking and reverse thrust , is there a specific short-field landing technique for large jet airliners ? Never heard of any . The required landing distance is calculated so that the plane can reliably stop ( even if reversers fail ) and landing at shorter runway is not allowed . so the 747s try to land right on the numbers , rather than the usual technique of touching down within the first third of the runway . The usual technique is to aim for 1,000 ft down the runway and touch down with some flare somewhere around 1,500 . In discussions about the famous landings at St Maarten , it is sometimes said that part of the reason for the low passes is due to the relatively short runway , so the 747s try to land right on the numbers Actually the <URL> runway 10 has PAPI and TDZ marking a little beyond the usual 1,000 ft mark at around 1,250 ft. <URL> the threshold is displaced 162 ft ( but it also says runway 9 , so it is likely out of date ) , but according to the satellite images it is a bit over 300 ft plus some runway end safety area , placing the threshold around 500 ft past the fence and the touch-down zone around 1,750 ft past the fence . Now the normal glide-slope is around 5 % . That means the aircraft is supposed to cross the fence at around 90 ft , on average . That seems about right . Of course you ca n't expect every aircraft to be positioned precisely within a few feet , so now and then some crosses it at maybe 50 ft. That is not intention , but simply a deviation . But of course the photos of planes flying especially low are more likely to be picked for publishing . Also , a short field landing normally calls for steep approach which make precise aim for landing spot easier . That would actually place the aircraft higher over the beach . But the glide-slope at TNCM is normal 3 ° ( 5 % ) one , so it is not a steep approach . Such a procedure is fine in a Cessna , but in a large passenger jet ? I have my doubts . In large jet it is n't . Air transport has stricter regulations than general aviation because more is at stake and larger aircraft have stricter limits because the higher energies involved mean errors are harder to fix and have more serious consequences .

How can the glide ratio in a balanced turn be estimated ?
I get a variation of the glide ratio with $ \ frac { 2 } { \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } $ for circles flown with a bank angle of $ \ varphi $ when compared to straight flight at the respective best speed for optimum L/D . Your initial assumptions are right : Lift : $ L = c_L \ , \ rho \ , \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ , S \ , n_z $ Load factor : $ n_z = \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } $ with the bank angle $ \ varphi $ Drag : $ D = D_0 + D_i = \ Bigl ( c _ { D0 } + \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ varepsilon } \ Bigr ) \ , \ rho \ , \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ , S$ ( zero-lift drag + induced drag ) , and both are equal at optimum $ L/D $ : $ $ \ Bigl ( \ frac { L } { D } \ Bigr ) _ { \ rm opt } = \ Bigl ( \ frac { c_L } { c_D } \ Bigr ) _ { \ rm opt } = \ frac { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ epsilon } { 2 \ , c_L } \ text { for straight flight at } 1 \ , g \ text { ( $ n_z = 1 $ ) } . $ $ Now with load factor $ n_z = n $ and unchanged speed : $ $ \ frac { L _ { ng } } { D _ { ng } } = \ frac { \ frac { c _ { L _ { 1g } } } { \ cos \ varphi } } { \ frac { c _ { L _ { 1g } } ^ 2 \ bigl ( 1 + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos ^ 2 \ varphi } \ bigr ) } { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ epsilon } } = \ frac { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ varepsilon } { c _ { L _ { 1g } } \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } . $ $ The ratio between both glide ratios is $ \ frac { 2 } { \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } $ , which makes sense because it will become 1 for $ \ varphi = 0 $ and become less than 1 for nonzero values of $ \ varphi $ . Note that the glide ratio at n g does n't carry an " opt " subscript anymore , because by increasing $ c_L $ we move away from the optimum . If the best L/D would be maintained for circling flight , speed would need to increase , not lift coefficient . The altitude loss in straight flight of a distance equal to the diameter of a circle with the radius $ R = \ frac { v ^ 2 } { g \ tan \ varphi } $ is $ 2 \ , \ pi \ , R \ , \ frac { D } { L } $ . When flown at the correct bank angle , this altitude loss per circle $ \ Delta h $ will become $ $ \ Delta h = \ frac { \ pi \ , v ^ 2 } { g \ tan \ varphi } \ Bigl ( \ frac { D } { L } \ Bigr ) _ { 1g } \ Bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ Bigr ) . $ $ Plot of the glide ratio with bank angle divided by the glide ratio for straight flight ( blue line ) . I also added the altitude loss for a full circle ( red line , Basis : $ L/D = 18 $ at 100 $ \ , $ m/s in straight flight ) , both for flight at constant speed and constant lift coefficient : Use the results from this plot with caution at higher bank angles : Lift would need to double at a bank angle of 60 ° , doubling $ c_L $ , so we fly much more slowly than any pilot would . The red line gives more realistic values , since here the aircraft speeds up for flying higher bank angles . Flying at constant speed gives less altitude loss simply because the circle becomes smaller than when flying at constant $ c_L $ . Note that for every meter flown the altitude lost is greater when flying at constant speed , indicated by the blue glide ratio degradation curve . Two factors conspire to increase aerodynamic losses when flying at constant speed with higher bank angles : You need to create more lift , which causes higher induced drag , and Your optimum $ L/D $ is at a higher speed when the bank angle increases , which again increases aerodynamic losses because you move away from the optimum . If you try to express the altitude loss per circle $ \ Delta h $ as a function of $ \ varphi $ , you will get a quadratic equation and two solutions , one high and one low bank angle : $ $ \ frac { \ cos ^ 2 \ varphi + 1 } { \ sin \ varphi } = \ frac { g \ , \ Delta h } { \ pi \ , v ^ 2 } \ Bigl ( \ frac { L } { D } \ Bigr ) _ { 1g } . $ $ Maybe MathSE can solve this algebraically ; I would resort to iteration or tabulation here .
Pilot 's breath is not recorded on a flight data recorder , as it is not one of <URL> . However , if a pilot is breathing abnormally , the cockpit voice recorder may easily detect that as the breathing sound is captured by the CVR . A reference to this can be found in the <URL> for Germanwings flight 4U9525 , which states : ... the only sound to come from Lubitz is the sound of him breathing , picked up by the microphone on his headphone set . ... " We could hear human breathing inside the cabin , " said Mr Robin , " and this breathing noise we heard up until the moment of final impact . That means that the co-pilot was alive . Apparently he was breathing normally , so this is not someone having a heart attack , for example .
There is no regulation against doing so provided that the third person in the cockpit is type rated for PIC privileges on the aircraft and has a waiver from the FAA to operate the aircraft as a single pilot ( they are available with some additional training . ) In practice , this would almost never occur both for safety reasons and cost . In addition full motion simulators are available for most aircraft type rated for a two person flight crew , so it would just be more feasible to carry out the training in one of these using simulated IMC , which is arguably more realistic and accurate than flying the real thing under the hood .
Spoofing GPS means broadcasting a false GPS signal - This is harder than jamming GPS which can be done relatively easily by broadcasting a strong random signal at the relevent carrier frequencies . GPS receivers use GPS ephemeris tables which tell them where exactly they should expect each satellite to be . So the false GPS signal has to look enough like a real GPS signal that the receiver will accept it and use it 's transmitted data in it 's calculations . Of course , if , for example , the expansionist president of a country with advanced avionics capability decided to supply sophisticated equipment and the associated personnel to a separatist group in a neighbouring country , it might be possible for them to bring about this kind of result . There have been <URL> of this kind of spoofing actually happening , so it appears to be possible . The U of Texas students built a GPS spoofing device for about $ 3,000 . A pair of students , the " attackers , " then sat aboard the upper deck of the White Rose , where their GPS spoofer emitted a counterfeit signal slightly stronger than the real GPS signal . This was a yacht at sea , presumably out of sight of land on a featureless ocean . It may be more difficult to achieve this with an airliner , which have a variety of navigational instruments , including radio navigation beacon receivers . Inconsistent indications may alert the pilot to a problem . Non-GPS navigational instruments/systems that may be found in an aircraft include : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>
Any control surface changes both local camber and local incidence , so it would be best if you change the coefficients accordingly . If you use a panel code , it would be enough to change the local surface inclination ( = the flow direction at the local control point ) by the deflection angle . If you need formulas for the coefficients : A control surface with a cord length fraction d ( of total chord length ) will change the local lift coefficient $ c_l $ with $ $ \ Delta c_l = \ sqrt { d } \ cdot c _ { l \ alpha } \ cdot sin ( \ eta ) , $ $ where $ \ eta $ is the deflection angle in radians and $ c _ { l \ alpha } $ is the lift coefficient gradient over angle of attack of the original airfoil . The additional lift will act at a point between 50 % and 25 % of wing chord . The higher value is for very short flaps , the lower for all-flying surfaces ( technically 100 % flap chord ) , so a control surface deflection will add a torsional load . Drag will not be affected for small deflection angles , but when they get bigger , first drag rises and then the lift increase becomes nonlinear . If you stay in the linear range ( 15 ° with 30 % flap chord , 25 ° with 15 % flap chord at moderate angle of attack ) you can linearly add the flap effect ( offset the coefficients ) . Going beyond that in both deflection angle and angle of attack will need a reduction in flap effectivity which can ( in extreme cases ) even become control reversal . Also note that the aileron especially will twist the wing such that its effectivity is reduced at higher dynamic pressure . The details of this effect depend on the stiffness of the wing . Your example of a NACA 0024 is already so thick that it will not tolerate big flap deflection angles and show separation on the suction side . Good wing thicknesses for subsonic flight are between 12 % and 15 % , and the most extreme ones ( like the root of highly loaded high aspect ratio wings ) will still be below 20 % . Supersonic wing thicknesses are generally between 4 % and 6 % .
You kind of have two questions in one - When can I call Clearance Delivery to get my clearance ? and How long is that clearance good for ? <URL> - the local controllers will usually have your clearance 30 minutes before your scheduled departure . Sometimes you can get this information a little earlier yourself - the new Flight Service tools like <URL> can give you expected clearance and flight plan routing information based on what you filed , if the ATC computer already knows what it 's going to do with your flight . <URL> , and you can do the same thing yourself with the Lockheed-Martin tools with a few more manual steps . You still need to talk to the controllers but if you know what they 're going to say it makes that conversation faster ! The second part can go one of two ways : The point of the " void time " is that the ATC system is reserving a spot in the system for you up until that specific time . After that ATC is going to let other aircraft use the airspace they were holding for you ( they may allow someone to make an instrument approach to the airport you 're leaving from , for example ) . This is used a lot for non-towered fields where you have no local controller to talk to . Clearances from Clearance Delivery at a towered field can include a void time , but they generally do n't because they assume you 're in the plane and ready to go at or around the time you call in , and you have local controllers to talk to if you have a problem during the run-up or something which delays your departure . Basically the clearance is good until someone tells you otherwise in that situation . The tool that gets used at towered fields more often is : You 've been issued a clearance , but you ca n't execute it until the tower has coordinated you a spot in the airspace . This is generally more efficient than reserving airspace with a clearance and void time when there are controllers to talk to , and if everything is working well your release should be ready right around the time you 're ready to take the runway for departure .
In place of pitot-static system No , because it measures different physical quantity . Laser Doppler anemometer measures velocity of the stream ¹ . But pitot-static system does not . Pitot-static system measures <URL> and expresses it as airspeed at which that dynamic pressure would occur at sea level on an <URL> ² . Since lift and control effectiveness depend on dynamic pressure , that is exactly the quantity the pilot needs to see . Laser Doppler anemometer does not provide it , therefore it can not replace pitot-static system . In addition to pitot-static system Anything can be used in addition to what we have . But the question is whether there is a reason to . For flying the aircraft , true airspeed is not needed and for determining the wind speed by comparing true airspeed and ground speed the airspeed can be estimated well enough from indicated airspeed , pressure and temperature . However a laser anemometer has the advantage of being able to measure the wind speed ahead of the aircraft . This could be used for load alleviation ( the system needs to know about the gusts a bit in advance so it can move the control surfaces in advance ) and it could perhaps be used for detecting wind shear , though I am not sure how feasible such anemometer measuring wind speed hundreds of metres ahead is . ¹ A.k.a. true airspeed . ² That quantity is called <URL> . That is intended quantity , but the measurement is subject to various errors . The raw output of the pitot tube is called <URL> and the value corrected for positional errors ( due to the air-stream impacting the pitot tube at an angle ) is called <URL> .
With the set of parameters available to you , you can not do this . If you have the actual track instead of the desired track , you will be able to calculate the wind . The simplest way to do this is using vector math . There are three vectors to consider : ground speed vector $ \ vec { V _ { gs } } $ air speed vector $ \ vec { V _ { as } } $ wind speed vector $ \ vec { V _ { ws } } $ <URL> $ \ vec { V _ { gs } } = \ vec { V _ { as } } + \ vec { V _ { ws } } $ $ \ vec { V _ { ws } } = \ vec { V _ { gs } } - \ vec { V _ { as } } $ I assume the actual track angle ( $ \ phi $ ) and heading ( $ \ psi $ ) are with respect to the true North . The north component of your air speed is then : $ V _ { as } \ cdot \ cos ( \ psi ) $ and the east component of your air speed is : $ V _ { as } \ cdot \ sin ( \ psi ) $ For ground speed the decomposition is : north : $ V _ { gs } \ cdot \ cos ( \ phi ) $ and the east component of your ground speed is : $ V _ { gs } \ cdot \ sin ( \ phi ) $ $ $ \ begin { bmatrix } V _ { ws , north } \ \ V _ { ws , east } \ end { bmatrix } = \ begin { bmatrix } V _ { gs } \ cdot \ cos ( \ phi ) - V _ { as } \ cdot \ cos ( \ psi ) \ \ V _ { gs } \ cdot \ sin ( \ phi ) - V _ { as } \ cdot \ sin ( \ psi ) \ end { bmatrix } $ $ You now have the north and east component of the wind vector . This you can change to a speed and direction , but I leave that last part up to you . Do n't forget that wind direction is usually reported as the direction from which the wind is coming . To find the wind speed from the North and East components use the root of the sum of the squares : $ V _ { ws } = \ sqrt { V _ { ws , north } ^ 2 + V _ { ws , east } ^ 2 } $ The wind direction can be found by $ \ tan ^ { -1 } ( \ frac { V _ { ws , north } } { V _ { ws , east } } ) $ Note that this will give a division by 0 for winds exactly from north or south . To implement it in a computer language the atan2 function can be used . This prevents division by zero and also returns the direction of the full range of the circle instead of semi-circular This should give the direction from which the wind is coming in radians .
I get a variation of the glide ratio with $ \ frac { 2 } { \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } $ for circles flown with a bank angle of $ \ varphi $ when compared to straight flight at the respective best speed for optimum L/D . Your initial assumptions are right : Lift : $ L = c_L \ , \ rho \ , \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ , S \ , n_z $ Load factor : $ n_z = \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } $ with the bank angle $ \ varphi $ Drag : $ D = D_0 + D_i = \ Bigl ( c _ { D0 } + \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ varepsilon } \ Bigr ) \ , \ rho \ , \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ , S$ ( zero-lift drag + induced drag ) , and both are equal at optimum $ L/D $ : $ $ \ Bigl ( \ frac { L } { D } \ Bigr ) _ { \ rm opt } = \ Bigl ( \ frac { c_L } { c_D } \ Bigr ) _ { \ rm opt } = \ frac { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ epsilon } { 2 \ , c_L } \ text { for straight flight at } 1 \ , g \ text { ( $ n_z = 1 $ ) } . $ $ Now with load factor $ n_z = n $ and unchanged speed : $ $ \ frac { L _ { ng } } { D _ { ng } } = \ frac { \ frac { c _ { L _ { 1g } } } { \ cos \ varphi } } { \ frac { c _ { L _ { 1g } } ^ 2 \ bigl ( 1 + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos ^ 2 \ varphi } \ bigr ) } { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ epsilon } } = \ frac { \ pi \ , AR \ , \ varepsilon } { c _ { L _ { 1g } } \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } . $ $ The ratio between both glide ratios is $ \ frac { 2 } { \ bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ bigr ) } $ , which makes sense because it will become 1 for $ \ varphi = 0 $ and become less than 1 for nonzero values of $ \ varphi $ . Note that the glide ratio at n g does n't carry an " opt " subscript anymore , because by increasing $ c_L $ we move away from the optimum . If the best L/D would be maintained for circling flight , speed would need to increase , not lift coefficient . The altitude loss in straight flight of a distance equal to the diameter of a circle with the radius $ R = \ frac { v ^ 2 } { g \ tan \ varphi } $ is $ 2 \ , \ pi \ , R \ , \ frac { D } { L } $ . When flown at the correct bank angle , this altitude loss per circle $ \ Delta h $ will become $ $ \ Delta h = \ frac { \ pi \ , v ^ 2 } { g \ tan \ varphi } \ Bigl ( \ frac { D } { L } \ Bigr ) _ { 1g } \ Bigl ( \ cos \ varphi + \ frac { 1 } { \ cos \ varphi } \ Bigr ) . $ $ Plot of the glide ratio with bank angle divided by the glide ratio for straight flight ( blue line ) . I also added the altitude loss for a full circle ( red line , Basis : $ L/D = 18 $ at 100 $ \ , $ m/s in straight flight ) , both for flight at constant speed and constant lift coefficient : Use the results from this plot with caution at higher bank angles : Lift would need to double at a bank angle of 60 ° , doubling $ c_L $ , so we fly much more slowly than any pilot would .

The gliding slope , which equals $ D/L $ , does not change with weight . Hence , starting from a given height $ h $ , the longest gliding distance will be $ d = h \ cdot max ( L/D ) = h \ cdot max ( C_L / C_D ) $ , i.e. , independent of weight . However , the gliding speed , and , consequently , the gliding time , do change with weight , and significantly . If $ C _ { L , max } $ is the lift coefficient when $ C_L / C_D $ is maximal , the gliding speed at best slope , $ \ bar { V } $ , is obtained from $ W = ( 1/2 ) \ cdot rho \ cdot \ bar { V } ^ 2 \ cdot S _ { ref } \ cdot C _ { L , max } $ .
Well , pretty much anything can be given a US airworthiness certificate provided it 's not literally falling to pieces . You could certificate such an aircraft as a <URL> -- Specifically one of : Experimental -- Research and Development To conduct aircraft operations as a matter of research or to determine if an idea warrants further development . Typical uses for this certificate include new equipment installations , operating techniques , or new uses for aircraft . or Experimental -- Showing compliance with regulations To show compliance to the airworthiness regulations when an applicant has revised the type certificate design data or has applied for a supplemental type certificate or field approval . If your goal is to ultimately get this aircraft a <URL> you would probably want the latter , to allow you to conduct test/certification flights in the modified aircraft . To then get a standard airworthiness certificate things are a bit more murky . You could get a US STC based on the European STC &amp; using this aircraft as the example for conformity inspections and flight testing , but that would require going through <URL> . The other option would be the 337 process , in which case you are also going to need an A&amp;P mechanic ( preferably one with Inspection Authorization ) and the cooperation of your local FSDO to approve the modification as a " major alteration " ( <URL> - Instructions <URL> ) . As you alluded to in your question , something like installing a Rotax engine in a Cessna 150 is a " Major Modification " that has no " FAA Approved Data " ( STC procedure/drawings/etc . ) to include with the 337 , so you would need to submit " Acceptable Data " for your modification ( the European STC is a good starting point ) and work with the FAA to obtain approval for the modification . This is something you would want to talk to the FAA about before purchasing an aircraft with such a modification ( there 's a good chance they may not approve the modification , which would leave you with an unairworthy aircraft , or one restricted to the Experimental category ) .
I do n't think many airline crew actually bother to log the day/night breakdown . At my airline we have different pay rates for day and night flying , so we do care , but the company " Electronic Logbook " tracks the day/night breakdown for us . The system is not 100 % accurate and we sometimes get paid more or less day or night then we actually fly in , but it tends to average out over the year . In the summer , polar routes can be as much as 15 hour flights of daylight , while the same route in the winter can be 15 hours of night flying . On some flights we will see the sun set , and then rise , and set again , as we chase the sun and our route changes from northwest bound to southwest bound . <URL> Here are some samples of summer/winter , day/night Toronto to Hong Kong flying in my eLog : <URL> <URL>
The problem is : Now I want the aircraft to go to balance state to move with constant velocity . So all the four forces should equals to zero thus the lift force should equlas the weight force . How Can I decrease the lift force ? This can be done by simultaneously reducing AoA ( which in-turn reduce CL ) by introducing little down elevator and reducing the engine power accordingly to maintain the airspeed .
They 're called <URL> -- Self Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns . Older systems tended to fire 23 mm shells . Newer systems tend to fire 30 mm shells augmented by short range missiles . They are equipped with radars and high-speed elevation and traverse motors for the turreted guns , so they can react quickly to fast a/c flying low ahead . They 're also useful against attack helicopters , which also hug the ground ( see below ) . These are short range weapon systems , typically only effective under 10,000 ft , the guns at much less than that . They 're still useful even today . Medium and long-range SAM 's have forced a/c to fly low , below their search and fire control radars , but within range of the guns . This was standard NATO doctrine during the late Cold War ------ and gave rise to the F-111 ( for example ) , which was designed to fly fast and low , hugging the bumpy terrain of Central Europe . This would have worked very well had the Soviets not fielded SPAAG 's ( basically modern AAA ) and developed their own MANPADS ( shoulder-fired SAM 's ) . Soviet AWACS and look-down shoot-down radar also contributed to the decline of this tactic . These systems denied the use of low-level airspace so effectively that during Desert Storm , the Coalition air forces basically gave up low-level operations within the first week and switched to bombing from medium altitude exclusively ( above the reach of AAA and MANPADS ) . Not even the A-10 with its titanium armor could long survive in that environment . Afterward , they did occasionally venture below 10,000 ft , but typically with special permission and enthusiastic support . Even after the first week , when Iraqi air defenses were ineffective , few a/c still flew below 10,000 ft because the AAA and MANPADS were too numerous to be eliminated entirely . NATO air forces are getting around this problem by buying stealth fighters , namely the F-35A , which can hide from SAM radars , allowing it to fly at medium/high altitudes , far above MANPADS and AAA . But that 's for another question/answer . Here 's an older Shilka ( Vitaly V. Kuzmin - <URL> ) : <URL> A later Tunguska ( Leonid Dzhepko / Л.П . Джепко ) : <URL> And a modern Pantsir ( Vitaly V. Kuzmin - vitalykuzmin.net ) : <URL> ( All images taken from their respective wikipedia pages . )
Primarily steering is accomplished in two main ways : Steerable nosewheels - Usually limited to tricycle undercarriage , and usually controlled using the same left/right pedals as control the rudder in flight Using the rudder itself - Often associated with the traditional undercarriage ( tail draggers to some ) . In this case the rudder works on the ground in much the same way as it does in the air - ie , deflecting the rudder pushes the tail in the opposite direction , thus causing the nose to pivot in the required direction . In addition , steering can be augmented in two ways Differential braking - often the left and right main undercarriage have their own deferentially controlled brakes . These are usually controlled by " hats " on the top of each rudder pedal . By applying greater braking pressure to , for example , the left wheel will cause the aircraft to pivot more around that wheel causing a left-turning tendency . Differential thrust - in a similar vane to above , greater thrust applied to the left engine will cause a right turning tendency .
You 'll find this info in helicopter performance design literature . The power to drive the rotor ( and a propellor ) can be sub-divided into three parts : useful power , induced power , and profile power . The solidity ratio shows up in the profile power part . Like in aerodynamics , the power/thrust equations are often made dimensionless and evaluated in coefficients . From Helicopter Test and Evaluation by Cooke and Fitzpatrick , section 2.4 : $ C_P = C_T \ left ( \ frac { V_C + v_i } { V_T } \ right ) + \ frac { s \ cdot C_D } { 8 } $ with $ s $ being solidity ratio . So solidity ratio shows up in the profile drag power portion , which makes sense .
As far as I can find , the FAA does n't define the term landing so it could be argued either way . The " typical " <URL> is : 1 : an act or process of one that lands ; especially : a going or bringing to a surface ( as land or shore ) after a voyage or flight That definition does n't say that it has to be " controlled " or that the airplane has to be usable again ! Even if you decide that it was n't a " successful landing " , you could always get your third landing later if you are still allowed to fly , and then carry the passengers . So this brings us to the second part of your question : Are you allowed to fly after an accident ? Since you had an accident ( as defined by <URL> ) you must immediately notify the NTSB of the accident . Once you do that , you have 10 days to file the required report . At this point , you still have a valid pilot license and can legally fly another airplane . Chances are however , that you will be receiving a certified letter from the local FSDO requiring a reexamination in order to keep your license because your competence has been called into question . If you do n't call them to make an appointment , they will start the process to suspend your certificate . During this time , you can also continue to fly because you still have a valid license . The FAA can also use their emergency authority to immediately suspend your license if they feel that it is warranted . This can be appealed to the NTSB board if you feel that it is n't justified , and they have up to five days to respond . At this point you are not allowed to fly pending the response from the board . This , and a lot more information can be found on <URL> .
The torque in a helicopter is generated by the engine driving the main rotor in one direction , which causes the fuselage to spin in the other direction . The tail rotor shaft is horizontally mounted and hence creates it own ' lift ' to provide anti-torque . The pitch of the tail rotor gives directional control . Common ways to design a helicopter without a tail rotor : Tandem rotors : Two main rotors mounted one in front of the other . The rotor discs spin in opposite directions . All power from the engines is used for lift . Example : CH-47 Transverse rotors : Two main rotors mounted side-by-side . Example : Kamov Ka-22 Co-axial rotors : Two rotor discs are mounted one on top of the other . The engine units power both rotors . This structure requires a very complex swashplate mechanism . Example : Kamov Ka-25 Intermeshing rotors : In this main rotor assembly , the two set rotor masts are installed at a slight angle to each other , in a transversely symmetric manner , so that the rotor blades intermesh without colliding with each other . Example : Kaman K-MAX Tip jet : This is an interesting solution to the no-tail-rotor problem . Instead of driving the rotors with a turboshaft engine , compressed air is sent through nozzles installed at the tips of rotor blades . The engines effectively push against the air rather than the helicopter fuselage . The rotor spins just like a Catherine wheel . Example : Hiller Hornet NOTAR : NOTAR - NO TAil Rotor uses a fan inside the boom to build a high volume of low-pressure air , which exits through two slots and creates a boundary layer flow of air along the tailboom utilizing the Coandă effect . The boundary layer changes the direction of airflow around the tailboom , creating thrust opposite the motion imparted to the fuselage by the torque effect of the main rotor . Example : MD-900 Refer to <URL> for more !
Towing is quite feasible , and even landing while in tow is possible - I 've done it myself in gliders . The hard part is catching up with the stricken plane . To stay with Keegan 's Boeing 777 : It most likely will travel at Mach 0.8 and somewhere between 30.000 and 39.000 ft when disaster strikes . Let 's further assume that power fails instantly , so the aircraft , traveling at 240 m/s , will develop a sink rate of 15 m/s just to continue flying . When it sinks , the increasing density allows it to slow down , so at sea level it will fly at 130 m/s , sinking with 8.125 m/s . For simplicity , assume a linearly decreasing sink rate , and the remaining time aloft will be less than 1000 sec or around a quarter of an hour . Now the towplane has 15 min to scramble the crew , run up the engines , get take-off clearance and to actually fly an intercept to the stricken airliner . How realistic is that ? How many airports are needed to have 777-sized towplanes ready , and how many otherwise unproductive 777s would this scheme need ? A car can stop and wait a couple of hours for the tow to reach it . An aircraft can not .
Not in the US . The C162 's <URL> says : The Model 162 Skycatcher is not equipped or certified for IFR flight That means that under <URL> it may not be operated IFR . But , <URL> allows an exception for aircraft not certified for IFR to be operated under IFR in VMC only : A. IFR Training in Visual Meteorological Conditions ( VMC ) . Instrument flight training may be conducted during VMC in any aircraft that meets the equipment requirements of part 91 , § § 91.109 , 91.205 , and , for an airplane operated in controlled airspace under the IFR system , § § 91.411 and 91.413 . An aircraft may be operated on an IFR flight plan under IFR in VMC , provided the PIC is properly certificated to operate the aircraft under IFR . However , if the aircraft is not approved for IFR operations under its type certificate , or if the appropriate instruments and equipment are not installed or are not operative , operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions ( IMC ) are prohibited . The PIC of such an aircraft must cancel the IFR flight plan in use and avoid flight into IMC . An autopilot is n't required for IFR flight in the US ( see <URL> ) and <URL> you linked . I did n't check the full equipment list to see which required instruments are missing from the C162 , but even with full IFR equipment if it is n't certified for IFR then it ca n't be operated in IMC per the regulations above .

If turning off electronic gadgets is so important , why are there no detectors used to find them ?
Three reasons I can think of : It 's easy to detect the general presence of a specific transmitting device ( a WiFi antenna , say ) , but very hard to precisely localize it . They could tell if there 's one on the plane , but someone with a very sensitive piece of equipment would have to walk up and down the aisles pointing it at people to actually find it in somebody 's pocket . And cellphones ( when not in use ) are generally burst transmitters : they do n't broadcast continuously , they just " ping " the tower every so often . This means it could take a long time and a lot of aisle-pacing . Many " electronic devices " which are banned are entirely passive and have no traceable [ * ] emissions . Think cameras , handheld GPS receivers , iPods . ( On the other hand this passiveness also means they are extremely unlikely to harmfully interfere with the operation of the airplane , but right or wrong , such devices are still banned in some cases . ) It 's not that important . There are a few incidents where electronic interference is suspected as a possible factor , but no conclusive evidence . As soon as there is actually a fatal accident where an electronic device can be conclusively blamed as the cause ( and I doubt this will happen ) , the airlines will be a lot more willing to spend the kind of money that would be required to implement this . For a full , evidence-based discussion of the actual risks , I refer you to this question on Skeptics Stack Exchange : <URL> [ * ] No traceable emissions . All electronic devices generate some very , very tiny incidental signals . But these are so weak that they will be virtually impossible to detect on a crowded plane filled with its own ( approved ) electronics . Such emissions are measured in laboratories with extremely sensitive antennas in special , heavily-shielded rooms under carefully controlled conditions .
<URL> In short The longer time required to align an inertial unit is the price to pay for its independency on any external equipment or signal , but Earth itself . A GPS receiver is faster , but is only one small piece in a huge system . The GPS ground segment ( control and monitoring stations ) and space segment ( satellites ) are necessary for the GPS receivers ( user segment in the jargon ) to work . They have multiple possibilities to fail , this critical dependency can not be afforded by an aviation navigation system , GPS must be backed up , and this is done using inertial ( can be INS , IRS , IMU or combined with air data units like ADIRU ) . During inertial alignment the unit accurately senses local vertical and true north ( actually Earth polar axis ) . The problem is that sensing true north requires knowing latitude , and determining latitude requires knowing true north . This is solved using successive approximations of both data -- fortunately this iteration is convergent -- until the desired precision has been achieved . It 's slow because Earth rotation produces tiny effects at small time scale , and we have n't found more practical sensors yet . The effects depends on the distance from the rotation axis , larger at the equator than at the poles . While GPS relies also on very <URL> , they can be easily retrieved by digital signal processing as soon as the random generator algorithm and seed are known . An IRS provides the position like a GPS receiver . IRS also provides the horizontal plane ( attitude reference ) and the north direction which are inaccessible to the GPS alone . This is another reason inertial systems are still used . <URL> Details Gimballed vs strapdown Gimballed inertial systems principle is simple : Accelerometers are maintained oriented with Earth using a gimballed platform , and all measurements are done in the Earth reference system . In strapdown inertial systems , accelerometers and ( laser/optical ) rate gyros are aligned in the aircraft reference system , and measurements are done related to this system . Except this difference , the principles for alignment are quite the same . <URL> Overall principle of a strapdown inertial system , <URL> Old gimballed inertial are longer to align because gimballed gyroscopes are less precise than fixed laser gyros . For the explanations , let 's assume a gimballed stable platform . The alignment consists of getting the Earth orientation and speed , and inertial unit initial position . After alignment , current speed , attitude and heading will be determined by integrating accelerations and rotation rates and adding the result to the initial values . Alignment time vs accuracy obtained Alignment aims to determine two axis : Vertical of the location ( direction of gravity ) and true north azimuth ( parallel to Earth rotation axis ) . For this phase , both accelerometers and gyroscopes are used . While vertical is relatively easy to determine with accelerometers , true north direction direct determination is not possible : True north direction can not be sensed without knowing local latitude , and latitude can not be determined without knowing the direction of true north . The practical way to proceed is : Set an initial value for latitude ( it can be assumed ) , determine approximate north direction . Knowing approximate north , determine approximate latitude . From approximate latitude , refine north direction , etc. . See detailed inertial principle and alignment process in : <URL> . Accuracy of true north bearing increases with alignment time : <URL> Source : <URL> Alignment requires the unit to be motionless , hence any erratic motion decreases inertial signal/noise ratio which slows this process ( passengers boarding , wind acting on the tail surfaces , etc ) . Inertial does n't need external equipment or signal Inertial is a stand alone device , completely independent of any external equipment or man-made signal . It relies only on Earth rotation speed and gravity . That 's why it 's still used for navigation in spite of existing radio aids and GPS ( GPS is actually another radio aid ) . <URL> Today , inertial is mostly used to backup GNSS One may wonder why inertial systems are still used at the GPS era , in spite of their limited accuracy and long alignment procedure . The main reason is that you can not blindly rely on GPS constellation availability . Let 's list some of the possible failures . GPS is the US solution for satellite positioning or <URL> . While defense organizations can obtain credits for different reasons , the difficulty to set up a civilian GNSS has been striking with the numerous delays encountered building <URL> , the European GNSS . It needs to design , launch and maintain the satellite constellation ( more than 20 satellites are required for accuracy and availability ) . The constellation must be permanently monitored and controlled from ground stations all over the World . GNSS signal can be perturbed by natural phenomena : <URL> , weather and volcanic ashes may partially or totally
Why do people have to worry about CG ? Because the manufacturer has designed the aircraft following certain criteria , and one of those is where the CG will be during flight . If the CG is outside that interval , the elevator will not have enough autority to keep level flight . does tipping over of aircraft actually occur these days due to improperly managed CG ? Was not improperly " managed " , but it went out of bounds ( in particular , the aft limit ) , unfortunately , soon after take-off and <URL> .
Let 's say you have two aircraft that will reach the same point in space at the same time , and your job is to keep them three miles apart . One way to do it is to calculate how many knots the second aircraft should reduce their speed so that at the time the first aircraft reaches the point , the second aircraft will have fallen three miles in trail . Unfortunately for you , this means that you have to work a time-speed-distance-wind problem for every single aircraft that you , as a controller , handle . Alternatively , you pick a point three miles away and tell the second aircraft to fly there . Air traffic controllers are human , and humans are better at angles than we are at numbers . The simplest thing for controllers is usually the best thing - they 've got lots on their mind already without making them do math too ! This might change in the NEXTGEN air traffic network ( where everyone has a GPS position and speed readout right there on the screen ) but for now , easy is better than hard .
According to <URL> , it is perfectly acceptable to maintain electronic records for airframe/engine .
It 's been several years since I worked at United 's flight training center , but if my memory serves me , it is there in case the system is receiving input that the pilot wants to exclude . As was explained to me , an example of this would be the other pilot becoming incapacitated , with their body leaning against the sidestick . In this case , one would want to use the Priority Takeover button to eliminate the other pilot 's input . In Captain Sullenberger 's case , it is likely that he wanted to ensure that First Officer Skiles was n't providing any control inputs that would work against his control inputs . Now , it is also my understanding that such functionality is not useful in a " hostile takeover " event , since the other pilot can also attempt a priority takeover ( or use physical force , due to the close proximity of the two pilots ) .
A simple definition of situational awareness that you are aware of the different situation happening around you , know why they are happening and can think of an action you need to take to tackle with those . In aviation , situational awareness <URL> : For a pilot , situational awareness means having a mental picture of the existing inter-relationship of location , flight conditions , configuration and energy state of your aircraft as well as any other factors that could be about to affect its safety such as proximate terrain , obstructions , airspace reservations and weather systems . The potential consequences of inadequate situational awareness include CFIT , loss of control , airspace infringement , loss of separation , or an encounter with wake vortex turbulence , severe air turbulence , heavy icing or unexpectedly strong head winds . As far as your second question , hypothetically speaking , one can say that going through the preflight checklist , pilots are more focused inside the cockpit mostly and the situation outside the airplane is not too much of concern until they pay attention to that . Generally speaking , when the airplane is not moving , situational awareness can be lesser . It is same as when you are driving , at what time you have lesser situational awareness ?
Because it makes you sound cool and very Top Gun ! Negative Ghostrider . The pattern is full Seriously though , short words , especially at the end and beginning of transmissions are often clipped . When everything is busy , a question might only need a " yes/no " reply . Yes/no is easily lost in radio communication . Affirm/negative are not . Also , with English native speakers , yes and no are absolute . In some languages , yes and no are relative to the question . Interpret this : Do n't you have enough fuel to make the field ? Yes , we do n't . or No , we do n't . Of course , the question is not good as it contains a negative but , if a question can only have an " affirmative or negative " response , it also helps the questioner to form a good question : Can you make the field ? This can only be " affirmative ( always shortened to " affirm " to avoid confusion ) or " negative " . There is no interpretation .
For ( modern ) gliders with highly optimized laminar flow <URL> , bugs ( or dirt ) are a non-negligible factor , especially in competition gliding . There are some older laminar airfoils that are notoriously allergic to bugs ( and rain ) , but all are to a certain degree . This is also the reason why any glider pilot worth his or her salt will painstakingly clean their ship each afternoon and before each competition flight . Sufficient bugs will degrade your performance by a noticeable amount - most gliding computers even have a special " bug " factor to include that into glide path calculation ( even though the measuring and correllation of that is quite subjective ) . I ´ ve had a few flights in somewhat biblically bug-infested conditions ( summer , hot , low thermals ) that more or less painted the leading edge black ( like in this picture from an <URL> ) . Bug wipers are quite common on high-end and competition gliders and can be found e.g. at <URL> . Or try to google for " Mückenputzer " . Of course bug wipers are not without drawbacks ( concerning cost , installation , ease of use , drag etc. ) . A friend of mine once stuck a banana peel on his wing and tried to remove that with the wiper , resulting in banana and wiper being stuck in the middle of the wing . It took some creative maneuvers to clear that mess , by which time probably a lifetime aerodynamic benefit of cleaning had been spent . As for the comparison with cars , their <URL> differ in a lot of ways . In comparison to a wing there is no laminar flow to talk of at higher speeds ( most of it is turbulent ) , which drastically reduces the influence of the surface smoothness on the drag produced .
Short answer : ILS is rather sensitive to interference and not all electronic devices take much precaution in avoiding the generation of interference . The pilot wants to be sure that the readings he 's getting on the localizer and glideslope are accurate , since he ca n't actually see the runway to verify the final approach path visually . Longer answer : ILS is actually relatively simplistic as RF signals go . Both the localizer and the glideslope just consist of a pair of AM signals that are broadcast directionally . For both systems , the modulated frequencies are 90 Hz and 150 Hz . For the localizer , 90 Hz is broadcast to the left of the runway centerline and 150 Hz is broadcast to the right of the centerline . When the aircraft is aligned with the runway , it will receive equal strength signals of both frequencies . When it 's to the right , it will receive more power from the 150 Hz signal and when it 's to the left , it will receive more power from the 90 Hz signal . The glideslope works pretty much the same way , just with the 150 Hz signal transmitted below the glide path and the 90 Hz signal transmitted above it . <URL> <URL> Now , suppose some passenger 's electronic device is emitting a frequency that it should n't be . This is not exactly unheard of among consumer electronic devices . This is more common among devices manufactured in countries with less-strict emissions testing requirements/enforcement , but it 's possible due to slight defects in almost any device . [ Source : I design RF receivers for a living . ] Now suppose that this noise happens to be on the localizer or glideslope frequency for the runway to which the aircraft is flying an approach . Hopefully you 're starting to see a problem here ... Whatever amplitude changes are happening on this unintended emission are now being received by the AM demodulator of the localizer or glideslope , potentially confusing it and , in low visibility conditions , causing the aircraft to be directed somewhere other than the runway threshold . <URL> <URL> in order to detect erroneous ILS readings : Crosschecking altitude and DME distance periodically . Crosschecking altitude and flight management system ( FMS ) threshold distance . Crosschecking altitude and the crossing altitude of the outer marker ( or locator , very-high-frequency omnirange [ VOR ] navigation equipment , or FMS ) . Crosschecking radio altitude and barometric altitude . Crosschecking ground speed and rate of descent . Questioning air traffic controllers when indications do not appear to be correct . However , even when following those instructions , slightly erroneous ILS signals may be hard to detect until too late . If a DME is showing that you 're half a mile off , you can probably notice that , but a couple hundred feet off might not be noticeable ( but is still plenty to be a big problem . )

Some deicing fluids can leave a gel-like residue on the airplane . Several incidents occurred with 737s where the residue accumulated in the elevator balance bay , causing severe oscillation/vibration in flight above 270 KIAS . These incidents resulted in the issuance of <URL> , which required adding the 270 KIAS limitation you discovered into the 737 's Airplane Flight Manual ( AFM ) . The required " maintenance procedures " consist of cleaning off the deicing fluid residue . The AD also requires a one-time cleaning and sealing of the elevator balance bay . The FAA has received reports of numerous incidents of severe airframe vibration , or limit cycle oscillation ( LCO ) , in flight after the horizontal stabilizer had been deiced/anti-iced on the ground . The reported incidents occurred on Boeing Model 737-600 , -700 , and -800 series airplanes . The empennage structure on these , as well as Model 737-700C series airplanes , is identical ; therefore , all of these airplanes are subject to the identified unsafe condition . These events have been attributed to an accumulation of deicing/anti-icing fluid or other residue in the elevator balance panel cavities and on the external surfaces of the elevator tab . A <URL> gives some more information and also has some photos showing the residue . Here 's what a gummed-up 737 elevator balance panel looks like : From the article : Airplane deicing and anti-icing fluids can leave residue in critical areas in the wings and stabilizers . This residue can rehydrate and expand into a gel-like material that can freeze during flight and cause restrictions in the flight control systems . Therefore , attention to this residue should be part of a regularly scheduled inspection and cleaning process . ... Although Type III fluids have not been specifically linked to any events involving flight controls , the composition of these fluids makes them equally susceptible to residue problems as the Type II and Type IV fluids .
I think it 's a little bit of both -- for most aircraft , how they behave in a turn is a byproduct of their designed aerodynamic properties . This question is actually quite complex to answer . Let 's assume you 're talking about a simple light aircraft , where control surfaces are mechanically linked to the controls that move them -- this ensures that anything you feel is related to what 's happening to the plane , and not necessarily to anything more complex ( like a fly-by-wire computer , or a hydraulic linkage with some degree of hysteresis ) . Aircraft turns are divided , by the CAA &amp; FAA at least ( see the FAA 's Airplane Flying Handbook , <URL> ) into three main categories : Shallow turns ( roughly speaking , < 20º angle of bank ) . These tend to become shallower if left alone . Medium turns ( roughly speaking , 20º < $ \ theta $ < 45º angle of bank ) . These turns tend to be stable without further pilot input . Steep turns ( $ \ theta > 45 $ º ) . These tend to become steeper if left alone , sometimes dramatically so . Let 's look at these in a bit more detail , with some explanation as to why these effects occur . Shallow turns . These tends to become less steep as the turn progresses , and most aircraft have a natural tendency to decrease the angle of bank throughout the turn . This tendency to lessen the angle of bank arises , I believe , entirely as a designed aerodynamic feature of the aircraft to have lateral stability . As shallow angles of bank are essentially a situation that 's is but a small perturbation about flying straight and level , it 's desirable for the angle of bank to decrease back to zero if left alone . If that is n't the case , the aircraft stability has to be actively maintained by constant manipulation of the control surfaces ( which is tiring or impossible for a human ) . This stability can be achieved through design features , such as ( i ) the dihedral of the aircraft 's wings , ( ii ) their sweep , and ( iii ) their height position -- if high , there is an increased degree of lateral stability due to the centre of mass of the aircraft being below the tilted plane of the wings , and , if disturbed slightly , it experiences a force $ F \ approx mg \ sin \ theta $ to " pull " the wings back upright again . The sole purpose of any degree of wing dihedral -- the angle they make with the horizontal -- is to improve lateral stability . If a perturbation causes one wing to drop , the resultant ( unbalanced ) force will produce a sideslip in the direction of the downward wing . In effect this is analogous to " creating " a flow of air in the opposite direction to the slip . This flow of air will strike the lower wing at a greater angle of attack than it strikes the upper wing . The lower wing will thus receive more lift and the airplane will roll back into its neutral position . Many small aircraft have a slight degree of dihedral on the wings . A similar effect occurs with ( ii ) swept wings -- when a disturbance causes an airplane with swept back wings to slip or drop a wing , the low wing presents its leading edge at an angle that is almost perpendicular to the relative airflow . As a result , the low wing acquires more lift , rises and the airplane is restored to its original attitude . As an aside , you do n't really notice you 're in a shallow turn , aside from the fact that you 're continually applying a little bit of stick and rudder . The $ g $ - loading is minimal . Medium turns . In this case , the aircraft is in a metastable state -- it will carry on at a constant angle of bank , but a ` shove ' to either side will result in the bank increasing or decreasing as appropriate . By this point , $ \ cos \ theta \ neq1 $ , and the outer wing is really generating a lot more lift than the other one -- and thus you 'd effect the angle of bank to increase , as it pulls the aircraft into the circle . The effects discussed above , however , still apply , and provide an effective restoring force back to the normal attitude . In a medium turn , aircraft are designed to have these forces balanced , and , in practice , you often need little-to-no aileron and almost no rudder to do a coordinated medium turn in a light aircraft . If it 's properly trimmed , you can take your hands off the controls and sit there merrily going around in a circle . Depending on your speed , the $ g $ - loading is apparent , but not great . Steep turns . By this point , one wing is generating almost no lift , and the other is generating quite a lot . We 've gone beyond the designed stability point of a medium turn , and the angle of bank tends to increase as the outward wing pulls the plane of the aircraft towards its axis of turn . This type of turn actively requires pilot input to maintain a constant angle of bank , and , depending upon the speed , it can physically be quite hard work . The $ g $ - loading of the wings is significant , and , as the stall speed of an aircraft approximately increases as the square-root of the $ g $ factor experienced , it 's entirely possible to enter an accelerated stall or even a spin here . You notice the
I 'm not an engineer ( which might be better suited to answer this ) so this is from simplified things they feed pilots : Jet engines take much longer to spool up ( i.e. increase RPM ) than piston engines , especially at low RPM because of the pressure ratio/increased airflow necessary to keep the compressor from stalling/surging/blowing up every time when changing power settings . The ( simplified ) jet engine cycle contains a compressor that pushes air into a combustion chamber , where it burns , and then blows out the rear end rotating a turbine that moves the compressor from back where we started at . If you " add more power " ( i.e. put more fuel in ) it takes a while for that extra fuel to produce more thrust , which in turn takes a while to accelerate the turbine , which will make the compressor spin faster , which will finally bring more compressed air into the combustion chamber to utilize all that extra fuel you poured in at step 1 . Adding power all of a sudden will increase the pressure in the combustion chamber , so much that air that is " upstream " ( i.e still in the compressor ) does not want to advance . The extra pressure in the combustion chamber did not have enough time to spool up the turbine , so now the compressor is underpowered to keep " pushing " compressed air into the combustion chamber . Air starts flowing backwards ( i.e. from combustion chamber to compressor ) , engine surges , all hell breaks loose . So there is a lag ( electronically these days , the pilots can floor the trust levers as fast as they like ) when the engines are at low RPM , the FADEC only adds a little bit of extra fuel , waits for the airflow to stabilize , then adds a little more , and so on . I think the graph below might explain this . Every time you change RPM , you will increase Pressure Ratio ( i.e. move up the graph ) , then you wait a little bit for Air Mass Flow to increase ( i.e. move right ) . If you increase the Pressure Ratio too much , without the accompanying mass flow ( which take a while because of inertia ) you will enter the surge line . A similar thing happens on spool down , albeit a gentler one . Compare this with the piston engine where you put more air/gas mixture into the cylinder , it makes for a bigger bang , accelerates the piston faster , and the very next piston cycle you can theoretically get max power .
According to the <URL> , the main reason is search and rescue : b . It is strongly recommended that a flight plan ( for a VFR flight ) be filed with an FAA FSS . This will ensure that you receive VFR Search and Rescue Protection . So the question becomes , does search and rescue have value in populated areas ? I would say that - excluding large cities - populated areas are actually not very densely populated at all ( relatively speaking ) , and there is a very good chance that no one will see your aircraft come down or even react if they do . You might be flying at night , or no one may be looking in the right direction , or they may assume you 're landing at a private strip or doing cropdusting or whatever . And even when an aircraft is known to be down in a specific area , it 's often very hard to find it - especially if you land in trees - so anything you can do to narrow down the search area is important . An AOPA safety video ( I forget which one ) mentioned an incident where a helicopter went down less than a mile from a runway threshold at a class B airport and it still took 24 hours to locate it ( the details may be different , but you get the idea ) .
All studies which so far showed an advantage for blended-wing bodies ( BWB ) were flawed . The trick mostly used is to compare an existing airliner with a hypothetical BWB which uses equally hypothetical engines of improved efficiency , like what could be expected 20 years into the future . This masks the inefficiency of the BWB concept and makes the combination come out ahead . The BWB will always have more surface area than a comparable conventional design . This translates into more friction drag and more skin mass , which more than offsets any advantage given by the bigger wing root ( which helps to reduce wing spar mass ) . If you like real data , use the <URL> as an early BWB and compare it to its contemporaries . Note that design attempts for an airliner based on the Vulcan ( <URL> ) went nowhere . Why are these BWB studies published ? The author gets more attention when he/she claims a " revolutionary breakthrough " than when he/she is more honest and admits that the concept is a dud . Even Boeing or Airbus like to publish BWB studies , so the public gets the impression they are ahead of the competition . It is sickening to read such academically dishonest studies - you need to spend time to dig to the bottom of the thing and to unravel the plot ; however , once you have done this a few times , they all become alike . But compared to studies made 60 or 80 years ago , where the author factually lists what he did and why it did n't work out ( which is the only way you can learn something ) , those modern studies are a waste of time .
The fan section of a turbofan engine is driven by the low pressure ( LP ) spool . This means that it is connected to two parts of the engine : The LP compressor , which must compress the air before it enters the high pressure ( HP ) compressor The LP turbine , which must receive the air after it exits the HP turbine The problem is that the HP section is efficient at high RPM . But the fan will reach aerodynamic limits as the fan tips pass supersonic speed . Fan blades are also harder to contain in the event of a failure as they spin faster . So to accommodate the fan , the LP section has to spin at a slower speed , which makes it harder to match with the high RPM HP section . There is also a limitation on air flow . The fan must be able to move a maximum amount of air , which is takeoff power at sea level . But it must also be able to function efficiently at cruise level , where the flow is faster but much less dense . Engine companies use different strategies to deal with these limitations . GE mainly makes the LP sections larger in diameter . This allows the blades to have a high velocity at lower RPM . This this requires the air flow to change direction more rapidly . Rolls Royce has created a 3 spool design , which allows each section to spin at a more optimal RPM . This adds complexity to the design . Pratt and Whitney is going with the geared fan approach . Similar to turboprops , there is a gearbox to allow the fan to spin at a lower speed than the engine spool that is driving it . This allows the turbine spool to operate at a more optimal RPM while still allowing the fan to spin more slowly . A slower fan can be larger , allowing for a higher bypass ratio . A high bypass ratio allows a turbofan engine to drive more air ( produce more thrust ) for less air going through the core ( burn less fuel ) . Modern large aircraft have engines like the <URL> on the 777 ( 9:1 bypass ) , with the latest engines on the 787 going even higher with the <URL> ( 9.6:1 bypass ) , and <URL> ( 10.8:1 ) . Smaller aircraft like the 737 and A320 currently use engines like the <URL> ( 5.5:1 ) , with the new <URL> going higher ( 9:1 or 11:1 ) . The PW1000G goes even higher ( up to 12:1 ) .
Your interpretation of the answer to that question is a bit wrong . It would be an error to claim that delta wings do n't perform well at low speed . Delta wings perform exceptionally well at low speeds . The correct interpretation is delta wings are not fuel efficient . And this is true at low and high speeds . There are advantages to delta wings at both high and low speeds . The following list are some of the known advantages : Improved handling at high Mach numbers due to swept leading edge ( note : this is the same advantage as swept wings but with the down side of being draggy when performing manoeuvres - swept wing planes retain much more kinetic energy after a turn ) . Intrinsically strong structurally ( it 's a triangle ! ) thus can be built much lighter . Retains quite a lot of rudder effectiveness at low speeds and high angles of attack ( this is unintuitive because you 'd think the wing would block airflow to the rudder but the strong vortex shedding on the leading edge maintains flow around the rudder ) . Have very wide CG range compared to conventional aircraft . This is especially useful in bombers . Have very benign and gentle stall behaviour . This is especially useful for paper airplanes since it can prolong flight at low speeds ( paper airplanes simply dip their noses and regain speed instead of simply diving and crashing ) . The major disadvantage is that it is draggy . Thus not fuel efficient . Thus in a business world where profit and cost matters delta wings are not attractive . For supersonic flights the drag is apparently roughly on par with swept wings . Except , as mentioned above , due to the geometry of the wing it can be built lighter thus save fuel - so it sort of cancels out . For toy planes , where efficiency is not of great concern ( fun and " cool " is more important ) delta wings are OK . Still , if you use the same sheet of paper and built a long , narrow , cambered wing like this : <URL> . . you 'll find that the long narrow winged plane flies much further than the delta wing paper airplane given the same launch speed .
This is for safety reasons . Take-Off and Landing are the two most critical phases of flight and thus , every additional step to ensure survivability , be it even just adjusting the light , is taken . The interior lights or cabin lights are adjusted to match the exterior environment , so that in case of an emergency , especially if the interior lights fail , your eyes are already accustomed to the light setting and you do not require additional valuable seconds for adjustment to a possibly darker or brighter environment . The lights are usually adjusted at dusk , night or dawn to match the exterior environment . <URL> If the cabing lights do not fail during an emergency , the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the " EXIT " signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow . The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed , saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated . This also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows . The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation , however , with a darker cabin , any outside light source , especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew , making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster , e.g. fire on port side -- > no evacation on that side . The blinds are therefore raised to allow a better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts , such as engines , wings , etc. . See also this related question : <URL>
Airbus WILL take off ~ safely ~ regardless of the pitch trim , as long as trim is in the t/o green range . Adjusting the trim to the correct position , however , depending on the location of the CG for that flight , insures the aircraft handles similarly between takeoffs and rotation will be more or less standard between flights . This means the pilot can make the same side-stick input on each takeoff and get the same 3deg/sec rotation . If not properly trimmed , rotation would be faster/slower and the pilot would have to adjust for that at a critical phase of flight . Not doing a good rotation will impact t/o performance significantly .

What are the costs and labour hours for converting a B767 airliner to an aerial refueling aircraft ?
It 's very difficult to answer this question directly , mostly because that the costs you or I would face when undertaking such an endeavour are primarily capital in nature . For a large airline ( or other organisation ) , they 'd have staff and equipment on hand already , and the price an organisation like BA or BAE pay for parts is almost certainly different to the list price . That being said , the deal in question is <URL> . From that source , the taxpayer will be paying around # 10.5 billion for 14 Airbus A330 troop transport/tanker jets with a capital value of only about # 1 billion , although the deal also includes maintenance . Although converted to military specification , the converted passenger jets will not be flying into a war zone any time soon . Interestingly , it appears that the government itself did n't really know the answer to ' how much will this cost ' , even as they were signing the contract to <URL> Specifically , a critical report from the National Audit Office concluded that there was ' poor access to full cost data -- the Department never gained visibility of detailed sub-contractor costs and margins for the aircraft and their modification ' . In other words , nobody knows !
I am sure the raw data can be found somewhere in some document or budget line item but there are a few things to keep in mind . These numbers may only be airframe maintenance preformed . According to <URL> it seems that P&amp;W maintains the engines . <URL> states that the air force must only maintain 50 % of the work in house . Again they may only be counting their hours . The air force ( and all military aircraft ) are subject to their own regulations and intervals and such . Although they must play by FAA rules when flying in airspace their upkeep is to the standards set forth by the owning military body . This may make it hard to compare with general aviation or commercial aviation . Do the required maintenance hours scale with : size , complexity , military/commercial use ? In general yes . A piper cub is going to be simpler to maintain per hour than say an F-16 but as you know things vary . I would say that the hours scale more with complexity than size . Mainly because from a mechanical stand point a more complex engine or aircraft would have more things to disassemble and go wrong and in turn more things to put back together generally increasing maintenance time . Keep in mind this is a very general statement . In terms of military vs commercial use , you will see a lot more maintenance on a military fighter than a commercial plane largely as a result of design . Commercial planes have lots of redundant systems and reliable parts as they are selling safety . Fighters have lots of high performance parts , some redundancy and things that may be made to wear faster in order to preform . Again a general statement but you can get the gist . Do those 20 hours refer to an average over extended operation of the aircraft ? In other words , does this include extended maintenance where the plane might be undergoing days of intensive maintenance , skewing the numbers ? Im going to assume that this is an overall average but it may not be .
When dealing with lightning protection , there are two significant areas that must be addressed : direct effects of lightning and indirect effects . The FAA provides guidance on these two areas in the following advisory circulars : <URL> <URL> The lightning zone analysis from the AC 20-155A will define the test requirements for the airframe and help determine the level of testing for installed equipment based on its location in the aircraft . At the aircraft level it can be a very complex and drawn out process negotiating the specific testing required with the FAA . Once that is done , requirements and verification for the equipment can be developed . A short summary of that process from AC 20-136B is : 6 . Steps for Showing Compliance . a . The following seven steps describe how you may comply with 14 CFR 23.1306 , 25.1316 , 27.1316 , and 29.1316 requirements for your aircraft 's electrical and electronic systems : ( 1 ) Identify the systems to be assessed . ( 2 ) Determine the lightning strike zones for the aircraft . ( 3 ) Establish the aircraft lightning environment for each zone . ( 4 ) Determine the lightning transient environment associated with the systems . ( 5 ) Establish equipment transient design levels ( ETDLs ) and aircraft actual transient levels ( ATLs ) . ( 6 ) Verify compliance to the requirements . ( 7 ) Take corrective measures , if needed . b . The steps above should be performed to address lightning transients induced in electrical and electronic system wiring and equipment , and lightning damage to aircraft external equipment and sensors that are connected to electrical and electronic systems , such as radio antennas and air data probes . Additional guidance on lightning protection against lightning damage for external equipment and sensor installations can be found in SAE ARP 5577 . Testing of individual LRUs is typically under RTCA document <URL> . Section 22 covers Lightning Induced Transient Susceptibility and Section 23 covers Lightning Direct Effects .
The most common vehicle seen is the tug . <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> Tugs are multipurpose tractors that are used to tow around all sorts of things . Several types of equipment are shown in this diagram : <URL> <URL> The tow vehicle at the nose is more commonly referred to as a pushback tug . They come in different sizes . Here is an example : <URL> <URL> The GPU is most often a unit that is towed behind a tug . <URL> <URL> Belt loaders usually can be driven on their own : <URL> <URL> The wide loader is used to put cargo containers in the hold : <URL> <URL> The cabin cleaning truck and galley service truck often have a lift built in : <URL> <URL> Luggage can be brought in baggage carts <URL> <URL> or in cargo containers which are brought to the aircraft on dollies <URL> <URL> Another vehicle often seen is the people mover : <URL> <URL>
Assuming that " flight school hours " means flight time then <URL> suggests yes : 3.6 Logging of Flight Hours gained in the USA Some flight hour recording practices allowable in the USA do not comply with European and UK requirements . In particular : 2 pilots flying together in a single pilot aircraft both claiming P1 hours ; One pilot accompanying another on newsgathering or traffic control flights and claiming P1/PIC when they have not acted as Captain or signed for the aircraft . Flying hours of this nature can not be credited towards the requirements for Part-FCL or UK Licences . The last sentence implies that if hours logged in the US do comply with " European and UK requirements " then they can be credited towards licenses . If you need something more detailed and explicit then it may be easiest to ask the CAA directly .
If the rudder is jammed in the neutral position ( as stated in your question ) , then landing is easy . You will just land using ordinary techniques . The plane may feel sloppy , and passengers sitting at the back will complain about feeling dizzy , but the aircraft is easily controllable and landing would not be any problem . Now things are different when the rudder is jammed to one side , for example in <URL> . The crew faced major controlling issues with a full right rudder , engine failure and very high sink rate . But even then , the pilots managed to land successfully .
I want to set a KPI to measure average hours flown . You might want to check <URL> : ( aviation ) The time from the moment the aircraft door closes at departure of a revenue flight until the moment the aircraft door opens at the arrival gate following its landing . Block hours are the industry-standard measure of aircraft utilization . ( Emphasis mine . ) The Wikipedia article <URL> lists very common terms and KPI 's . One of those terms that could also be applicable to your case ( revenue passenger miles ) was asked about here : <URL>
In the US , taxi time can be logged . <URL> says the pilot must log ( emphasis mine ) : Total flight time or lesson time . And <URL> says ( emphasis mine ) : Flight time means : ( 1 ) Pilot time that commences when an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight and ends when the aircraft comes to rest after landing ; or ( 2 ) For a glider without self-launch capability , pilot time that commences when the glider is towed for the purpose of flight and ends when the glider comes to rest after landing . Note that in reality , general aviation pilots ( I do n't know about airline pilots ) usually just log whatever is on the <URL> , which may include some time sitting still on the ramp doing post-startup checks , setting up avionics etc. . That might not be strictly correct per the regulations , but absolutely no one cares . <URL> is closely related .
For the landing is quite easy . Airliners usually approach an airport descending along $ 3 ^ \ circ $ slopes . This means that they will be 300m AGL approximately 5.7 km before the runway threshold , and they will be at 550m AGL about 10.5 km before the same point . For the take-off the situation is a bit more complicated , as each aircraft will have a different performance . Taking a value of about 1000ft/min for the vertical velocity and 200Kts for the forward velocity ( in aviation we use the imperial system , for a bit of background see <URL> ) we get similar distances to the above ( it is a $ 2.8 ^ \ circ $ slope ) Note that these paths are more or less a straight continuation of the runway , particularly on the landing side ( less so on the take off side ) . Each airport has approach and departure procedures , you could try to have a look at those . They are usually published by Jeppesen .
It will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft , but I will try to give some general estimates . Time on the Ground Part of what you are referring to what is sometimes called <URL> . It 's not really directly related to my calculations for your overall question ( though it is certainly a factor for short-haul jets ) , but in <URL> , minimum turn times for the Boeing 757 was studied , and it was found that the estimated turn time for a 757-200 was 52.5 minutes , based on actual operations . The 757-300 , a stretched model with more seating , would take about 59 minutes . From <URL> , presented by United Airlines , they show a general guideline MSGT ( Minimum Scheduled Ground Time ) , that is a generalization depending on flight locations , field facilities , and airlines . Some times are : Boeing 747 : 80 minutes Boeing 777 : 70 minutes Boeing 767 : 60 minutes ( -300 model ) Boeing 737 : 35 minutes ( -300 model ) Airbus A320 : 40 minutes <URL> has a discussion of a number of airliner turn times , however none are from official sources . Most vary between 20-45 minutes , depending on if cleaning is required . So for a typical airliner we can say it takes about 45 minutes-1 hour for a typical servicing . Aircraft Lifetime Now as to how many times they fly , you can find their aircraft design cycle limit ( essentially , how many takeoffs and landings it can make in its lifetime ) in <URL> ( summarized <URL> ) . Some listed numbers : Boeing 747 : 20,000 cycles Boeing 777 : 40,000 cycles Boeing 767 : 50,000 cycles Airbus A320 : 48,000 cycles ( 60,000 hours ) Airbus A300 : 40,000 cycles So for a ' typical ' airliner we can say it can survive about 40,000 cycles in a lifetime You can find the average age of airliners in different places online . <URL> splits up by airline and aircraft , and most airliners have an average age of 12-15 years . But note that this is the active fleet . The average age at retirement for an airliner is now <URL> . You can find a related Aviation.SE question <URL> Aircraft Usage <URL> discusses the average cycles and flight hours per day . Long haul aircraft ( like the 747 , 777 , A380 ) tend to spend more hours in the air per flight , but also have less cycles per day . I ca n't find official sources , but the thread presents a couple example averages for peak usage rate : Delta Boeing 757 : 9.5 hours/4 .8 cycles United Boeing 747 : 13.2 hours/1 .6 cycles ( I find these probably accurate , as there have been some publicized accidents that have much higher usage , like <URL> , which flew 48,740 hours and 39,781 cycles in 15 years - about 7 flights/day ; short-haul jets like the one in the article end up with more cycles than long-haul , as I noted above ) . It is difficult to find hard numbers , but overall , the average flight length for a short-haul jet is about 2 hours , whereas a long-haul jetliner is around 6-7 hours . Again , there are a lot of variables in this question , but using the above data , we can estimate the answer to your question , using these estimated figures from above : 40,000 cycles ( ~ 20,000 flights ) 25 years 2 hours/flight This means approximately 40,000 flight hours for a typical short-haul jet ; over 25 years ( 219,000 hours ) , this works out to about 1 hour in flight for every 5 on the ground . Obviously this varies widely , but for a ballpark number , that 's the best I can do . The highest usage would be a heavily used long-haul jet used on the longest routes from a busy airline ( i.e. trans-Pacific ; Middle East to U.S. ) , whereas the lowest would be a moderate-length flight on a low-volume route . In general , you are probably looking at about 1:3 to 1:5 air : ground time .
On light aircraft , polycarbonate windshields have been the norm . On higher speed aircraft , glass is used , particularly with heated windshields . Glass is actually a " plastic " but the polycarbonate plastics and glass have very different properties . Polycarbonate tends to be pretty shatter resistant , although I know a turkey vulture which proved otherwise ( grin ) . It really depends upon the type of aircraft and the design criteria , which include the operations , temperature , heat requirements ( ie hot windshield for de ice ) , weight considerations , EMI considerations ( coatings , etc. ) and so on . Both materials have been in sure for a long time . So what kind of aircraft are you talking about ?
No , these losses are well known and are called installation losses . Their reasons are : Intake losses . In a ground test the engine will be fitted with <URL> , but none of the long intake tubes which are common especially in supersonic aircraft . Generator loads : The <URL> to supply the aircraft with electricity . This can be simulated in a ground run , but often the generator load is higher in flight . Bleed air : Some of the compressed air inside the engine is piped to a <URL> for <URL> , or used for leading edge de-icing . Again , this can be simulated in the static test but sometimes bleed air losses are higher in flight . Interference between fuselage and power plant is only to be expected with fuselage-mounted engines . This can be both beneficial ( as in the <URL> and speed on the <URL> ) , or it can distort the flow when side-mounted intakes are operated at a high sideslip angle .
The differences are surprisingly small , and the implications of two versus four engines are not very great as far as design of the wing is concerned . Weight implications The wing is an immensely strong structure - after all , it 's able to bear the weight of the entire aircraft , including of course the engines . Engines are heavy , but only a small fraction of the weight of the whole aircraft . A similar aircraft with four engines rather than two will have smaller engines , so the total weight difference will not be large . Space implications You need more space to fit two engines on each side , but not a vast amount . For example , the <URL> has four remarkably small <URL> engines . What 's more , four small engines can be easier to mount , because they need less ground clearance . Same wings , more engines In practice , it 's not very difficult to add engines to a wing ( for aircraft companies , that is ; I do n't think I 'd be able to do it without seeing someone do it first at least once ) . For example , <URL> - obviously , this engine is just being carried , not used , but it shows that simply placing the engine there does n't present insurmountable aerodynamic or other engineering difficulties . And then we have the Airbus <URL> / <URL> , designed and built in parallel , which are essentially the same aircraft - same fuselage and same wing - one with two engines and one with four . ( Actually the -500 and -600 A340 variants do have slightly longer wings , but that 's because they are heavier , and nothing to do with the additional engines . ) That 's not to say that there are no implications in having additional engines . In this case , wing flutter caused by the outboard engines of the A340 required some stiffening . And of course , additional engines will require additional fuel and control lines . However , these are n't part of the structure of the wing itself , and are not in themselves likely to have implications for it .
To start you off there 's these two : <URL> - Certification of Airports and <URL> - Notice of Construction , Alteration , Activation and Deactivation of Airports . Part 139.311 covers all the lighting related requirements . Part 157 is there just so you can inform the FAA about the changes you 're going to make in the airport . for specifics about LED lights , I would suggest looking for Advisory Circulars with LED lighting for airports in particular .
I do n't know if it is official , but across Europe , Middle East , Asia , and north Africa I hear using " turnpad " , and many ATC in these regions provide directions like " bactrack via turnpad and continue taxi via taxiway A " , that means go ahead to turnpad bactrack and vacate runway via taxiway A.
The flying boom method uses a rigid boom which is " flown " by an operator in coordination with the pilot in order to make a connection with a receptacle on the second aircraft . The boom is retracted when not in use . Though <URL> if it comes in contact with an aircraft , <URL> . The probe and drogue method uses a trailing hose with a basket on the end . Pilots will guide a probe on their aircraft into the basket to connect with the hose . The hoses are retracted when not in use . Though the crew has less control of the drogue , which <URL> , there is less danger to the aircraft than from a boom , and it could allow the aircraft to stay further away from the tanker . The boom method was developed early on in the Cold War , when <URL> . They needed a method that would transfer fuel as fast as possible in order to reduce the time it took to transfer the large amounts of fuel needed . Because the boom is rigid , it is capable of a higher transfer rate . The importance of bombers meant that SAC got their way , and the KC-135 fleet was equipped with booms . Today , almost all US Air Force planes capable of aerial refueling use the boom system . The US Navy on the other hand , along with most aircraft in other countries , uses the drogue system . Though this method is not capable of the high transfer rates of a boom , it is much more flexible . A refueling aircraft may only be fitted with one boom , and this requires extra design work and integration with the fuselage . The drogue system , on the other hand , is more simple , and does not need a dedicated operator . This means that it can be more easily fitted to the refueling aircraft , even <URL> , and larger aircraft can have multiple drogues . Another point is that smaller aircraft such as fighters are not capable of receiving fuel at the full rate the boom provides , so they have less benefit from the system . Although a boom can have a <URL> , this still commits the tanker to one aircraft at a time and one type of system per flight . Also , aircraft such as helicopters <URL> . When the Air Force was looking at a replacement for its tanker fleet in the early 2000s , a <URL> to determine what standard the new tanker should support . The report suggests some options for the best combination of methods . In the end , the Air Force selected the <URL> for the contract , which will include both the boom and the drogue options for refueling . This will provide better support to aircraft from other branches or countries , while maintaining support of the existing aircraft that use a boom .
Where can the requirements for US aircraft registration be found ? The registration procedure is outlined in <URL> . See also the <URL> . 3 . The owner of an aircraft must apply to the Aircraft Registration Branch , P.O. Box 25504 , Oklahoma City , Oklahoma 73125-0504 , to obtain a certificate of registration . The applicant must submit an Aircraft Registration Application , AC Form 8050-1 , accompanied by evidence of ownership and a $ 5 registration fee . Requirements for registration of aircraft are contained in the <URL> ( For sale by the Superintendent of Documents , U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , DC 20402 . ) Basically , the registrant ( whether an individual or a corporation , trustee , etc. , all of which are defined in Part 47 ) must be able to prove legal ownership of the airplane . What is the penalty for flying an aircraft without a valid registration ? The violator would be subject to any of the <URL> : administrative action ( a " Warning Notice " or " Letter of Correction " which goes on your record ) , reexamination ( " 709 ride " ) , certification action ( suspension or revocation ) , or civil/criminal penalties . The exact penalty would likely depend on the circumstances : whether the violation was intentional and the degree of the pilot 's negligence under the FARs . What should someone do if they believe an aircraft to be operating without valid registration , and how could they determine this ? The <URL> reporting FAR violations by calling the FAA 's toll-free telephone number , 1-866-TELL-FAA .
<URL> notes that medical oxygen containers - whether for the storage , generation , or dispensing of oxygen - must be : 135.91 . a. 1 . i Of an approved type or in conformity with the manufacturing , packaging , marking , labeling , and maintenance requirements of title 49 CFR parts 171 , 172 , and 173 , except § 173.24 ( a ) ( 1 ) 135.91 . a. 1 . ii When owned by the certificate holder , maintained under the certificate holder 's approved maintenance program ; 135.91 . a. 1 . iii Free of flammable contaminants on all exterior surfaces ; and 135.91 . a. 1 . iv Appropriately secured . 135.91 . a. 2 When the oxygen is stored in the form of a liquid , the equipment must have been under the certificate holder 's approved maintenance program since its purchase new or since the storage container was last purged . 135.91.a.3.i-ii When the oxygen is stored in the form of a compressed gas as defined in title 49 CFR 173.300 ( a ) When owned by the certificate holder , it must be maintained under its approved maintenance program ; and The pressure in any oxygen cylinder must not exceed the rated cylinder pressure . 135.91 . a. 4 The pilot in command must be advised when the equipment is on board , and when it is intended to be used . 135.91 . a. 5 The equipment must be stowed , and each person using the equipment must be seated , so as not to restrict access to or use of any required emergency or regular exit , or of the aisle in the passenger compartment . 135.91 . b No person may smoke and no certificate holder may allow any person to smoke within 10 feet of oxygen storage and dispensing equipment carried under paragraph ( a ) of this section . 135.91.c No certificate holder may allow any person other than a person trained in the use of medical oxygen equipment to connect or disconnect oxygen bottles or any other ancillary component while any passenger is aboard the aircraft 135.91 . d Paragraph ( a ) ( 1 ) ( i ) of this section does not apply when that equipment is furnished by a professional or medical emergency service for use on board an aircraft in a medical emergency when no other practical means of transportation ( including any other properly equipped certificate holder ) is reasonably available and the person carried under the medical emergency is accompanied by a person trained in the use of medical oxygen . Part 91 does not seem to speak to medical oxygen Additionally , a <URL> notes that : In the DOT final rule , section 382.133 generally requires that air carriers conducting passenger service must permit someone with a disability to use an FAA-approved portable oxygen concentrator ( POC ) on all flights ( on aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 19 seats ) unless the device does not meet applicable FAA requirements for medical portable electronic devices ( M-PED ) and does not display a manufacturer 's label that indicates the device meets those FAA requirements . The page goes on to list approved oxygen containers . So , it seems that the FAA does not consider POCs to be hazardous , so long as they meet certain FAA approval standards . ( If you are asking about General Aviation requirements , I would assume an FAA-certified POC is okay to bring on a GA flight as well )
It 's tough to tell based on your question , but I think you are talking about an inspection due to an over-G reported on a flight either by the pilot or the flight control system post-flight report . Maintainers will do inspections of known stress points on the aircraft to look for breaks , cracking or loosened parts and then declare it safe for flight or fix anything out of tolerance . For a low level over-G , this could be pulling a few panels . For higher level over-Gs it could be 8 hours worth of work
It would chop it <URL> . Watch the video . It 's fun . When the helicopter pitches up right after refueling , the rotor disc can not follow the movement ( its hinges allow the blades to pitch up and down , and inertia makes it change its plane of rotation only slowly ) . The refueling probe is cut cleanly in half . However , I would not try this on purpose . The risk of damaging a blade is considerable . I am sure the rotor blades needed to be replaced after that incident .

What are the major non-pilot causes of GA accidents ?
For a statistical overview of General Aviation accidents I suggest checking out the <URL> prepared by the AOPA Air Safety Institute . Everything I 'm citing below comes from the most recent report ( the 23rd report , covering 2011 ) . The leading causes of accidents in 2011 were : Pilot Error - About 77 % This includes poor flight planning , weather encounters , and a host of other things that we could at least theoretically avoid if we actually did the things we were taught to do in training . Mechanical or Maintenance related - About 13 % This includes engine failures , control system problems , landing gear failures , etc. . The largest chunk of mechanical failures are " powerplant failures " , which account for 38 % of the mechanical failures , or a bit under 5 % of total accidents . Everything Else - About 10 % This includes freak occurrences like a flight instructor " walking into a moving propeller " ( I kid you not , it 's in the report ! ) . A large chunk of these are also engine failure for causes that could not be determined . If we add all the engine/powerplant failures together ( the explainable ones from " Mechanical " plus the unexplained ones from " Everything Else " ) they come out to be 11.5 % of total accidents , and are statistically the number two cause of Non-Commercial General Aviation accidents after " Pilot Error " .
Generally speaking1 , when an aircraft is allowed/ready to leave ( deliberately not using the word depart ) the gate , things proceed in the following fashion : The pilots are in contact with <URL> , and when the aircraft is ready to leave , Ground approves that they can leave the gate . The pilots asks <URL> that the <URL> can start . Pilots are in contact with a designated personal from groundcrew ( see picture below ) . Pushback tractor/tug will start moving the aircraft away from gates , onto the place where aircraft will be ready to move on its own . During the pushback , aircraft 's engines are started2 . Pilots inform tug driver/designated person from groundcrew which direction the aircraft needs to be facing at the conclusion of pushback . When aircraft is ready to roll towards its assigned taxi instructions , <URL> signals the pilots that aircraft is in the requested position and pushback tug is about to be detached . After the tug is disconnected , the designated groundcrew personal communicating with pilots , informs the pilots and disconnects his headset . The marshaller signals ( after moving away from the aircraft ) the pilots that the aircraft is ready to proceed on its taxi route . Pilots confirm and acknowledge this last signal , and aircraft starts to taxi . I have <URL> for the above mentioned activities . Although , I have always seen that a person from groundcrew attaches a headset near the nose gear of the aircraft ( picture below ) to communicate with the pilot . <URL> <URL> Please see the cable connecting the headset with the aircraft , near the nose gear . You can not follow the entire cable though . 1 : This is what a typical scenario looks like . Although , there can be great variations . 2 : Engines are not started near the gate as there is groundcrew servicing the airplane and to avoid damages to close-by structures .
Often the overspeed is caused by the airflow forcing the propeller to move faster . It 's like braking on the engine while going down a steep hill , even without touching the gas pedal you may speed up and redline the engine . Very problematic if you already overheated your brakes in a 18 wheeler . If you have a variable pitch prop you can feather it to reduce the effect of the airflow . Or just follow the procedures in the overspeed checklist for the aircraft .
Lead lag is caused by the blades speeding up and slowing down as they flap up and down . The blade on the advancing side experiences an airflow equal to it 's speed plus the forward speed of the helicopter . The blade on the retreating side experiences airflow equal to the speed of the blade minus the forward speed of the helicopter . This causes <URL> . To counter this , the blades can flap up and down around the flapping hinges . The blade on the advancing side flaps up , reducing the angle of attack and therefore the lift generated . The blade on the retreating side flaps down , increasing the angle of attack and therefore increasing lift . See this video at around 1:30 to see <URL> . This is a gyrocopter , but you can <URL> at 0:39 and 1:17 . Due to <URL> , the blade flapping up speeds up as it 's centre of gravity moves inwards toward the rotor hub . Since the rotor is turning at a constant speed , the blade must move forward around the lead/lag hinge . In a similar way , the blade flapping down slows down so lags . The blades will hunt forward and backwards from the neutral position in a sine wave as the rotor rotates . Lead/lag dampers reduce the force of this hunting . A variation of flapping hinges ( independent hinges for each blade ) is a teetering hinge on 2 blade helicopters where the hinge is connected to each blade . If one blade rises , the other must fall and vice-versa . The entire rotor disc " teeters " on top of the drive shaft . This is known as a <URL> and as far as I know , is used on all 2 blade helicopters . In semi-rigid and rigid heads , the overall effect of the blades speeding up and slowing down cancels out in the complete cycle of rotation and other mechanisms are used to reduce the hunting loads . Imagine a 4 blade rigid rotor . 2 blades are trying to speed up the rotor and 2 are trying to slow it down in equal amounts . One serious side effect of lead/lag on fully articulated heads is <URL> . Since the blades can move forwards and backwards , it is possible for the blades to get closer together on one side than on the other , especially when the helicopter lands with a roll angle , so one gear hits the ground first . This shifts the centre of balance away from the centre of rotation which can induce a wobble of the rotor head , which translates into a vertical " bounce " vibration at the landing gear . If conditions are right ( or wrong , depending on your view point ) , the resonance can be amplified by the natural resonance frequency of the helicopters landing gear and can lead , if allowed to continue , to the <URL> . If you think that helicopter blades are quite rigid , <URL> .
According to the <URL> , The air plane can structurally accommodate pilots or passengers weighing up to 250 lbs . Of course , this is subject to the maximum allowable takeoff weight . The manual also gives the forward and aft cg limits ( in page 30 ) . In case of very light pilots , the aft cg limit may be exceeded and it may be required to carry ballast for bringing the cg within limits .
There are different types of Krueger flaps used , with increased efficiency coming at the cost of increased complexity . The simple ones are basically flat panels that folds out from the wing lower surface into a very steep , deployed position and seals against the wing leading edge ; though these are extremely simple , they do n't offer much in the way of stall protection . The next type has large folding ' bull ' nose that offers increased performance at the cost of slightly increased complexity . This type of flaps is used in B727 , B737 , and inboard of B747 , as shown in the figure below : <URL> By Arpingstone - Photographed by Adrian Pingstone in August 2002 and released to the public domain. , Public Domain , <URL> The most complex type of Krueger flaps are the variable camber type , which has a flexible panel ( which forms a slot at the trailing edge ) and a bull nose . This provides a better $ C _ { L _ { max } } $ performance compared to a slat , but gives poorer takeoff L/D performance compared to the slat . However , the main problem is that the mechanism is exceptionally complex , as can be seen in the figure below . As a result not many aircraft use these . <URL> Image from <URL> This means that simpler Krueger flaps are used in the inboard with slats in the outboard region , so that the flow remains attached in the outboard regions at higher angles of attack compared to the inboard region .
Check out AIM 1-1-9 for localizer information . Basically , the localizer is positioned so to have a course width of 700 ' at the threshold . So full deflection to either side is 350 ' . A CDI has 5 dots on each side , so at the threshold each dot is 70 ' . Near the Middle Marker , one dot means you 're off course by 150 ft. Near the Outer Marker , a one-dot deviation puts you about 500 ft. from the centerline . GPS ( non-WAAS ) approaches have a constant full scale deflection of .3 NM after the final approach fix . AIM 1 − 1 − 17 5 ( e ) ( 5 ) When within 2 NM of the Final Approach Waypoint ( FAWP ) with the approach mode armed , the approach mode will switch to active , which results in RAIM and CDI changing to approach sensitivity . Beginning 2 NM prior to the FAWP , the full scale CDI sensitivity will smoothly change from ± 1 NM to ± 0.3 NM at the FAWP . As sensitivity changes from ± 1 NM to ± 0.3 NM approaching the FAWP , ... WAAS on the other hand is similar to the localizer . AIM 1-1-18 ( d ) 4 Both lateral and vertical scaling for the LNAV/VNAV and LPV approach procedures are different than the linear scaling of basic GPS . When the complete published procedure is flown , ± 1 NM linear scaling is provided until two ( 2 ) NM prior to the FAF , where the sensitivity increases to be similar to the angular scaling of an ILS . There are two differ - ences in the WAAS scaling and ILS : 1 ) on long final approach segments , the initial scaling will be ± 0.3 NM to achieve equivalent performance to GPS ( and better than ILS , which is less sensitive far from the runway ) ; 2 ) close to the runway threshold , the scaling changes to linear instead of continuing to become more sensitive . The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold . Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer , the splay angle can remain fixed , making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways . When the complete published procedure is not flown , and instead the aircraft needs to capture the extended final approach course similar to ILS , the vector to final ( VTF ) mode is used . Under VTF , the scaling is linear at ± 1 NM until the point where the ILS angular splay reaches a width of ± 1 NM regardless of the distance from the FAWP .
As you 've guessed , there are two options : a ferry flight , or shipping the aircraft in a container . Ferry flights are quite common ; the recent <URL> in the Pacific was a ferry flight to Hawaii . As well as planning a suitable route and dealing with permits and paperwork , refueling etc. , the ferry company may install <URL> to give more range , and provide the pilot with specialized survival and communications gear . And an airline ticket home , of course :-) This might all seem expensive , but considering that a new top-of-the-range Cirrus SR22 has a <URL> of almost USD 800,000 you can imagine that ferry costs are n't necessarily a big deal in comparison . The second option is to put the aircraft in a container and ship it , and there are <URL> who specialize in this ( the page has some small photos of aircraft in containers ) . The major concern in this case is removing the wings : gliders and many experimental ( e.g. home-built ) aircraft are designed to have their wings removed for storage and transportation ( towing behind your car ) but most typical Cessnas , Beechcraft etc. are n't . You need to have the aircraft professionally and carefully prepared and then re-assembled and checked after delivery . Which option is best depends on the costs of each option and the value of the aircraft . There 's also the consideration that if you buy a 60-year old aircraft from the other side of the world , ferry companies may decline to fly it to you because of the risks of subjecting it to the stresses and weather of a very long series of flights . Or their/your insurance company may refuse cover for a ferry flight for the same reason . Or perhaps the aircraft is certified for VFR only , which would make a long ferry journey much more difficult to plan and execute . In those cases , container shipping may be the only available option .
Unless the pilot has had their certificate revoked or suspended by the FAA for their medical condition or has failed an application for a medical certificate1 , they would probably be fine after seeing a physician . <URL> states that sport pilots using a driver 's license to satisfy medical requirements must : ( ii ) Have been found eligible for the issuance of at least a third-class airman medical certificate at the time of his or her most recent application ( if the person has applied for a medical certificate ) ; ( iii ) Not have had his or her most recently issued medical certificate ( if the person has held a medical certificate ) suspended or revoked or most recent Authorization for a Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate withdrawn ; and ( iv ) Not know or have reason to know of any medical condition that would make that person unable to operate a light-sport aircraft in a safe manner . If the holder has a valid US driver 's license , it would ( presumably ) be taken upon the certificate holder to have " reason to know " by virtue of having a checkup with a physician to check that this condition does not affect their ability to fly safely , especially if the person involved was in any sort of doubt as to their medical condition . However , if they have had a checkup with a physician that finds no particular issues , and that condition does not affect the validity of their driver 's license , they should be fine . 1 : By section ( ii ) , the pilot must still have a medical test and pass for at least a Class 3 medical certificate , if the FAA has revoked or found unsatisfactory their previous medical under a Class 1 or Class 2 certificate .
There are contingency measures for PF incapacitation when PNF is absent from the cockpit . This includes measures for cockpit decompression ( e.g. window breaking ) These measures are balanced with measures to prevent unauthorised passengers forcing entry to the cockpit , including by using force on cabin crew ( or PNF ) to make them open the cockpit door . Some of these measures are at the airline 's discretion . Cockpit door locks According to <URL> A locked door is opened by a flight crew inside the cockpit but can also be unlocked by cabin crew entering a keycode from the outside . Crew inside the cockpit can manually override it to keep a door locked for up to five minutes . " In the case of an electrical supply failure the door is automatically unlocked , but remains closed , " reads the manual . It is equipped with a manual escape hatch but that is only accessible from the inside . According to <URL> safety protocols mandated by Congress in the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks ... eliminate the use of keys for entering the cockpit - assuring that no errant passenger can wrestle a key away from a crew member . ... If a member of the flight crew does n't open the locked cockpit door from the inside , according to a manual for the Airbus A320 <URL> , the door can also be unlocked by the cabin crew outside the cockpit by entering a two - to seven-digit code , pre-programmed by the airline , on a keypad . Cockpit occupancy Guardian : Protocols and standard procedures around what happens when a pilot leaves the cockpit mid-flight vary according to country and airline . A flight attendant taking the seat of an absent pilot to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit , and/or blocking access to the open door with a trolley , are often seen on US flights , but not necessarily on others , [ Aviation expert Neil Handsford ] said . For instance it is not a requirement on Australian flights . LA Times : American experts say the typical procedure is for a flight attendant to use a food cart to block access to the cockpit when the pilot opens the door to leave . A flight attendant is supposed to remain in the cockpit and open the door for the pilot upon his or her return . ... Airbus Manual The Airbus manual referred to above says The Cockpit Door Locking System ( CDLS ) provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door . This system is mainly composed of : A keypad , located in the forward cabin , near the cockpit door , A toggle switch , located in the center pedestal 's Cockpit Door panel , A control unit and its CKPT DOOR CONT normal panel , located on the overhead panel , A buzzer . The keypad enables the cabin crew to request access to the cockpit . There are two different access request types : " Routine " and " Emergency " access request ( Refer to PRO-SUP-25 Cockpit Door Operation - General ) . The toggle switch enables the flight crew to lock or unlock the cockpit door , following an access request , thereby allowing or denying the entry to the cockpit . The cockpit door control unit is the system controller , in charge of : Locking or unlocking the door latches , upon flight crew action . Unlocking the door , in case of cockpit decompression ( the door then opens towards the cockpit under differential pressure ) . Indicating system failures of electrical latches and pressure sensors . Activating the access request buzzer and turning on the keypad LEDs . The buzzer sounds in the cockpit for 1 to 9 s to indicate that a routine access request has been made , or sounds continuously if an emergency access procedure has been initiated . The keypad is used to sound the buzzer in the cockpit for 1 to 9 s ( 3 s by default ) , by entering a zero to seven-digit code , as programmed by the airline , followed by the ' # ' key . It is also used to enter the two to seven-digit emergency code , followed by the ' # ' key , when the flight crew does not respond . There is also an <URL> that shows how the cockpit door lock operates normally and in the case of pilot incapacitation Abbreviations PF = Pilot flying , PNF = Pilot not flying .
The AOPA 's <URL> has quite a few resources that I like to review from time to time , including some great videos with commentary on exceptional cases . <URL> <URL> <URL> I do exactly what you are doing , during training and still after , but I 'd like to also say that you should n't narrow yourself to GA crashes , a lot of what happens commercially can be applied to GA , and usually with commercial accidents there is a lot more data and analysis available to work with . In that regard , I like to watch shows on Youtube like <URL> , or on TV like <URL> <URL> on individual crashes where you can search by certain criteria like aircraft type , states , type of flight , or even some specific keywords like " Vacuum Failure " . Just do n't limit yourself to looking at things like " Pilot Error " , pilot error is a broad category of crashes that is usually used to describe the pilot doing something wrong in the air , but a lot of crashes are " pilot error " in that the pilot could have broke the accident chain much earlier in the flight . Read as many as you can , regardless of the cause . For example an accident where the aircraft breaks up in flight may not be attributed to pilot error , but its good to know what lead to the break up and what could have been prevented .
The main benefit of biplanes is that the lift can be distributed across both wings . This provides more lift with less wingspan and places less load on each wing . Less load means the materials can have lower strength . This was very important in the early days of aviation , when engine power , materials , and weight were much more limited . The major downside of a biplane is aerodynamics . The wings interfere with each other , causing drag . While structural bracing between the wings can reduce weight , it also adds more drag . <URL> A biplane configuration does not make much sense for delta wings . The main drawback of a biplane is drag , but drag increases with the square of velocity , and delta wings are best in high-speed flight . <URL> , they have higher viscous drag due to the large surface area . A second delta wing will add more area , increasing both wave drag ( from the cross section ) and viscous drag ( from the surface ) . Configuration of the aircraft also becomes problematic . Most aircraft with delta wings tend to be fairly flat , allowing lower area and therefore lower drag . The closer the wings are , the more they will interfere . The further apart they are , the more structure is needed , either in a larger fuselage or in structural braces , which increases weight and drag .
All altimeters are " sensitive " to some extent ( an " insensitive " altimeter would be one where the internal pressure-sensing mechanism has failed : the pointer would n't ever move ) . What the FAA calls a " sensitive altimeter " is simply more sensitive than a regular ( now often called non-sensitive ) one : Non-Sensitive altimeters have a 1000-foot scale ( 200-foot tick marks ) as their most precise display . Sensitive altimeters have a 100-foot scale ( 20-foot tick marks ) as their most precise display . The sensitive altimeter in " glass cockpit " displays go even further , often having 1-foot resolution on a digital read-out . Let 's look at some ( analog ) examples : Non-Sensitive Altimeter , not adjustable for barometric pressure <URL> This altimeter is similar to what you 'd find on an old Piper Cub : The scale is marked in thousands of feet , with ticks every 200 feet . This altimeter is not adjustable for " barometric pressure " , but it is adjustable : The little knob on the bottom rotates the face of the altimeter . Put field elevation under the needle before you take off and it should be a reasonable approximation of your current altitude for the duration &amp; distance of a typical Piper Cub flight . These altimeters can only be " set " on the ground , because you need to know your elevation to set the position of the face or needle . Non-Sensitive Altimeter , adjustable for barometric pressure <URL> These show up from time to time : It 's a non-sensitive altimeter ( same scale markings we saw above ) , but it 's adjustable for barometric pressure . The Kollsman window on this one is marked in inches of mercury . When you turn the knob on this altimeter the needle moves and the barometric pressure that corresponds to " zero feet " shows up in the Kollsman window . This makes it easier to read than the previous example , and easier to reset in flight based on radio information : You can set the local barometric pressure ( QNH ) in the Kollsman window and get your current altitude without having to be on the ground at a known elevation . Sensitive altimeter , not adjustable for barometric pressure <URL> In this sensitive altimeter you can see that there is a 100 foot scale ( large pointer ) , and a 1000-foot scale ( small pointer ) . This is a bit of an unusual example : It 's a sensitive altimeter that is NOT adjustable for barometric pressure ( the knob simply adjusts the position of the pointers , and you set it to field elevation like you would with our first example . It ca n't be easily reset in flight as you need to know your current altitude to reset the altimeter correctly . Sensitive Altimeter , adjustable for barometric pressure <URL> This the altimeter most pilots are used to seeing in a " steam gauge " panel : It is a sensitive altimeter ( note the 100-foot scale pointer ) , and it is adjustable for barometric pressure ( note the Kollsman window , marked in millibars in this example ) . This is the type of altimeter required for IFR flight . This one happens to include 3 pointers ( 100-foot , 1,000-foot , and 10,000 foot ) , because it 's calibrated to 20,000 feet . As with most aviation products there is a Technical Standard Order ( TSO ) behind altimeters which would get into all the specific details of the differences . For sensitive altimeters it 's TSO C10 ( I believe C10b is current ) . I 'm not sure if there 's one for a non-sensitive altimeter .
Qualification : I worked at a busy drop zone for 10 years . Just announce yourself on the airfield frequency about 5-10 minutes out and they 'll tell you what 's going on , including which runway is active and how high they are jumping from - standard altitudes are 3000ft and 12,000 ft AGL . At our place it was really simple : left-hand for 34 , right-hand for 16 . We landed everyone on the east side , and if we are dropping at 3000 all day you can just pop up to 4000 and be completely out of the way . Under no circumstances make a cross-field pass as that 's usually right in the middle of everyone else 's landing pattern , and we do n't carry radios . If you are just passing by a 2km buffer is lots - no one is likely to be in the air that far away . No reply usually means nothing in the air .
<URL> The probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew 's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach , including the published missed approach procedure , which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain . <URL> According to released information this cargo aircraft overran the runway after the crew aborted the take-off above Vr after experiencing pitch control problems . The final report of this accident is not yet published but a preliminary report is available . The investigation focusses on the payload distribution which may have caused imbalance leading to the perceived control problems . <URL> The aircraft crashed on final approach in low visibility conditions ( 800 meters ) . During the initial approach the crew had requested and ILS approach ( precision approach ) to runway 02 but then changed their minds and asked for a VOR approach ( non-precision approach ) to runway 20 . During the approach , after deactivation of the autopilot , the aircraft deviated 340 meters to the left and the crew subsequently announced they were going around . Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit tree tops and impacted residential buildings . The final report is expected in October 2015 . To me it seems the probable cause is the failure of the flight crew to properly execute the published instrument approach including the published missed approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft impacting the trees and buildings . <URL> The investigation into this accident is still running , only some preliminary information has been published . Preliminary data indicates that about 36 seconds after takeoff the engine no. 2 auto-feathered , about 46 seconds subsequent to auto-feather the engine no. 1 was shut off by the crew , resulting in loss of all thrust . The aircraft subsequently descended , stalled and crashed into a river . ATR-42 , 16 August 2015 , Trigana Air Service Flight 257 This accident occurred just a couple of days ago so there are few facts known yet and no preliminary findings are published . I will not speculate about the probable cause of this accident . The common thread in the first four accidents seems to be the failure to comply with established procedures resulting in the loss of the aircraft . In two cases ( Lao Airlines Flight 301 and TransAsia Airways Flight 222 ) the flight crew flew a controllable aircraft into the ground . In the case of the Air Niugini crash improper loading of the aircraft is likely to be the cause , resulting in the aircraft being not trimmed correctly for take-off . The crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 235 is the only crash that involved an aircraft system malfunction ( engine 2 failure ) . However , the ATR-72 can fly on a single engine so the failure itself should not have been fatal . The crew then shut down the other engine ( number 1 ) which sealed the aircraft 's fate . It is too early to conclude that the crew did n't follow the correct procedures here ; for example there may have been ambiguous indications from the engine instruments that led them to believe that engine no. 1 had failed . However with the information currently available it seems that the crew did not follow the correct procedures for shutting down a failed engine . The high number of crashes involving an ATR aircraft seems not to be related to the model itself , but to the safety culture and lack of training within a number of airlines operating the aircraft .
To become an Air Force pilot , you have to be a commissioned officer , there are few ways you can do that . First you can go through the Air Force Academy , which is probably the most common . Another way is to be in an ROTC program through your college of choice . The last way I know of is to graduate college and join the Air Force through the officer candidate school ( OCS ) . Regardless of the method you choose , there are certain requirements you must meet : Be a U.S. Citizen Have any 4 year college degree or be within 365 days of attaining it Minimum 2.5 GPA ( although I 'd be surprised if they took you that low ) Under the age of 28 by the board convening date Have a standing height of 64-77 inches and a sitting height of 34-40 inches Have no history of hay fever , asthma , or allergies after the age of 12 Meet USAF weight and physical conditioning requirements Normal color vision Meet refraction , accommodation , and astigmatism requirements Distance vision can not exceed 20/20 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better Near vision can not exceed 20/40 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better If you 've met those requirements you can then go through the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test ( AFOQT ) and through Military Entrance Processing Station ( MEPS ) for your intellectual and physical evaluation . If you pass those tests , you may be selected for the Officer Candidate School ( if not joining through ROTC or Academy ) . After that you go into undergraduate pilot training ( UPT ) where you spend a year learning to fly through academic and hands-on training . Depending on how you perform at UPT you will receive a seat assignment . Higher scores are selected for fighter training while lower scores move towards transport aircraft . You can voice your opinion on what you want to fly , but ultimately the decision is driven by the needs of the Air Force at the time you graduate UPT . After UPT , you will move to Advanced Flight Training ( AFT ) which is between 6 months and a year long depending on the aircraft you 've been assigned . After AFT you 'll be assigned a squadron and location . If you do n't meet height requirements There is a waiver process , although getting a waiver for height requirements is extremely rare ( if not completely unheard of ) . The issue is that the ejection systems are designed for a specific height . This process starts by appealing a medical review board which you are allowed to write a letter to argue your position , however even with a waiver you would probably not be assigned a fighter aircraft . You would probably be assigned an aircraft that does not have an ejection system like transport or mid-air refueling aircraft . As <URL> mentions in the comments , the T6 training aircraft is also equipped with an ejection seat and if you ca n't fly the trainer , you ca n't progress on . The only other alternative to be a US Air Force pilot outside of height requirements is to be an unmanned aircraft pilot . Source 1 : <URL> Source 2 : <URL>
<URL> lists a number of specific ways that PIREPs are used by meteorologists : To " assess the strength and position of the jet stream " For thunderstorm and snow level forecasting For <URL> of regional weather phenomena , like " downslope wind storms in the lee of the Sierra Nevada " To " determine the likelihood of clouds thinning or burning off " Their summary is : Better reports and observations , not only from PIREPS but also storm spotters , Webcams and road weather networks help improve the picture of what 's going on in the atmosphere . Automated temperature , wind and humidity reports from MDCRS and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System in commercial aircraft also get incorporated into computer models . All of these observations lead to improved forecasts and warnings . There are a few very generic references out there too . A 2014 edition of <URL> says : The information will then be added to the distribution system to brief other pilots , help generate inflight advisories like AIRMETs and SIGMETs , as well as updates to the Current and Forecast Icing Products ( CIP/FIP ) , and improve overall forecast accuracy . And an <URL> has a brief mention : when the Aviation Weather Center ( AWC ) receives a pirep , meteorologists use it to verify that their weather forecast is correct or amend it if the pirep contradicts the forecast . Finally , PIREPs ( and <URL> ) are shown <URL> , although that probably is n't what you had in mind by meteorologists ' using ' the information .
The pulse jet engine works because it uses the dynamic pressure of air for compression . Consequently , it needs speed to work well . If the pulse jet is on the ground , it is not easy to start - it needs to be fed with compressed air , and once it runs ( it can run even when not moving because the oscillating pressure wave inside the tube will compress the inflowing air ) , it develops litte thrust . Thrust will go up with airspeed , so you need additional thrust sources for initial acceleration and take-off . In case of the V-1 , this was done by a steam catapult or by air-launching the device . Note that the V-1 was accelerated to 370 km/h on a 45 m long catapult which means more than 100 m/s ² ( 10g ) average acceleration . Most of the development work went into making the airframe withstand this acceleration . A modern design would need additional engines as well , and once those are included , the rationale for pulse jets becomes very weak . They make sense if you have an air-launched , disposable application , such as long-range air-to-air missiles . This is a niche in which their higher-speed cousins , the ramjets , <URL> . Pros : Very easy to build , very light . Runs and produces some thrust when at rest ( as opposed to ramjets ) . Cons : Thrust grows with flight speed . This can be seen as a pro , but normally requires additional means of acceleration . Therefore listed as contra here . Low fuel efficiency . The fuel energy is converted to other forms of energy : Just listen to the videos of <URL> to get an idea . High levels of vibration due to the intermittent operation . When the <URL> was tried out with <URL> , the aircraft experienced unacceptable vibration . Need heat-resistant materials . The central part will get very hot in operation , so at least nickel-chrome stainless steel is needed if air cooling is insufficient . Can not go supersonic . For this , there are <URL> . EDIT : NACA tested the As 014 pulse jet and wrote a <URL> , from which the performance data depicted below is taken : It seems that <URL> has improved the pulse jet design a lot : He needs no compressed air for starting and makes clever use of surrounding cold air to increase mass flow and keep material temperatures down .
AOPA has a <URL> about this , and it basically says : Since you failed the oral , more studying is probably in order . You will need to receive training in the area ( s ) of the checkride that you failed from a flight instructor . Once the flight instructor feels that you are proficient and able to pass the checkride , they will sign your logbook so that you may take it again . Schedule your checkride again . If you take it within 60 days , you will only need to test on the areas that you failed . After 60 days you have to take the entire checkride over again . Take your Notice of Disapproval ( 8060-5 ) with you to the checkride ( you did n't burn it did you ?? ) Like the article says , it is n't the end of the world ! About 20 % of first time applicants fail their checkride , but all you have to do is use it as a learning experience and let it make you an even better pilot . If you have questions about specific subjects , you can also ask questions here and we will be happy to help you out !
I fly a Super Decathlon with an Aspen E1000 . While an excellent PFD , I certainly would not trust it in aerobatic flight . There 's no cage function , and no way that I 'm aware of to keep the attitude indicator from misbehaving , which I 've seen it do firsthand . I also fly the Avidyne R9 system , which also does not have a caging function . Furthermore , I downloaded the Garmin G1000 manual , which says nothing about a way to cage the GRS 77 . This lack of commonly available GA glass-cockpit aerobatic-capable instrumentation probably contributes to why <URL>

What are the limitations in adoptions of GTF ( Geared Turbofan ) technology ?
The factors that are relevant here are : Increasing the bypass ratio is very desirable in order to improve the efficiency of the engine , and for the same amount of thrust , this means increasing the fan diameter . In order to keep the fan mostly subsonic , the fan rotational speed has to decrease with increasing fan diameters . Supersonic fan blade tips are possible and in use , but you lose efficiency and increase noise , so it 's desirable to limit this to the outermost area . For the same efficiency , a low-speed turbine requires more stages and therefore more weight compared to a high-speed turbine . Compare the PW1100G 's 3-stage LPT ( geared ) with LEAP-1A 's 7-stage LPT ( not geared ) . The only way to decouple the rotational speed of the LPT from the rotational speed of the fan is by using a gearbox . In the long run , this is therefore a question of whether the gearbox is heavier than a slower-turning LPT and whether a possible increase in maintenance costs due to the gearbox is acceptable for the given gain in efficiency or reduction in engine weight . With further increases in engine bypass ratios , the gearbox becomes increasingly attractive . In the short run , this is also a question of whether a company wants to risk developing a completely new component , with potential problems before and after entry into service . Additionally , with a given amount of money and manpower to develop a new engine , management will ask : Where are the engineering hours going to make a bigger difference , in improved fan , compressor , turbine and combution chamber designs/materials / ... or in a gearbox design . So while , for example , Rolls-Royce does not manufacture a geared turbofan right now , their " UltraFan " research engine project does include a gearbox . I think it 's safe to say that it is only a matter of time until most commercial turbofans will include a gearbox .
VERICOR POWER SYSTEMS has a patent for these valves , number and title The patent includes the following image : SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide for a control and method for arresting flashback in a gas turbine engine combustion system having a venturi for delivering a mixture of air and fuel to a combustion chamber and a valve for controlling the amount of air flowing to the venturi . The present invention achieves this object by providing a flashback control system and method having a flashback detection routine , a valve position trim routine , and a reference flame temperature adjustment routine . The flashback detection routine detects a flashback in the venturi by comparing the temperature at the venturi to the temperature of the air entering the valve . The valve position trim routine receives this flashback signal and in response causes the valve to open until the flashback is arrested . Finally , to prevent the flashback from recurring , the reference flame temperature adjustment routine adjusts a reference flame temperature in the control system so as to prevent the valve from returning to the position at which the flashback occurred . These and other objects , features and advantages of the present invention , are specifically set forth in , or will become apparent from , the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings . The patent can be <URL> , however , it has expired .
Two things : <URL> . This can be alleviated by carefully touching down , but you never know what exactly will happen in the next landing , so better do n't count on it to be smooth Deceleration distance : The higher mass requires a higher approach and touch down speed ( higher by the square root of the mass ratio between your actual mass and the maximum certified landing mass ) . Now you have more mass and more speed , but the landing strip and the airliner 's brakes are still the same . The risk is that you overshoot the runway with an airplane full of fuel or that you overheat the brakes ( which will result in their failure , and again an overshoot ) . Since the kinetic energy is proportional to mass times speed squared , the energy which needs to be absorbed by the brake goes up with the square of the mass increase . If the selected runway for your overweight landing is long enough and the weather is calm ( so a smooth landing is easier ) , an overweight landing is not such a problem . Now let 's look at the 777-300ER in detail . I use the figures from <URL> , because the <URL> is trying much harder to hide the relevant data . The MTOW ( maximum take-off weight , which is actually a mass ) is 351,534 kg , and the maximum landing weight is 251,290 kg , about 100 tons less . Now let 's assume that <URL> and returning to the airfield uses 5 tons of fuel , so the mass ratio is 1.379 . Therefore , the approach speed has to be 17.4 % higher and the total kinetic energy at touchdown is higher by a factor of 1.9 compared to the case at maximum allowable landing weight . If we now assume that speed is reduced linearly during the landing run and that the wheel brakes will just absorb as much energy over time as in the case at maximum landing weight , the deceleration needs to be lower by the mass ratio , so the aircraft decelerates with only 72.5 % of the deceleration at maximum landing weight . To shed its kinetic energy , the landing run will take longer by the increase in kinetic energy , i.e. 1.9 . Since the average speed is also higher by 17.4 % , the landing distance will be higher by a factor of 2.233 or 223 % of the landing distance at maximum landing weight . This neglects that the heating of the brakes is an instationary process , so you can not simply brake with the same intensity for more than twice the time they were designed for . But this little estimation should illuminate what impact a higher landing mass has on the energy and distance involved .
I will attempt an answer , although the question is a bit unclear . Climb rate is not measured in degrees or any other angle measurement unit . It 's altitude per time unit ( feet per minute usually ) . What you are mentioning is the climb gradient . See <URL> for details Now regarding your questions : Do climb rates for a given flight mission stay constant in one phase of flight ( e.g. until reaching 1500ft altitude ) and then change at a specific flight level or are they continuously adjusted ? Depends on what the pilot wants to achieve . Do they have to meet a restriction ? Noise abatement , crossing etc ? Are they instructed by ATC to climb quicker ( if able ) or slower to maintain separation with an opposite or crossing flight ? In any case they have to adjust their climb rate . Do given climb rates exist for ( one arbitrary ) given flight mission ? Yes and no . Given by whom ? The manufacturer ? The airline company ? The regulations ? If the SID you 've been assigned has climb restrictions imposed , then you have them given but not a firm number . It 's usually less than or more than ( or both ) . Also have in mind that climb rate is affected by aircraft weight as you can see in the document that I 've linked below . But this is more of a limit rather than a given rate for the specific flight . Is there a method to calculate the change of climb rates depending on altitude and weight ? Again , on whose perspective ? The aerospace engineer 's who designs the plane ? Or the pilot 's who will " just " fly it ? In the second case there are lookup tables , but I hardly recall details since it 's been almost 10 years from the last time I 've seen one . Are there sources like papers , reports , manuals that will work for genuine citation ? Your best bet is BADA . You might want to have a look into <URL> * where it actually describes ( among others ) the climb rates for various altitudes and weights for several aircraft types . Note that this is quite an old document dated back to 1998 , but I would guess this is the best one can get since BADA is proprietary and has lots of use restrictions . So I would n't expect anything much newer to be publicly available . * ( labeled since links have the bad habit to disappear )
Fitting a larger fan does two things to the thrust of an engine : The static thrust is increased . Static thrust is the thrust produced when the engine is not moving . The thrust gradient over speed becomes more negative , which means that thrust will decline more with speed when the bypass ratio is increased . But there is more : Exit speeds at the nozzle are reduced , and a bigger intake is required , since the bigger fan will need more air . Increasing the bypass ratio means taking some of the <URL> and turning this into a higher fan mass flow . If we look at the formula for the propulsive efficiency $ \ eta_p $ of an airbreathing engine : $ $ \ eta_p = \ frac { v _ { \ infty } } { v _ { \ infty } + \ frac { \ Delta v } { 2 } } $ $ where $ v _ { \ infty } $ is the speed of the engine and $ \ Delta v $ the speed increase of the gas flowing through the engine , the speed dependency becomes clear : When $ v _ { \ infty } $ is low , a smaller $ \ Delta v $ acting on a higher mass flow makes the engine more efficient . When $ v _ { \ infty } $ is high , however , this effect disappears , and now the smaller engine with a smaller and lighter intake becomes more attractive . When the core of the engine stays the same , its fuel consumption will also stay the same , but the bigger fan will create more thrust , especially at low speed . The core mass flow will be the same , regardless of fan size , and the amount of <URL> will also not change . Since efficiency is defined as thrust per unit of fuel consumed , the bigger fan will also increase efficiency .
My experience transitioning from airplanes to helicopters and then to gliders is that I never forget what I 'm flying . I know that sounds obvious , but its no different than the difference between driving a car with automatic transmission and manual , riding a motorcycle which has all the controls in a different place than a car and <URL> , and flying an airplane . I do n't reach for the throttle when I want to slow down in a car , and I do n't turn the wheel in the direction of the turn when I 'm riding a motorcycle . Similarly , when taking off in an airplane , I know I have to add power and pull back a bit to get it off the ground , and in a helicopter I inch the nose forward to gain <URL> . The reason I do n't act/react improperly when flying different aircraft is that it 's all been trained into my muscle memory to do the right thing depending on the circumstances . I do n't think of the horn in a helicopter as a stall horn , just like the buzzer in my alarm clock and smoke alarm are not stall horns . The horn in the heli is a low-rpm horn , and I ease the stick back not forward . Another complication is instrument flight . Although I am an instrument rated airplane pilot , I have a little hood time in a helicopter . I 'm so used to flying pitch and power against the AI that all my instincts under the hood in the heli were completely wrong . Nevertheless , I do n't think I 'll ultimately have any trouble flying instruments well in a heli .
You have confused a turboprop engine with a turbocharged engine . They are very different and have very little in common . A turboprop engine is powered by a turbine engine geared to a propeller . Turbine engines have less power available at higher altitudes so answer " A " is correct . A turbocharged engine is a piston engine which is fitted with a small compressor driven by exhaust gas pressure . The compressor ( turbocharger ) can increase manifold pressure to restore sea level power at altitude . ( Turbo-normalized ) A turbo charger can also supply greater than sea level manifold pressure for more power . ( turbo-supercharged ) Both types of turbocharged piston engines can maintain full rated power as they climb , but they will eventually reach a limit where full power can no longer be maintained .
The theoretical bare minimum would be a light gun to give light signals to aircraft . A more generally acceptable minimum is a two-way radio to do radio communications with aircraft . From there up other systems can be added . The list below gives some examples but is not exhaustive . A telephone . Always useful when you want to get in contact with other parties on the ground ( e.g. air traffic control centre ) or other parties with you . Meteorological instruments can provide current wind and visibility at the runway to the tower controller . This is not directly to support the Air Traffic Control function , but to provide information services to pilots . Airport lighting control : runway ( and taxiway ) lights are usually controllable from the tower . These systems can become quite complex on larger airports A display with a feed from an approach radar . This present the air traffic situation around the airport to the controller . Whilst on larger airports the approach controllers are usually not located in the tower itself , smaller airports often combine tower &amp; approach control . Even when approach controllers are physically located elsewhere , the approach radar assists tower controllers as well in building a clear mental picture of the situation . An emergency button that makes the fire department jump to life . Surface radar display . This presents the ground traffic situation to the controller . Often not found on small airports , but essential for efficient operations at busy airports , especially in low visibility . More radio 's . To split tower control who do the runways and ground control who do the taxiing aircraft . Further divisions can be made . A system that shows which runways are active , which are closed for use by the airport authority ( e.g. for maintenance ) Electronic flight strip system . The traditional paper strips are now often replaced by a digital equivalent . These E-strip system usually communicate with the whole flight data processing system , correlating strips to radar tracks . Gate allocation system . It 's always nice to now where those arriving aircraft should be directed once they are of the runway . Gate video systems showing the situation at the gate . ( to bust pilots that say they are ready for engine start / pushback whilst they are still loading cargo :-) ) Departure management system . When you have a complex airport with multiple runways and a maze of taxiways , a DMAN may help to get aircraft airborne at the right time in the right sequence in the right direction . Arrival management system . With many aircraft arriving from all directions , headed for different terminal / gates it helps to have an AMAN to avoid overloading your Terminal Manoeuvring Area with incoming flights competing to be first . Integration of the Surface radar , DMAN and Gate Allocation System with the lights control system . The level of integration varies . In the most extreme case pilots just have to follow the taxiways that light up green and stop at red stop bars . This avoids a lot of radio communications and confused pilots who did n't exactly remember a taxi clearing involving a dozen of taxiway letters .

A diverse departure is a default departure procedure , named " omnidirectional " by ICAO . To answer your question : It is normally not published . The only thing that is required on aeronautical publications is a wording preventing or limiting the use of this procedure . BUCKLEY AFB ( KBKF ) , AURORA , CO TAKEOFF MINIMUMS AND ( OBSTACLE ) DEPARTURE PROCEDURES 11013 Diverse departure not authorized . Use published departure procedures for obstacle avoidance . Sometimes there is a reminder that it can be used : CANNON AFB ( KCVS ) , CLOVIS , NM TAKEOFF MINIMUMS AND ( OBSTACLE ) DEPARTURE PROCEDURES ORIG 15064 Diverse departure authorized all runways . This default procedure is valid only when : Not explicitly prohibited , There is at least one instrument approach for the airport No obstacle departure procedure ( ODP ) and No standard departure ( SID ) has been published for the airport . A diverse departure is conducted this way : Cross the runway end at 35 ft , maintain heading and a 200 ft/NM gradient until 400 ft above the runway end . The 200 ft/NM gradient is TERPS ' minimum climb gradient , and corresponds to ICAO 's 3.3 % for the minimum procedure design gradient . Continue or turn in any direction while maintaining a minimum rate of climb of 200 ft/NM . Maintain this rate of climb until reaching a 1,000 ft obstacle clearance or a 2,000 ft obstacle clearance in mountainous areas . <URL> <URL> The 40:1 ratio ( 152 ft/NM ) delimits a surface from the runway end , named the obstacle clearance surface ( OCS ) . The diverse departure ensures being above the OCS until enroute . Whenever the conditions exist for a diverse departure , it is implicit ATC authorities have assessed the absence of obstacle above the OCS . This assessment is named the diverse departure assessment . Given the 40:1 slope and obstacle clearances , the area assessed may have a radius from 25 to 46 NM .
There is an aircraft with a single engine in the middle of fuselage - the <URL> - and it has the wingspan of a 737 . <URL> Global Hawk and B737 ; image from reddit . For the engine to power an airliner the size of 737 , it would have to be more powerful and huge . This leads to a few issues : It is going to eat up cabin space . In an age where airlines are finding creative ways to squeeze more people into the available space , this is a no-go . The large engine means that there should be sufficient clearance between the engine and the fuselage - else , it would result in more drag and reduced thrust , thereby reducing efficiency . Increasing clearance is quite difficult for fuselage mounted high bypass engine due to weight implications . Passengers in rear seats may not have a pleasant journey due to engine noise . Mounting the engine in rear incurs weight penalty through various ways - you have to strengthen the rear fuselage and at the same time , you lose wing bending relief , requiring strengthening and you have cg issues . Mounting engines above the fuselage is a not maintenance friendly either . Just to note , redundancy and safety are significant issues , especially in a commercial airliner .
Angle of Attack is the angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the relative wind . The elevator is also a " wing " in the effect that it is an airfoil . 1 ) Then what is the angle between the chord line of the elevator and relative wind ? Because if I am not wrong , by pitching the elevator up , the wing of an aircraft is subjected to the ' angle of attack ' . It 's also called " Angle Of Attack " . Pitching the elevator up also changes the angle of attack of the elevator . There are such conditions as elevator stall , although much less common than wing stall . 2 ) When you say angle of attack exceed critical angle of attack , is it because the elevator is pitched up thus creating wider angle between the chord line and the relative direction of the wind ? The " Critical AoA " is the angle at which the airfoil is generating the most lift . [ <URL> ] : The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient . This is also called the " stall angle of attack " . Below the critical angle of attack , as the angle of attack increases , the coefficient of lift ( Cl ) increases . At the same time , above the critical angle of attack , as angle of attack increases , the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface Usually when you exceed the critical AoA , the air on the upper surface of the airfoil de-laminates and becomes turbulent . This results in a loss of lift ( stall ) . <URL> <URL> 3 ) In the Air France 447 accident , the PF kept saying , keeps the wings level . What does it mean ? How can the wings be leveled when the angle of attack is so high ? Does keeping the wings level means reducing the angle of attack to zero ? I 'm not sure what context you are talking about . I 've read the transcripts pretty carefully and I do n't recall the PF saying to keep the wings level . The Captain said to descend , while the PF was trying to climb . The SIC was pushing the stick forward while the PF was pulling back , causing the wings to remain level ( or at a slight climb ) . Keeping the wings level ( avoiding an un-coordinated turn ) in a stall condition is the best way to avoid putting the aircraft into a spin . This is possibly what they meant , although they did n't know that they were in a stall ( or if they did , they were not reacting to it appropriately ) . Yes , leveling the wings would be making the AoA at zero ( zero meaning where the airfoil is developing lift , and depending on the bank angle ) , but only if there were positive airspeed to make the relative wind parallel with the chord . In the case of AF447 , the aircraft was falling out of the sky at a spectacular 15,000 FPM , which means that the relative wind to the airfoil was basically perpendicular . They did n't have the forward airspeed to change the AoA , so they should have lowered the nose to gain airspeed and decrease the AoA . The important thing to remember is that the pitch angle of the aircraft is not the same as the AoA . You can take an aircraft at zero forward speed and drop it straight down , the pitch angle will be zero but the AoA will be perpendicular .
The pulse jet engine works because it uses the dynamic pressure of air for compression . Consequently , it needs speed to work well . If the pulse jet is on the ground , it is not easy to start - it needs to be fed with compressed air , and once it runs ( it can run even when not moving because the oscillating pressure wave inside the tube will compress the inflowing air ) , it develops litte thrust . Thrust will go up with airspeed , so you need additional thrust sources for initial acceleration and take-off . In case of the V-1 , this was done by a steam catapult or by air-launching the device . Note that the V-1 was accelerated to 370 km/h on a 45 m long catapult which means more than 100 m/s ² ( 10g ) average acceleration . Most of the development work went into making the airframe withstand this acceleration . A modern design would need additional engines as well , and once those are included , the rationale for pulse jets becomes very weak . They make sense if you have an air-launched , disposable application , such as long-range air-to-air missiles . This is a niche in which their higher-speed cousins , the ramjets , <URL> . Pros : Very easy to build , very light . Runs and produces some thrust when at rest ( as opposed to ramjets ) . Cons : Thrust grows with flight speed . This can be seen as a pro , but normally requires additional means of acceleration . Therefore listed as contra here . Low fuel efficiency . The fuel energy is converted to other forms of energy : Just listen to the videos of <URL> to get an idea . High levels of vibration due to the intermittent operation . When the <URL> was tried out with <URL> , the aircraft experienced unacceptable vibration . Need heat-resistant materials . The central part will get very hot in operation , so at least nickel-chrome stainless steel is needed if air cooling is insufficient . Can not go supersonic . For this , there are <URL> . EDIT : NACA tested the As 014 pulse jet and wrote a <URL> , from which the performance data depicted below is taken : It seems that <URL> has improved the pulse jet design a lot : He needs no compressed air for starting and makes clever use of surrounding cold air to increase mass flow and keep material temperatures down .
Short answer : Turbofans need supersonic speed at the fan blade tips to create their high thrust . Turbofans can tolerate supersonic speeds because the intake creates constant flow conditions irrespective of flight speed . Efficiency for propellers and fan blades is highest at subsonic flow conditions . Propellers can turn at supersonic speeds , but since flow conditions are less controlled , the penalty for doing so is much higher than the penalty for a fan . Explanation It is a bad thing to have supersonic fan blade tips , just like supersonic propeller tips are best avoided . But in turbofans it is a price worth paying , because the faster tip velocity means higher dynamic pressure , and the pressure difference between both sides of the fan blade grows with the square of their velocity . This makes the high thrust levels of modern turbofans possible . <URL> Propeller efficiency over speed ( picture <URL> ) . The plot for fan blades would look not much different . The very thin , uncambered airfoil of a supersonic propeller and the added wave drag lower the maximum efficiency , but hold efficiency up into supersonic air speeds . Note that the propeller on the <URL> did move at supersonic speed . There is nothing inherent in propellers which prevents their tips from moving faster than the speed of sound . On the other hand , the big diameter of a prop requires proportionally more torque to keep the prop rotating against the drag from the supersonic tips . Thus , a fan engine requires less torque per blade to reach supersonic tip speeds on the fan blades . Also , the <URL> to make the noise from supersonic tips manageable . The XF-84H 's noise made people literally sick . But there is more to it : @FreeMan encouraged me with his comment to dive a little deeper . A supersonic propeller will work well when the direction of flow at every station along the propeller blade is about equal to the local airfoil chord . Since the blade is uncambered , this means that the change in local flow direction at the leading edge can be minimized to the amount which is required to create the desired thrust . But to be able to fulfill this condition you need to match your propeller speed to the flight speed and twist distribution . Also , the angle of attack must be compensated for by sviveling this propeller axis into the direction of flight . It will have no <URL> , but can run at only one speed for a given flight speed . Contrast this with a turbofan : The intake makes sure that the flow speed and direction at the face of the fan is the same no matter what the flight speed is . This is done by the pressure field in and around the intake which <URL> in from the sides at low speed . In the fan you can indeed match the local angle of incidence to the airspeed so the fan will work well over its design range . Generally , a fully subsonic fan would be more efficient . But then the diameter would need to be as large as that of big turboprop engines , and the shroud would become impossibly heavy and produce too much drag . The high dynamic pressure on the fan blades is needed to produce the thrust with the relatively small diameter of a turbofan .
fooot has pointed out the <URL> ( powers the B-1 Lancer ) has a BPR ( bypass ratio ) of > 2:1 and comes with an afterburner . Other examples are the <URL> ( 1.1:1 ) and the <URL> ( 0.97:1 ) . Generally , anything <URL> is a low BPR , and bypass air is needed for cooling . Pure turbojets resort to other means of cooling , such as the ram air inlet <URL> , or they run inefficiently at low combustion temperatures . I ca n't speak for the inner workings of a classified military engine , but an ideal supersonic engine would be a variable cycle engine ( VCE ) . Operating with bypass in the subsonic regime , and without in the supersonic high-power demand regime . Such theoretical ( to the public at least ) examples from the 90 's are shown ( and linked ) below . Do note the idea behind the VCE is the elimination of the wasteful and noisy afterburner . So , it 's an either/or situation . A dual operation of afterburner and high bypass in a non-VCE would not have benefits . <URL> ( <URL> ) Image shows how a VCE routes the bypass air in both modes of operation . Other variations by RR and Snecma can be <URL> . Note the novel design of the Snecma with the free-turbine -- extra-fan . VCE 's would definitely be heavier and more complex engines . Related : <URL>

I analyzed a <URL> last semester in my aerothermodynamics course , so allow me to answer this question . The short answer : the un-compressed air provides the majority of an engine 's total thrust since the compressed air powers the engine . Correction : I forgot to mention that the fans also compress entering air . That is , all air entering an engine is compressed a bit by the fan . Some of this compressed air enters the turbojet core and the rest of the fan-compressed air bypasses the engine core . I ignored this for the sake of simplicity , but I should have explained this since you directly asked about air compression in a turbofan . Long answer : see below ! 1 . The fan ( s ) Air enters the engine through a fan ( or fans in the case of the F100 engine ) . These are the giant fans with a spinning insignia in the middle that you see inside an engine . Update : The spinning insignia clearly show if the fan is spinning so workers do n't get injured . The fan ( s ) increases the pressure of the air that enters an engine . Some of this compressed air is diverted around the rest of the engine and is directed straight out of the engine . The bypass ratio is a measure of how much air bypasses the " jet " core ( bypass air/core air ) . 2 . The compressors The rest of this air is then compressed through a combination of more fans and a converging duct . The data from my thermo project tells me that this stage increases the pressure of the core air by more than 10,000 % , but I 'm not too sure about that * . Sufficed to say , this core air now has a lot of energy -- let 's add some more :D Quick note : The compressed air now has insignificant velocity relative to the bypass air . Most of the compressed air 's energy is " in " its pressure ( senior SE members , please correct me if I 'm wrong ) . 3 . The combustion chamber ( aka , combustor aka magic chamber ) Now the core air enters the combustion chamber . Here the air enters small chambers , mixes with jet fuel , and is ignited . The main parts-of-an-engine diagram I posted makes it seam like the combustion chamber is one big part of a jet-engine , but really the combustor consists of a bunch of smaller chambers surrounded the main shaft of the engine . Here is a gif that shows what I mean : How the combustion chamber operates is beyond my scope of understanding , but consider that a combustor is essentially trying to keep a candle alight in the middle of a hurricane . Awesome engineering goes into designing better and more efficient ( hotter-burning ) chambers . 4 . The turbine ( aka more magic section ) Now that hot and even more energetic air enters a the turbine section which consists of a diverging ( increasing in area ) duct and more fans . Whereas the compress " inserted " energy into the air , the turbines draw out energy from the air . As the air enters the larger ( in volume ) turbine area , it expands and spins the turbine fans which power the compressors and the fan . This Back Work Ratio ( BWR ) is a measure of how much turbine power it takes to spin the compressors . 5 . The nozzle The still energetic core air is once again concentrated before being shot out of the back of the engine.This thrust , together with the thrust of the bypass air , propels the air forward following this model : $ F _ { thrust } = \ dot { m } _ { bypass } \ times \ Delta v _ { bypass } + \ dot { m } _ { core } \ times \ Delta v _ { core } $ Where $ \ dot { m } _ { bypass } $ is the mass flow-rate of air that is bypassed and $ \ Delta v _ { bypass } $ is the change in velocity of that air as a result of the fan . And $ \ dot { m } _ { core } $ is the mass flow-rate of air that is combusted and $ \ Delta v _ { core } $ is the change in velocity of the core air as a result of the fan , compressor , combustion chamber , and turbine . The uncompressed air contributes about 60 % of the total thrust . The " processed " air loses a significant portion of its energy to powering the engine . However , the compressed air still provides about 40 % of the total thrust . Adding an afterburner can increase this contribution to 50 % . How is this possible ? Dead algae from a billion years ago . The hydrocarbons in jet fuel pack a lot of energy into a small <URL> and <URL> ( two completely different concepts ) . Burning those hydrocarbons releases a lot of energy that powers the fan , compressors , and electric generators of an aircraft before pushing the airplane forward . This high energy in a small place/space is also why electric cars/anything were n't practical until LiPo batteries ( story for another article ) . I applaud you for noticing that the uncompressed air contributes to an engine 's thrust . I think the term " bypass " confuses some people into thinking that this air is " thrown away " . it 's not . The bypassed air is actually sped up by a series of fans and imparts forward momentum to the aircraft . I 'm studying Aerospace engineering right now ( Whoop ! ) , so my excitement at being able to answer this question rather side-tracked me from your original question , but I hope you enjoy the extra info on how a turbofan operates .

Fluid Types <URL> contains a good summary of the different types of fluid : Types Type I fluids have a low viscosity , and are considered " unthickened " . They provide only short term protection because they quickly flow off surfaces after use . They are typically sprayed on hot ( 130 -- 180 ° F , 55-80 ° C ) at high pressure to remove snow , ice , and frost . Usually they are dyed orange to aid in identification and application . Type II fluids are pseudoplastic , which means they contain a polymeric thickening agent to prevent their immediate flow off aircraft surfaces . Typically the fluid film will remain in place until the aircraft attains 100 knots or so ( almost 200 km/h ) , at which point the viscosity breaks down due to shear stress . The high speeds required for viscosity breakdown means that this type of fluid is useful only for larger aircraft . The use of type II fluids is diminishing in favour of type IV . Type II fluids are generally light yellow in color . Type III fluids can be thought of as a compromise between type I and type II fluids . They are intended for use on slower aircraft , with a rotation speed of less than 100 knots . Type III fluids are generally light yellow in color . Type IV fluids meet the same AMS standards as type II fluids , but they provide a longer holdover time . They are typically dyed green to aid in the application of a consistent layer of fluid . Chemical Composition The main component of deicing fluid is usually propylene glycol or ethylene glycol . Other ingredients vary depending on the manufacturer , but the exact composition of a particular brand of fluid is generally held as confidential proprietary information . Call ahead to the airport to see what kind of deice/anti-ice fluid that they have because each one is different . Time Limits Every year , the FAA publishes tables which include information about how long the various deice fluids will provide protection under various weather conditions . Here is an example table : For this particular fluid ( ABAX ECOWING AD-49 Type IV ) we can lookup a specific example such as : -10 Degrees Celcius 75 % fluid and 25 % water Light Snow This shows that the fluid will provide protection for 1:40 to 2:05 . If you are delayed longer than that , you will need to deice again . Since every part of the aircraft needs to be protected , the timing starts when they first start spraying the aircraft . Note that other types of fluid ( particularly Type I fluids ) have much shorter holdover times than this , so be careful and make sure that you check ! Resources <URL> <URL>

From this PPRune forum <URL> , the Boeing 777 does use ultrasonic sensors ( some 20 per tank ) This airplane has some 20 sensors per tank . Each of these is effectively a " radio doppler " and works on the same principle . The sensor calculates the height of fluid by measuring the difference in the speed of the sonic signal sent out thru one sensor to another , as against the ACTUAL local speed of sound ( which is a preset value ) thru standard temp air.This difference is then converted very accurately into height in the tank in mm.Which translates into quantity of fuel AT THAT sensor given the actual specific gravity of fuel at that point . - King on a Wing

On August 30 , 2017 , a completely new body of regulations for small aircraft has been put in place which does not distinguish between normal or utility airplanes but low speed ( below 250 KTAS ) and high speed designs ( > 250 KTAS ) . It also distinguishes between four levels depending on the number of seats ( 0-1 , 2-6 , 7-9 and 10-19 passengers ) . The spirit of the new regulation is to no longer prescribe design-specific rules but more abstract goals in order to limit risk , leaving the details to the aircraft builder . Also , the number of rules has been drastically cut , and their numbering starts where the old numbering ended . Therefore , 23.49 has become <URL> and no longer gives a specific stall speed . All it does is to direct the applicant to determine a stall speed and details what conditions must be covered . I expect that you have not formally started the certification process of your design , because that date determines which regulations apply . You are now free to select the stall speed of your design as long as you can demonstrate that the aircraft can be operated safely without exceptional pilot skill or strength . But you can always count on Eurocrats when a body of regulations which has grown like cancer is to be preserved and extended . In their version ( <URL> ) , the maximum stall speed of 113 km/h or 61 knots is still alive and well . However , <URL> has now copied the new body of regulations as well and replaces the old certification standard in the name of global harmonization . The old regulations reflect the experience which has been collected over decades . Many rules can be traced back to a specific accident and it helps to read through them and to consider why this specific rule has been implemented . Your new design might employ a clever way to avoid that particular condition at all , and then the new liberty of the new regulations will be helpful . But it would be foolish to throw all that experience overboard - a lower stall speed makes any airplane easier to fly . When things happen less quickly and less kinetic energy is involved , more accidents can be avoided and the damage in those that still occur will be lower .

I have already found answer for my problem . ACES and FACET from NASA Aviation System Division solve my problem . It should handle all statistical data , it has statistical output as well and it could also handle meteorological data .

First , a caution : IFR procedures can ( and do ) vary between countries . It is incumbent on the pilot to study the respective authority 's Aeronautical Information Publication ( AIP ) to understand local procedures before flight . When asking questions about instrument flight procedures , it is helpful to know which countries you are specifically traveling through . While the vast majority of countries simply adopt ICAO procedures , many have significant deviations ( the United States included ) . <URL> , section 6.5.3 discusses instrument flight that terminates into a visual approach . Interestingly , the document is silent on what happens if the approach is aborted . In the United States , the FAA is more explicit . In the <URL> , section 5-4-23 visual approaches are specifically addressed . Paragraph ( e ) details what should happen if a visual approach is terminated : A visual approach is not an IAP and therefore has no missed approach segment . If a go around is necessary for any reason , aircraft operating at controlled airports will be issued an appropriate advisory/clearance/instruction by the tower . At uncontrolled airports , aircraft are expected to remain clear of clouds and complete a landing as soon as possible . If a landing can not be accomplished , the aircraft is expected to remain clear of clouds and contact ATC as soon as possible for further clearance . Separation from other IFR aircraft will be maintained under these circumstances .
<URL> Using two counter-rotating props does indeed eliminate torque issues . The co-axial configuration has been around for a while , like the successful <URL> . The thrust , power and propeller disk issues are a bit complicated , let 's start with a qualitative discussion . Two 2-blade co-axial rotors compared with a single 4-blade rotor of the same size . To generate a given thrust , two counter-rotating 2-bladed propellers use less power than a single 4-bladed propeller of the same size - if they are mounted far enough away from each other . Separating the two propellers helps in reducing power : the closer together they are , the less the power advantage . Separate them 20 % of the rotor radius , and you still have a 7 % power advantage over a single 4-blade propeller , as computed by Kamov <URL> . Further away results in less power required . Note that the 7 % power advantage may not account for losses from the dual gearing trains required . Co-axial 2-bladed propeller compared with two 2-bladed separate propellers of the same size . Momentum theory predicts a power penalty of $ \ sqrt { 2 } $ = 41 % when two rotors are placed co-axially without separation , compared with the two identical rotors being operated in isolation . Test results have indicated that that is an overestimation : 20 % is more realistic . We 're limited to commercially available sizes and pitches and are using fixed pitch . That means that we can not optimise for the exact circumstances . My recommendations for the design process would be as follows : From your link I see that there are 40 " and 49 " blades available . Go for the 40 " props . Your link gives an output RPM of 3500 . With a 40 " prop , the tip speed becomes ( 3500 RPM * $ 2 \ pi $ rad * 0.5 m / 60 sec ) = 183.3 m/s , about Mach 0.55 . Forward velocity is around 20 m/s . The velocity triangle at the tip has an angle of tan $ ^ { -1 } $ 20/183 = 6.2 ° A typical symmetrical profile such as NACA 0012 has a maximum L/D at angle of attack = 4 ° at M = 0.6 ( <URL> ) . <URL> Add this to the velocity triangle and you end up with a blade tip angle of 10 ° . That equates to a blade pitch of 22 inch for the forward propeller . Select the standard pitch closest to 22 inch ( 24 " ? ) . The next one up to 22 " should be the best choice , because the aft propeller will be pulling in air and add to the free stream velocity . The aft propeller runs the accelerated air from the forward propeller and must have a higher blade pitch than the forward propeller . Select the next available pitch up ( 28 " ? ) . Naturally , one propeller must be clockwise and one must be counter-clockwise . Both propellers should be 2-bladed . That will result in four blades in total , more than enough for this application . Adding more blades will cost horsepower and not result in any useful thrust increase . For the thrust per propeller , if I compute that from a $ C_L $ of 0.55 and integrate that over the blade radius from 5 cm to 48 cm ( to account for tip losses ) , I get : $ $ T = C_L \ cdot \ rho \ cdot A \ cdot \ int _ { 0.05 } ^ { 0.48 } \ omega \ cdot r \ cdot dr $ $ $ $ = C_L \ cdot \ rho \ cdot A \ cdot \ frac { \ omega ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot ( 0.48 ^ 2 - 0.05 ^ 2 ) $ $ $ $ = 0.55 \ cdot 1.225 \ cdot 0.05 \ cdot \ frac { 366 ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot ( 0.2304 - 0.0025 ) $ $ With $ C_L $ = 0.55 $ \ rho $ = 1.225 kg/m $ ^ 3 $ at sea level A = blade area is about 0.05 m $ ^ 2 $ $ \ omega $ = 3500 * 2 $ \ pi $ / 60 = 366 rad/sec = 514 N per propeller . Note that there are assumptions on propeller profile and blade area in there . $ \ alpha $ may not be exactly 4 ° so lets take a 10 % lower value of 450N per propeller = 900 N total . Power required to generate this thrust is the blade profile power plus the induced power from thrust generation . When I look up the $ C_T $ and $ C_P $ factors of the propeller disks , I get a $ C_P $ of 0.001 , resulting in a power P of $ $ P = C_P \ cdot \ rho \ cdot A _ { disk } \ cdot { V _ { tip } } ^ 3 = 0.001 \ cdot 1.225 \ cdot 0.785 \ cdot 183 ^ 3 = 5.9 kW $ $ So for two propellers with a penalty of 20 % , that would be 14.4 kW = about 20 hp . There are some estimates in here and all depends on the pitch size and if my assumptions of blade profile and blade area are correct , but it seems to be in the ballpark . The product would need to be tested for actual thrust and power consumption of course . If your counter-rotating setup and gearing works , the main selling points would be absence of torque and a low tip speed resulting in low noise . Update Some of the comments are on using larger propellers and one 3-bladed and a 2-bladed , and there is a question on using a spreadsheet for single propellers . The single propeller spreadsheet may be a compilation of experience on using one single propeller . However , you will be driving two propellers . A main selling point for your set-up is elimination of torque . Use one 3-bladed and one 2-bladed propeller , and the difference in drag will re-introduce torque . You have 4 blades in total already , no need to add a 5th or more for any purpose . A larger propeller uses more horsepower than a smaller propeller , and you ' re

The NTSB actually <URL> the use of exterior cameras to the FAA in 2012 . It appears to be <URL> a <URL> , but it looks like you should contact your local FSDO for approval of an <URL> if you 're permanently fixing a camera to a plane . The grey area comes in that if the camera is temporarily attached , you should n't need special approval , but in practicality it could come loose and damage the plane . GoPro says this about affixing their cameras to planes : Industrial strength suction cup . Strong enough to pull dents out of a car door or stay attached to an airplane at 200mph + , proven though not endorsed by GoPro per FAA rules . There 's a <URL> where someone asked the FSDO to sign it off as a Minor Alteration , and it was determined that a short logbook entry would suffice : Temporarily installed a GoPro camera mounted to a standard inspection panel on ( Left/Right ) lower wing in place of the standard inspection panel . There are no electrical connections associated with this installation . This is a minor alteration as it has no appreciable effect on performance , flight characteristics , or other qualities affecting airworthiness ( refer to FAR 1.1 Major Alteration and FAR 21.93 ) . A net weight change of 9 oz is incurred with the temporary installation ; therefore , the weight and balance change is negligible ( refer to AC 43.13 1B , 10-2 ( c ) ) .
This is heavily dependent on the local jurisdictions you plan to operate in and what their laws are . First off you must find out if your desired countries of operation accept foreign certificates . This varies heavily all over the world and can range from full no questions asked acceptance , to you needing to simply take the test again ( in that country ) through any various case you can think of . Second you need to find out what certificate you need . Here in the US to give rides ( and receive compensation for such ) you need a commercial certificate . This looks like it <URL> . Hours . The FAA requires a few more hours than the Canadian certificate will , <URL> Are at least 16 years of age ; and Have logged at least 10 hours of flight time in a glider and that flight time must include at least 20 total glider flights , and Have 2 hours of solo flight time in a glider , and Have passed the FAA written examination ; and Have passed the flight exam with a FAA Examiner . <URL> A minimum of 6 hours of flight training under the direction and supervision of an instructor At least 2 hours of solo flight time , including a minimum of 20 takeoffs and 20 landings Right off the bad Canada requires 4 less hours which , no matter how you spin it will be cheaper ( since you have to pay for less time ) . Here is the US if you are not a citizen you will need to pass an NTSB background check to train . I do not know if Canada has a similar requirement . Travel , assuming you are in the Caribbean already it may be cheaper to travel to Florida ( or the like ) to train then go all the way up to Canada for your training . Edit : According to this document the ECCAA does issue glider ratings <URL> ( a ) The Authority may issue the following ratings for pilots ( i ) Category ratings in the following aircraft : ( a ) Aeroplane ; ( b ) Rotorcraft ; ( c ) Glider ; ( d ) Lighter-than-air ; ( e ) Power lift .
Some factors might be : Price of fuel at the various airports ? Landing fees ? Are any of the airports so busy that you might have to hold waiting for landing clearance ? ( You do n't want to plan a fuel stop at LHR ) . Can you expect long taxis in some places ? ( All other things being equal , a single runway with a ramp next to it is better news than something like Schiphol or O'Hare ) . If you 're carrying passengers , are some of the airports in countries with significantly more cumbersome immigration rules applying to technical stops than others ? Some may want airport transit visas from passengers of certain nationalities even if they do n't disembark . Political considerations such as the ones mentioned by Terry in the comment . And , of course , the total expected fuel burn for the two legs , which will depend on your refueling points . Your operations department will make concrete calculations for a number of likely stops , and weather has an influence on top of geography . If you have several possible airports that all happen to be right on the shortest path between your origin and destination , the math will tend to favor a refueling stop roughly in the middle -- this will minimize the total cost-of-lifting-enough-fuel-for-the-rest-of-the-leg . Finally , if you 're planning a recurring scheduled flight , will any of the options provide a business opportunity to take on some extra passengers on days where the demand from the actual origin is low ?
What you need would be named " ICAO 1/500 ,000 map " , this is a VFR map with airspace class , based on a <URL> .

An alternative would be to use the online <URL> , selecting carefully layers and data to display , my trial at that : <URL> It must be improved to suit your needs , but I do n't expect it to be better than SkyVector . By clicking on a location , you can display all the information about relevant areas ( description , limits , etc ) . For enroute , <URL> provide two maps : <URL> <URL> . Good for intersection points and routes . On the airport plates side , the <URL> is not in public access , but several sites provide plates , e.g. : <URL> ( static ) <URL> ( interactive ) <URL> provides link to other sites like SkyVector . <URL> could be a good point of contact to discuss local documentation .

The license they are talking about is an FAA license issues on the basis of your Italian one , provided that license is up to an FAA standard . See @Pondlife 's answer for some links , and here 's one on the <URL> . The FAA license would be restricted to the privileges of your Italian one . For example , if you do not have privileges to fly at night on your Italian license then you would not be able to fly at night . If your Italian license defines the day as being shorter than the FAA you 'd have to use the Italian definition . To get one you have to show up in person at an FSDO unless the Italian FAA equivalent has an agreement in place where they can validate identity , etc. .
The test was carried out by the Sandia National Laboratories under terms of a contract with the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics , Inc. , of Tokyo . The <URL> : ... was to determine the impact force , versus time , due to the impact , of a complete F-4 Phantom -- including both engines -- onto a massive , essentially rigid reinforced concrete target ( 3.66 meters thick ) . The reports on the tests can be found in these places : <URL> by von Rieseman , W. A. et al.and <URL> by K. Muto et . al. . Interestingly , the aircraft used in the tests were flyable . The report notes : A flyable F4D aircraft was acquired by Sandia . The aircraft was modified slightly in order to support the aircraft at four locations with a special carriage structure . ... the aircraft weighed 12.7 tonnes ( with some avionics removed ) . The impact weight was 19 tonnes , which included ... 4.8 tonnes of water that was added to simulate the fuel weight ... The target consisted of a block of reinforced concrete 7m square and 3.66 m thick ... with a combined weight of 469 tonnes . The aircraft was crashed with the engines and <URL> : A fully functional F4 was used in the impact test.Only the gears and flaps at the main wings were partly removed and replaced by a carriage structure and sleds . This can also been in the following mass distribution diagram for the aircraft used in the test . <URL> Image from <URL> by von Rieseman , W. A. et al. . Finally , the test was for measuring the impact forces , not the strength of the wall , <URL> : At Sandia , a spokesman , John German , said the point of the test was to move the wall , as a way to measure the impact forces . ... as a preliminary step in building a computer model of such impacts , ... Mr. German said : " That test was designed to measure the impact force of a fighter jet . But the wall was not being tested . No structure was being tested . "
I have both US and Australian PPLs , and having flown VFR in both countries , there are some real differences in the VFR charts and supplemental data available . Mostly the contents are fairly evident but if you are unfamiliar with a specific type of VFR chart , it is important to look over the chart in detail to make sure you understand it . The US publishes VFR charts known as <URL> . These cover the entire country , including non-continental areas like Hawaii . IMHO these are excellent although in busy airspace , the 1:500,000 scale can become complex . So pilots learning to fly in the US usually become familiar with the sectional covering their base field , and then with that understanding , can look at sectionals for anywhere else in the US . Printed sectionals can also be used for long range VFR flight planning as they can be laid out in sequence and routes plotted across adjoining chart boundaries . For online chart examination , <URL> publishes all US sectionals online , which is a great resource . Australia does not publish sectionals covering the whole country . It 's a good question as to why but essentially the centre of the country is a big desert where few people live . So from a historical perspective , the inner part of the country has been regarded as " remote " and thus less in need of highly detailed maps . In addition , the word ' sectional ' is n't even in Australian pilot lexicon , so use the word ' chart ' instead . Australia publishes Visual Terminal Charts ( VTC ) for each large metropolitan area which are a Mercator projection at 1:250,000 . And there are Visual Navigational Charts ( VNC ) which mostly encapsulate the VTCs and are at 1:500,000 ( same as sectionals ) . The image below is an example of the Brisbane VTC . <URL> As VTC/VNCs cover only largely populated areas , for printed chart long VFR route planning , you will need to revert to the World Aeronautical Charts ( WACs ) , pronounced ' whacks ' . <URL> WACs started as an ICAO project after WW2 to transition from the existing US-based international wartime series and so all Allied nations were effectively asked to harmonize their maps with a US design . But in 2015 , the FAA <URL> and thus a recently US-trained VFR PPL would never have heard of them ( ! ) The US WAC coverage looked like this : <URL> WACs are a Lambert projection at 1:1,000,000 and in Australia , printed chart VFR route planning would be done over sequential WAC 's , with likely a supplemental VNC chart for the populated areas to be crossed . WAC 's do not contain airspace ( although supposedly an aeronautical chart ! ) . They are essentially a topo map with features that are easy to spot from the air . <URL> So , to answer the OP 's question - no , there are no free online sources for Australian government produced charts . SkyVector shows a very data sparse US Sectional-like view of Australia but I would n't use it for anything other than simple distance/leg planning . However , all of the previously mentioned chart types for Australia are now encapsulated and adjoined in a single app known as OzRunways . I have no association with them , other than being a customer . Another answer has also referred to this as well . OzRunways works on both iOS and Android and in my experience seems very widely used amongst Australian VFR pilots . For VFR use , they provide a so-called ' Hybrid VFR Map ' which simply uses the most detailed chart available . Price at time of writing is about AUD $ 100 and chart-wise also has New Zealand and Papua New Guinea . But also of value to pilots flying in Australia , there is comprehensive airfield information available in the ERSA ( EnRoute Supplement Australia ) , which is a <URL> . It lists technical aspects/refueling contacts/etc . for every sizeable airfield in Australia . In addition to this , AOPA also publish a pilot guide for various airfields . OzRunways contains the ERSA and for an extra amount , they also will bundle the pilot 's guide . I would value any other comments about VFR chart sources for Australia but hopefully this is a good overview .
This question was answered in an earlier ( 2013 ) message . Generally , if you are ferrying an airplane and are compensated as a commercial pilot , are not carrying passengers or cargo for hire , you are operating under Part 91 of the US federal aviation regulations . That you are a paid ferry pilot is not relevant . See 19 CFR 122.1 ( d ) A " commercial aircraft " is any aircraft transporting passengers or cargo for money or other consideration . As you are not transporting passengers or cargo ( both of which would be covered under the commercial operator rules ) or you have a passenger as a friend or the aircraft owner who does not pay for passage , you are ferrying an aircraft which is covered as a private flight . Make absolutely certain you understand how the US eAPIS system applies to you as a foreign national bringing the aircraft into the US , and you have appropriate documentation and the owner is prepared to jump through whatever hoops Customs needs to get the aircraft ashore . The US Customs Guide for Private Flyers is a useful reference . Simon , I disagree with your understanding . There are many operations which are not commercial , with paid pilots . An example of this is a corporation owns an airplane which requires a pilot . The corporation can hire a pilot to fly its airplane and carry its parts/executives/employees / friends . While the pilot must carry a commercial certificate and carry at least a Class II medical certificate , the flight is not considered a commercial flight , nor is the the company considered a commercial operator since it does not hold out its aircraft for hire , unless its in the air carriage business . If on the other hand that same aircraft owner decided to carry the company next door 's freight and executives and charge them for it , that changes the story .

I think one thing that does not get emphasized enough : Pilots do not land airplanes!In fact , we try to keep the airplane flying as long as possible ! We systematically rob the airplane of energy ( energy from engine power , energy from airspeed , energy from altitude ) until the plane can no longer fly , and settles gently on the runway . But even as the plane is landing , the pilot is still trying to coax it back into the air to remove as much energy as possible . A big student mistake is to point the airplane at the runway , and try to force it to land there . That leads to landings too fast , too high , big bounces , porpoising , and sometimes nose-in crashes . So do n't think about " how am I going to land this thing ? " Instead think about " How am I going to remove more energy from the equation to lose altitude and airspeed ? " A landing is a series of precise targets you are aiming to hit , each with less energy than the last one ( but each one still with enough energy to keep flying and be safe ) Each target consists of Position ( horizontal and altitude ) , airspeed , and descent rate . You hit each of these targets at 3 different points on a square ( abeam the numbers , downwind-to-base , and base-to-final ) Hitting a target that consists of a position + airspeed + descent rate is not easy ! But the more precisely you can hit each target , the easier the next part is . Although I hope I 'm repeating the same instructions you 've already heard , for the sake of the Site , let me re-iterate the standard instructions for a C-172 . Be level at TPA ( airport + 1000 feet ) , and at a cruise speed of approximately 100 kts . The runway should be approx 3/4 of the way up your strut . When you are abeam the numbers , Carb Heat ( if applicable ) , throttle back to approx 1,600 RPM , and pull-back as necessary to maintain altitude ( the consequence will be that you slow down ) . Watch your speed , altitude and position . Drop flaps 10 & deg ; when speed allows , and aim to hit a speed of 85 kts , an altitude loss of 250 feet , and have the numbers at 45 & deg ; behind you , all at the same time . Turn the corner to base , using approximately 30 & deg ; of bank angle . Continue to reduce speed ( by pulling back ) to hit 75 kts , and drop altitude another 250 ft. ( you 're now 500 ft above the runway ) . Add Flaps 20 when appropriate . Turn the corner to final . You can " oval " your turn if you are undershooting the centerline , but do NOT over-bank if you have overshot the centerline . Aim for the centerline , acquire a PAPI/VASI , keep an eye on your airspeed relative to approach speed ( 68 kts ) . Watch 3 and ONLY 3 things : Airspeed ( Slowing towards 68 kts ) Centerline ( left ? right ? on target ? ) Slope ( PAPI/VASI ? Light configuration ) . Keep repeating " Airspeed , Centerline , Slope " out loud , describe if you 're too far/too close on each one , and describe how you 're going to correct . For example : " Airspeed : 75 kts ; too fast ; pulling back to slow down " " Centerline : Left of center ; coming slightly right " " Slope : 3 red +1 white is too low ; adding power to slow descent " ( repeat ! ) When the runway is made , drop final flaps , engine to idle , and prepare to flare when you 're about 10-15 feet , and hopefully right at the numbers . Remember that your altitudes are 1000 , 750 , 500 , touchdown . And your airspeeds are 85 , 75 , 65 .
FAA <URL> talks a little about this ( you want Appendix 2 , " Wind Analysis " ) . Basically you start by figuring out what kind of aircraft you want to operate at the airport , and establishing some basic wind limits ( specifically , the maximum crosswind and tailwind components you want to deal with ) . Then you call up NOAA 's " National Climate Data Center " , tell them where you 're looking to build your airport , and see if they can have wind data for the location you 're looking to build on . If NOAA does n't have data you have a couple of other options -- another nearby airport 's wind analysis can be used ( if the topography does n't vary that much and the wind analysis is " recent " ) , or you may have to perform a wind survey which basically means placing a <URL> on the site to record the wind speed and direction for a year . Armed with collected wind data you tally up the number of observations in given wind speed ranges and mark them down on a " wind rose " . You then place your runway ( s ) on the wind rose so that they 're aligned with the prevailing winds and determine your " wind coverage " - the amount of time the winds at your site are within your crosswind and tailwind limits . The advisory circular I linked to shows you how to do this by hand , but there 's also software to do this which is how most folks do it . <URL> which will generate the wind rose and runway/crosswind limit bars for you . Note that this is just the wind part . As you 've alluded to there are a number of other considerations , like terrain : If the prevailing winds favor runway 36 , but runway 36 points right at a mountain a mile from the field you might have to align the runway 33 or 03 and sacrifice a perfect headwind for not having pilots fly into the mountain . Also as ratchet mentioned the airspace around your proposed site may influence your runway layout and types of operations . <URL> and a process to go through to ensure that your airport is not deemed <URL> . Also as you alluded to in your question there are other considerations like density altitude ( local temperature and humidity trends ) which will influence design factors like runway length - there 's another advisory circular ( <URL> ) that talks about runway design criteria , including length considerations . For even more than you ever wanted to know about airport design you can check out <URL> , which all deal with airports in some way ( there are ACs on design , construction , markings , lighting , ARFF , and even how to qualify for and obtain federal aid ) .
<URL> looks like it goes back to 2005 . My favorite weather site <URL> has historical data . It seems like you need to plug in dates one at a time but there are plenty of ways to skim a page and im sure you can ask them for a data dump if you know what you need .
end question
start question
Are control inputs different during autorotation ?
Yes and yes . A certification requirement of helicopters with powered controls is that they have a manual reversion so that control can be maintained in the event of a power failure . However , the controls can be really heavy with no power and accidents have occurred when hydraulics have failed at critical moments or pilots have lifted off with hydraulics off and have been caught by suprise with the effort needed to maintain control . The control inputs during autorotation are the same . For any given glide , or flare , the lift required is the same powered or unpowered . Lift is proportional to the speed of the blades , which is independent of powered or unpowered , and the angle of attack . During autorotation , the energy ( power ) going into the rotors is derived from the airflow coming up through the disc . In this sense , an autorotation is still powered but the power comes from the airflow rather than the engine . During autorotation , since the airflow is from below , rather than above , the pitch required is lower for the same angle of attack to generate the same amount of lift . So , the swashplate is lower in autorotation but lowering collective still decreases lift and raising it increases lift . The primary difference is that rather than controlling lift and power , the collective controls rotor speed since increasing pitch increases the angle of attack which increases lift and therefore increases drag , slowing down the rotor . Lowering the collective has the opposite affect . The cyclic control is the same in all respects ( you tilt the rotor thrust in the direction you want to go ) since it increases , or decreases the pitch , and therefore the angle of attack , cyclically . The movement of the swashplate about the X and Y axis is independent of the position of the swashplate in the Z axis . The pedals work in the same way too . In summary , the only difference in the controls is the vertical position of the swashplate .
Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft have what is called envelope protection which is to prevent pilot inputs from exceeding structural limits as well as keep them from getting the aircraft into an upset flight regime ( stall , overbank , etc. ) . The philosophy behind it is that , if the pilots need to perform an extreme maneuver they can be as aggressive with the controls as they want , confident that they wo n't break the plane . Boeing generally disagrees with this approach saying that , in an emergency , the pilot needs to have all possible force at his disposal , even if it breaks the plane . See the <URL> Federico linked to in comments for more on this . Of course , the Airbus system can only provide these protections when systems are all functioning properly . If part of the system is not working the protections are removed . Examples : <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , As far as AA587 , the A-300 is not a fly-by-wire aircraft and does n't have envelope protections . It 's debatable , though , if envelope protection would have helped in that situation . None of the rudder inputs by itself was outside of the structural limitations of the aircraft so the computer would probably not have prevented them . The failure was due to the inputs being made in quick succession which quickly fatigued the composite material of the rudder . The computer can be programmed to know , for instance , how much g-force the structure can take . But it would be difficult to determine what complex combinations of inputs might exceed the strength of the design .
$ V_1 $ is takeoff decision speed . It is based upon : Runway length Temperature Reduced thrust takeoff Takeoff weight Takeoff flap setting If $ V_1 $ is higher than $ V_R $ , then ( as far as I am aware ) , $ V_1 $ will be adjusted to be the same as $ V_R $ . You have to make the decision to takeoff by the time you rotate , so it does not make much sense to have $ V_1 $ higher than $ V_R $ . $ V_2 $ is takeoff safety speed . During a one engine inop takeoff we would accelerate to and climb at this airspeed to our acceleration height ( a height we could level off at and be safe from obstacles while we further accelerate ) . We also referenced certain flap transitions on takeoff to $ V_2 $ ( e.g. $ V_2 +15 $ - flaps 0 ) To address the rest of the question , $ V_1 $ and $ V_2 $ are primarily used in large aircraft . In light twins you also need to be aware of $ V _ { MC } $ . $ V _ { MC } $ is the minimum controllable airspeed with an engine inop . In particular you do not want to be slower than this airspeed during climbout in case of engine failure .
For statically stable aircraft , the canard is a spoiler in disguise . It will create a strong downwash right behind itself , coupled with an upwash outward of $ \ pi $ / 4 of its semispan . With changing angle of attack and lift coefficient , the vertical position and the strength of both up - and downwash will change , so the wing incidence variation over wingspan can be made right for just one angle of attack . Pros The force to effect flight path changes works the right way , so pitch response times of canards are slightly better than those of a conventional configuration . The wing can be further aft , so in short business jets the cabin might not interfere with the wing spar . Cons The induced drag at off-design points is higher than that of a comparable conventional configuration . The bigger lifting surface must keep some stall margin , so the total lift coefficient will be smaller than that of a comparable conventional configuration . In the end , a canard will need more wing area . Control surface deflections will add to the already high lift coefficient of the canard plane , increasing lift demands on the surface with the smallest margins . The highest lift coefficient is needed at the surface with the smaller <URL> . Normally , the reverse would be better . If the engines are mounted below and ahead of the wing , they will be hit by the wake of the canard , reducing intake efficiency and <URL> margins . To make sure that the control surface will be the last thing on the plane to run into compressibility problems , it should have less lift coefficient and more sweep than the wing . In the end , a statically stable canard will have a lower cruise Mach number than a comparable conventional configuration . The landing gear must be made to retract into the fuselage , because the wing is too far behind the center of gravity to allow the gear to retract into the wing . I could go on , but I guess you see by now where this is heading ...
If you know what you 're looking ( sniffing ) for , yes . Avgas 100LL smells like gasoline ( a little different than what you pump into your car , but similar ) . Jet-A smells like kerosene ( not quite " like diesel " , but definitely not like gasoline ) . If you are familiar with how both smell you can tell them apart by odor , and a significant contamination of Avgas with Jet-A could be detected by smell . ( Other tests , like an evaporation test , are more reliable for lower levels of contamination however ) .
I know you said that you do n't think it 's a crosswind , but honestly it most likely is . As the plane speeds up and the wings start to generate more and more lift the plane is more easily affected by cross wind . So , as you speed up , it gets harder and harder to keep the plane straight . Throw in some gusts , and you 're going to get some jerking motions as well . Especially if that gust decreases the lift of the aircraft , the wheels suddenly catch the ground more and the craft is suddenly tugged harder than the pilot anticipated ... Here 's a video of a <URL> that should illustrate the point more .
Looking at the hurricane manuals for a few airports , evacuating flyable aircraft to a safer location tends to be the most common choice . From the <URL> Effective with the issuance of a Storm WARNING and/or Hurricane WARNING : Relocate flyable aircraft to other geographical areas , place under suitable shelter , or secure as appropriate . Also , from the <URL> Upon receipt of a Hurricane Warning , Airside Operations will : Initiate evacuation of all flyable aircraft and post Airfield Operations Senior Agents and Agents in detail to insure compliance and report results .
I 'm not sure if ' most ' airports have this design . I 've seen both cases ( i.e. departures below arrivals and the other way around ) . Atleast for small airports , a few reasons come to mind for having departures above arrivals : If arrivals is on ground floor , the baggage can come easily from the aircraft . This reduces complexity , especially in small airports . Most of the aircraft are boarded using jet bridge - makes sense if they are boarded from first floor ( or above ) ; of course , jet bridges can also be used for disembarking , so this is questionable . The upper floor offers a good view to enjoy while shopping or eating . This maybe the reason as more time is spent in departure . Also , if the arrival is in ground floor , one can simply ' walk out ' as no checks are there ( international flights are a different case ) . None of these arguments are convincing , I guess .
The short answer is that at negative 2 G , the airframe limit for the A7-E , it took little effort to keep your feet on the rudder pedals . In controlled flight there are aircraft limitations on both positive and negative G. I flew the A7-E for the US Navy and have some operational experience that might offer some context to the question . I believe the positive G was limited to somewhere between 7-9 G. Ca n't quite remember the exact number , and it did depend on the external store configuration as well . Newer aircraft have higher G loading capabilities , although the human body has its own limit . Fitness and training can extend the pilots envelope to high G . As mentioned negative G in the A7-E was limited to -2 . There was no issue at these sorts of values keeping your feet on the rudder pedals . It is worth mentioning that the rudder is controlled by the AFCS ( Automatic Flight Control System ) system and so there is no real need to keep your feet on the pedals , although I did use them at times . Negative 2 G 's was hard on the body , and a pilot would come back to the ship with bloodshot eyes after undergoing maneuvers that required this sort of thing . I can think of 3 times that a pilot would find themselves in a negative G environment . I am not including standard acrobatic maneuvers , but more tactical situations . One , and this was n't typical , was during training . At a high altitude you unloaded the aircraft to -2 G 's and set a 45 degree dive . As the airspeed increased it entered an area on the IAS instrument that was no longer valid , and this was close to Mach . The goal was to observe the characteristics of the aircraft when it went supersonic . There was a gentle pitch down as you broke the sound barrier . I did this maneuver once , although I commonly practiced 45 degree dive bombing deliveries . The second , and quite common , situation was a maneuver called a bug out . A bug out was used by a flight to engage other aircraft in air-to-air combat . It was at once a defensive and offensive maneuver . The lead called " Bug out . Bug out , " and the flight went to -2 G 's , unloading the aircraft , and giving up altitude for airspeed . As your adversary turned towards your 6-o'clock the flight would " Pitch back , " and pulling positive G 's , gaining altitude . Trading airspeed for altitude got the aircraft into slower flight where its turn rate could be maximized . The bug out placed the aircraft immediately in free fall with military thrust applied . Rolling inverted and applying positive G 's is like being in a turn in the sense that the positive G bleeds energy . The third situation was a defensive maneuver . At low airspeed and with someone directly on your 6 o'clock the pilot might try to " jink . " Jinking was a last ditch maneuver where the pilot randomly pulled maximum G , and then went full negative G. I used this against an F-14 in a fight , and afterwards the pilot came and told me he could n't get a firing solution . As for uncontrolled flight there is the flat spin which can exert substantial negative G on the pilot . If I remember correctly a flat spin had never been positively observed in an A7-E . It was postulated , however , that given asymmetric wing loading it might be possible . On the other hand the F-14 could enter a flat spin . Talking with pilots who had knowledge about this sort of flight I was told that the negative G could be large enough where it would not be possible to get your hands on the ejection handle , either low or high . Not sure about the feet :) An interesting side note . At times a pilot will find themselves in a high g turn , grunting against the inflated g-suit , and fighting the encroaching tunnel vision . When I found myself here I would pull on the stick a bit more and watch my peripheral vision go dark ( tunnel vision ) . A bit more g and the tunnel got even narrower , until it was like I was looking through a hole . Then I would ease the stick and watch the hole get bigger . Pull back and smaller . Kind of interesting .
No . The transition attitude in a defined area is fixed . For example , in the USA it is 18.000 ft and in many European countries it is 5.000 ft. It 's impossible to have different transition altitudes at one airport , because that would make it impossible to use vertical separation between aircraft close to the transition layer .
The EASA <URL> are all publicly available online . Actually proving that an aircraft meets those criteria will certainly include all the steps you mentioned although exactly what happens probably depends a lot on the specific aircraft and manufacturer .
A <URL> ( MOU ) is n't an aviation term or practice , it 's a general business/legal term for a ' pre-contract ' of some kind . Before two companies commit to a legally binding and perhaps very expensive contract , they 'll often prepare an MOU to make sure that everyone involved has the same understanding of what will be in the contract . That way , there should n't be any big surprises or fundamental disagreements when the real contract is prepared . In the context of aviation , that could be things like how many aircraft will be purchased and when , or what the price is anticipated to be , or anything else that both side consider important . That means that the information in an MOU could be very interesting for other parties ( " can you explain why our competitors are paying you $ 50m less per aircraft than we do ? " ) , so they 're usually confidential . Another common use for MOUs is for PR/Marketing purposes . If two companies are discussing a joint business venture they might come up with an MOU and use it to generate market interest or even raise capital ( " I know we 're a small company but we have an MOU with Boeing to jointly research alternative fuels " ) . Given that background , I do n't think it 's likely that you 'll get any specific answers to your questions . An MOU could include all the things you mentioned but only a real contract is enforceable .
1 ) Why does n't the tower use satellite throughout the flight ? The narrow answer is that the control tower is responsible for a small geographic area . The " tower " does n't want to talk to the craft at other points in the flight , so the need is not there . It only wants to talk to the plane when it is close to the tower 's airspace . Other components of air traffic control that do need to talk with airplanes in flight also divide up regions of the airspace and have radio equipment situated to talk to the necessary craft . A larger answer is that ground control and aircraft communications were under major development for decades before satellite communications were available . The system we use today is heavily based on line-of-sight VHF communication radio over most populated areas . Since these systems are already installed in many thousands of aircraft , changing to something different like satellite communication requires a significant benefit , someone to pay for it , and a lot of time to allow for the change . 2 ) Does a control tower only send voice services through the direct link ? or does it send data as well ? Data is beginning to be sent via <URL> . You can search for CPDLC on this site and find several questions and answers about it , but it is considered only a supplement to the voice communication of ATC today . Are n't there security issues or power safety issues involved in ground to air transmissions ? Unauthorized transmissions are possible , but they are managed and have n't traditionally been a big problem . There 's another question about <URL> . But much of the answer is that since ATC is monitoring the frequency , unauthorized transmissions would be heard and responded to . I 'm sure that future digital delivery will change some of these issues , but that 's likely to be true whether the message is transmitted via local radio transmitters or satellite . Not sure if that 's what you meant by security issues . I 'm not familiar with power safety issues .
First , the precise terms is not fins , but control surfaces . Fins would be fixed but the four rear surfaces can rotate around a spanwise axis . By rotating , they can be positioned at an angle to the airflow , thus deflecting it and creating an opposing force . Compare that to a <URL> . They work in the same way by creating a force normal to their plane . While this force has a vertical and horizontal component , the horizontal components of the single surfaces cancel each other when all surfaces are rotated by the same angle . Their vertical components will add up , creating a pitching moment . When the left and right surfaces are rotated by the opposite angle , their vertical force component will cancel while the horizontal component will add up , thus creating a yawing moment which swings the tail around . If it were to pitch downwards , which fins would need to move and in which direction ? All four surfaces will move trailing edge down , so the resulting force will point up and pitch the whole craft nose down .
During taxiing aircraft turn using their nose wheel . The nose wheel is usually hydraulically controlled . The pilot operates it through a tiller . The nose gear can rotate usually quite far , sometimes to almost 90 degrees . At high speeds , directional control is achieved using the rudder pedals . The nose gear is often linked to the rudder pedals , however the maximum rotation is limited . The nose gear steering does not exactly match to the the rudder steering at all speeds . At low speeds the rudder is ineffective so the nose wheel steering is dominant . For sharp turns the tiller is always used because of the limited rotation by the pedals .

Instrument landing system - ILS - is a very common precision approach system used in airports around the world . An ILS consists of two ground antennas and an airborne received in the aircraft . One of the ground antennas , known as a localiser , transmits a narrow beam along the runway , giving lateral guidance to aircraft approaching the runway . The other antenna , the glide slope , transmits a vertical beam at a specified angle , giving vertical guidance for aircraft approaching . Together , the localiser and glide slope provides aircraft with an exact path to follow toward the runway . <URL> A localiser antenna The main advantage of ILS is that is allows approaches and landings in poor weather conditions . Pilots do not have to visually see the runway until moments before touchdown , because the ILS can guide the plane down very precisely . However , there are different standards of ILS . These are named CAT I , CAT II and CAT III ( CAT III has three additional substandards : CAT IIIa , CAT IIIb and CAT IIIc ) . In order to fly a CAT I approach , the cloud based ( ceiling ) must be no lower than 200 feet and the visibility must be no lower than 550 metres . This is because the pilots must be able to visually identify the runway no later than 200 feet above the ground to be able to land . For a CAT II approach , the ceiling must not be lower than 100 ft and the visibility not less than 350 metres . CAT IIIa has a minimum ceiling of 50 ft and a minimum visibility of 200 metres . CAT IIIb has no minimum ceiling , but there must be at least 50 metres of visibility . For a CAT IIIc , which has not actually been implemented anywhere , there are no minimum limits for ceiling and visibility . As you can see , CAT II or III approaches allow pilots to land is extremely bad weather conditions . So if CAT III is so great , why do n't we use it all the time ? In order to use CAT II/III approaches , a number of conditions have to be met : The ground based ILS equipment must live up to very strict standards , and be very carefully calibrated . As a result , installing and maintaining CAT II/III ILS equipment at an airport is very expensive , so not all airports have it . In addition to the ILS antennas , there are also strict requirements for other runway equipment such as lighting . The aircraft must have special equipment that is certified to perform CAT II/III approaches . Again , cost is a significant factor . Equipping aircraft with such fine tuned equipment is very expensive , and if you mostly fly to areas with good weather , it is probably not worth it . The pilots must be qualified . A normal pilot license is not enough to fly a CAT II/III approach , you need additional training and qualifications to be allowed to perform such approaches . Air traffic control low visibility procedures result in reduced airport capacity . Because ILS signals are transmitted from antennas on the ground , there are risks of interfering with the ILS signal , resulting in imprecise guidance . The main issue is when an aircraft moves in front of the antennas , partly blocking the signal for other aircraft on approach . Because of this , airports have strict rules for how close aircraft may get to ILS antennas when CAT II/III approaches are in use . Aircraft on the ground must hold further away from the runway than they normally would , to stay clear of so called ILS sensitive areas . <URL> An example of ILS sensitive/critical areas at an airport <URL> Separate runway holding points used when CAT II/III approaches are carried out We also need additional space between two aircraft approaching the same runway . This is because the first aircraft , once landed and on the runway , can block parts of the localiser signal for the following aircraft . Because of this , the first aircraft must be clear of the runway by the time the second aircraft joins short final . This means we need extra space between aircraft , resulting in a reduced runway capacity . As you can see , there are a number of factors limiting the use of CAT II/III approaches , which is why they are only used when the weather is so bad that CAT I approaches can not be carried out .
Other folks have already addressed why we want to lock the flight controls when we leave the aircraft - " to prevent damage from gusts of wind " , and " to keep the plane from doing interesting things in a strong breeze " . To the question of the " best " position to lock controls in , for light aircraft the general consensus is that the rudder and ailerons should be locked in the neutral position - In this position any wind blowing over the wings will cause them to lift uniformly , putting tension on the tiedown ropes holding the aircraft to the ground . ( If the ailerons are locked at an angle one wing will generate more lift than the other , allowing one of the tiedown ropes to go slack . ) Elevators are a subject of a little more nuance and debate : It 's generally considered best to lock the elevator in the " nose down " position ( because any gusts of wind over the tail will push the nose down , rather than encouraging the nose to lift , this also means that those gusts will apply tension to a tie-down rope located at the tail rather than causing it to go slack ) . On some aircraft locking the elevator in the nose-down ( or nose-up ) position opens up spaces that birds may try to nest in ( <URL> ) - some pilots prefer to lock the elevator of these aircraft in the neutral position to discourage avian visitors . Generally it 's better to lock the controls than leave them unlocked to bang around in the wind , so on some light aircraft not equipped with control locks pilots use the seatbelt to hold the controls in place . This often results in a " sub-optimal " control position ( elevator fully nose-up , ailerons full-deflection left or right ) , but because the wind speed at which control surfaces may bang against their stops is usually lower than the speed at which the aerodynamically unfavorable control positions will substantially affect the aircraft this is a " lesser of two evils " approach .
The wing planform ( which is the shape and layout of wing ) for each aircraft is mainly based on the aerodynamic requirements . There are other considerations like stealth , controllability etc. . The basic terminology in the wing geometry is given in the figure below . <URL> Source : grc.nasa.gov Most of the wing platforms in use ( or have been used ) fall under one of these categories . Elliptical Aerodynamically , the elliptical planform is the most efficient as elliptical spanwise lift distribution has the lowest possible induced drag ( as given by thin airfoil theory ) . However , the most important disadvantage of the elliptical wing is that its manufacturability is poor . Perhaps the most famous aircraft with elliptical planform is the <URL> , used in Battle of Britan . <URL> " <URL> " by Adrian Pingstone ( <URL> ) - Own work . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . Interestingly , the elliptical wing was not decided to minimize induced drag , but to house the retractable landing gear along with guns and ammunition inside a wing that had to be thin . As per designer Beverly Shenstone , The ellipse was simply the shape that allowed us the thinnest possible wing with room inside to carry the necessary structure and the things we wanted to cram in . And it looked nice . Some aircraft like the <URL> had a semi elliptical wing , with only the leading or trailing edge elliptical . <URL> " <URL> " by Unknown - <URL> . Licensed under CC0 via <URL> . Rectangular Arguably the simplest wing planform from a manufacturing point of view , the rectangular wing is a straight , untapered wing . A good example would be the light general aircraft like <URL> . <URL> " <URL> " . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . The main disadvantage of this wing is that it is aerodynamically inefficient . Tapered Wing This is a modification of the rectangular wing where the chord is varied across the span to approximate the elliptical lift distribution . While not as efficient as the elliptical lift distribution , it offers a compromise between manufacturability and efficiency . A very good example of aircraft using this type of wing is the North American <URL> , which became the premier USAAF escort fighter against the Luftwaffe . <URL> " <URL> " . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . Constant Chord with Tapered Outer This is midway between the rectangular and the tapered wing , with the inner part having constant chord and the outer part having a taper . A very good example of this type of wing is the <URL> . <URL> Source : Almost all of the wings seen so far are used in subsonic aircraft due to the large drag caused by them in the transonic regime . Most of the wings used in supersonic aircraft fall under one of the following categories . Delta The delta is a very low aspect ratio wing used in supersonic aircraft , most notably in the European designs . The main advantages of the delta wing is that is efficient in all the flight regimes ( subsonic , transonic and supersonic ) . Also , the wing offers a large wing area for the shape , reducing wing loading and improving maneuverability . The delta wing design is also very strong structurally , offering large volume for internal fuel . The delta wings are also quite simple to build and maintain . The main disadvantages are that they have high induced drag due to low aspect ratio and also that they should have high angle of attack at low speeds ( takeoff and landing ) , mainly due to fact that at these speeds , lift is generated by vortices . To compensate for this , they have high stall angles . A very good example for this wing is the Dassault <URL> , which is an example of tailless delta i.e. without horizontal stabilizers . <URL> Source : www.aircraftrecognition.co.uk A variant of the delta wing used in some aircraft is the one with horizontal stabilizer ( tailed delta ) , the most famous of them being the Russian <URL> . <URL> Source : hdwallpapers.cat Another variant is the one used by the <URL> , the so called cropped delta , where the tips of the delta are ' cut off ' to reduce drag at high angles of attack . <URL> " <URL> " by <URL> - Own work . Licensed under GFDL via <URL> . Yet another variant of the delta wing ( this planform is very popular in combat aircraft ) , is the so called double delta , where the leading edge angle is not constant , but has two different values . One good example of this is the <URL> ' Tejas ' under development in India . <URL> " <URL> " by Rinju9 - Own work . Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via <URL> . Trapezoidal The trapezoidal wing is a high performance configuration such that the leading edge sweeps back and the trailing edge sweeps forward . This is mostly found in combat aircraft from the US . This wing configuration offers efficient supersonic flight and has very good stealth characteristics . However , the wing loading is quite high , resulting in reduced maneuverability , especially instantaneous turn rate . This wing configuration is used most notably in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor . <URL> " <URL> " by
My thesis , which I wrote so long ago that I no longer recall the title , was a complete redesign of the Boeing 747 cockpit from a human factors and usability point of view . My designs , which were submitted to Boeing at the time , likely helped create the foundation for the modern glass fly-by-wire cockpit . At the time , glass cockpits did not exist ( the term refers to the glass in the CRT monitors that were eventually used within the cockpit , later replaced by LCD displays ) . Fly-by-wire , which is the concept of replacing conventional flight controls with an electronic interface , was in its infancy . I remember working tirelessly to create a comprehensive new human interface for pilots that would minimize errors and improve safety . My research was based in the cognitive sciences , which consisted of university coursework in human physiology , neuroanatomy ( rudimentary at the time ) , psychology , statistics , engineering , computer science , mathematics , linguistics , neural networks ( the very first ones ) , and artificial intelligence . It was a rigorous and diverse education . I spent hours and hours watching films of pilots performing a vast array of different procedures . Sometimes they were successful , and sometimes they were not . When they were not , it often resulted in serious consequences . I spent long nights listening to hour after hour of dialog between air traffic controllers and pilots . I studied detailed accident and near-accident reports . I also interviewed pilots and spent a fair amount of time inside commercial cockpits , between flights , gathering essential data . One of the challenges that I vividly recall was reducing complexity for pilots , while keeping the tasks difficult enough so they would stay engaged to their tasks and not fall asleep or become distracted . The most rewarding part of developing my thesis was converting the cockpit from what I called a control-based center to a task-based center . Up until that time , most controls available to pilots were designed to directly impact a flight control surface such as the rudder . There were some rudimentary " intelligent " controls to perform basic horizontal and vertical navigation ( but nothing that integrated the two ! ) . I designed a new system that was based on high level tasks that the pilot would need to perform . No longer were ailerons , elevators , flaps , and thrust the focus . Instead , I changed the focus of the cockpit to center on essential tasks such as taking off , landing , route planning , communications , and traffic and weather avoidance . During this work , I learned that I had to seamlessly integrate my human factors engineering and user experience design skills . In my opinion , and from my personal experience , they always need to be . Whenever I fly , I ask to take a look at the cockpit after we land . It 's a joy to see the evolution of my designs . Whether I was the originator of these designs or one of many human factors engineers who came up with them at the same time , I will never know . But similarities of the current designs to what I proposed in my thesis many years ago gives me a little insight into a possible answer to that question .
I do n't know specifically for a CFM56 , but in general : fan blades are usually identified by a dimple on the spinner ( blade # 1 is next to the dimple and number from there ) . High pressure compressor blades can be identified by special " locking " blades , which will look different from the others . They will have screws in them to " lock " them into place . These line up with a feature on the rotor , so they are always in the same place . Locking blade will be # 1 and number from there . I 'm not sure how high pressure turbine blades are identified . LPT blades are usually identified by finding the # 1 fan blade and rotating it down to bottom dead center . Then the LPT blade at bottom dead center is considered blade # 1 .

Are STOL kits that use leading edge slats available for ' typical ' GA aircraft ?
Lowering stall speed is not a benefit in itself , it 's only a benefit if it you need it . There are STOL kits for many airplanes , you do n't see them much on most airplanes because there 's no real benefits in normal flying and they cost a fair chunk of money to install . STOL kits only get you so far , adding a STOL kit onto an airplane with a 50 kt stall speed will not give you a 25kt stall speed , it 's a lot less than that . If you have a bush airplane , fly into very short fields or in high density altitudes then a STOL kit can give you extra capabilities . If you do n't fly into very short fields then a STOL kit is extra weight and costs for capabilities you wo n't use . It 's also not as simple as simply sticking some extra bits on the front of the wing , there 's many considerations . For one , if you drop an airplane 's stall speed substantially then you will run into control authority issues at slow speed . You will have to beef up the ailerons , rudder and elevator to compensate , which is a substantial re-design , adding costs . The most popular STOL kits are for airplanes which already are good STOL aircraft to begin with and have adequate control authority .
In the United States moored balloons ( or kites ) are governed under <URL> ( a much neglected and very short corner of the regulations that also covers amateur rocketry and " unmanned free balloons " -- looking at your profile it 's probably a section you 'd find very interesting ! ) . In this particular case you 're probably looking for <URL> . The FAA is mum on the specific engineering requirements of mooring systems - I expect they anticipate you will work with structural and mechanical engineers to design a tethering system that can safely hold the loads your moored object will place on it ( or just tie it to the biggest , most structurally secure thing you can find , with a nice heavy rope and a proper knot ) . There are a few things they ARE pretty specific about though . Some operating limitations ( altitude , size , location , visibility ) . The fact that you have to tell them about it in advance ( At least if it 's more than 150 feet AGL , per ) Lighting and marking requirements for the tether ( s ) ( , which basically says the mooring line must have pennants ( daytime ) and/or lights ( nighttime ) to ensure visibility ) What happens to Balloons if the tether breaks ( , which basically says if the balloon breaks free of its moorings you need a " rapid deflation device " that gets it down in a hurry so it 's not just wandering around up there ) . Interestingly they do n't seem to care so much if a kite escapes its moorings .
Well , yes . Variable shape wings ( or variable geometry ) have a number of uses , primarily in being able to optimize the shape of the wing to an ideal form for the regime of flight . The idea is n't new ; birds , bats and other flying creatures twist and warp the shape of their wings in order to maneuver and generate thrust as these pigeons demonstrate . <URL> The Wright Brothers used a warping wing box on their gliders and the 1903 flyer . Orville Wright is said to have come up with the idea while twisting a rectangular cardboard box used to ship bicycle tire inner tubes . The chief advantages to such a design are that it provides an extremely clean airframe , aerodynamic wise , without joints , separate control surfaces , moving parts , etc which create excess drag . In addition , the aircraft shape can automatically be optimized to the altitudes , speeds and Mach numbers desired without tradeoffs for weight or performance required with aircraft made from conventional materials . The downside to warping wings is solving the problem of finding materials which could be flexible and change their shape and then remain rigid and immutable under aerodynamic loads . Wood and metal airframes lacked the capability to do this successfully . Early attempts to solve this problem have been to make ' swing wing ' designs where the wing can be rotated at the wing root to an optimal sweep in flight . The Bell X-5 successfully demonstrated this concept and it has been used on a number of military aircraft including the F-111 , F-14 , MiG-23 / 27 , B-1 , and SU-22 . NASA is currently developing a morphing wing for these reasons . If successful and shown to be feasible from a manufacturing and service standpoint , it would be a game changer . <URL>
According to <URL> , the problem is not the retraction of the slats/flaps but instead turning the ADIRS ( air data inertial reference units ) off . The RTLU is designed to operate in a feedback loop , where its position is controlled based on input from the FACS ( Flight Augmentation Computers , which take input from the ADIRS ) . If the ADIRS go offline while the slats are extended , the RTLU goes into a " emergency return to low speed " mode . This allows maximum rudder travel by driving the RTLU to mechanical stops . If this happens regularly it can cause damage to the stops . This appears to be related to the <URL> crash . Although this issue was not one of the main contrbuting factors , <URL> lists this as one of the Technical Followups ( TFUs ) that Airbus issued as a result of the investigation . It improves the reliability of the RLTU , the failure of which was cited by the investigation . See this related question for more on the function of the RTLU in the flight control system : <URL>
As Andy pointed out , this question is very broad ( even if we 're only talking about India ) . Your starting point should be <URL> because they can tell you definitively what would be involved in getting a " homebuilt " aircraft approved to fly under Indian law . <URL> and is broadly similar to the FAA 's " Experimental : Amateur-Built " certification requirements : The aircraft needs to be constructed in accordance with the DGCA 's acceptable methods , techniques , and practices . Basically this means you ca n't use chewing gum as a structural fastener : The aircraft needs to be safe to fly . The aircraft will be inspected by a DGCA representative prior to being allowed to fly . Note that the DGCA inspection is mainly looking for " obviously unsafe " conditions - they do n't do a teardown inspection so if you used chewing gum as a structural fastener and subsequently that area is covered up by a wing skin the inspector wo n't know , but you will when the wing falls off on your test flight . You will need the DGCA to issue you a Certificate of Airworthiness before you can fly the aircraft around - that certificate is contingent on completing required test flights at the airport where the aircraft is based/built . You will need an appropriate pilot 's license ( and medical certificate if applicable ) in order to fly the aircraft ( this is also required to conduct the Certificate of Airworthiness test flights mentioned previously ) .
No , no restrictions on using an afterburner . There are a few <URL> on the civil registration that must use the afterburner to take off . However , most countries forbid supersonic flight by non military operated aircraft in their airspace . The only time Concorde went supersonic was over the ocean .
According to <URL> they used to be very customizable , but not very much interchangeable at least to the point that no one bothered to change them on second-hand aircraft . They are reducing it because it only causes confusion . Aircraft change owners and pilots change employers and it 's most useful if all aircraft of the same type have the same cockpit layout . As far as 787 goes , it has very similar flight deck to 777 , always , to the point it has <URL> .
Here it is : <URL> . At about 8 p.m. British Airways Flight 112 , traveling from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Heathrow Airport in London , diverted to Bangor after smoke was discovered in the cockpit . Story was published on June 10th , 2004 . Article says Wednesday night , so it should have happened on June 9th . Both the <URL> and the NTSB do n't have any reports . It must have been a minor issue . Just a <URL> , fuel leak on departing Heathrow .
Low volume , high liability , and the overhead of certification all contribute to the high price of factory-new aircraft . Certification The process to design , build , and test an aircraft to receive a type certificate from the FAA adds time and cost to any new clean-sheet design ( substantially more cost if the design is novel in some way ) . The design and construction techniques must conform to the requirements in the FARs , and you have to demonstrate conformance to FAA inspectors ( who will also want to see you assemble a few planes under their oversight before issuing you a production certificate to go ahead and make them on your own ) . Volume 50 + year old designs like the Piper PA-28 and Cessna 172 that are still in production on an approved type certificate avoid that cost , but are still a low-volume high-touch product : <URL> . Because of the relatively low demand ( and thus low sales volume ) the cost of the skilled personnel to build aircraft is n't spread out the way it is with cars ( and the investment in large-scale low-touch automation is n't economically feasible ) . That drives up the manufacturing cost , and the price goes up with it to ensure the manufacturer is still making a profit . Similar economies of scale affect all the third-party parts going into new planes as well : radios , instruments , lights , etc. that conform to applicable FAA Technical Standard Orders ( TSOs ) are rather expensive . Liability Finally , any new aircraft starts a new 18-year liability period for the manufacturer . Any accident that results in whole or in part from manufacturer errors , omissions , or negligence in a new aircraft can come back to haunt that manufacturer in the form of a lawsuit , so the cost of product liability insurance is baked into the price of every new aircraft . ( After 18 years the manufacturer is off the hook thanks to the <URL> . ) All of these factors take the Searey from being a \ $ 50,000 kit ( airframe , engine , and propeller ) to a \ $ 150,000 factory-built Light Sport aircraft , and that is putting it on the market as a Light Sport aircraft under " consensus industry standards " . Producing it as a Part 23 certificated aircraft would add the additional cost and requirements of FAA certification . ( I 'm using the Searey as a convenient example since you mentioned it in your question and I could find kit and factory-built pricing easily , but other light sport aircraft available in both kit and factory models seem to stack up similarly . I do n't know of any that have been subsequently " upgraded " to a Part 23 aircraft : Only a few manufacturers have successfully launched that sort of product , and those command rather substantial prices on the new market . )
Besides the main points you mentioned , I can think of a couple things , the first is sort of related to your point # 1 . Airplanes are designed to be easy to service . Cars are less so . Cars only have a few very expensive parts , mainly the drivetrain ( engine and transmission ) . If either of those needs to be replaced in an older car , it can easily cost more than the car is worth . Airplanes are much more complex , and have a larger number of expensive components . The engines of most airliners are designed to be removed relatively quickly . Although the engines tend to be the most expensive part , replacing an engine is nowhere near the total cost of the airplane , and there is generally a good pool of engines out there for parts and replacement ( just look at how many JT8D engines are still in service ) . In GA aircraft , it is easier for a repair to cost more than the airplane is worth . However , the more comprehensive maintenance required on aircraft means that this kind of repair is less likely to be needed . Also , while its usually easy to go out and replace a broken car with a comparable new or used one , the aircraft market is n't as large . New aircraft tend to be much more expensive , and the used market is more limited . Another reason is that airplanes can have more unique qualities than cars . For example , there are original 737s flying in Canada because they are able to operate from gravel runways . There are just more combinations of sizes and capabilities in airplanes than with cars . Many times , it is only economical to replace those aircraft ( both for the builder and the buyer ) in very long cycles .
Does this vortex draw in air from above , pulling it downward and as a result lifting the plane up ? Yes , the bound vortex in combination with translational flow accelerates air downwards . Or is the vortex shed downward off the tail of the wing ? How does this work ? A vortex has no beginning and no end . When the wing begins to move , the vortex starts out of nowhere and has four parts : The bound vortex which travels with the wing , one parallel starting vortex which stays in place and two free vortices which connect both , running from the wingtips to the point where the wingtips were when the wing started moving . To be precise , an infinite number of vortices of infinitely small strength is created , and some cover only the center of the wing while others run over most of the wingspan . <URL> Idealized vortex structure ( own work ) . The wing moves to the left with the speed v . The vortices are shown as discrete lines - to be precise , the bound vortices should be a sheet of infinitesimally small vortices which extend both over the chord and the span of the wing . Chordwise , they bunch together close to the leading edge , so their average streamwise position is at one quarter of the wing 's chord . And now let me give you my advice : If you do not want to operate or to write a potential flow code , do yourself a favor and forget all that . <URL> why you must endure the vortex explanation of lift , and <URL> for a much more intuitive explanation of it all . If by leading edge vortex you mean the <URL> , this is a result of flow separation . The inertia of the air molecules makes it impossible for them to flow around the leading edge , and they jump off the contour , leaving a volume of lower pressure behind . This pressure bends their flow path towards the wing and sucks the aircraft upwards . Since more air follows the same pattern downstream , the whole air above the wing starts to rotate while it flows downstream . This low pressure area sucks more air in from above , just like the regular low pressure region over a straight wing does . Along and past the inner part of the wing this downward motion is prevalent and keeps the air spinning like the <URL> from a straight wing .
When using an airfoil with a sharp leading edge in subsonic regime , you need to adapt the angle of attack so that the <URL> occurs right on the sharp edge . At every flight condition there should be an AoA which achieves this . Higher AoA , and the stagnation point is too low . To low AoA , and the stagnation point is too high . However flight conditions change frequently , so the required AoA changes dynamically as well . Since AoA also drives the lift and lift is the priority in a pilot 's mind ( he wants to keep flying after all ) , stagnation point will only occasionally match the leading edge . During flight the AoA will often fail to match the stagnation point , let 's say with too high AoA , separation would occur below the leading edge ( on the " intrados " ) . This is the only good illustration I could find : <URL> Source : The University of Sydney ( Australia ) The stagnation point is at the tip of the only grey line that stops right on the black plate . Basically all incoming flow between these leading edge and stagnation point ( unfortunately no line shows this on the picture ) will follow this trajectory : Incoming at high speed onto the airfoil , below leading edge , going towards the stagnation point , but aims just slightly higher up . The stagnation point is the point of highest pressure , so the incoming flow slows down Comes a point where the slowdown is sufficient to actually reverse the flow which now shoots up along the surface towards the leading edge , now driven by the pressure from stagnation point Arriving at the leading edge from below the flow needs to do a U-turn around the leading edge to keep following the wing shape and flow towards the " extrados " and keep on with its life . Therein lies the problem : when finally arriving at the leading edge , the air has non-zero speed ( zero speed only occurs at stagnation point , of which there is only one ) , but must instantly reverse it . Physics says nope , and you get a large leading edge vortex to smooth the motion out . Unfortunately that is also called a flow separation bubble , which may became a stall . This is : bad for performance ( drag ) bad for safety ( stallable ) bad for comfort ( vibration from the eddies ) bad for structure ( vibration fatigue ) Why does it only happen in subsonic flight ? At supersonic speeds , information can not travel back on the flow using the same pressure gradient trick , once the air is on the intrados/extrados , it stays there , and can not back up the other way . So no ' adaptation ' is possible , regardless of AoA . Why use rounded leading edge to remedy this in subsonic ? With a rounded edge , the U-turn is not so sharp , it is actually manageable for the air . This means you 'll not always have flow separation , so you 're safe . The rounder , the easier larger the range of AoA stay " adapted " . TL ; DR It 's possible to fly subsonic with sharp leading edge , but less safe and lower performance . The key is AoA adaptation .
The vortex generators are used in commercial aircraft ( Boeing especially ) , for a number of reasons , which are usually not applicable to GA aircraft . For example , vortex generators are used for anything from stall alleviation to <URL> to noise reduction , some of which are not applicable for GA aircraft . Also , they are <URL> , which is much more expansive compared to the GA aircraft . That said , vortex generators are found in some aircraft , like the Piper Malibu Meridian , as shown below , <URL> . <URL> Image from www.nasa.gov Another point is the a <URL> for GA aircraft . A number of GA aircraft have been retrofitted with them . <URL> By Ahunt at English Wikipedia - I took this photo and release it to the public domain , Public Domain However , they are quite costly and require extensive tests for certification , with the result that they are not used much compared to commercial aircraft .
Per definition the moment coefficient in the Aerodynamic Centre is independent of the angle of attack . Since the airfoil is symmetrical , the moment around the a.c. , $ M _ { a.c. } $ for an angle of attack $ \ alpha $ will be of equal magnitude and opposite sign at angle of attack $ - \ alpha $ : $ M _ { a.c. } ( \ alpha ) = - M _ { a.c. } ( - \ alpha ) $ The two statements can only hold if $ M _ { a.c. } = 0 $
A typical discovery flight is about a 30 minute on the ground introduction to the airplane and the cockpit controls , followed by a sightseeing flight of 30-minutes to one-hour . The entire process typically lasts 1 to 2 hours . During the flight , the instructor will have the controls for takeoff , navigation and landing , but may turn the controls over to the passenger for some gentle , easy maneuvers . You can expect to ask numerous questions and have them answered , but you wo n't learn a whole lot about actual flying in a short session . I would advise you to keep your questions to the flight training process , rather than specifics about flying that need more detailed explanations . Some good questions may be : How much ground school does it take to get a license ? How much flight time does it take to get a license ? What are some important milestones along the way to getting a license ? Will I have the same instructor throughout my training ? What supplies do I need for training ? How much should I expect to spend ?
You are missing the weight force . The wing should stall first because then it will produce less lift and the weight will make the aircraft pitch down . In attached flow , the lift from wing and tail is <URL> such that the combined resulting force is acting exactly at the longitudinal position of the center of gravity . If the wing stalls , the balance of lift is shifted backwards ( regardless of the tail producing lift or a downforce ) , because now the forward part of the wing-tail-combination will produce proportionally less lift than it did in attached flow . The center of gravity will then be ahead of the resulting lift force and will pull the nose of the aircraft down . A tail stall is bad news for the pilot and should be avoided : A stalled tail will have much less elevator effectivity , reducing the control power available to the pilot A stalled tail at high angle of attack is stalling at maximum lift , so it produced positive lift before . If it stalls , its lift will shrink and make the aircraft pitch up . In a conventional configuration the tail flies in the flow field of the wing . Because the wing 's <URL> , the angle of attack variations at the tail are reduced . This helps to keep the flow at the tail attached over the whole useable angle of attack range of the wing . A tail stall is either caused by a wrong location of the center of gravity ( CG ) or by a very poor transsonic design which causes <URL> when the wing is still doing fine . Very rarely can you stall the tail by a wrong trim setting when a <URL> , or in a <URL> . Some supersonic aircraft compensate for the backward shift of the center of lift in supersonic flow by pumping fuel from forward to rear . If an airplane with such a rear CG location slows down to subsonic speed , it will need to produce proportionally more lift with the tail than with the wing . If it now pitches up ( say , for a tight turn ) it will risk a tail stall . Note that such a configuration is <URL> at subsonic speed . EDIT : Now you define the center of gravity as ahead of the wing , which makes for a very stable configuration . The tail is producing a downforce to compensate the pitch-down action of the wing 's lift . If the wing stalls first , lift will become less than weight and the aircraft will accelerate downwards . Now the angle of attack will increase at both the tail and the wing ; at the tail even for two reasons : The downward acceleration will change the local flow direction to a larger angle of attack , and The diminished downwash from the wing will cause an angle of attack increase of its own at the tail . This effect takes a little longer to manifest itself : The delay is the distance between the quarter points of tail and wing divided by the airspeed . Both effects will quickly create a dominant pitch-down moment for the aircraft because the tail will contribute much less downforce than before the stall , and the diminished pitch-down moment of the wing will become insignificant .
A crew that consists of the basic required cockpit crew for the aircraft plus relief crew for long flights is called an " augmented flight crew . " As far as I know , this designation is used by ICAO , the FAA , and the EASA ( and likely others . ) <URL> defines augmented flight crew as : Augmented flight crew . A flight crew that comprises more than the minimum number required to operate the aeroplane and in which each flight crew member can leave his or her assigned post and be replaced by another appropriately qualified flight crew member for the purpose of in-flight rest . The FAA 's Federal Aviation Regulations define it nearly identically in <URL> : Augmented flightcrew means a flightcrew that has more than the minimum number of flightcrew members required by the airplane type certificate to operate the aircraft to allow a flightcrew member to be replaced by another qualified flightcrew member for in-flight rest .
The FAA <URL> defines ' standard rate turn ' as , A turn of three degrees per second . This results in the completion of a full circle in 2 minutes . Every airplane must be able to complete a standard rate turn in order to be certified . The standard rate of turn is used as the main reference for bank angle . GA aircraft are expected to turn at the standard rate of turn during holding , intercepting , tracking , approaches , departures etc. . You 're correct that the airspeed determines the turn rate . As the turn rate is standardized , the bank angle becomes dependent on the air speed . From FAA-H-8083-15A Instrument Flying Handbook , True airspeed determines the angle of bank necessary to maintain a standard-rate turn . A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle of bank required for a standard-rate turn is to divide your airspeed by 10 and add one-half the result . For example , at 60 knots , approximately 9 ° of bank is required ( 60 ÷ 10 = 6 + 3 = 9 ) ; at 80 knots , approximately 12 ° of bank is needed for a standard-rate turn .
( This is a US-based answer . ) There 's no statistical information that I could find out there about this , but aircraft type , total hours , hours in type , age , previous claims etc. are all factored into the premium as well , so it 's hard to make a simple comparison based on one variable . And as AOPA <URL> : Not all carriers have the same guidelines for when they will offer a premium reduction . But having said all that , it looks like an instrument rating is the key qualification to get . AOPA 's <URL> recommends it : Typical actions you can take to reduce your rates include : [ ... ] Obtain an instrument rating . I guess you could go through AOPA 's <URL> multiple times with different data to see what premiums come out , but just calling them is probably easier . <URL> is a well-known aviation insurer and they 're more specific . The wording is bit awkward but <URL> an instrument rating reduces your premium with them by 10 % : Q : Is there any type of additional training that would lower my premiums ? A : [ ... ] obtain an upgraded certificate or Instrument Rating and you become eligible for the full 10 % savings . They do n't say what an " upgraded certificate " means , but if you 're one of the few people who have a commercial certificate but no instrument rating then perhaps that would count . Other insurance companies also say that advanced ratings can reduce your rates ( <URL> , <URL> ) . Finally , I can add a couple of comments from personal experience . I have AOPA renter 's insurance and it 's flat rate : your certification and experience do n't matter at all . Second , when I was looking for life insurance , having an instrument rating cut my premiums a lot but it was a while ago and I ca n't remember the exact numbers . I do remember that they were reluctant to even consider me without it .
On a low wing monoplane you 'll need a pump all the time . There will be a mechanical pump fitted to the engine for the purpose . On a high-wing monoplane the engine is often gravity feed . However , during critical phases of flight ( specifically take-off and landing ) you would n't want to have that fail so a second auxiliary electric pump is fitted that the pilot switches on beforehand and can switch off once that phase is over . The Pilot 's Operating Manual will give specific recommendations for use on any given type .

What happens if a passenger dies mid-flight ?
In the event of a passenger dying on an airplane during flight , each case is different depending on the location of the airplane , the duration of that flight and the wishes of family or friends traveling with the deceased passenger . What happens to the flight ? If the death occurs before takeoff or shortly after takeoff , the airplane is landed back to that airport or the nearest airport . If it happens mid-flight , normally the flight is continued to its destination . Where is the deceased passenger placed ? If there is a seat available in first or business classes , the deceased person is moved there and covered with a blanket . If it is a full flight , that person may simply be strapped in more tightly and covered . This is done to ensure that the body is out of view of other passengers . A deceased person is never placed in the lavatory . It is not respectful and a major security concern . What happens at arrival airport ? The arrival airport is informed in advance about the situation . Hence police , ambulance and coroner are available . Some airlines keep body bags on board . Normally the deceased person is placed on a stretcher and is carried from the rear exit of the airplane using a lift truck and then placed in an ambulance . This might be done after other passengers have exited the airplane . What are the regulations ? FAA have regulations addressing several emergencies , but not specifically this one . An FAA spokesperson <URL> : FAA spokesman Les Dorr said he was unaware of any policies that specifically address what should be done if someone dies in flight . The airlines make those decisions on their own . <URL> mentions some incidents of this situation happening . <URL> is a company which provides airlines with medical help from emergency care doctors on the ground . They <URL> : ... there is one death for every 8 million passengers from the airlines [ they ] serve ...
Passengers are counted before the plane leaves the gate . Since everyone 's boarding pass is scanned at the gate , they know how many passengers should be on board . If that number does not match , it may be a red flag that someone has sneaked out . The missing passenger can usually be located as using the lavatory , changed seat etc. . As a last resort , the passenger 's luggage is removed from the cargo hold for security . If things get to that stage , the flight is inevitably delayed for sure .
Generally , sweep makes the wing less efficient in creating lift and complicates structural design . Therefore , aircraft designers try to use as little sweep as they can get away with . However , <URL> onset of <URL> and allows jet aircraft to improve their maximum transport performance ( the product of speed and payload ) . <URL> both help to fly faster , but backward sweep is preferred because it makes stalling less dangerous , improves <URL> and allows to make the wing lighter . The shortest take-off distance will be achieved with zero sweep - if it were not for the need to limit compressibility effects , sweep would only be used in tailless aircraft . The main factor for choosing wing sweep is the desired <URL> , and Mach 0.85 has become the de-facto standard . Other factors are : Relative wing thickness : A thicker wing needs more sweep , because thickness adds its own compressibility effects . Maximum local Mach number of the airfoil where recompression is shock-free : So-called <URL> help to reduce sweep , and older designs ( before the A310 ) had generally more sweep because their critical Mach number would had been lower at equal sweep . Regulations have nothing to do with it , only engineering determines the sweep angle . Since the design cruise Mach number is <URL> at Mach 0.85 for long-range airliners , the sweep angle of different aircraft is very similar . Regional jets normally fly a little slower to improve fuel efficiency , and their sweep angle is less than that of their big , long-range cousins .
The flight director is related to the autopilot system . It displays a guide on the artificial horizon , which shows the attitude of the airplane , but does nothing to control the plane . The guide represents a reference of an airplane attitude that will follow the parameters set for the autopilot . The pilot can manually fly the plane directly where the flight director indicates , and by doing so the plane will follow the parameters set for the autopilot . If the autopilot is engaged , autopilot flies the plane to follow the flight director . The flight director serves as a visual indication of where the autopilot wants the plane to go . Although a flight director typically accompanies an autopilot system , some aircraft have a flight director without an autopilot . The procedure to engage them is to first turn on the flight director , which will show where the autopilot wants the plane to be , and then to engage the autopilot , which will then automatically fly the plane . This is what the autopilot controls can look like . Here is the Boeing flight director , visible as the crossed magenta lines in the center of the screen .
Well , this depends a little on your situation . In all cases your goal is get on the ground in a controlled manner that leaves the pilot , passengers , and airframe intact - so obviously you 'll be heading for the nearest airport ( and if you can get in contact with ATC and explain your situation doing so would be a really good idea ) . No signs of carb ice ( yet ) . If you 're flying in conditions conducive to carburetor icing but do n't yet have signs of icing there are a few things you can do to help prevent it from forming : Seek a warmer/drier altitude There 's <URL> that gives an idea of the probability of carb ice . If you can find an altitude where the temperature/dew point spread is less conducive to carb ice formation fly there until you can land . Lean the mixture ( as practical ) to limit evaporative cooling from the fuel vaporizing . This can limit the temperature drop in the carburetor , and if it 's only a few degrees of difference between ice and no ice it might help . Avoid low-power operation ( < 60 % power ) . A partially closed throttle plate is more likely to pick up ice ( there is a greater pressure drop across the throttle plate which means a greater temperature drop ) . " Clear " the engine periodically by opening &amp; closing the throttle . This helps ensure the throttle plate does not freeze in place , and can dislodge any small ice patches before they become a more serious problem . I think this would qualify as an " urgency " situation ( ) , <URL> . If you can get in contact with ATC do n't hesitate to let them know that . Signs of carb ice are apparent . If you do have signs of carb icing you can do all of the things above too , but how effective they are may vary . As <URL> adjusting the mixture can help ( typically carb ice makes the engine run over-rich ) . In extreme cases wide-open throttle and an aggressively leaned mixture may keep the engine producing power ( and will reduce the pressure drop across the throttle plate , possibly bringing the carb temperature up enough that the ice will melt off ) . In many light singles your alternate air is the carb heat box , but if you have an alternate air source for the engine besides carb heat that may be worth trying as well ( especially if it 's in the engine compartment or heated cabin ) . Carburetor icing with carb heat inoperative is a bona-fide emergency . I ca n't imagine not making a call in this case . Best-case scenario you wind up making an uneventful landing with fire trucks waiting to greet you ; Worst-case scenario you wind up landing somewhere that 's not an airport , but at least someone knows where you are .
I will assume that the starting condition is level flight . yes . momentarily the assumption of " rigid body " would not be satisfied . Also , for that 0.5 s the aircraft would not be in contact with 10 % of the weight , assuming constant thrust and velocity , you would have 10 % more lift than weight , making the aircraft rise a bit before descend again when all the passengers land again . Velocity would not be greatly affected , as the drag would remain unchanged ( no external change in shape or large attitude variations ) the difference between zero-fuel weight ( ZFW ) and Dry Operating weight ( DOW ) is probably what you are looking for . Airbus defines it as the " total traffic load " . If you want to add catering , cabin equipment and the crew , you then take the difference between the ZFW and the Manufacturer 's Empty Weight ( MEW ) . As a percentage it can vary wildly based on the aircraft class ( class 23 has much less cargo/passenger space that a class 25 , for example ) yes . think of a beam in equilibrium on a pivot located at half its length : if you push just above the pivot , the beam will not rotate , any other location will cause it to rotate and flip over . This does not mean that the aircraft might flip over , as the beam is an uncontrolled and unstable system , while the aircraft is controlled , but it is a comparison that can help visualize the effect I would define it more as shifting rather than jumping . This is a totally different scenario : the center of gravity at the end of this " jump " would be in a totally different location w.r.t. the start of the experiment , something that instead was not happening in the previous scenarios . By shifting the location of the center of gravity is likely that it might exceed the specified position limits and cause the airplane to be uncontrollable , to pitch up or down ( depending if you shift the passengers backwards or forwards ) and stall or nose-dive . On large aircrafts it is obviously not easy to achieve such unsafe scenario , as the cargo will be usually much heavier than the passengers , limiting the extent of the CG shift .
Mainly by the soon to happen descent and landing , probably at a place you were n't expecting to go . :) If you are seated behind the wing , you might be able to see smoke or flames coming out of the engine , but other times it will just quit with no visible indicaion , depending on the cause of the failure . Sometimes ( usually just after takeoff when the airplane is slow ) it is obvious and you can tell by the change in the sound of the airplane ( one side suddenly gets quiet or there might be a loud bang depending on why it failed ) , a sudden yaw in one direction ( the nose pulls to one side ) , and an abrupt pitching down of the nose ( done by the pilot to maintain flying speed ) . Other times ( like during a descent with plenty of speed and the engines at idle , or when the center engine of a three engine airplane fails ) it can be hard for even the pilot to tell without looking at the instrumentation , so you probably wo n't notice it . Another major clue would be when the seatbelt sign unexpectedly coming on , without an announcement or indication of turbulence , and the flight attendants suddenly putting things away and getting ready for landing , especially when you are n't close to your destination . Being briefed for an emergency landing is also a dead giveaway ( no pun intended ) .
On the EMB-145 the passenger cabin was split into 5 zones and we were given passenger totals in each zone from the flight attendant prior to leaving the gate . If balance is off ( this happened quite rarely for us ) you would tell the flight attendant " I need 2 passengers from zone 5 moved to zone 1 " or " I need a passenger from zone 3 moved to zone 2 " or some other similar instruction . The flight attendant would solicit volunteers and if no one did , they would instruct someone to move . The move was only for takeoff and once airborne they could go back to their normal seat . After moving passengers we would re-calculate the weight and balance to verify we were in the envelope and set takeoff trim . Similar methods are used in larger airplanes with the cabin split into zones . The only time we would use ballast is when we had a full cabin and not enough bags in the cargo ( not common ) . In those cases we would ask ops for ballast and they would put something in the cargo . They would try to make it useful if an outstation needed something else they would just load 50 lb bags of sand .
Options would be to either move the passenger to another seat &amp; placard that seat as unusable , or go back to the gate and have maintenance fix what 's broken . In the former case , the seat would most likely be fixed by a mechanic at the next station . The seatbelts used in the F/A demos are seatbelt extensions , which still need the installed seatbelt itself to be intact . They are fully functional as such , though , unlike the demo life vests &amp; O2 masks , which indeed are " demo only " and of no use at all in a real emergency . For a mechanic , the seatbelt is quick &amp; easy to replace , although without needle-nose pliers ( and a spare male or female belt ) , rather difficult for the crew -- who would n't be allowed to anyway . The FAA requires that every passenger has a seatbelt and has been told how &amp; when to use it , and that the crew has verified that they have it on before takeoff .
First of all it depends on what type of " employee " and if the jumpseat is in the cockpit or the cabin . According to the answers to <URL> there are no regulations on who may sit in a cabin jumpseat as long as it meets the specifications set out in FAR § 121.211 for proper airline seats . So the airline is free to set policy for cabin jumpseats . As for jumpseats on the flight deck the restrictions are quite stringent . If the employee is a pilot FAR § 121.547 ( c ) ( 3 ) allows off-duty pilots to fly in a jumpseat on the flight deck , so there would be no need to make them an active crew member . FAR § 121.547 ( a ) ( 1 ) allows an on-duty flight attendant to fly in a jumpseat on the flight deck . The person would have to be a certified flight attendant , so you could n't just make any employee a crew member . Remember also that flight attendants have hours of service restrictions , so any time they are considered on-duty has to comply with the h.o.s. regulations . Certain other types of employees are allowed to fly in the flight deck , but they have to be performing a specific function on the flight that requires their presence in th cockpit . For example , a mechanic could fly in the cockpit if he 's there to monitor something on the aircraft . A flight dispatcher could be on the flight deck if they are observing flight operations as a part of training . Even some persons who may be given access to the cockpit for operational need , like air marshals or training personnel , still must have a seat available in the cabin . So they ca n't put someone in the cockpit just to transport them from place to place and they could n't just plop a salesman or a ticket agent there and say they are a " crew member . " There are regulations stipulating the minimum number of flight attendants on a flight but not a maximum number . So , technically they could make a flight attendant part of the crew , but if that person was just listed as a crew member and was n't actually performing any duties , the FAA would certainly interpret that as a violation .
<URL> is how the helicopter flies in most situations . It flies similar to an airplane in this situation , with pitching up and down to increase and decrease airspeed . This is controlled by use of forward and aft cyclic . Straight flight is where the tail rotor is set so that it opposes the turning tendency of the main rotor . This essentially prevents the helicopter from yawing while in flight . This is controlled by using the anti-torque pedals . Level flight is simply when the helicopter is flying at a constant altitude . This does not mean , however that its nose is pointed ahead , or that it is flying forward , merely that it is not gaining or losing altitude . I 'm not sure exactly what cruise flight is . When a helicopter is " cruising " , it most likely is maintaining altitude and flying straight ahead , but I do n't think there is a separate term for it .
No , the airport would n't be closed , and the # 1 aircraft does n't need to go around nor be sent around . The risk of him shutting down the runway is very slight , and is probably of the same magnitude of risk that sending him around to hold until # 2 has landed &amp; the runway has been checked and reopened , would put him into a low-fuel emergency state . If they are both about the same distance ( actually , time ) away , then the emergency aircraft has priority ( assuming that he does n't decide to hold in order to troubleshoot , burn down fuel , prepare for the landing , etc ) , but essentially closing the airport from the time that the emergency has been declared until the emergency aircraft lands , is n't something I 've ever seen or heard of . The runway is often closed following an emergency landing until it can be checked by an airport vehicle , to ensure that it is clear of debris , spilled fuel/oil/hydraulic fluid/etc . And if the emergency aircraft ca n't clear the runway under its own power , it takes time to get it towed off , possibly pinning the landing gear ( to prevent unintended retraction ) first . Plus there may be an evacuation after the landing . So closing the runway for some time after the emergency aircraft lands , is entirely possible . But if the airport has planes in the pattern &amp; the emergency aircraft is 50 miles out , it 'd be better to let those who want/need to land , do so , rather than risk them running low on fuel airborne while awaiting the runway 's reopening . Same basic logic applies in the # 1 / # 2 scenario posed above . If aircraft regularly had their gear collapse &amp; shut down runways unexpectedly , that would be a different story . But that 's exceedingly rare , so that is n't the contingency that all planning is based on .
Short answer : no . Longer answer : you would need to design a carrier craft that could store large quantities of ammunition in safe conditions - enough to supply more than one fighter , perhaps several times . Having a lot of live ammo on board would increase the chances of something going off at a bad time . To continue : this ammunition then needs to be transferred to the fighter , while in flight at speeds of what , say 200 kts ? How do we do this ? Perhaps some sort of pneumatic tube would work , but only for the small stuff and you would have to make sure it would arrive safely . Transferring whole cassettes of rounds or bombs would need some other means . OK , so let 's say we transfer the ammo with some sort of failsafe on ( pins , etc. ) . So now the fighter pilot needs some means of removing the failsafe in order to use the stuff . Perhaps the only feasible solution would be a carrier aircraft that could take the fighter on board while refuelling and rearming . That is what they built the Akron zeppelin for in the 1930s ( Wikipedia link : <URL> ) . Do n't think it would be feasible with modern fighters , though .
You have this tagged both FAA and ICAO but for the FAA thats governed under <URL> ( c ) Hand fire extinguishers for crew , passenger , cargo , and galley compartments . Hand fire extinguishers of an approved type must be provided for use in crew , passenger , cargo , and galley compartments in accordance with the following : ( 1 ) The type and quantity of extinguishing agent must be suitable for the kinds of fires likely to occur in the compartment where the extinguisher is intended to be used and , for passenger compartments , must be designed to minimize the hazard of toxic gas concentrations . ( 2 ) Cargo compartments . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located for use in each class E cargo compartment that is accessible to crewmembers during flight . ( 3 ) Galley compartments . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located for use in each galley located in a compartment other than a passenger , cargo , or crew compartment . ( 4 ) Flightcrew compartment . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located on the flight deck for use by the flightcrew . ( 5 ) Passenger compartments . Hand fire extinguishers for use in passenger compartments must be conveniently located and , when two or more are required , uniformly distributed throughout each compartment . Hand fire extinguishers shall be provided in passenger compartments as follows : ( i ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 6 but fewer than 31 passengers , at least one . ( ii ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 30 but fewer than 61 passengers , at least two . ( iii ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 60 passengers , there must be at least the following number of hand fire extinguishers : Minimum Number of Hand Fire Extinguishers Passenger seating accommodations : 61 through 200 : 3 201 through 300 : 4 301 through 400 : 5 401 through 500 : 6 501 through 600 : 7 601 or more : 8 ( 6 ) Notwithstanding the requirement for uniform distribution of hand fire extinguishers as prescribed in paragraph ( c ) ( 5 ) of this section , for those cases where a galley is located in a passenger compartment , at least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located and easily accessible for use in the galley . ( 7 ) At least two of the required hand fire extinguisher installed in passenger-carrying airplanes must contain Halon 1211 ( bromochlorofluoromethane ) or equivalent as the extinguishing agent . At least one hand fire extinguisher in the passenger compartment must contain Halon 1211 or equivalent . You may also find some <URL> .
This stopped after the World Trade Center attacks . You might be able to get a kid in briefly before the plane takes off .
There is no regulatory requirement for oxygen to be available for anyone on board an aircraft so long as it remains at altitudes of 12,500 ' MSL or less . And only the required minimum flight crew is required to have oxygen if they are flying above 12,500 ' up to and including 14,000 MSL ' IF they will be at those altitudes for more than 30 minutes . <URL> If they were going above 15,000 ' MSL that would be another story . So the short of it is , No , that pilot was not irresponsible , perhaps , maybe slightly inconsiderate , but not irresponsible . The reason for this is the lower density of the air is n't low enough to harm the majority of passengers . Except for extreme cases , such as those with severe and uncontrolled asthma or heavy smokers , the worst thing that would happen would be the passengers would just get sleepy and fall asleep . This is natural , and because the body does not need as much oxygen when asleep . For passengers there generally wo n't be any harm done from a mild case altitude induced hypoxic hypoxia . And YES ! You can ask someone if they will be ' OK ' at higher altitudes ! Just as it is not only ' OK ' but required to ask their weight for weight and balance calculations . ( And quite frankly I believe most people find that more intrusive . ) In fact you should take 5 minutes to tell your passengers that the flight will be in excess of , say 11,000 ' , that way they can be prepared for some unusual effects and not have to worry about them . To take it a step further , remember you are the Pilot in Command and you should be aware of your passenger 's limitations as that may trigger any self imposed safety limitations you have for the safety of the flight . Now , if you just want passengers to be comfortable and/or they absolutely insist on not taking a little nap , then it is entirely up to you if you want to carry a portable aviation oxygen canister with you for your passengers . For further information on hypoxia I would recommend the <URL> on it and the differing effects on pilots , and by extension passengers . Hope this helps !
I work as a fixed-wing pilot for a hospital-based Air Ambulance program . Let me add my experience to the ATC orders accurately cited by Pondlife 's answer : the <URL> call sign ( the old " Lifeguard " is still used when filing the flight plan ) indicates a need for priority handling . ATC is often helpful in providing us with priority routing . This includes giving us direct clearances , moving us up in the landing que , allowing us an unrestricted approach speed , and otherwise expediting our flight . However , ATC does not always provide priority handling , and I have often experienced ground delays of 5-10 + minutes as ATC apparently prioritizes other traffic , including air cargo and the like . This is rarely a big problem as patients are typically stable , but it can be frustrating when priority handling is expected . However , if medical staff determine that a patient is in critical condition , we will announce this to ATC -- typically accompanied by a request for a specific clearance or change to a previous clearance . This announcement re-iterates our need for priority handling and indicates the urgency of the situation . In this way we can work with ATC to best care for the patient . We will often make such an announcement when checking on with approach control for their information with no specific accompanying request . Occasionally , however , we will need to request such priority handling because ATC has issued us speed restrictions or delaying vectors to put us behind other traffic . ATC is very good at working with us when we do need the priority handling . In other words , ATC usually automatically gives us priority handling , but when they do n't -- and we need it -- we ask for it and they are very good at working with us to provide the priority handling .
It depends on the seat . Most modern seats , including the ACES II system common in US Fighter Jets , fall away from the pilot at a pre-determined altitude . <URL> Once out of the plane , a drogue gun in the seat fires a metal slug that pulls a small parachute , called a drogue parachute , out of the top of the chair . This slows the person 's rate of descent and stabilizes the seat 's altitude and trajectory . After a specified amount of time , an altitude sensor causes the drogue parachute to pull the main parachute from the pilot 's chute pack . At this point , a seat-man-separator motor fires and the seat falls away from the crewmember . The person then falls back to Earth as with any parachute landing . Generally , according to that link , this occurs at just over 100-200 feet above ejection height . However , if you eject at high altitude , such as Captain Scott O'Grady did ( 26,000 ft ) , the seat will fall away on a sensor ( either 10,000 or 18,000 feet , I do n't recall which ) . The chute may open automatically , or if it is not set to at that height , you can then pull the chute manually , or wait until its set height to open .
It has happened <URL> What then happened is that the plane just went on until out of fuel after which it will glide down and skid to a stop ( pilot survived ) . This is assuming there is no obstacle in the way . Another example is the <URL> , a fighter pilot eject and the plane still under power just kept going in a straight line and " landed " in a field . A more deadly example is the <URL> . A mistake in the pressure regulation setting let the plane become unpressurized while climbing to cruise altitude . Both pilots lost consciousness and the plane 's autopilot followed its programmed path following the waypoints and ending up in a holding patter until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the ground . Survival depends on luck with obstacles , whether the plane is properly trimmed and which order the engines flame out in , asymmetric flame-out may result in a spin .
At that point it was indeed the flaps extending in preparation of takeoff ( you can see them moving through the rain ) . You would typically also be able to hear the cargo doors closing ( before the plane starts taxiing ) and the engines ramping up as you start to take off ( <URL> in the same video ) .

Do military pilots use amphetamines or other stimulants ?
The U.S. Air Force ( and Navy ) still uses , and has used off and on since WWII , what are commonly referred to as " Go Pills " for instances when pilots need to be up for long periods of time - in wartime , sometimes longer than the crew rest regulation . ( These pills can also be used for altering sleep cycles , along with " no-go " pills ; for example , when changing from day to night ) . The most common go pill is <URL> , which is an amphetamine . You can find some more information in <URL> .
That 's a good question , and brings up a joke that many pilots know well : " What 's going to be in the cockpit of the future ? " " A dog and a pilot . " " A dog ? Why a dog ? " " Well , the dog is there to keep the pilot from touching anything . " " Ummm , why have the pilot then ? " " Well , someone has to feed the dog ! " Technology has improved to the point where airplanes can pretty much fly and even land themselves . They are even getting pretty good at handling " normal " emergencies like engine failures and depressurizations . Where pilots really shine though are the type of abnormal and emergency situations that are n't " in the book " . <URL> , a computer will be out of options because it was never programmed to handle that ( because it was considered " virtually impossible " when it was designed ) . A pilot on the other hand can analyze and experiment until he finds enough of a solution to keep the airplane in the air as he works through other issues . During a total electrical failure , the computers wo n't be much good . Sure , you can design redundant systems and make it so that it " can never happen " , but what about when it does ? There are also all of the little things that a pilot is constantly making decisions on how to handle . Some examples could include : Can the airplane fly with a particular feature inoperative ? What about multiple features inoperative ? How do they interact with each other ? What do you do when the passengers take too long to board and you are going to miss your departure slot ? What do you do when the ground crew forgets to close a door ? What about when the tug driver does n't push you back quite far enough ? Or ATC wants to change you to a different runway ? Or you ask ATC to change you to a different runway because it might save a few minutes and that will keep you from having to deice again ? Or another airplane unexpectedly pulls out in front of you while taxiing ? A pilot can see " ugly " clouds off the end of the runway and decide that it would be better to wait a bit before taking off . What happens when a flock of birds suddenly appears during the takeoff roll ? What happens when a passenger gets sick or unruly ? When do you need to divert and when can you continue ? On a typical flight , a pilot will make hundreds of small decisions that can make a big difference in the flight . Any one of these ( or one of the tens or hundreds of thousands of other things that could happen ) could trip up a computer . The pilot is also there as the " final authority " . If a hacker were to somehow hack into the automated systems , a pilot can always disconnect them and fly the airplane manually . He can turn off systems , he can be ... Well , the pilot can be creative and a computer can only do what it was programmed to do . Right now when a drone crashes it is n't such a big deal because nobody was on board . If an airliner with a load full of paying passengers crashes it is a big deal . Even just one . Many of these problems can be overcome . Some of them already have been . Some of them may never be fully handled in an automatic way but maybe we could still do automated flights with an acceptable level of safety . Some automation is actually better than some pilots in certain areas . However , the biggest reason that we do n't have fully automated passenger airplanes is because the general public feels comforted by a person being up front who can take over and carry them to safety if needed . Even if the technology were 100 % ready for automated passenger flights , I think that the number of people willing to purchase a ticket would be so low that it would be financially unfeasible for an airline to deploy it .
<URL> ( <URL> ) Ground call horn . There 's a horn the pilots can sound to attract the attention of the ground engineer , so they can talk on the intercom ( by wearing a headset ) .

Taxi lights can be flashed on/off to attract the attention of ground crew , also opening a window and waving would work . <URL> ( <URL> ) <URL> ( <URL> ) Ground crew member wearing a headset connected to the plane .
<URL> which is mostly about licensing . However X-Plane also has an <URL> is legal for certain training/instructional hours . You can find more info on the FAA 's approved simulators <URL> and <URL> . The flight school I trained at had a certified sim from the 80 's that was pretty miserable by todays standards . It was certified and had no screen , I would say it was " custom built " FWIW . Many airlines may turn back to the manufacturer for recurrent training . Both <URL> and <URL> run facilities with full motion simulators . I would think they built the software in-house but I do n't have any hard evidence on that . As the OEM builder they have access to genuine interior parts to build the sims . For smaller aircraft places like <URL> in full motion sims but <URL> SIMCOM uses actual aircraft interiors ( most likely from defunct airframes ) for their sims . <URL>
Yes , cargo aircraft are like other aircraft in that there is generally at least a jump seat available . Especially larger aircraft will also have <URL> .

On the first flight of the day , after every refueling , and if you have flown through precipitation or the plane is left in the rain , you check the fuel for water and to make sure you have the right kind of fuel . Since water is heavier than fuel , if there is just a little bit of water in the fuel it could cause the engine to stop . You ca n't pull over to the side of the road like you can in a car , so you need to immediately deal with the problem . The most likely place for this to occur is on takeoff . If you think fast and switch tanks , you might get lucky and only have water in one tank so you can continue your takeoff . If not , you may need to find a place to land . In 17 years of flying , I have only found water in the fuel once , and it was n't even my airplane . But since it was on Catalina Island , a stopped engine would not have been pretty . The other reason to check the fuel is that airplanes designed for 100LL do not burn Jet Fuel . Jet fuel is denser than 100LL so it will sink to the bottom of the tank . It is straw colored and somewhat greasy so you can tell if you plane has accidentally been filled with it , but you really have to be paying attention . It would be easy to miss if you just topped off . There have been incidents when twin-engine planes have mistakenly been filled with Jet A and have either crashed or had expensive fuel system cleaning required . In this article , <URL> describes his experiences . After the <URL> of a Cessna 421s someone did a <URL> to see how easy it is to identify a combination of Jet A and Avgas . It 's fairly hard using standard pre-flight practices . That 's why many people recommend watching the fuel truck if you have a twin-engine plane or one that prominently says " Turbo " on the side . Many aircraft have rubber bladders to hold the fuel . Most older Cessnas have them . Water can get trapped in the folds of the bladder and get into the engine later when the fuel is sloshed around . Even if the fuel source is free of water , a tank that is not full can have water condense in it . Most autogas has some ethanol in it . Water will dissolve in a gas-ethanol mixture and so a slug of water wo n't get into the engine like it will in an aircraft engine . Contamination is less of an issue and is one that is really hard for a GA pilot to determine . You really ca n't tell if the fuel is contaminated with other petroleum products just by looking at it .
When multiple U.S. military aircraft are operating in formation , they do so as a " flight " . This flight has a callsign , and in the case of Presidential transport flights , this callsign is the Presidential one , such as Air Force One or Marine One . For POTUS transport using a fixed-wing aircraft , the flight typically consists of a single aircraft , usually one of the VC-25s specifically built for the purpose . Its fighter escort , if any ( typically there is one ) , is a different " flight " that operates in tandem with Air Force One as the escort " element " of the complete transportation " package " . Therefore , for Air Force One and for Navy or Executive fixed wing equivalents , the aircraft is the flight and has the callsign . When the " Marine One " helicopters must be used , however , a very sophisticated " shell game " is played , as you already know . Not only are multiple helicopters used ( I 've seen up to 6 in use at the same time ) , they are externally identical in appearance , and they change position in the flight formation constantly . The Secret Service has even gone so far as to use body doubles that would make positive ID of the helicopter the actual President has entered difficult , even if an enemy faction had spotters in place to track each individual helicopter 's position in the flight the whole time it 's in the air . This entire flight of multiple helicopters is what carries the " Marine One " callsign . Individual aircraft within the flight , if typical military radio procedures are followed , would be identified by adding a craft number suffix : " Marine One-One " , " Marine One-Two " , etc. . I do n't know whether the aircraft change craft numbers during flight to match formation position , or if the pilots just keep track of which chopper 's where as they juggle . So , a potential assassin would either have to take a 50-50 shot ( or worse ) at one of the choppers in the flight , or he 'd have to coordinate with multiple launchers to attack all the choppers simultaneously ( and the larger the effort , the more communication is required to plan and execute it , which increases the group 's exposure and the potential for detection ) . If there is any reliable intel that the President would be targeted with this level of sophistication during a visit , he usually does n't go ; he has a VP , a Secretary of State and a cadre of ambassadorial representatives whose job it is to personally represent the President anywhere in the world the President himself can not be , for any reason .
The " packs " ( or A/C on the aircraft ) are powered by engine bleed air . When bleed air is extracted from the engines , less thrust can be produced . This may be a problem if the airplane is taking off at a high elevation airport or the departure path requires a certain climb gradient to clear obstacles . This action does create some discomfort in the cabin so it 's usually not preferred unless required for safety . Some newer airplanes are manufactured with an " APU to pack " configuration - i.e. the pilots leave the APU running during takeoff , which provides bleed air to power the packs . The workload on the engines are now reduced .
A number of experiments and papers by Robert Hoey ( from the early 1990s on ) have used models of flat-winged soaring birds such as ravens . One of his papers is referenced in this broad review : <URL> One of his earlier papers is copied here : <URL> The topics include some discussion of low static stability of the model and the lack of vertical surfaces in real birds , as well as unknowns such as wing profile .
The pilots also need to use oxygen in case of smoke , fumes , or fire in the aircraft . Thus , they need enough oxygen to be able to get down and land in a fire scenario , which is much more than a decompression ! Fire procedures have the crew on 100 % oxygen at positive pressure to prevent them from breathing in smoke and fumes , while in a decompression , their masks mix oxygen with cabin air , in much the same way the cabin masks do . This is also why the cabin masks are not used in smoke/fumes scenarios .
You can persuade a turbine engine to run on just about anything that can burn . So the decision of which fuel to actually use depends on the side factors including , but not limited to : availability cost emissions hot section temperature chemical reactions with engine parts Specific examples : Coal dust is rather difficult to pump around , and the rampies do n't like shovelling liquid hydrogen ( used in the Space Shuttle ) requires a lot of storage and has the nasty habit of freezing anything it touches , like rampies . ethylacetylenedecaborane is unpleasantly toxic ( rampies union again ) and the combustion byproducts were rather abrasive to the engine 's innards trimethylaluminum would reduce the engine complexity ( no igniters needed ) because it has the nasty habit of igniting instantly upon contact with air , so leaks are rather dangerous . natural gas is commonly used as a turbine fuel in pumping stations : it 's already there and thus is " free " . The required pressure vessels make it impractical to use as an aircraft fuel . So kerosene basically became the standard turbine fuel because it 's : cheap : kerosene makes up a rather large fraction of crude oil . When you measure your fuel load in tons a few cents per litre makes a difference . safe to handle : relatively non-toxic , does n't ignite all that easily storable and transportable in common structural metals does n't clog up the engine
Zeppelins had a rigid skeleton and several internal gas bags . None of them are still in operation .

At present , all US military aircraft follow the <URL> . The first letter ( ' F ' or ' B ' ) denotes the mission of the aircraft , while the number denotes the design number . The designation system produces a Mission-Design-Series ( MDS ) designation . From <URL> : 4.1 . Designator Definition : 4.1.1 . The MDS designator is an official DoD recognized alpha-numeric symbol designation of a military defense aerospace vehicle . ... The designator describes the aerospace vehicle in two components where the components are separated by a hash.The first component , comprised only of alpha characters , describes the mission of the vehicle.The second component , comprised of both alpha-numeric characters , describes the design number and design series of the vehicle . 4.1.2 . Standard aircraft MDS designators are comprised of the following : status prefix ( optional ) , modified mission ( optional ) , basic mission ( required ) , design number ( required ) , design series ( required ) . The document also gives some examples of this implemenatation : <URL> <URL> Both tables from <URL> The 1962 system replaced the earlier system , where each service had their own systems in place for naming of aircraft .

So , you have <URL> and <URL> after <URL> ( this was due to the counters being reset ) , while the next bomber has been named <URL> .
Yes , they do . They are called Anti-Skid and they go from Mark I of 1948 , with simply an on-off switch triggered by wheel lock , till Mark V ( or at least that 's the last I 've seen ) , with quite complex control systems and sensors behind . The full details are a bit long to include them all here ( there are <URL> ) . For a brief overview , see <URL> from slide 12 till 18 .
Formation lights are used so that aircraft can fly close formation at night . They are typically luminescent strips positioned so that an aircraft can be in the desired position ( i.e. fingertip formation ) and have references fore-aft , up-down , and near-far similar to references as used for daytime formation flying . Something along the lines of , " keep the position light just below the formation light ( strip ) under the cockpit and the aft fuselage light ( strip ) just touching the wing hardpoint , and you 're in the right position . If the position light goes farther below the strip , you 're getting high ; if the hardpoint is sliding back into the aft light you 're getting close , etc. " Obviously these references are very specific to each individual aircraft . You can see the formation lights in this picture of an F-14 ; the dots are actual position lights , while the strips are the formation lights . <URL> <URL> As to why only military aircraft have them ... how often have you seen or heard of civil aircraft flying formation at night ? Yeah , me neither . There are very , very few non-military reasons for formation flight , and essentially none that require it to be done at night .
No , but a hat to protect the head from the sun . You may call this the glider pilot 's headset ;-) <URL> Glider pilot with hat ( picture <URL> ) The flight noise is just a faint hissing sound , and the most noise is either produced by the electrical variometer or the radio . On a busy day and with everyone on the same frequency , I often switched the radio silent when high up . When you receive transmissions from tens of kilometers away , you often receive parallel transmissions , which result in a very loud and annoying crackling in the radio .
Well if you are in Australia I 'd love to take you for a spin ! You need to find your local aviation community . Online , airport open days , the local aero club , flying schools , aviation events , and even at the fence of the airport - you 'll find people if you go looking . In any aviation enthusiast group you 're likely to find at least one private pilot . Build up a bit of a rapport and just ask them to take you up . Just be genuine , talk about what you love about flying , do n't look shocked when they say you have to pay half ( remembering that private pilots are not allowed to earn money for it , so do n't let yourself get ripped off ) , and offer to buy them a beer afterwards or something :) EDIT - I add the beer comment as a bit of a joke . Although it 's always nice to get that bit of gratitude from a passenger , a pilot trying to build hours before going commercial would simply be thrilled to not have to pay for a full hour !
Non-pilot astronauts are not required to become pilots . They fly in the backseat of T-38 's partially for transportation purposes , and partially for flight regime training . They are called " mission specialists " and since their job does not require piloting skills , there is no reason to train them as such . <URL> says " The T38 is used for flight readiness training to help the astronauts become adjusted to the flight environment , including the g-forces experienced on launch " and that non-pilots fly at least four hours per month in a T-38 . Pilot astronauts fly at least 15 hours per month to maintain proficiency . You can look up whether someone has a US Pilot 's license using the FAA 's <URL> . A quick search turns up several astronauts who have never been licensed . For example , the mission specialists on the final shuttle mission , <URL> and <URL> , are not pilots . That being said , I would n't be surprised if most , if not all , of the non-pilot astronauts got some stick time in a T-38 since it is a trainer with dual controls . Obviously the pilot and I 'm guessing the commander would be airforce pilots In the NASA vocabulary , commander is equivalent to what you would think of as pilot or captain , whereas pilot is equivalent to what you would think of as co-pilot . In the Apollo program , the commander landed the lunar module on the moon , not the " Lunar Module Pilot , " and in the shuttle program , the commander landed the shuttle , not the pilot . So , you are correct that both the commander and pilot must be pilots , and some of them did come from the Air Force , although US Navy was more common , and a few came from the Marine Corps . Almost all of them were test pilots . A few astronauts joined NASA with the qualifications to be pilot-astronauts , but only flew as mission specialists ( for example , <URL> and <URL> ) . I am honestly not sure whether or not NASA allowed them to fly the T-38 's ; however , the only photo evidence I can find shows them in the rear seat , which leads me to believe they were not allowed to fly solo . I have no idea if NASA still uses T-38 's NASA does still use T-38 's because NASA still sees a need for pilot astronauts in the future , and the pilots need a way to maintain flying proficiency . In the <URL> , four out of the eight were test pilots of some sort , although it 's unclear how many will be considered pilot-astronauts . There is <URL> that the number of T-38 's which NASA operates does appear to be shrinking , which is likely a reflection of a reduced astronaut corps size , budget constraints , and the fact that the aircraft fleet is about 50 years old . According to unconfirmed sources ( <URL> ) , the number of NASA T-38 's is expected to be reduced from 32 to 16 by 2015 . Other Space Shuttle-specific aircraft have been retired entirely , such as the Gulfstream II <URL> and the <URL> ( the latter was n't flown by astronauts ) .
It all depends on the laws of the country that the crew is visiting . Some do and some do n't . Many do unless they have a reciprocal agreement with the pilot 's country , in which case they do n't . This would be a great question for a specific country pair , or even if you want to know the laws about a specific country ( in which case we could give the actual requirements ) , but the best answer for a general question like this is " it depends " . In some cases , the crew is n't even required to clear customs unless they are leaving airport property . Other times they have to clear as soon as they land . Part of qualifying for a route with the airlines is making sure that you have the required visas . Having two passports help a lot in getting multiple visas , because they can keep flying internationally while the visa application is in process .
Has boeing changed their alarm systems post that incident ? The story of <URL> is complicated . It is not clear that a misidentified alarm was the cause of the crash . Update : If you are talking about the cabin altitude warning horn , that was allegedly misidentified as a take-off configuration , then nothing has been changed , at least up to May 2015 ( see : <URL> , bottom of the page 50 ) . " As the aircraft climbed , the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased . As it passed through an altitude of 12,040 feet ( 3,670 m ) , the cabin altitude warning horn sounded . The warning should have prompted the crew to stop climbing , but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off configuration warning , which signals that the aircraft is not ready for take-off , and can only sound on the ground . In the next few minutes , several warning lights on the overhead panel in the cockpit illuminated . One or both of the equipment cooling warning lights came on to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans ( a result of the decreased air density ) , accompanied by the master caution light . The passenger oxygen light illuminated when , at an altitude of approximately 18,000 feet ( 5,500 m ) , the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed . " m , Source : <URL> .

How do planes search for submarines ?
This principle method of airborne sub-hunting is using sonar to search a wide area around your ships in the direction of advance . The intent is less tracking subs as it is to deter them from obtaining a firing solution on your ships . ASW is a long , complex topic . This answer will be brief unless someone has more questions . Airborne sensors include : Sonobuoys Passive - ( omnidirectional or directional ) - subs are very quiet today . Detection ranges is extremely short . < 100 m by some accounts . Active - all subs are coated with anechoic tiles to absorb acoustic energy A P-3 would go through about 10-30 buoys over a 6-10 hour mission Some <URL> are available . <URL> of sonobuoy deployment and operation <URL> <URL> <URL> Dipping sonar Unique to ASW helos <URL> Credit : <URL> MAD - magnetic anomaly detector - The large boom extending behind the tail : <URL> Credit : <URL> looks for large metallic masses limitations : short range ( 100s of meters ) , which requires a/c to fly very low over the surface ( increasing airframe fatigue and fuel consumption ) . Descending from cruising altitude also takes time . upside : good localization ( spatial accuracy ) , relatively few false positives . downsides : Equipment is large and heavy . For these reasons , a MAD boom is not included on the current P-8 , the navy 's newest long range maritime patrol a/c . Counter-measures : Sub can dive deeper to reduce their chances of being detected . Typical SSN operating depths are 400 m . The Type 214 claims a 700 m test depth . Modern subs are made from non-magnetic steels ( eg , German Type 212 , Type 214 ) or titanium ( Soviet Sierra , Alfa , and Papa class SSNs , portions of the Typhoon 's 10 pressure hulls ) . Subs also undergo degaussing <URL> LA-class USS Toledo ( SSN-769 ) prepares to get underway after four days at the Magnetic Silencing Facility . 5 Feb 2010 . Credit : <URL> Radar - Historically , more useful for detecting subs on the surface , forcing them to spend more time underwater , where they were less effective . For much of WWII , German U-boats were essentially submersible torpedo boats . Most of their attacks were actually made on the surface . Today , our improved radars can detect submarine periscopes , forcing subs to take only very short glimpses . The periscope is actual quite useful for ID-ing targets and obtaining ranges much more quickly than stalking with sonar alone . Visual If you 're directly above a sub at shallow depth , you can see it . Needless to say , this is extremely rare , but is one reason operating in shallow , littoral waters is dangerous . If you 're lucky , you might spot a periscope wake . It 's also unlikely you 'll see a surface wake . At periscope depth , subs move very slowly . And at operating depths , surface wakes are extremely minute , likely undetectable even by radar and advanced processing , although attempts have been made . <URL> <URL> Other non-acoustic methods Chemical - to detect snorkeling subs recharging their batteries LIDAR - potentially faster than MAD .

As a general average , Chicago O'Hare ( KORD ) seems to do somewhere between 1.5 and 2 operations per minute ( so roughly one takeoff or landing every 30-40 seconds ) . I based this on data from the FAA 's <URL> report , and specifically looked at November 23 through November 30 of 2014 ( 17835 operations , over 8 days works out to 1.55 operations per minute - I poked around randomly and found days as high as 1.7 operations per minute ) . One of the limiting factors for number of operations at any airport is separation between aircraft , which is covered <URL> Incidentally we were discussing airport/tower activity levels <URL> earlier today , and Chicago O'Hare is the busiest airport in the United States overall - a title it recently stole back from ATL ( which was # 1 from 2004 to 2013 ) .
So I 'm assuming mail does not go in civilian aircraft . Like many thing in aviation it depends . For shipping it will depend on where you are shipping to and from , how big the item is and the chose method of shipment . Both <URL> and <URL> ( who are private shipping carriers ) operate large fleets of cargo airplanes . In many cases a shipment may end up on one of their own cargo planes . However their planes , like passenger planes run routes that may be pre-decided . As such passenger airlines sell the leftover cargo space to anyone willing to buy it . <URL> UPS/FedEx may pre-broker a deal to buy a certain amount of cargo space per year from an airline to obtain a better rate or they may buy it on demand as needed . Now Air Mail is a bit different as its <URL> postal service . Technically the USPS no longer offer airmail service as it was once called but does still offer domestic and foreign guaranteed time shipping . All of these items are moved in <URL> or by under contract by FedEx as the USPS no longer operates any aircraft . Am I right , and if so , what 's the reason for that ? It seems it would be extremely more efficient at least for small shipments . Like most things in aviation low cost will always beat out marginal efficiency . If FedEx can ship a package at a significantly reduced rate but in turn it will take an extra day or two to arrive than many customers will see a value add in that . In the same vein it would be very efficient to fly every passenger in a small plane to an airport closer to their final destination and have the plane depart when the passenger needs to , however the cost of that simply would never work out .
As you pointed out in your question , no book is a substitute for actual instruction in an aircraft with a flight instructor . That being said , doing your homework and knowing what your instructor is going to expect goes a long way toward completing your training in a timely manner . The books here are all great reference texts to be combined with a flight instruction curriculum . FAA Publications / Books for initial training A surprising number of new student pilots are not aware of the wealth of information the FAA has compiled and published to help people learn to fly . There is a whole series of <URL> that you can take advantage of which are available from the FAA as well as from a variety of publishers like <URL> . While all of the regulatory information is geared toward US/FAA regulations much of the technique information , signs &amp; markings , etc. will be universal , in conformance with ICAO rules . I list a whole bunch of them here , but you can find a wealth of information by googling what you want to do and the words " FAA Handbook " . Books on Flying the aircraft - maneuvers , etc. . Quite simply if it flies the FAA probably has a book about how you should fly it . These books cover basic flying technique and the maneuvers the FAA expects pilots to be able to demonstrate . The popular ones include : <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-3A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-21A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-13A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-11A ) Books on " essential aviation knowledge " - Airport signs &amp; markings , " rules of the air " , etc. . <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-25A ) is the starting point here . <URL> is another key resource ( you will often find this as a combined " FAR/AIM " printed publication ) . Books for the more advanced stuff - Instrument ratings and beyond <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-15B ) and <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-16 ) are excellent references for pilots pursuing an instrument rating .
Gates are usually not charged to airlines separately . Gate fee is usually part of the landing fee package . Landing fees are an important part of the airport revenue , with passenger fees . Airport pricing is subject to recommendations from ICAO , IATA , and other organizations , as regard scope of costs to be taken into consideration , and non-discrimination of airlines . Pricing is determined by the organization managing the airport and/or State or local administration . Single till vs dual till : Distinguishes between aeronautical and non-aeronautical ( commercial ) charges . Airport schedule pricing may use single or dual till . See : <URL> - IATA . <URL> . ICAO guidelines tries to maintain some principles for airport business across all countries : Landing charges : Should be based on the aircraft weight formula . The maximum certificated take-off weight as indicated in the certificate of airworthiness ( or other prescribed document ) should be used , while considering local restrictions that may affect aircraft maximum take-off weight . Allowance should be made for the use of a fixed charge per aircraft or a combination of a fixed charge with a weight-related element , in certain circumstances , such as at congested airports and during peak periods . Parking and hangar charges : For the determination of charges associated with use of parking , hangar and long-term storage of aircraft , maximum permissible take-off weight and/or aircraft dimensions ( area occupied ) and length of stay should be used so far as possible as the basis.Any period of free parking time for aircraft immediately following landing should be determined locally by considering aircraft scheduling , space availability and other pertinent factors . Other charges : -- Passenger service charges -- Security charges -- Noise-related charges -- Emissions-related aircraft charges Albeit a bit old , The Airport Business by Rigas Doganis has a chapter on <URL> which discusses this topic in depth . Extracts : Landing fees : Charged per aircraft , usually based on MTOW ( maximum takeoff weight ) . On most airports covers ATC , runways , taxiways , parking at stand or apron for a certain time ( e.g. 2 hours ) , use of gates / fingers / terminal for disembarking ( use for departure may be paying ) , take-off . Surcharges or rebates in addition of landing fees : For noise , peak-hour operations , Parking and hangar : Beyond the free-parking period covered by the landing fees . Usually based on weight . Passenger charges : per departing passenger , sometime per arriving passenger too . It is easy to find pricing for airports online . <URL> airport ( 2015 ) Rates are different for domestic and international flights . Charges per passenger for landing and passenger facility . For domestic flights , additional landing charges per ton of MTOW . Charges for diversion . Parking charges beyond 2 hours , paid per arrangement with airport . New York <URL> ( 2015 ) Charge for aircraft landing , per thousand pounds of MGLW ( maximum gross landing weight ) . Additional charge for day landing or takeoff ( not for schedule airlines ) . Charge for using public passenger ramp and apron area ( in some cases , when congestion ) . Charge for parking and storage , per 8-hour slot , based on MGTOW ( maximum gross takeoff weight ) . Agreement possible for operators of aircrafts . No charge for air terminal use . Charge for each passenger departing . <URL> ( 2013 ) Landing fee , based on MGLW , different between permitted and non-permitted air carriers . No charge for remote gates bussing service .

There are a several theft-deterrent mechanisms in place . On small airplanes , most commonly , the door to the airplane itself is usually locked with a key . ( Notice the key cylinder in this picture below the silver door handle : Prop locks : Throttle locks : A lot of airplanes do have an ignition key which you turn to engage the starter . Of course , as <URL> , this can be circumvented by hand-propping ( which is a very dangerous endeavor for unskilled people who have n't done it before ) You would have to know how to operate the basic systems of the airplane as well as how to fly . <URL> Fences and other physical security measures around airports .
Aircraft land on the main wheels . For aircraft with nose wheel it is the back ones , but for aircraft with tail wheel ( also called " tail-draggers " ) it is the front ones . In either case the main wheels are very close to centre of gravity and carry most of the aircraft 's weight , the nose or tail wheel only carries a small fraction of it . The aircraft must land on wheels that are close to the centre of gravity ( longitudinally ) . If they were not , the force on the wheels would create a moment that would violently pitch the aircraft . Actually , tail-draggers tend to bounce on landing a bit because there still is some moment left and in case of tail-draggers it pitches the aircraft up . Early planes were almost all tail-draggers , because that layout is more robust , handles unpaved runways better and has less drag when the gear is fixed . It however provides poor directional control especially once the tail lifts off the ground during take-off roll . Later most designs started to use nose-wheel , because it provides better directional control , is directionally stable , makes the floor level when the aircraft is standing so loading is easier and visibility during taxi is much better and with invention of retractable landing gear the drag did n't matter any more .
do they fly in a pilot ( like mid-air refuel ) ? No , that is n't really feasible ! See answers to <URL> do they leave it to the co-pilot to take care of such situations ? Yes . In both normal and emergency situations , the co-pilot is able to fly the aircraft , navigate to a nearby airport and land the aircraft without the assistance of the senior pilot . From <URL> Here are some lines of defense : The remaining pilot must assume or maintain control Establish a safe flight profile and engage the autopilot ; use all possible automation Obtain cabin crew assistance Inform ATC If on an extended-range twin-engine operations ( ETOPS ) flight , the remaining pilot or PIC must assess whether to continue the flight , return to the departure airport or divert . The decision is based on : Weather conditions at the destination or alternate Reduction of flight time if diverting Workload involved in single-pilot operation Familiarity with the alternate Condition of the incapacitated pilot Availability of medical assistance Overall safety of the flight Arrange medical assistance upon arrival Brief a cabin crew member to assist if required Complete the approach and landing using the autopilot as much as possible A partially incapacitated pilot should not be allowed to participate in the subsequent operation of the aircraft , as judgment may be impaired After landing , seek immediate medical assistance See also <URL> The remaining pilot must first assume command and maintain control of the aircraft . Furthermore the position of essential controls and switches should be checked , and in nearly all cases , use of the autopilot should be made and an emergency be declared . Use of the autopilot and priority of air traffic service are two obvious and effective ways of maintaining a tolerable level of workload . The second step is to take care of the incapacitated flight crew member . The grounds for this are not entirely humanitarian ; if left unattended an incapacitated pilot can become a major problem and in any case is a major distraction to the remaining crew . Thus the incapacitated pilot must be moved out of the range of flight controls . In all cases , the advisability of removing a pilot ( perhaps unconscious ) from the seat must be dictated by consideration of the phase of the flight , the crew available , and the contours of the flight deck . Note : Consideration of the restraint and care of an incapacitated pilot dictates that cabin attendants are at least familiar with the operation of harness and seat controls Finally , and after the incapacitated flight crew member has been taken care of , the remaining flight crew should re-organise the cockpit work and prepare for landing . Details will depend on many variables including such considerations as the type of aircraft being flown , phase of flight , en route and terminal weather , and many others . How does commercial airlines prepare themselves for these kind of situations . I imagine that it involves the usual measures make pilots take regular medical tests . make pilots responsible for reporting own or crew illness , fatigue etc. prevent pilots eating the same meals in-flight . write procedures for pilot incapacitation in-flight . train flight crew to perform those procedures review and revise the above based on experience of relevant events . From what I 've read , non-pilot flight-crew are often given very basic training so that they understand the basics of flight . For example <URL> requires flight attendants initial training to include a pilot-incapacitation drill , an understanding of aircraft parts including rudder , ailerons etc , principles of flight , etc etc. . Do they specifically check if there are any pilots in the passenger manifest I believe the airline staff would often be aware of any airline pilots onboard ( e.g. <URL> ) but not of GA or military pilots flying as normal passengers .
To get to the bottom of it , it might help to look at lift at a molecular level : Every air molecule is in a dynamic equilibrium between inertial , pressure and viscous effects : Inertial means that the mass of the particle wants to travel on as before and needs force to be convinced otherwise . Pressure means that air particles oscillate all the time and bounce into other air particles . The more bouncing , the more force they exert on their surroundings . Viscosity means that air molecules , because of this oscillation , tend to assume the speed and direction of their neighbors . Flow over the upper side of the wing Now to the airflow : When a wing approaches at subsonic speed , the low pressure area over its upper surface will suck in air ahead of it . See it this way : Above and downstream of a packet of air we have less bouncing of molecules ( = less pressure ) , and now the undiminished bouncing of the air below and upstream of that packet will push its air molecules upwards and towards that wing . The packet of air will rise and accelerate towards the wing and be sucked into that low pressure area . Due to the acceleration , the packet will be stretched lengthwise and its pressure drops in sync with it picking up speed . Spreading happens in flow direction - the packet is distorted and stretched lengthwise , but contracts in the direction orthogonally to the flow . Once there , it will " see " that the wing below it curves away from its path of travel , and if that path would remain unchanged , a vacuum between the wing and our packet of air would form . Reluctantly , the packet will change course and follow the wing 's contour . This requires even lower pressure , to make the molecules change their direction . This fast-flowing , low-pressure air will in turn suck in new air ahead and below of it , will go on to decelerate and regain its old pressure over the rear half of the wing , and will flow off with its new flow direction . Note that lift can only happen if the upper contour of the wing will slope downwards and away from the initial path of the air flowing around the wing 's leading edge . This could either be camber or angle of attack - both will have the same effect . Since camber allows for a gradual change of the contour , it is more efficient than angle of attack . Flow over the lower side of the wing A packet of air which ends up below the wing will experience less uplift and acceleration , and in the convex part of highly cambered airfoils it will experience a compression . It also has to change its flow path , because the cambered and/or inclined wing will push the air below it downwards , creating more pressure and more bouncing from above for our packet below the wing . When both packets arrive at the trailing edge , they will have picked up some downward speed . Behind the wing , both packets will continue along their downward path for a while due to inertia and push other air below them down and sideways . Above them , this air , having been pushed sideways before , will now fill the space above our two packets . Macroscopically , this looks like two big vortices . But the air in these vortices can not act on the wing anymore , so it will not affect drag or lift . See <URL> , including pretty pictures . Lift can be explained in several , equivalent ways Following the picture of a pressure field outlined above , lift is the difference of pressure between upper and lower surface of the wing . The molecules will bounce against the wing skin more at the lower side than at the upper side , and the difference is lift . Or you look at the macroscopic picture : A certain mass of air has been accelerated downwards by the wing , and this required a force to act on that air . This force is what keeps the aircraft up in the air : Lift . If you look at the wing as a black box and only pay attention to the impulse of the inflowing and outflowing air , the wing will change the impulse by adding a downward component . The reaction force of this impulse change is lift . Either way , you will arrive at the same result . By the way : Most of the directional change happens in the forward part of the airfoil , not at the trailing edge ! Lift is a matter of definition Lift and induced drag are both part of the pressures acting on the wing . If you add up all the pressure forces acting on a wing , their resulting vector will point slightly backwards . The streamwise component is drag , and the component orthogonal to the direction of movement is lift . This is just a defininion , made for simplicity .
Non-holographic radar systems such as those used in fighter aircraft and active guided missiles only point in one direction at a time . Normally , when the radar is in search mode , a mechanism inside the radar makes the beam move from side to side ( possibly up and down as well ) , so it has a wider field of view and can pinpoint the direction of any aircraft it finds . The aircraft with the radar warning receiver ( RWR ) sees a brief pulse of radiation every second or so : only when the beam is pointing in its direction . This way , it knows the radar emitter is in search mode , and the direction of the emitter . Every aircraft in the radar 's field of view will see the beam at different times , and they will all see the radar on their RWR screens . In a combat zone this is potentially a lot of emitters , but the RWR can analyse the radar signal to identify the radar : what type of aircraft , SAM , or ground radar it is , and whether it 's friendly or enemy . Getting the position of the target only every second is n't good enough to guide a missile towards it . When the radar is in track or launch mode , it stops scanning the beam , and keeps it pointed at the target aircraft . The RWR on the target aircraft now sees much faster pulses of radiation , so it knows that it is the sole target of the radar . At this time , it can warn the pilot of a missile lock . But because the radar is now only pointing in this one direction , other aircraft in the area do n't get illuminated by radar at all . Their RWR systems wo n't pick anything up . Only the aircraft that 's actually threatened gets the missile lock warning . In addition , the same analysis that can identify what type of radar is illuminating the aircraft can also identify fully active radar-guided missiles . Like when the aircraft 's radar is in track or launch mode , the missile 's radar emitter only points in one direction , and does n't scan , so only the target aircraft will see it . Obviously it 's a little bit more complicated than this . There are a lot of details about how frequent the radar pulses are , and how the RWR knows the range of the source , but I hope I 've captured all the important information in an understandable way .
All of these methods are used . Nosewheel steering is common on most commercial aircraft using a tiller . Rudder , differential braking , differential thrust and even motors in the wheels ( experimental only as far as I know ) are also used , <URL> . Engine thrust is used to move forward but differential thrust might also be used when negotiating tight turns . <URL>
The <URL> on Wikipedia gives an overview of the steps . Determine the weights and arms of all mass within the aircraft . Multiply weights by arms for all mass to calculate moments . Add the moments of all mass together . Divide the total moment by the total weight of the aircraft to give an overall arm . The Basic Empty Weight ( BEW ) of the aircraft will come from the Weight &amp; Balance information that is unique to each aircraft . The computed arm for the BEW may have some rounding error , so treat it as informational . Use the precise figures for Weight and Moment from your aircraft 's W&amp;B . The arms , distances from some reference datum , will also come from your aircraft 's W&amp;B info : fuel , front seats , rear seats , and baggage areas on a Cessna 172 . Copy those into your table as well . Avgas ( 100LL ) weighs 6 pounds per gallon , so the weight is 6 times the number of gallons . I like to work top-to-bottom and left to right . For the grand finale , divide the sum of the Moment column by the sum of the Weight column to get the overall center of gravity . The example below is from my PP-ASEL checkride taken in a Cessna 172 . The items in boldface are computed values . The digits after the decimal are there for typographical purposes and do not necessarily indicate significant figures . $ $ \ begin { array } { c | r | r | r | } &amp; \ textit { Weight } &amp; \ textit { Arm } &amp; \ textit { Moment } \ \ \ hline \ text { Airplane } &amp; 1 { , } 665.6 &amp; 39.2 &amp; 65 { , } 928.93 \ \ &amp; &amp; &amp; \ \ \ text { Fuel ( 50 gal ) } &amp; \ bf { 300.0 } &amp; 48.0 &amp; \ bf { 14 { , } 400.00 } \ \ &amp; &amp; &amp; \ \ \ text { Bacon } &amp; 180.0 &amp; 37.0 &amp; \ bf { 6 { , } 660.00 } \ \ \ text { Shelton } &amp; 172.0 &amp; 37.0 &amp; \ bf { 6 { , } 364.00 } \ \ &amp; &amp; &amp; \ \ \ text { Duffel } &amp; 10.0 &amp; 73.0 &amp; \ bf { 6 { , } 364.00 } \ \ \ text { Shelton bag } &amp; 10.0 &amp; 73.0 &amp; \ bf { 6 { , } 364.00 } \ \ &amp; &amp; &amp; \ \ \ text { Backpack } &amp; 15.0 &amp; 93.3 &amp; \ bf { 1 { , } 399.50 } \ \ \ hline &amp; \ bf { 2 { , } 352.6 } &amp; \ bf { 40.9 } &amp; \ bf { 96 { , } 212.43 } \ end { array } $ $ In this particular case -- given for information only -- the center of gravity ( 40.9 ≈ 96,212.43 / 2,352.6 ) at the total weight is within limits for the Normal category as given in the aircraft 's Pilot Operating Handbook ( POH ) .

In fact , ARINC 429 is used in the " federated " avionics , this is the " old " system used in many aircraft like A320 , B737 , ... Federated avionics require a lot of wires which generates a lot of weight . In ARINC we have approximately one wire per device , so the speed ( 100Kbps or 12,5 Kbps depending on the selected mode ) is sufficient . ARINC 429 Architecture : <URL> In " new " aircraft like A350 or B787 the industry use the Integrated Modular Avionics in order to reduce weight and reduce the number of S/N to stock . In this kind on avionic all computers are merged in a couple of " cabinet " composed of multiple core processor units , shared ROM , shared RAM , shared graphic cards . All these cards are linked , in the cabinet , with the Backplane BUS ( ARINC 659 ) , which operates at 60Mbps as a commercial aviation bus All cabinet are linked , each other and with actuators , using AFDX ( ARINC 664 ) who look like Ethernet protocol and work at the speed of 100Mbit/s .

Short answer : High-strength aluminium alloys are tricky to weld correctly . Aluminium is such a fine material for aircraft structures that the need to rivet it is gladly accepted . Two things are important : While steel has a temperature range in which it gets more and more runny , aluminium alloys change from solid to liquid within a few degrees . Also , heat conductivity in iron-based alloys is lower than in aluminium , so heating steel locally will keep the surrounding material cooler and more solid compared to aluminium . While welding thin sheets of steel is trivial , it needs <URL> . For very thin sheets , special equipment like a water-cooled copper backing on which the aluminium sheets rest , so their back is cooled , are needed . Also , the melting temperature of steel and titanium is high enough for it to glow long before it melts , while aluminium will melt without giving you any optical hint of its temperature . High-strength aluminium is produced by <URL> . The <URL> atoms dispersed through the aluminium matrix which locally distort the atomic lattice and strengthen it . If they are heated and rapidly cooled by welding , the copper distribution would be changed and the material would be weakened around the welding area . To harden the finished structure again is rather impractical in most cases , so riveting is the better alternative . A third speciality is the oxide layer on aluminium , which has a higher melting temperature than the base material . You need an AC <URL> welder to disrupt the aluminium oxide layer , so your choice of welding techniques is rather limited . Also , riveted structures are easier to inspect and to repair . Most repairs need to remove aircraft structure for access , and a riveted structure is easier to disassemble and to put together again after the repair using slightly thicker rivets . My experience with aluminium welding stopped at 4mm thick sheets ; while thicker ones were easy to weld , I never managed to weld thinner ones . You sit in front of your structure and heat the spot where you want to start welding . Watching it through the darkened head screen you wait until the spot under the arc becomes glossy , which signals that the surface has started to melt . Now you need to add your welding wire like crazy to keep the spot from heating more , and get the spot moving . If you fail to do so , a second later you will have a hole under your arc , because the aluminium has molten completely and has fallen away . Doing this with 2mm sheets was a pure exercise in futility for me - the moment the surface became glossy it fell away already . Edit : Thanks to @voretaq7 for sharing the link about friction stir welding in the comments ! This is made possible by precise positioning of the parts and a computer-controlled welding head and will see wider application in the future . Eclipse Aerospace claims it helps them to avoid 60 % of rivets in their jet aircraft .
Many ( especially larger ) airlines have a history and infrastructure for engines from a specific manufacturer and are unlikely to change that , the cost would extend far beyond just the cost of changing the contract . E.g. KLM has a massive investment in maintenance facilities for GE engines , workshops , spare parts warehouses , highly trained specialised technicians . Retooling to RR would be prohibitive for them . Of course a smaller operation without maintenance facilities of their own might be more flexible in that and just buy whatever is cheapest at the time , contracting out maintenance to various companies as needed . But even then , it 's often more economical to have a single maintenance provider doing all your work for you , which might well mean a provider who 's specialised in a single series of engines , for example if you 're based at Schiphol there 's a good chance you 'll be contracting out your maintenance to KLM and their GE specialised shops . So there are many good reasons for airlines to stick with a single engine supplier ( and to a degree with a single aircraft manufacturer ) , even if the cost of buying those engines is higher than selecting competing engines from another manufacturer . Say you 're going to save 0.1 % in your fuel bills for the 2 new aircraft you 're buying to increase the fleet of 20 with other engines you have already ( and that 's a big if , those engines are pretty close between manufacturers for a specific aircraft ) . You 'd need to fly a LOT for it to be worth building an entire duplicate maintenance network just for those few new aircraft . Of course if it 's part of a long term plan to replace the entire fleet with aircraft using that other manufacturer 's engines , that 's a different story . But mixed engine fleets tend not to be the most economical way to go , even if on one type manufacturer A is marginally more fuel efficient and on type B manufacturer B is marginally more fuel efficient ( and that 's what you 're going to see , marginal differences only ) . If you 're talking an operation like Delta or United , with hundreds of aircraft of each type , it might be a different story . But then too you 're talking about more aircraft with each manufacturer 's engines than most other airlines have in total , and they 'll have multiple maintenance shops themselves , making it easier to have a facility for each manufacturer ( and of course in case of the big US airlines , they tend to have ended up with that in the course of gobbling up other airlines anyway ) .
The fuel system in aircraft generally includes a left and right tank within the corresponding wings . Each tank generally provides fuel to the engines on that wing . The crossfeed valve is used to temporarily connect the two sides of the system . This system allows the shortest route for the fuel and keeps the systems separate , so a leak on one side can not drain the entire system . The crossfeed valve is generally kept shut for this reason . A couple scenarios illustrate when opening the valve might be necessary . To keep the plane balanced , both wing tanks should have about the same amount of fuel . However , for various reasons , they could become unbalanced . The crossfeed valve allows fuel to flow from the tank with too much fuel to the tank with less fuel . Another scenario would be the loss of an engine . In a twin-engine airplane , the remaining engine would need to be able to draw fuel from both wing tanks . Note : especially in larger aircraft , fuel systems can be much more complicated , with multiple tanks in each wing and also in the fuselage . Fuel transfer also becomes more complicated . Using the 737 as an example , this is the fuel system control panel with the crossfeed switch in the center . With the crossfeed valve open , turning off the fuel pumps on one tank will cause more fuel to be drawn from the tanks on the other side .
There are multiple ways to fly and control Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAV ) , or drones , for e.g. the Predator . <URL> Source : science.howstuffworks.com Some UAVs ( like the Global Hawk ) can perform the entire mission ( from takeoff to landing ) autonomously , negating the need for a pilot . Most of the UAVs , like Predator can perform ( i.e. fly in ) some simple missions ( like reconnaissance ) autonomously . In case a geostationary satellite is used for communication with the UAV , the latency is around 300 ms ( The electromagnetic waves have to travel ~ 70000 km ) . In case of other delays ( like equipment etc. ) this will not be greater than 500 ms or around half a second . This is not significant in case of slow moving systems like Predator ( they are not dog-fighting , after all ) and the ' pilot ' can effectively control the aircraft . The only situation where this is a problem is when the UAV is taking off/landing and in this case , the control is handed over to local LoS operators . The Predator is reported to have a ' latency ' of around two seconds , which causes problems during takeoff/landing . According to the <URL> , But the two-second delay between a pilot moving a joystick in Nevada and an aircraft responding in Afghanistan is enough to cause a crash during take-off and landing . Crews in Afghanistan control ' launch and recovery ' through direct contact with antennae on the aircraft . Half an hour after take-off , control of the Reaper is handed to a crew in Nevada ; half an hour before landing , it returns to the crews on the ground in Kandahar . Note that the RAF also does things the same way . According to the report on <URL> , Although the personnel will be permanently based at RAF Waddington , some will go to Afghanistan to control the take-off and landing of the drones locally .
The short of it is that most such ex-military aircraft , and replicas built new to spec on these designs , do not have a " type " as defined by the FAA at all . Because the absence of a type means the aircraft ca n't be certified as airworthy in the normal way , and pilots of these aircraft can not receive a type rating to fly them , the certification of aircraft and pilot is a bit different . The aircraft must first be issued an FAA " Special Airworthiness Certificate " . This is essentially a slightly more rigorous form of airworthiness inspections for type-rated aircraft and virtually identical to that for experimental and/or home-built aircraft , resulting in the certification of the craft as airworthy in general even though it does not fall into a predefined aircraft type for which FAA instructors can issue type ratings . The airman , because he ca n't be certified to fly a non-existent FAA aircraft type , must receive a special rating certification called a " Letter of Authorization " , allowing the pilot to fly aircraft of a specific model , and/or a " set " of aircraft that have similar configuration , power , weight and other operational specifications and limits ( but that are n't similar or common enough for a type rating ) . The training required for an LOA includes a combination of ground school and flight school containing information and in-flight training on the specific model to be authorized . But , when it is not possible or practical to do in-flight training in the exact model of aircraft to be authorized ( usually because the aircraft in question is a single-seater with no two-seat configuration available ) , flight training in a " similar " aircraft can be a substitute . Pilots of vintage single-seat warplanes like P-51s typically get their flight training for the category in something similar to what military pilots of the day would have used , such as an AT-6 . If the flight school just happens to have a Twin Mustang laying around , that would be even better , and also more directly applicable to multi-engine warbirds like the P-38 . Back to your example , say you get your hands on a " de-fanged " A-10 ( which would require a ton of ballast weight to be added , literally ; the GAU-8 weighs about as much as a Cadillac , but I digress ) . All flying examples are single-seaters ; however , the avionics , especially of the original A-10A without the glass cockpit upgrade of the PEUP program , are comparable to any 70 's - era jet trainer . So , you could receive flight training in a T-33 , which is a trainer-compatible straight-wing turbojet with more similarities in its flight characteristics to the A-10 than differences . Coupled with ground instruction and/or simulator time on the specific systems of the A-10 ( Which wo n't include any weapons integration , but honestly for the A-10A that was a single FLIR display and the arming/firing switches , and the C variant only upgraded that to a pair of MFDs ; other than relative positioning , the flight instruments of the A-10 would be familiar to any PPL ) , you could be certified to fly your A-10 solo without any flight hours in an A-10 specifically . The same might apply to aircraft that do have two-seater variants but where the flight school is unable to procure one . If you won the Powerball , and put a chunk of that money into your very own milsurp F-15C ( \ $ 38 million a pop back when they were being made and that 's in late 1970s dollars ) , it 's highly unlikely your local flight school would be willing to pony up for an F-15D two-seat configuration to train you on it ( unless you bought the plane for them with another big chunk of your lottery winnings ) . They might , however , have a T-38 in their inventory or be able to loan one from the nearby naval air station , which would give you a primer into the capabilities of a multi-engine turbofan ex-military fighter . Honestly , though , if you wanted to fly an F-15 , you 'll probably want a two-seater , and your CPL , so you could give rides to paying customers and offset the cost of running this beast ( typical fuel load without droptanks , 13,500 lbs which is about 1,985 gallons . With Jet A running about \ $ 4.85 / gallon , the cost of a fillup would be somewhere in the $ 10,000 neighborhood which would give you a cruising range of about 1,000 miles , so you could offer this as a special type of jet taxi ) . Here 's some more reading on the subject : <URL>
One way to approach this question is to look at the annual budget for an airport . I 'm going to assume that you mean a large passenger airport as opposed to one focused on serving general aviation , cargo , etc. . . Let 's use SFO ( San Francisco International ) as our example . It 's a city-owned airport , so the budget is a public document . Here 's <URL> . Page 5 ( page 7 in the PDF ) breaks down major sources of revenue . We have some that fall into the category of " direct " revenue in your question : landing fees , terminal rentals , etc. . . under the " aviation " category . Some of the terminal rental fees include space for purposes you might not consider aviation uses , like back offices for airline staff We also have $ 60-80M in " PFC Revenue . " PFC stands for <URL> ; it 's a charge that is added to the ticket price of everyone flying out of that airport . Finally , there are the non-aviation revenues . The bulk of those come in two categories : parking and concessions . Parking is self-explanatory . Concessions describes all the independent businesses that operate at the airport . Many businesses lease terminal space for retail shops ( including duty-free ) , restaurants and take-out food , lounges , currency exchange , etc. . . They all pay rent and/or a share of revenue to the airport based on the terms of their lease . SFO also books about $ 23M/year in revenue off the sale of electricity , as the airport sells electricity to its tenants ( airlines , concessions , etc. . . ) . I suspect , but am not positive , that these electricity sales are a nice moneymaker for the airport , as it can purchase hydropower from the City at extremely low cost and resell it at market ( utility company ) rates to its tenants . This is a quirk particular to San Francisco however . If you scroll through the detailed budget in the PDF , you 'll find entries for other revenue categories . Examples include advertising fees ( Clear Channel pays the airport to put up ads in the terminals and other areas ) , revenue for things like ATMs and baggage carts , leases to rental car companies , fees paid by taxicabs and airport buses for the right to access airport property , and even permit fees paid by filmmakers and photographers using the airport . Heck , the airport even charges the regional transit agency $ 3.2 M/year in rent and custodial fees for the airport train station . Browsing through the budget should give you a pretty good idea where a large US airport can make money from non-aviation services .
Great question ! I am far from an expert in supersonic flight , but according to this <URL> , Ed Haering ( an aerospace engineer at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards , Ca . who I would consider to be an expert ) answers just this question and says that it is n't a problem for other airplanes : chetman1020 : Do sonic booms ever disrupt other things in the air ? Ed : Sonic booms can temporarily dissipate or accentuate a " Sun-Dog , " the small bit of a rainbow off to either side of the Sun caused by high altitude ice crystals . Aircraft are not affected by booms from other aircraft .

Can a drone travel beyond the range of its remote control signal ?
If the controlling software allows it then yes . There 's at least one drone available where autonomous flight <URL> ; the <URL> says that the drone will continue its " mission " even if you lose the signal to it , although the overall length of the flight path is limited to 5km and the drone will not fly close to airports . Other drones stop and hover or land if they lose the connection to the controller . Whether doing this is actually a good idea ( or legal in whichever jurisdiction you want to operate in ) or not is a whole other question .
Short answer If a single range should be stated for ACAS II , it would be the reliable range of 14 NM , even if targets can displayed by current TCAS II up to 30/40 NM . Reliable means here : a track can be established with a probability of at least 90 per cent for aircraft within the surveillance range . The reliable range of 14 NM is achievable with a ground plane antenna a power of 250 W and a Mode S sensitivity of -- 74 dBm . Diversity of ranges There are different range values that can be considered : Overall pulse detection range is 30 NM . Reliable surveillance range is 14 NM . Recommended RA range is 12 NM . Guaranteed range is 4.5 NM . The range must be limited because it impacts the number of transponder addresses to be stored for a given transponder density as well as the number of interrogations within a volume , hence radio spectrum use and reliability . ACAS II recommendations by ICAO ACAS II ICAO recommendations are found in <URL> , Airborne Collision Avoidance System ( ACAS ) Manual : Interrogation pulse detection range is 14 NM for Mode A/C and 30 NM for Mode S . The equipment should have the capacity for surveillance of any mix of Mode A/C or Mode S targets up to at least 30 aircraft . Surveillance must be reliable within 14 NM , with an aircraft density of 0.3 aircraft per square NM within 5 NM ( and up to 142 aircraft within 30 NM ) . The equipment should assess as possible collision threats only those targets within a maximum range of 12 NM . No target outside this range should be eligible to generate an RA . As density increases , reliability decreases . If the overall target count ever exceeds the surveillance capacity at any range up to 14 NM , the long-range targets may be dropped . The system reliability is guaranteed within the minimum range of 4.5 NM . This radius is deemed adequate for providing protection for up to 500 kt encounter . TCAS version 7.1 TCAS II is the sole implementation of ACAS II which fully comply with ACAS II . The reference ( paying ) documents are : <URL> ( RTCA ) and <URL> ( EUROCAE ) . From the EASA document <URL> TCAS II can simultaneously track up to 30 aircraft , within a nominal range of 14 NM for Mode A/C targets and 30 NM for Mode S targets . In implementations that allow for the use of the Mode S extended squitter , the normal surveillance range may be increased beyond the nominal 14 NM . However , this information is not used for collision avoidance purposes . This is confirmed in FAA document <URL> TCAS has a requirement to provide reliable surveillance out to a range of 14 nmi and in traffic densities of up to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile . [ ... ] TCAS can simultaneously track up to 30 transponder-equipped aircraft within a nominal range of 30 nmi .
An airship pilot has three ways of adjusting lift : Every lighter-than-air vehicle needs some ballast to adjust its weight . This could be sand , but mostly water is used . A blimp is only partially filled with helium . The envelope is held taut by filling a bag inside with air , called a <URL> . If you press a little more air in this bag , the overall density of the gasses in the envelope goes up , while the volume stays practically constant . This allows for fine adjustment . Forward and aft ballonets even allow for trimming the pitch attitude . When the airship moves , the air does provide a little dynamic lift or downforce , depending on pitch attitude and elevator deflection . This is a little tricky , because airships are not stable , and a pitch-up command will lead to altitude loss below a critical speed . The ballonets in this cutaway drawing of a Goodyear blimp are numbered 2 and 4 . On a calm day , the biggest disturbance is actually the sun . If the envelope is exposed to direct sunlight , it will heat up and the gas within will be heated as well , causing the blimp to rise . If the sun is covered by a cloud , the gas cools down and loses some lift . On partially cloudy days it is not easy to keep the same altitude ! Another threat is an unstable atmospheric temperature gradient . Glider pilots love this , because it will give them strong thermals , but the gas inside the airship will behave similarly to that bubble of warmer gas which causes thermals . When the airship rises , the gas inside cools less quickly than the surrounding air , and the airship will gain lift when it goes up . It becomes really bad on the way down : Now the gas warms up less quickly as well , and the airship loses lift as it comes down . The airship pilot needs to drop some ballast or create more dynamic lift , or his craft will slam into the ground . Long-range airships like the LZ-127 used a mixture of hydrocarbon gases as fuel . This mixture ( called <URL> ) was balanced to be just as heavy as air and filled some of the gas cells within the envelope . Consumed fuel would be displaced by air , so no lift adjustment was needed on a long trip .
In AF447 the falling motion most definitely affected the angle of attack . Due to the fact that the pf did keep the stick pulled back for all but the last few seconds of the fall the aircraft was so steep that , although the aircraft was falling at a slight pitch up , angles of attack actually reached as high as 60 ° . The descent was so steep that the air was passing over the pitot tubes at such an angle that it was reading below 40 knots , although the plane was moving far faster then that . The computer required that the airspeed be of a certain value to consider the aoa plausible so the stall warning stopped sounding even though the aoa was between 30 ° and 60 ° during the fall . When it hit the water the forward ground speed and the vertical speed were both 107 kts . As far as why the pilot did not realize he was stalled , that 's the question of the century . Much effort has been put into figuring that out , and there are numerous things that are at play . But in the end I do n't think anyone has come up with a satisfactory answer for that . If you want to dig into the causes of this crash and get a good understanding of Airbus systems in general I highly recommend <URL> and it 's companion <URL> . The author is uniquely qualified and gives the most thorough explanation yet is not as technically challenging as reading the BEA report . All of the numbers mentioned in this answer come from the linked book .
how does it not immediately start spinning ? Physics , and engineering . But I guess that you would like a bit more detail , so let 's try dive in . wheel brakes They tend to have a stabilizing effect by shifting some of the weight on the front wheel and allowing the pilots to control the aircraft with more effectiveness . spoilers These are automatically controlled by the Fly-by-Wire system , so if required they would be retracted . thrust reversers If they are functioning properly , the resulting force will go through the vertical plane containing the C.o.G. ( but a bit below it ) , so they do not pose much of a problem . Another thing you have not mentioned , but I am going to add , is crabbed landings ( such as <URL> ) , since in these situations the aircraft DO tend to spin a little . In these cases , in the timeframe between touchdown and braking , 2 things help the aircraft remain on the runway : the vertical tail ( with the rudder ) , and the position of the main landing gear w.r.t. the center of gravity of the aircraft . As it can be seen in <URL> taken from the lecture notes of the course I followed ( the title translates to " Braking run in crabbed landing " ) , normal tricycle gear aircraft tend to be stabilized by their own landing gear in this situation , while the same can not be said for old school taildraggers . So , what really could cause a problem ? The answer is wind gusts ( especially if the wind is perpendicular to the runway ) , uneven conditions of the runway ( say , a puddle or a thin layer of ice on one side of the runway will cause one set of main gear to have less grip than its counterpart on the other side , causing a yawing towards the side with more grip ) , asymmetrical failures in the thrust reversers , excessive braking while also turning the aircraft to realign to the centerline ( particularly a problem if the distance between the two main gears is not sufficient ) . How does the aircraft remain on the runway despite these possible problems ? At high speeds , thanks to the vertical tail ; and at low speeds thanks to the front nose gear . At in-between speeds , the situation is slightly more complicated : the tail is not much useful anymore , while the front gear would risk breaking if used to correct too much . So , for example , a FbW system can help through the asymmetrical use of spoilers . An example of what could happen , but seen during a take-off , is illustrated <URL> ( video kindly provided by MichaelK in chat ) .
This situation is due to usually 2 + sectors being worked . Each sector will use its own frequency when split . When these sectors get combined , one of 2 things will happen . 1 ) The controller will just work with both sectors frequencies keyed up and be listening on both and transmitting on both and have everyone go to the approrpriate frequency for the sector they 're in or near . 2 ) The controller wants everyone on one frequency and has everyone going into those sector 's that they are working to be on just one frequency . Frequency congestion and capability ( if the transmitters/receivers are different locations for the different frequencies ) are also factors .
If your definition of drone is any remote control aircraft freely available to consumers , then the answer is yes , but highly unlikely . <URL> Its very unlikely , but it is possible . First , I 'd like to point out that Radio Controlled Aircraft ( RC Aircraft ) have been available to consumers since at least the late 1950s . Hobbists build RC aircraft all the time , and when I was a kid I built my own RC aircraft that was much bigger than most commercially available " drones " . To focus on drones alone misses a big slice of the pie . RC aircraft are sometimes built as 1/4 scale models of the original aircraft and can weigh 100lbs or more , so imagine a remote control aircraft that is 25 % the size of the real aircraft . So , the potential has always been there for at least the last half a century for a remote control aircraft to have enough mass to potentially cause a serious collision with a real aircraft . Imagine if a couple of 18lbs geese took down the Flight 1549 , what would a 100 + lbs quarter scale RC Aircraft do . Personally , I 've never been too concerned with this because I 've flown both RC aircraft and real aircraft . It would be extremely hard for a drone or RC aircraft pilot to target an aircraft and hit it in its most vulnerable locations such as cockpit or engines . So , yes , its possible , but I would not lose any sleep over it .
Only if the airplane wants you to know it is armed . It has several ways at its discretion : If it has a powerful radar , it can switch it on at altitude and announce its presence to other aircraft up to 150 km away . It can send <URL> squawks which are reserved for military aircraft . Note that IFF is used by both military and <URL> . Both methods are only indirectly indicating whether an aircraft is armed . The armament itself will not show up at BVR distances . In the end , if you want to be sure , you have to move some sensors close to the aircraft if the weapons are carried externally , or even wait until they are deployed when they are carried internally . Especially many small aircraft are used both in a civilian and a military role . A BVR radar is a dead giveaway for a military aircraft - such equipment is not fitted with civilian aircraft , and removed or disabled when an ex-military aircraft is converted to civilian use . Similarly , supersonic speed , which can reliably be detected with Doppler radars , is a telltale sign of military aircraft approaching . Transport aircraft are much harder to distinguish from bombers on the basis of radar signals alone , and in the end you can not exclude that the hostile aircraft tries to spoof your equipment into classifying it as a civilian aircraft .
Indeed , the aspect ratio is defined as you describe . It is a way to define how slender the wing is for a given wing area , which is the main parameter in determining how to generate enough lift to keep the aircraft aloft . An area is two-dimensional , and a broadly rectangular shape like a wing area is defined by the length and the breadth of it : span and chord . Aspect ratio describes the proportions of span and chord : a short stubby wing , or a long and slender one ? This is one of the main parameters in how much drag the wing creates : a long slender wing minimises one particular form of aerodynamic drag , called induced drag . <URL> <URL> But a wing is a cantilever beam , subjected to aerodynamic lift . The lift forces bend the wing upwards , and the wing structure must produce internal forces that cancel out the aerodynamic lift . In a hollow cantilever beam like a wing , the skin mainly does that : the upper skin resists compression , and the lower skin resists tension . The further away the upper and lower skin are , the lower the stresses . A structural engineer wants to give as much distance between the plates as possible : he wants the wing to be very thick , in order for it to be light in weight . But again aerodynamics puts a limit to this : a very thick wing would create too much form drag , so the structures people are given the maximum distance that the aerodynamics can support . Wing thickness affects aspect ratio in defining the maximum AR that can be achieved . The wing thickness is not part of the induced drag , and does not appear in the definition of the aspect ratio . It is an important defining parameter in wing weight and other forms of drag .
Why do you need a kite ? A glider is much better suited to the task . Again , nature has invented this long ago . Albatrosses use a technique called <URL> to cover wide distances over water , using the windshear close to the surface . <URL> have tried to imitate this with gliders , albeit with limited success . The few who tried it could indeed stay in the air by harvesting energy from windshear , but the dynamic loads ( up to 4 g ) were too much to do this over an extended time .
If you keep increasing your angle of attack , your drag will increase and combined with the increasing along trajectory component ( your path angle will increase ) of the weight vector will slow you down ( assuming your thrust does not exceed your weight + drag ) . Because you slow down , your lift will decrease . The lift will now be less than the across trajectory component of the weight vector and the flight path will become less steep . I do n't understand your second point . The critical angle of attack is where the maximum lift coefficient occurs . If you increase the angle of attack further , the wing will stall and the lift will decrease . This does not occur at Vx
Radio was not widely used until the 1930s , before that , mostly light signals were used . Early ground support aircraft in WW I could drop little notes which were pencilled by the observer , stuffed in a small capsule to which a streamer was fitted , and that was dropped as closely as possible to the troops which should get that message . This method was still used in WW II , when most aircraft had radio , because only specially equipped ground troops had compatible receivers . The first regular flights by night were 1921 for the air mail connection between Omaha and Chicago , and electric flood lights were positioned along the flight path . When Lufthansa opened the first night connection between the Reich and East Prussia in 1926 , they posted burning oil drums along the way to mark where the pilot had to fly . Communication the other way ( air to ground ) was not possible on those flights . The first air-to-ground radio communication used morse signals , and this is the origin for these strange three-letter names for things like local air pressure at the ground ( QFE ) or pressure corrected to sea level conditions ( QNH ) . There was a whole lot more of those , including some to order coffee before landing , but they are no longer necessary . <URL> .
Cotswold Airport , near the village of Kemble in Gloucestershire , England . Cotswolds landing strip , has become the busiest aviation scrapyard in the world . Usually the cockpit parts are taken out before they end up there , but you never know ; you may get lucky and they grant you access for a day . I do n't see why not ! Chevron Aircraft Maintenance Ltd is responsible for the dismantling of all Boeing 737 series aircraft .
Helicopters are very inefficient in forward flight , for several reasons . Consider Glauert 's high speed assumption , i.e. the helicopter can be represented as an aircraft with a circular wing during high speed flight . Now , if you know anything about basic fixed-wing performance , you 'll realize immediately that this implies an aspect ratio just over 1 , which is awfully small . You may recall that for a fixed-wing aircraft , induced drag is inversely proportional aspect ratio -- so a very low aspect ratio means very high induced drag ! Induced drag is normally not a big deal for fixed-wing aircraft at high speed because it 's proportional to the square of the lift coefficient ( which decreases with speed ) , but ... In reality , the situation for a helicopter is even worse ! Glauert 's assumption assumes we have an ideal rotor , i.e. one that has a uniform induced velocity throughout . In practice , the inflow distribution over the rotor is highly non-uniform , especially at high speeds where the advancing side of the rotor is in a very different aerodynamic environment than the retreating side . Even on a very simple level , the " working area " swept on the retreating side is much smaller than that on the advancing side . Since lift needs to be balanced , momentum theory implies a higher induced velocity over the smaller area " worked " by the retreating side , and therefore a much higher induced drag at high speeds than an equivalent fixed wing aircraft . <URL> <URL> As the helicopter goes faster , and as the rotor turns more slowly , more of the retreating side blade will stall , which leads to a dramatic increase in drag . This starts on the inboard section of the blades , and moves outwards as the advance ratio ( ratio between flight speed and tip speed ) increases . In fact , the most inboard sections of the blade will even be in reversed flow -- and airfoils do n't work too well backwards . On the advancing side , things are bad too , but for different reasons . The profile drag of the rotor increases rapidly with speed . Moreover , as the advance ratio increases , the advancing tip Mach number also increases -- and as the blades get into the high transonic regime , local shocks begin to form and lead to even larger increases in drag . This can be delayed by slowing the rotor down , but that makes the problems on the retreating side even worse ! In general , it 's hard to develop airfoils that work well in both regimes . Outside of the rotor itself , the rotor hub is very draggy , between the main rotor shaft , pitch links , swashplate , hinges and blade grips , etc. . Helicopters usually have pretty " utilitarian " fuselages , as well , which are not so well streamlined . Plus , you have the tail rotor , which has most of the same problems as the main rotor . Back to the specific question of range , the Bregruet range equation says that the range of an aircraft is proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio and the speed of the aircraft . We 've already established that the L/D of a helicopter is pretty bad , especially at speed . So , the cruise speed is going to be pretty low and the L/D is going to be pretty low , so to sum up , the range is going to be really low . The tradeoff is that the helicopter is very good at hovering -- even amongst VTOL platforms , the helicopter is the most efficient . Speed and range are the price you pay for that capability .
Yes , it is entirely possible that the airplane will hit a wall where no more acceleration is possible while climbing . This is called the sound barrier . Besides the geometry , both the <URL> and the Mach number influence L/D . As a rule of thumb , the zero-lift drag coefficient <URL> when accelerating to Mach 1 . Slenderness and sweep help to keep this rise down , but some is inevitable . Below is a plot with test data from the linked NACA Research Memorandum A55F06 for wings of different aspect ratio . <URL> Figure 9 from NACA Research Memorandum A55F06 ( picture <URL> ) Just so you do n't think this can be overcome by clever design , below is a survey of the drag rise of supersonic aircraft , taken from a short course on fighter design by Ray Whitford . While engineers could lower the drag rise with increasing experience , the Sears-Haack body shows that there is a theoretical lower limit that can not be avoided . <URL> Supersonic drag rise survey by Ray Whitford . Note that here the absolute increase in overall drag is plotted . This graph includes all effects like <URL> which contribute to the supersonic drag rise . However , this can be overcome by inserting a short dive which helps to gain enough kinetic energy to <URL> shortly past Mach 1 . But you need to start with enough excess thrust so any net thrust is left in the supersonic region . By the way , the thrust of your ideal rocket will increase on the way up because the atmospheric pressure drops . This will result in an increase in the pressure difference between the thrust chamber and outside pressure .
Yes , a hot air balloon would change class , if you are adding an engine and propeller to provide thrust . With powered flight comes the need to provide some form of flight control ; at this point , you have an airship , albeit a <URL> . According to the FAA 's <URL> , and much like @voretaq7 's citation in another answer : An airship is an engine-driven , lighter-than-air aircraft , that can be steered . The FAA has a whole section on <URL> , for further reading .
VOR Ground Station is aligned with magnetic North . It emits two signals : a 360 ° sweeping variable signal an omni-directional reference signal When an aircraft receives those signals , its receiver compares those and a measures the phase difference . This gives a precise radial position of the aircraft which is displayed on its Omni-Bearing Indicator ( OBI ) , Horizontal Situation Indicator ( HSI ) or a Radio Magnetic Indicator ( RMI ) , or a combination of two different kinds . <URL> the two signals : <URL> Blue is 360 ° sweeping signal Green is omni-directional reference signal

Fuel The fuel consumption of the A380 is about 11 metric tonnes per hour . With a fuel price of <URL> , this results in \ $ 11000 per flight hour . Amortization An A380 will cost about \ $ 350M . The aircraft will be used for about 25 to 30 years , but let 's assume the amortization period is about 20 years with a residual value of \ $ 50M . With an interest rate of 5 % , you would pay about \ $ 24M per year . That is about \ $ 2740 per hour , or \ $ 0.76 per second , flying or not . Assuming a usage of 60 % , taking into account turn around times at the gate and maintenance downtime , it boils down to \ $ 3915 per flight hour . Crew Captain costs <URL> . Let 's assume they fly about 60 hours per month , the combined flight deck crew cost is about \ $ 350 per flight hour for the base salary . Another \ $ 80 needs to be added for allowances bringing the total to \ $ 430 per flight hour . Cabin crew rate would be around $ 40 per hour , so for 20 crew the cost will be \ $ 800 per flight hour . Also allowances for overnight stays and hotel costs need to be taken into account Airport charges These vary extremely between airports . You can basically break the costs down into costs related to the aircraft , the passengers and various taxes by the government . Aircraft cost usually are related to the Maximum Take-off Mass ( MTOM ) of the aircraft and the noise category . A Boeing 747-400 , while less heavy than an A380 , will in some cases be more expensive due to the higher noise level . Many airports differentiate between peak and off-peak hour landings . I ca n't find accurate data for the A380 but an old table that I have for the Boeing 747-400 suggest that total the cost vary between about \ $ 6000 to \ $ 25000 . Overflight charges Fees are levied by countries whose territory is flown over , mainly to cover ATC cost . The cost is typically based on the distance flown and the MTOW . For a 747-400ER over Europe , the fee is on average <URL> . Assuming an average speed of about 900km/h , the hourly cost is about 1300EUR/h . These costs are lower over the high seas and over the US . Rough total Based on the above , the total will be between \ $ 22,000 and \ $ 41,000 per hour .
The wingtip vortices create both upwash and downwash ; The downwash lies within the wingspan and affects the wing angle of attack while the upwash region lies outside the wingspan and can be utilized by another aircraft ( or bird ) flying behind and above the wing . The flow induced by the downwash reduces the effective angle of attack of the ( finite ) wing and causes the induced drag . See if this image clarifies your doubt . <URL> Source : aerospaceweb.org Consider the upwash before the wing and downwash after the wing ( section ) . <URL> Source : theairlinepilots.com As it can be seen , the airflow in front of the wing is slightly directed upwards by the upwash . Now , the angle the wing makes with the horizontal datum ( i.e. relative airflow ) is the same . However , the airflow is slightly turned upwards and the wing sees the air coming at it at a different angle compared to the relative airflow . As a result , the effective angle of attack ( defined as the angle of attack that lies between the chord of an airfoil and the effective airflow ) is reduced , so that the relative and effective airflow looks something like this : <URL> Source : theairlinepilots.com This difference between the relative and effective airflows is what that causes the induced drag . <URL> Source : theairlinepilots.com

Do aeroplanes have to balance torque like helicopters ?
A single engine plane can suffer from control problems due to torque . An early famous example was the <URL> As others have pointed out , torque effects have to be countered using the normal aerodynamic controls available to the pilot . Some aircraft had extra-large ailerons because of this issue . <URL>
Winglets on wings help because they increase the volume of air on which the wing can act . <URL> , but when span is restricted or the maximum wing bending moment is limited , winglets bring a small improvement in efficiency at high lift coefficients . <URL> , however , the winglets would run through air which is already affected by the tips of the propeller . No additional air will be involved , so no efficiency increase will be possible . Please note that propulsive efficiency is increased by accelerating more air by a smaller amount . The formula for the propulsive efficiency $ \ eta_p $ of an air breathing engine is $ $ \ eta_p = \ frac { v _ { \ infty } } { v _ { \ infty } + \ frac { \ Delta v } { 2 } } $ $ where $ v _ { \ infty } $ is the speed of the inflowing air and $ \ Delta v $ the speed increase of the air affected by the propeller disc . A smaller $ \ Delta v $ acting on a higher mass flow makes the engine more efficient . This effect is most pronounced when $ v _ { \ infty } $ is low . The prop tip winglets would operate in a region of high dynamic pressure and generate more friction drag without contributing to the prop 's efficiency . By the way : Whoever tells you that winglets reduce induced drag quite a bit has something to sell to you , but I digress .
Pilots do encounter UFOs all the time . I just want to emphasize that UFO means " Unidentified Flying Object " - something which is flying , and which the pilot can not identify . It does not mean an alien craft . The guidelines for pilots are as follows ( <URL> ) : 7-6-4 . Unidentified Flying Object ( UFO ) Reports a. Persons wanting to report UFO/unexplained phenomena activity should contact a UFO/unexplained phenomena reporting data collection center , such as Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies ( BAASS ) ( voice : 1-877-979-7444 or e-mail : Reporting@baass.org ) , the National UFO Reporting Center , etc. . b . If concern is expressed that life or property might be endangered , report the activity to the local law enforcement department . Air traffic controllers have the following guidance under <URL> : 9-8-1 . GENERAL a. Persons wanting to report UFO/unexplained phenomena activity should contact a UFO / unexplained phenomena reporting data collection center , such the National UFO Reporting Center , etc. . b . If concern is expressed that life or property might be endangered , report the activity to the local law enforcement department . The question " Was it of the E.T. kind " is beyond the scope of this site . This subject is , let 's just say , suitably covered by other sites on the Internet at large . One notable example of a UFO report is the <URL> . For other examples , a Google search for " <URL> " offers some decent results . " <URL> " even links to some recordings of pilot UFO reports to ATC . Some objects commonly reported ( genuinely ) as UFOs are spacecraft , fast or high-flying military aircraft like the U-2 or the SR-71 when it was in service , rocket launches , weather balloons , kites , errant helium balloons from kids ' birthday parties , flocks of birds , con trails , and lightning storms . Any of these and more can easily look , under the right circumstances , to a pilot like a " UFO . " The closest experience I 've had in my flying history to a " UFO " happened at night , during a landing approach in the midwest U.S. I was on a downwind leg when a very bright light appeared above me in the center of the windscreen , and rapidly moved downward toward the horizon . It scared me half to death ; my instinctual thought was that it was the landing light of another plane descending on top of me . It turned out to be a meteorite . It only took me a second or two to figure it out , but boy did it get my adrenaline up ! There was no need to report it though . Culturally , pilots are generally apprehensive about reporting UFOs , out of fear of sounding like a lunatic or unhinged conspiracy theorist and being laughed at . Nonetheless , reports are not uncommon .
The cabin crew simply counts the seated passengers ( or alternatively empty seats ) by zone ( a block of rows ) , writes it down and hands the slip to the flight crew . It is common to do this on commuter planes even with assigned seating since passenger balance matters more on small aircraft and people may move . As pointed out by <URL> : In practice , low cost airlines , which routinely offer free seating , also operate the majority of their flights with a high load factor , so that identifying any unoccupied seats will be a fairly simple matter .
The pavement requires frequent renewal of the top surface . The frequency depends on the type of pavement and on the weather . Asphalt for instance suffers a lot of damage when it snows and becomes less viscous when it is very hot , <URL> . The main issue with repairing a runway on a major airport like JFK or O'Hare is doing so with little to no impact on traffic . Resurfacing an entire runway can take a long time . Therefore , rather than closing the runway for days at a time , airports try to do as many short maintenance operations as possible at night . Some operations can not be done in a single night but can be divided into several perfectly timed tasks , that can be done between 11 PM and 5 AM . Some operations can not be divided into such small tasks and require that the airport closes for a day or more . The French airport Orly ( ORY ) for instance has one slab of concrete replaced every night on the runway . This way , the strip can be renewed every other year on average , without disturbing traffic . ( I saw a video on this subject once , but ca n't seem to find it again . ) The results of each runway inspection are compared with the results of the previous runway inspection . Maintenance programs are revised based on the rate of deterioration of the runway . The FAA has <URL> to help airport operators plan these maintenance operations . But damage done by huge planes is only one of the many things that needs to be taken care of on a regular basis . Moreover , aircraft manufacturers try to design landing gear that reduces the impact of the aircraft on the runway as much as possible ( note that airports can charge higher landing fees for aircraft that do more damage to the runway , so airlines want airplanes that do n't damage the runway ) . The most common maintenance operations are ( not in any order , and indicated frequencies are only a rule of thumb , as these will change from one airport to another ) : Removing rubber . This is an important one . When taking off or landing , aircraft often skid for a brief moment and leave rubber on the runway . This greatly reduces the adherence of the runway , which has a negative impact on stopping distances . This is usually done with high pressure water . Cleaning the approach light systems and other visual aids . These get dirty with rubber , tartar , dirt ... This operation can be done for instance with a mix of water and sodium bicarbonate , or <URL> . Checking the quality of the approach light systems and other visual aids . Often , a truck with optometric sensors drives down the runway and measures the luminosity . Sometimes the lights need to be replaced . Airports usually have spares available for every type of light that is used on the runway . Paint and markings somtimes have to be redone . <URL> . Trucks are equipped with all kinds of sensors and go up and down the runway . The measures are used to make a map of the condition of the runway . Sometimes , the runway is divided into sub-sections and a different section will be evaluated every month or every other month , so that each section is inspected twice a year . Checking for foreign objects on the runway . On all the airports I visited , this is done by the airport firetruck several times a day . Every few months , they sweep the runway to prevent grass , dirt , pebbles , ... from accumulating . Repairing cracks and resealing joints on the runway . This is to prevent water infiltrations that have long-term catastrophic consequences . A visual inspection of the runway is performed daily to look for cracks . Cutting the grass around the runway and on the airfield . The grass has to be kept 2 to 4 inches high around the runway . This reduces the amount of debris that can be blown onto the runway . This also reduces the number of birds and other animals living close to the runway ( because nobody wants birds to be ingested by an engine , or a squirrel to be run over ) . Keeping all water evacuation paths clear . No water can be left to build up on the runway , since this would increase stopping distance for aircraft , and may freeze . There also are seasonal operations , such as de-icing the runway or removing snow .
The landing on carrier is indeed hard . The reason is not the deceleration ( which is handled by the hook ) , but the touch-down . Since the deck is short , the wires ca n't be spaced very far apart , so the aircraft must touch down very precisely . Since the precision is better at steeper angle , the aircraft landing on carrier do not flare . At all . So they hit the deck at more than twice the vertical speed compared to typical landing on decent runway .
The two things are completely different and exist for different reasons : Fan and turbine blades are mounted loosely , so they can self-balance . This is because at the very high RPM fans and turbines spin at they are extremely sensitive to imbalance . On the other hand , the self-balancing only works at high RPM . It also requires the blades to be connected at the tips with the " shroud " . Rotors have lead-lag hinges because the rotor spins parallel to the flow so in forward flight the advancing blade meets the air at significantly higher speed than the retreating blade . Propellers spin slower , so they are not as sensitive to imbalance , and they do n't have the shroud , so they ca n't be mounted loosely anyway . They spin perpendicular to the airflow , so all blades meet the air at similar speed and angle of attack , so they do n't need to deal with as big differences in the aerodynamic forces . And they are smaller and more rigid .
Most helicopter do n't carry radar ; there is no need for it . In civil helicopters radar is typically used for weather detection . In most use cases there is not real need for it because helicopters are usually operating under daytime Visual Flight Rules ( VFR ) and are staying away from clouds . For maritime helicopters that are used in search and rescue operations or off-shore operations on oil-rigs , weather is often installed . The typical location is in a radome in the nose of the helicopter . Examples are the <URL> or <URL> Military helicopters use radar for detecting objects . Depending on the nature of the mission the helicopter is designed for , the radar is underneath ( usually for navy operation , providing sea surface detection capabilities , see for example the navy version of the NH90 ) or on top of the rotor ( to look over obstacles such a hills / trees and provide fire control to their missiles ) . An example is the <URL> .

Everything will expire one day , including our Sun . Flight recorders are no exception . Older flight recorders used magnetic tapes . They used to work like any other <URL> . At present , <URL> boards are used . These are considered much more reliable than magnetic tapes , because no moving parts are involved like magnetic tapes . Data from both recorders is stored on stacked memory boards inside the crash-survivable memory unit ( CSMU ) . A <URL> : ... is collectively the solid-state memory chips and a hardened metal container filled with specially designed heat insulating material . It is this container that provides the survivability , for it is able to withstand massive crushing loads , intense heat , and exceptionally high G forces , all of which is proven by crash survivability testing . <URL> You can see that the memory boards are inside stainless steel shell , which is designed to withstand the crash . Although there is a limit of writes on solid state memory , after a crash there are no more writes . When the FDRs/CVRs are recovered from a crash scene , there are various methods to retrieve data , depending on the condition of flight recorders . This process can take weeks or months to complete .

Many airlines do in fact have inflight camera feeds for Cabin surveillance so I do not think the question is relevant to most major airlines anymore . For a specific example , Emirates Airline employs the Cabin Video Monitoring Systems ( CVMS ) across its fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft . These Cabin cameras can be accessed by Cockpit crew through the System Display or the Cabin crew through the FAP ( Flight Attendant Panel ) and for any abnormal situation such as a hijacking/hostage situation on ground , the CVMS can be accessed on a laptop via the GSP ( Ground Service Panel ) . Additionally , as mentioned above , they have landscape cameras installed for an external video feed but that is more of a feature for passengers . The advantages of a CVMS in a hijacking/hostage situation such as positioning , identity , body language and weapons of the hijackers plus general operational advantages such as issues during boarding/offloading and other emergency situations such as an evacuation are great and not to be discounted .
Yes it is correct that helicopters use more fuel when hovering : the engine needs to apply more power to overcome drag . Here is a graph of the engine power required for different airspeeds , from J. Gordon Leishman , Principles Of Helicopter Aerodynamics : <URL> The line for total power goes down between 0 - 70 kts with increasing airspeed , this is caused by the line for induced power : power required to overcome the induced drag of the helicopter blade . The total required engine power is the summation of : Induced power . The power required to overcome the induced drag of lift creation , further detailed below . Propulsive power relates to the engine exhaust velocity now being helpful , and to the rise in induced power at higher speeds due to compressibility drag . Profile power , required for the blade profile drag . Parasitic power , for the drag caused by the air frame , rotor hub etc. . Zero in the hover , very dominant at top speed . Helicopters have shapes that are way less aerodynamic than fixed wing planes , and this source of drag becomes very significant at higher speeds . Tail rotor power . Up to 20 % of the main rotor power both in the hover and at top speed , very low in the middle due to the helpful vertical tail . At top speed the torque of the main rotor is high and the tail rotor must do more work , unless the vertical tail can be adjusted . <URL> Induced power is dominant in the hover . Induced drag is caused by the backwards tilt of the lift vector : the higher the angle between blade and free stream , the more the vector is tilted backwards , which causes both loss of lift and increase of drag . The equation for lift L is : $ $ L = C_L \ cdot \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho \ cdot V ^ 2 \ cdot S$ $ and at a given altitude , the two variables here are $ C_L $ ( lift coefficient ) and $ V$ ( airspeed at the blade ) . $ C_L $ is an approximately linear function of angle of attack at the blade , so lift increases linearly with blade tilt-back and quadratically with increasing airspeed over the blade . <URL> Above graph from Leishman shows the velocity distribution over the blades when hovering , and at airspeed . Quite a complicated situation - when hovering , the airspeed reaching the blade is only the rotational speed of the rotor , at forward speed the blade going forward has rotational speed plus airspeed . The helicopter does not roll over and both forward blade and retreating blade deliver the same amount of lift , with the rearward going blade tilted back more than it was in the hover . But the forward going blade is tilted back a lot less : airspeed has a quadratic influence . Note that the circle in the plot at fwd airspeed is not stalled flow , but reverse flow : the air streams in at the back of the blade . So drag is now negative , the airstream helps to propel the blade ! However there is loss of lift in the reverse flow area . Induced power reduces with airspeed at first according to the simple 1-D impulse consideration ( more air mass through the disk ) , and later increases as the disk is increasingly tilted forward and must do more work to overcome losses from rotor profile drag , airframe parasitic drag , and compressibility drag . There is also an interference effect of the downwash over the fuselage : in the hover the air streams straight down , while in forward flight the rotor wash is more aligned with the fuselage , catching more of a streamline shape . Parasitic drag is of course dominant at top speed , while offloading the rotor by using fixed wing surfaces reduces the induced power at high speeds - but from hover to moderate forward speeds it is purely the reduction in lift induced power that creates translational lift . <URL>
For the US under the FAA , Yes you do ! <URL> Changes of fixed equipment may have a major effect upon the weight of the aircraft . Many aircraft are overloaded by the installation of extra radios or instruments . Fortunately , the replacement of older , heavy electronic equipment with newer , lighter types results in a weight reduction . This weight change , however helpful , can cause the CG to shift , which must be computed and annotated in the weight and balance record . For larger repairs . Repairs and alterations are the major sources of weight changes . It is the responsibility of the FAA-certificate mechanic or repairman making any repair or alteration to know the weight and location of a change , to compute the CG , record the new empty weight and EWCG in the aircraft weight and balance record , and update the equipment lists . Generally this is done by the shop that installs them . If you as the owner/operator installs them ( <URL> ) you may need to have a new WB drafted up . This is also checked at anual every year , The FAA-certificated mechanic or repairman conducting an annual or condition inspection must ensure the weight and balance data in the aircraft records is current and accurate . It is the responsibility of the PIC to use the most current weight and balance data when operating the aircraft .
In the early days of aviation it was simply easier to have the gear fixed . The landing gear adds drag , but so does <URL> and <URL> . Airplanes generally did not fly very fast or far , so the drag from the landing gear ( and that other stuff ) was not a big issue . The first design with retractable gear <URL> . Since then , retractable gear has been a design decision each airplane must make . Retracting the gear into the airplane allows for a cleaner form , which reduces drag . However , this is at the expense of added weight . The retract system , which is usually hydraulic , must be added , and the plane must be designed to make room for the gear somewhere at least mostly inside the aircraft . The plane must also be designed to handle situations where some or all of the gear does not extend properly . For planes that need to be fast and/or efficient , retractable gear is worth the reduction in drag . The additional drag has to be supported by the structure as well . Aircraft with retractable gear will have a maximum speed at which the gear can be extended . Even gear with proper fairings would add significant drag at the speeds airliners fly at . This would be much more critical at supersonic speeds . In these cases the weight of reinforcing the gear could be even higher than the weight of the retracting system . Particularly smaller general aviation planes tend to not have retractable gear . The retract system adds extra weight and complexity ( and therefore cost ) , which will be fairly significant in a small plane . Fixed gear is simple and can be designed to minimize drag as much as possible . These planes do not typically need to fly fast or have large range , so the added drag is less of an issue . Other small planes do have retractable gear , which will allow for greater speed and range . The PA-32 type shown in <URL> was later produced in a <URL> as well .
There 's an interesting article on the hazards at <URL> . The avoidance tactic mentioned in that article is to avoid rapid descents at low forward airspeed - this would seem sensible as that 's where the rotors will be exposed to their own downwash . And the preferred reaction also described there is to use the cyclic to fly forwards , to move into less disturbed air . ( I have heard that another cause of the condition is flying into narrow spaces among tall buildings , but unfortunately I have n't been able to find a reference . )
A <URL> measures the time spent in a general aviation aircraft with the power on . Planes differ in that time is easier to record than distance . For a given airspeed , the distance covered by the aircraft depends on the wind , altitude , and other factors . Modern airliners would record the period each engine has run , flight time , cycles ( one cycle is one pressurization/depressurization cycle ) , etc. , <URL> . Those records are then used to track the <URL> ( TBO ) . Same as with cars . For small planes , a <URL> is used to record the revolutions the engine has made , this one is used for TBO . <URL> ( <URL> ) Image of tach timer .
Loadsheets have a section called ' <URL> . As the name implies , pilots can record last minute changes here . If the changes are minimal , there is no need to recalculate the mass and balance , and trim settings . What constitutes ' minimal ' depends on many things , principally limits set by the operator or manufacturer . I ca n't verify this but think 400kg would fall within these limits , unless the aircraft was already at its performance limits .
From a private pilot 's perspective , there are two possible options : a foreign-based license or a ' full ' FAA pilot 's license . The first type is defined in <URL> , which starts like this : § 61.75 Private pilot certificate issued on the basis of a foreign pilot license . ( a ) General . A person who holds a foreign pilot license at the private pilot level or higher that was issued by a contracting State to the Convention on International Civil Aviation may apply for and be issued a U.S. private pilot certificate with the appropriate ratings if the foreign pilot license meets the requirements of this section . You apply to the FAA and they check with Germany ( or wherever ) that your foreign license is valid . If it is , they 'll issue a foreign-based license " with the appropriate ratings " with no flight or theory test of any kind required . That 's for VFR only ; if you 're instrument rated then you also have to do a theory test as well if you want to fly IFR . That sounds great - and I suppose it is - but there are two big practical concerns . First , any limitations on the foreign license are applied , e.g. if your license is for daytime VFR only then you 're still restricted to that , even if a regular FAA license would allow night VFR . And if your foreign license expires or becomes invalid for any reason , the FAA one does too . Second , you wo n't have been required to learn anything about US regulations or flying practices . So you might not fly safely or legally because you simply do n't know the rules or even what services are available to you as a pilot ( FSS , Flight Following , TRSA etc. ) . One way to handle this is to get some general orientation or introductory training from a US instructor or school , but as a foreigner that will require TSA approval unless you can do it as ground school only ( which is <URL> as " flight training " ) . But you might find - as I did - that some instructors will not work with a foreign student at all until they have TSA approval , whether or not it 's just ground work . The other option is to get a normal , full FAA license . You have to pass the same FAA medical , written and flight tests as US pilots to the same <URL> . You can count your previous flight time towards the required hours but you do need to be able to pass the tests so you will certainly need some instruction . And as a foreigner you will need TSA approval before you can receive any flight training . The big advantage of getting a full license is that it never expires . If you really want to get one and you have the time and money then you could look into spending a month somewhere suitable in the US ( Florida ? Arizona ? ) at a flight school to get it as quickly and cheaply as possible .
They <URL> hot compressed air from inside the jet engines , cool it down and pass it into the cabin . There are outlet valves in the fuselage that allow stale air out and which control cabin pressure and air-refresh rates . A few aircraft types , such as the 787 , now use a compressor to take in air from under the aircraft . They do this because it can be more fuel-efficient ( not for any other reason ) . It is arguable whether it creates an additional fire hazard . See also <URL> <URL> <URL>
Yes , helicopters can be fitted with autopilots . Some are very simple , others are quite advanced . The more advanced ones can , for instance , follow a pre-programmed route , climb/descent to a pre-selected altitude , fly an ILS approach , perform a go-around automatically . They are not ordinarily found in small helicopters due to cost and lack of necessity . All modern offshore helicopters that I 've encountered have them and they are used extensively . Usually they are engaged shortly after take-off and disengaged shortly before landing .

What are the mass flow rate and exhaust velocity for a CF6 or GE90 turbofan ?
According to <URL> , the GE90 has a mass flow rate of 1,350 kg/s at take-off and 576 kg/s at cruise ( at 10.668 km = FL350 ) . The CF6 has a mass flow rate of 591 kg/s at take-off . Exhaust velocity is n't generally quoted , perhaps because it only bears a loose relation to the performance characteristics of the engine . I suppose if you wanted you could find the area of the exhaust and use the density of air to find the velocity . Looking specifically at the GE90 , we see that it has take-off SFC ( specific fuel consumption ) of 7.9 mg/N-s . Using the formula $ I _ { sp } = 1 / ( g_o · \ text { SFC } ) $ given in <URL> we get a specific impulse of 12,285 s . If we use the cruise SFC of 15.6 mg/N-s , we get a specific impulse of 6,536 s. Is this an effect of the lower density of air , or simply of the lower fuel required in the cruise ? I do n't know .
The FAA has issued an <URL> which covers what they call " non-towered airports " NON-TOWERED AIRPORTS When the control tower is closed or if there is no tower , the airport is referred to as non-towered . At a non-towered airport , you do not need controller permission before entering a runway or taxiway . Below are some best practices for operating on a non-towered airport : When you approach the runways and taxiways , STOP , LOOK both ways , and LISTEN for aircraft that are landing or taking off . Vehicle windows should be open to do this properly . Alert others when you are using a taxiway or runway by always making an announcement on the radio before you enter . Be specific with your location and intentions . Always yield the right-of-way to taxiing aircraft and give them plenty of room . If an aircraft is headed toward you on the same taxiway , move out of the aircraft 's way . Always carry a radio tuned to the airport 's Common Traffic Advisory Frequency ( CTAF ) or UNICOM . If an aircraft is about to land on a runway that you need to cross , stop well clear of the runway . Continue to yield to the aircraft until it has landed and taxied off of the runway . Be aware that some aircraft at non-towered airports are not equipped with radios . Before you cross a runway , ensure that no potentially conflicting aircraft are taxiing , landing or taking off . Be aware of aircraft at non-towered airports that frequently make touch-and-go landings ( immediately after landing , full power is applied and the aircraft takes off again ) . If your vehicle has a rotating beacon , be sure to turn it on anytime you are on the airport surface . Turn on headlights as well , being careful not to blind any pilots in the area .
The answer is 19,428 , but I could only get there by <URL> ' MRJT ' to get the missing information : <URL> DOM + all of the fuel is 43,372 . And since MSTOM is 62,800 , that leaves you with 19,428 for payload ( allowable traffic load ) . $ $ 62,800 - ( 27,372 + 12,000 + 4,000 ) = 19,428 $ $ Below you can see the calculations for MTOM , MLM , and MZFM . Since the traffic load for the ' MTOM limited case ' is the lowest , the maximum traffic load for the flight is 19,428 kg . ( Table courtesy of DeltaLima . )
One thing to note is that ' pure ' air dominance fighter or ground attack aircraft is not being developed anymore . Most of the combat aircraft developed recently/under development are multirole ( or ' omnirole ' ) aircraft . In case of air dominance ( or air superiority ) fighters , which have the task of eliminating enemy air defense system especially fighters and securing aerial control for operation of friendly forces without harassment , the following are important design objectives : High thrust to weight ratio , as it helps in maneuvers . Stealth , as the enemy ca n't shoot what he/she ca n't see . High maneuverability , for close combat situations and evasion . High weapons load , as it enables engagement of a large number of enemy aircraft at once . A good range , as it is better to engage enemy aircraft in their area rather than in friendly territory . A powerful radar to track and engage enemy aircraft , as it enables them to shoot first . Communication links to transfer data between the aircraft and between the AEWACS aircraft , as most of the aircraft today operate in an integrated battlefield . Speed is also a very important parameter . In case of ground support ( or attack ) aircraft , whose primary task is the destruction of enemy logistics and/or support for ground troops under fire , the designers look for similar yet a bit different set of characteristics . Ruggedness , as the aircraft should be able take some amount of punishment and return home . High endurance and Time on Target , as the ground troops may require support for an extended period of time , with corresponding weapons load . Communication links between aircraft and ground troops for obvious reasons . Precision targeting systems for situations where friendlies are in close contact with the enemy troops . Ability to operate from forward operating bases is desirable . Most of the present generation aircraft carry out their ground support duties using precision weaponry rather than any fundamental design decisions . Though there are still trade-offs , as in any aircraft design . The weapon load of stealth aircraft is lesser their non-stealthy counterparts as external weapons carriage increases the radar signature of the aircraft . For ground attack aircraft , a high subsonic speed is more than enough unlike the supersonic air dominance fighters . Low altitude maneuverability is important for ground attack aircraft for quick ingress and egress from the combat area . One aspect of aircraft design is that combat aircraft optimized for high altitude operations can face higher stresses when operating in lower altitudes ( i.e. near ground ) . For example , when USAF switched B-52s from high altitude bombing role to low altitude penetration tactics , it caused increased stress in the airframe .
The differences are surprisingly small , and the implications of two versus four engines are not very great as far as design of the wing is concerned . Weight implications The wing is an immensely strong structure - after all , it 's able to bear the weight of the entire aircraft , including of course the engines . Engines are heavy , but only a small fraction of the weight of the whole aircraft . A similar aircraft with four engines rather than two will have smaller engines , so the total weight difference will not be large . Space implications You need more space to fit two engines on each side , but not a vast amount . For example , the <URL> has four remarkably small <URL> engines . What 's more , four small engines can be easier to mount , because they need less ground clearance . Same wings , more engines In practice , it 's not very difficult to add engines to a wing ( for aircraft companies , that is ; I do n't think I 'd be able to do it without seeing someone do it first at least once ) . For example , <URL> - obviously , this engine is just being carried , not used , but it shows that simply placing the engine there does n't present insurmountable aerodynamic or other engineering difficulties . And then we have the Airbus <URL> / <URL> , designed and built in parallel , which are essentially the same aircraft - same fuselage and same wing - one with two engines and one with four . ( Actually the -500 and -600 A340 variants do have slightly longer wings , but that 's because they are heavier , and nothing to do with the additional engines . ) That 's not to say that there are no implications in having additional engines . In this case , wing flutter caused by the outboard engines of the A340 required some stiffening . And of course , additional engines will require additional fuel and control lines . However , these are n't part of the structure of the wing itself , and are not in themselves likely to have implications for it .
GPS units paired with older autopilots such as the S-TEC 30/50 mentioned here do not automatically give GPSS steering to the autopilot unless the GPS has a GPSS system built in . In this case the additional GPSS unit swaps between traditional NAV/APR/BC modes that seek using deflection from the CDI and GPSS steering which is data-driven straight from the GPS . It is possible to get a PFD that has GPSS built in as well ( Aspen Evolution ) and takes care of this functionality . A functional difference between these two systems is demonstrated as such with a Garmin GNS-530W / 430W and an STEC-50 autopilot with the separate GPSS unit : 1 ) with the GPS giving guidance and GPSS off ( or not installed ) the autopilot treats the GPS input signal as a CDI input - in other words , if there is a course change of greater than 10 degrees in either direction the autopilot will follow no guidance and do whatever it wants to , for example ignoring a 90 degree right turn in the flight plan ( other than making an initial heading change of a few degrees while attempting to track as the CDI quickly goes full deflection ) and then continuing on in whatever random way it wants without following guidance or a flag showing on the CDI ( there is no flag because the guidance is present , but it 's out of range just like a VOR signal would be ! ) . Accordingly all major course changes must be executed manually or in heading mode by hand then the autopilot is engaged in NAV mode to track the course once it is captured and within 10 degrees of the present course . 2 ) with the GPS giving guidance and GPSS on the GPSS unit sends direct roll steering commands to the autopilot that are extremely accurate . The autopilot must always be in HDG mode to accept these inputs . The heading bug on the DG or HSI is effectively ignored while GPSS is engaged . Here 's an example : while tracking a course ( or really at any point in flight ) , selection of a 90 degree right turn ( say , direct to ) in the GPS will result in direct roll steering commands being given to the autopilot and the autopilot executing those commands and following them extremely closely within the parameters of the autopilot design ( standard rate turn , etc. ) , resulting in an automatic turn to the new course , including automatic intercept of that course if the GPS performs that function , and any following courses and changes being flown precisely and automatically as they are sequenced in the flight plan . Source : I now own an aircraft that has this system and operate it all the time .
For the same aircraft speed and an horizontal trajectory : When the aircraft is lighter , less lift is required . To decrease the lift , the angle of attack needs to be reduced ( said otherwise : the aircraft flies more horizontal ) . A smaller AoA creates less induced drag . Lift and drag coefficients as a function of the angle of attack are represented in the following diagram . <URL> ( <URL> ) The ratio L/D is also represented , with its maximum L/D max . L/D max is an economical angle of attack . After L/D max , a gain in lift is at the expense of a larger increase in induced drag . Side-effect of reduced drag : The thrust can be reduced to achieve the previous speed . The range is increased thanks to the thrust reduction . For a more accurate representation of lift and drag coefficients against the angle of attack , and additional information : <URL> .
Motive flow is required in design of ejector pumps in fuel system . Ejector pumps ( also known as jet pumps or eductor pumps ) have no moving parts and therefore represent a highly reliable , low cost means to move fuel in an aircraft . All jet pumps contain the physical characteristics illustrated in below figure . <URL> In this pump , the motive flow comes from a high pressure source such as a primary boost pump , or the returned fuel from the engine . When the high pressure motive flow passes through the throat it creates a suction which sucks fuel from its neighborhood and the total fuel flow are sent to another location . The overall efficiency of an ejector pump is low when compared to electric motor powered pumps but they are frequently used due to their extremely long life , high reliability and low cost . The ejector pumps generally are used for two functions : Ejector pumps are often used to provide the primary fuel boost function in smaller transport aircraft applications such as business jets and regional aircraft . In order to minimize the unusable fuel , scavenge pumps are often employed to suck up fuel from the remote corners of fuel tanks and to discharge this fuel at the inlet to the main feed pump ( s ) . Ejector pumps are used for this purpose and the motive flow for these scavenge devices may be taken from the feed pump outlet if other motive sources are not available . Note : Most of above material are from : Langton , R. ( 2009 ) . Aircraft fuel systems . Chichester , U.K Wiley .
Generally when GA pilots talk about climb performance we speak of two different airspeed values : Best Rate of Climb speed ( Vy ) gets you the most altitude per unit time ( feet per minute ) . When you want to get to cruise altitude quickly for maximum efficiency you 'll aim for the best rate of climb so you spend the least time at lower , less efficient altitudes . Best Angle of Climb speed ( Vx ) gets you the greatest altitude per unit of ground distance ( feet per mile ) . When you 've got a FAA-Standard 50-foot-tree at the departure end of the runway you 'll aim for the best angle of climb to ensure you do n't wind up in the tree . Those speeds are useful to us as pilots , but the exact rate of climb ( feet-per-minute ) for those speeds will vary : A fully loaded plane will climb more slowly than one that 's just got the pilot and a few gallons of fuel on board , and that 's where the " maximum rate of climb " enters into the discussion : Maximum rate of climb is the number of feet per minute you can get climbing at the " best rate of climb " airspeed . If someone is being sloppy in their usage " Maximum Rate of Climb " could mean " Best Rate of Climb " ( pitch for Vy and you get what you get ) , but if you 're being precise in your usage and really talking about the rate of climb it would mean <URL> in feet per minute based on the current conditions and aircraft weight . Maximum rate of climb under a given set of conditions is useful information to know if you need to clear terrain at some point on your flight path and want to be sure you can climb fast enough to do so : If you 're starting from sea level and need to clear a 5000 foot mountain that 's 5 minutes away but your plane ca n't manage more than 500 feet per minute at best-rate-of-climb speed under the current conditions you 'll need to reconsider your flight plan to either avoid the mountain or climb in a circle somewhere until you can clear it .
PNR is a passenger 's / party 's record . PNL is the full list of all the PNR 's . Example : John Smith is a party of 1 , that 's the PNR entry . And he is number 7 on the PNL .
Generally , it is more efficient to have one large than two small devices . The twin fan solution not only needs a gearbox and driveshafts that a single fan solution does without , it also has more intake and nozzle surface area per cross section than the single fan . This will cause more viscous losses and lower efficiency . The only advantage would be if size limitations make a single fan impossible , but in that case it would be more straightforward to have each fan driven by its own core engine . Famous examples of aircraft which used a <URL> would start with the <URL> models , all of which had a single engine drive two propellers via bicycle chains . But the list is short . The list of opposite designs where <URL> would drive a <URL> or fan would probably be longer , and my favourite from this list is the <URL> .
It 's tough to tell based on your question , but I think you are talking about an inspection due to an over-G reported on a flight either by the pilot or the flight control system post-flight report . Maintainers will do inspections of known stress points on the aircraft to look for breaks , cracking or loosened parts and then declare it safe for flight or fix anything out of tolerance . For a low level over-G , this could be pulling a few panels . For higher level over-Gs it could be 8 hours worth of work
You can start with the FAA 's reference page for <URL> . It will point you to the FAA <URL> General Aviation Airman Designee Handbook . It 's all there . You 'll need to talk to your local Flight Standards District Office ( FSDO ) as they are responsible for administering the program . The general eligibility requirements are : General Eligibility Requirements . The managing office must carefully consider all of the requirements before designating an applicant or renewing a designee . The general requirements for appointment , which are reviewed by the NEB , are : a. Minimum Age . Minimum age of 23 years for all designees . b. Personality Traits . Must exhibit integrity , professionalism , and sound judgment . c. Training Requirement . Must have satisfactorily completed the applicable training requirement before appointment/renewal as a designee . d. Knowledge of Guidance Materials . Must have access to , and adequate knowledge of , the current regulations , policies , directives , and related guidance material appropriate to authorized functions . e. Command of English Language . Must be able to fluently read , write , speak , and understand the English language . f. Objectivity . Must maintain the highest degree of objectivity while performing authorized functions . g. Good Record . Must have a good record in the aviation industry . h. Technology Access . Must have internet access , as well as access to a computer and printer with hardware/software sufficient to support the required activities . Note : A designee is not required to be a U.S. citizen . Note : Additional eligibility requirements for specific designee types are included in the applicable designee type specific chapters ( Chapters 6 and 7 ) of this order . As to what the FAA is looking for ( this from a DPE , I used to work with ) , the FAA is looking for someone they can trust to perform the job to standards . They expect a DPE candidate to be an experienced instructor . They 'll look at the the history of students signed off for check rides by that person . If any significant number of recommended students are n't passing check rides or ' just squeak by ' , it wo n't reflect favorably on the applicant . OTOH , if the recommended students are well prepared and almost always pass , that 's a good indication . That shows the instructor 's standards are the same as the FAA 's . ' Openings ' for DPE positions are driven by supply and demand . The purpose of any Designee is to help manage the workload imposed on the FAA 's office . If the office can handle the number of applicant 's , they wo n't add a DPE . And if an existing DPE is n't performing a minimum of examinations , they 'll lose the Designation . Most of the DPEs I 've known worked for flight schools where there was a steady stream of students .
You do n't want an aircraft that just ' works ' - rather , you want an aircraft that satisfies your needs . The first flight is usually made by a prototype and does just that - it flies and pretty much nothing else . Only once you start the flight tests do you understand the airframe limitations and whether the aircraft meets the requirements ; usually , a number of modifications are needed . Also , the first flights are rarely , if ever in production configuration . In most of the cases , the required systems are fitted later . In general , most of the combat aircraft bring about substantial improvement over its predecessors - in fact it is a requirement , as the old ones can be used with small improvements at a much lesser cost . Me 262 was really a revolutionary product and the use of jet engines caused a number of delays ; in fact the prototypes were flight tested with piston engines in 1941 . The first test flight happened with piston engine - just as well because both the jets flamed out soon after takeoff . By the time the second and third prototypes , the engines had been changed . However , these engines ( Jumo 004 ) were larger , requiring larger nacelles , which in turn required a bigger vertical stabilizer ( the landing gear was changed later ) . Pre-production of Me 262 had started in 1943 ( and went nowhere due to engine troubles ) when it was decided to change it into a bomber , further increasing the development period . By the time it took the field , it was in too few numbers to do anything . Another example is the Mirage III . There were significant differences between the aircraft in first flight and the production one . The prototype never reached the required Mach 2 in level flight.The first one to do was the pre-produciotn Mirage IIIA with an engine with more than 30 % extra thrust , lengthened fuselage for radar etc. . Even this version was not combat capable - that was the Mirage IIIC . The design is not frozen till the flight testing is over and the production plans can only be finalized after that - you never know what 'll change ( for example the hugely successful Su-27 underwent a change in wing design midway through testing ) . The delays due to setting up of production comes later and is normally quite less for countries/companies having experience . It is the design freeze that takes up more time during test flights .
There are plenty of great $ 20,000 aircraft out there - the hard part is finding them . " What to look for " is an incredibly broad question , and varies substantially between different types of aircraft : You would not look for the same things on a Piper Comanche as you would on a Cessna 182 . Accordingly the first thing you want to do is find a mechanic who is an expert in the particular type of aircraft to help you check it out and do a " pre-purchase inspection " . Finding those mechanics is actually pretty easy : Look for a " type club " that supports the aircraft you 're considering and ask them for recommendations ( e.g. for a Cessna <URL> , for a Cirrus <URL> , for most Piper aircraft <URL> , for Beechcraft <URL> , etc. . Talk to folks on those forums ( and to your mechanic ) about what you , as a buyer , should be looking at before you get the mechanic involved for the more detailed inspection . There are lots of things you as a pilot ( even a student pilot ) can determine just by looking at a plane ( and/or the logbooks ) . Some key items to look at before you go see the plane : NTSB Records <URL> go to the NTSB site ( or the equivalent if you 're not in the USA ) and search for accident records . Not every accident will show up in the database , but sometimes you 'll find out that the cream puff aircraft being advertised has actually been " substantially damaged " in an accident . The NTSB database search is free and there 's no reason not to do it . Logbooks All aircraft have logs , so if possible get a copy of them before you even go to look at the plane . Read through the logs ( yes , all of them ) : You 'll find all sorts of interesting things in there , but what you 're mainly looking for is good , consistent maintenance and regular use of the aircraft . As a secondary concern you 're looking for major repairs ( or significant minor ones ) that you might want to ask your mechanic about . FAA Records You can <URL> online for a small fee . This includes registration information and any records of major repairs/alterations ( " Form 337 " ) filed for the aircraft . It is generally an " interesting subset " of the logs . This is something you 'll want to have handy when your mechanic looks at the plane , though it 's not something you need to have before you go look at it yourself . Theoretically the owner should have all the documents that this record contains as part of their records/logbooks , but in practice paperwork sometimes gets " lost " . If all that looks good it 's time to look at the plane : How is the overall condition of the aircraft ? Cosmetics can lie , so do n't be dazzled by a shiny coat of paint and a nice interior : Is the on-board paperwork ( ARROW ) all in order ? Are the tires , hoses , and other rubber components in good condition ? Is the engine bay ( relatively ) clean ? Are there any leaks , drips , or other items of concern ? Are there obvious signs of damage ( skin patches , dents , fabric tears , etc. ) ? Are there obvious signs of corrosion ( bubbles under the paint , etc. ) ? Is the paint in overall good condition ( no major chips , no cracks , no flaking ) ? Is the aircraft itself clean ? ( As much as cosmetics lie , a plane that looks like it 's been neglected probably has been ... ) Does the aircraft pass a very thorough preflight ? Go through the preflight checklist with an eye for anything abnormal -- ask yourself " Would I fly this aircraft today ? " . If the answer is no , think carefully about why . If the answer is yes it may be time to test-fly with the current owner . Does the aircraft operate correctly on the test flight ? Do the engine and propeller operate properly ? Do all the instruments and avionics function correctly ? Does the aircraft fly well ? Can you trim for hands-off straight and level flight ? If the aircraft passes all your checks it 's time to turn your mechanic loose on it - they will inspect the aircraft for problems ( major and minor ) that you as a pilot might not notice which can wind up costing you a lot of money . This pre-purchase inspection ( and the ensuing negotiation based on what the mechanic finds ) is usually the last stop before handing over your money and taking the keys .
When dealing with lightning protection , there are two significant areas that must be addressed : direct effects of lightning and indirect effects . The FAA provides guidance on these two areas in the following advisory circulars : <URL> <URL> The lightning zone analysis from the AC 20-155A will define the test requirements for the airframe and help determine the level of testing for installed equipment based on its location in the aircraft . At the aircraft level it can be a very complex and drawn out process negotiating the specific testing required with the FAA . Once that is done , requirements and verification for the equipment can be developed . A short summary of that process from AC 20-136B is : 6 . Steps for Showing Compliance . a . The following seven steps describe how you may comply with 14 CFR 23.1306 , 25.1316 , 27.1316 , and 29.1316 requirements for your aircraft 's electrical and electronic systems : ( 1 ) Identify the systems to be assessed . ( 2 ) Determine the lightning strike zones for the aircraft . ( 3 ) Establish the aircraft lightning environment for each zone . ( 4 ) Determine the lightning transient environment associated with the systems . ( 5 ) Establish equipment transient design levels ( ETDLs ) and aircraft actual transient levels ( ATLs ) . ( 6 ) Verify compliance to the requirements . ( 7 ) Take corrective measures , if needed . b . The steps above should be performed to address lightning transients induced in electrical and electronic system wiring and equipment , and lightning damage to aircraft external equipment and sensors that are connected to electrical and electronic systems , such as radio antennas and air data probes . Additional guidance on lightning protection against lightning damage for external equipment and sensor installations can be found in SAE ARP 5577 . Testing of individual LRUs is typically under RTCA document <URL> . Section 22 covers Lightning Induced Transient Susceptibility and Section 23 covers Lightning Direct Effects .
For the FAA , a " complex aeroplane " must have : A retractable gear ( not necessary for a seaplane ) ; In-flight adjustable flaps ; and A controllable pitch propeller . The FAA 's definition is given in <URL> : Complex airplane means an airplane that has a retractable landing gear , flaps , and a controllable pitch propeller , including airplanes equipped with an engine control system consisting of a digital computer and associated accessories for controlling the engine and propeller , such as a full authority digital engine control ; or , in the case of a seaplane , flaps and a controllable pitch propeller , including seaplanes equipped with an engine control system consisting of a digital computer and associated accessories for controlling the engine and propeller , such as a full authority digital engine control . However , the EASA has a different definition of a " complex motor-powered aircraft " that is an airplane , which is considerably more " complex " : an aeroplane : with a maximum certificated take-off mass exceeding 5 700 kg , or certificated for a maximum passenger seating configuration of more than nineteen , or certificated for operation with a minimum crew of at least two pilots , or equipped with ( a ) turbojet engine ( s ) or more than one turboprop engine Note that 5700kg is about 12567 pounds .
For this we need to reference the <URL> First off this will tell us who is in charge down there ( at least for US bases ) as its not quite an ice frontier free for all , Oversight of the on-ice operations of the civil aircraft is NSF-delegated to the Dept of the Interior/OAS Office of Aviation Services ( OAS ) in accordance with the SLA between OAS/AIL . Joint use of the USAP airspace in Antarctica requires close coordination between the DoD and NSF ( and its delegations ) . It looks like if you want to fly down there you need to file <URL> 2.3.4 . Intercontinental flights between New Zealand and Antarctica will require USAP aircrew to file a DD Form 1801 ( International Flight Plan ) in Christchurch Base Operations to Christchurch Clearance Delivery . Flights utilizing the Macquarrie route will require a FIR estimate for Melbourne and Auckland boundaries . The document does not list any approach procedures for NZSP but it does list them for McMurdo Station and they are presumably similar , 2.7.2.1 . IFR . McMurdo ATC retains responsibility for all IFR aircraft . Aircraft will be USAP Inter-agency Air Operations Manual , 1 August 2012 40 instructed to contact Tower prior to entering Class E airspace . Mac 2.7.2.2 . VFR . Aircraft are normally instructed to contact tower no closer than 10 miles from the airport for landing instructions . 2.7.2.3 . Aircraft operating in Class D airspace will be in radio contact with the tower and should remain at 1,000 feet AGL or higher ( 500 feet for helicopters ) until commencing final descent . They even have reg 's for uncontrolled fields 2.8.1 . For operations at uncontrolled McMurdo area airfields , fixed/rotary wing aircraft pilots will follow uncontrolled field procedures . 2.8.1.1 . Flight plans will be filed with Mac Center and advisory service provided . 2.8.1.2 . Fifteen ( 15 ) minutes prior to departure from an uncontrolled airfield , the pilot will notify Mac Center/Tower of planned activity via landline or radio . 2.8.1.3 . Mac Center/Tower will notify Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting ( ARFF ) ( who notifies the USAP Airfield Manager ) on FM Channel 2 of intended uncontrolled airfield operations . 2.8.1.4 . Pilots will announce their intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency ( CTAF ) VHF 129.7 MHz . Interestingly it looks like McMurdo is the primary landing strip however based on the letter of 1.2.1 the South Pole Station ( which Im pretty sure is NZSP ) only accepts ski equipped aircraft so you would at least need skis . 1.2.1 . Primary airfields for the USAP are located in the McMurdo Station area and at the South Pole Station ( ski-equipped aircraft only ) . The primary heliport is located at McMurdo Station . Additional ice runways , skiways , and helicopter landing sites are established throughout the continent supporting the USAP science activities as planned by the NSF Prime Contractor 's Fixed / Rotary Wing Coordinators . According to the doc a lot of the info is published in the <URL> which looks like you may need to set up <URL> to download or " contact [ your ] affiliate National Antarctic Program " . All this in mind , I have not yet found any documentation or out right publications that seem to forbid flying there as long as procedures are followed . With that in mind you clearly need to file some flight plans and related info , I would think you would need a good reason to be going there to get approval . The reality is there may be more info on this buried in the <URL> but in practice I dont know how that sort of stuff gets enforced .
Where can the requirements for US aircraft registration be found ? The registration procedure is outlined in <URL> . See also the <URL> . 3 . The owner of an aircraft must apply to the Aircraft Registration Branch , P.O. Box 25504 , Oklahoma City , Oklahoma 73125-0504 , to obtain a certificate of registration . The applicant must submit an Aircraft Registration Application , AC Form 8050-1 , accompanied by evidence of ownership and a $ 5 registration fee . Requirements for registration of aircraft are contained in the <URL> ( For sale by the Superintendent of Documents , U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , DC 20402 . ) Basically , the registrant ( whether an individual or a corporation , trustee , etc. , all of which are defined in Part 47 ) must be able to prove legal ownership of the airplane . What is the penalty for flying an aircraft without a valid registration ? The violator would be subject to any of the <URL> : administrative action ( a " Warning Notice " or " Letter of Correction " which goes on your record ) , reexamination ( " 709 ride " ) , certification action ( suspension or revocation ) , or civil/criminal penalties . The exact penalty would likely depend on the circumstances : whether the violation was intentional and the degree of the pilot 's negligence under the FARs . What should someone do if they believe an aircraft to be operating without valid registration , and how could they determine this ? The <URL> reporting FAR violations by calling the FAA 's toll-free telephone number , 1-866-TELL-FAA .
Do n't know what you mean by real temperature . You will certainly experience a change of static temperature in an adiabatic flow if the velocity changes . Stagnation enthalpy describes the total energy contained in the fluid which comprises inner ( thermal ) energy , kinetic energy ( and potential energy which is often neglected ) . Stagnation enthalpy is constant for an adiabatic flow with no energy exchange . Thus , thermal and kinetic energy are antagonistic in the sense that increases of the kinetic energy need to be countered by reducing thermal energy in order to keep a constant value of total i.e. stagnation enthalpy , and vice versa . The stagnation temperature of a fluid is a virtual entity , temperature entities that are observable i.e. measurable are static temperatures . However , in a stagnating point the static temperature ideally features the value of the stagnation temperature . Back to your question : If you measure temperatures in an adiabatic flow at points of different flow velocities , you will experience different temperature readings . Your measurement setup has to ensure that your readings are not falsified by slowing down the fluid at the points of measurement .

Does EASA have access to medical records outside of the EU ?
No , EASA can not access anything . You will be asked to bring your medical records to the exams . Neither EASA nor your examining doctor is able to access any of your medical records without your consent . It 's restricted personal information . Some countries already have medical records in digital ( computerized ) form , but many still rely on written data . In any case , EU institutions have no jurisdiction outside of EU . You will also be given a questionnaire that will include a checkbox for any known medical conditions you have ( or had in the past ) . I do n't know what your condition is/was , but it might be a good idea to consult a private examiner first before checking anything on the list that might prevent you from getting a certificate issued .
The estimated off block time , EOBT , which is the time at which the flight is planned to leave the gate at the departure airport , has a validity of + / -15 minutes . If the plane is not able to depart within this window , the company must send a new ATC flightplan with an updated EOBT . In some cases a calculated takeoff time , CTOT , is issued to a flight . This is the exact time the plane must begin its takeoff roll . It is given based on airspace or airport congestion along the planned route of the flight , to prevent overload in individual ATC sectors . The flight must begin its takeoff roll within -5 / +10 minutes of the CTOT . If unable to comply , a new CTOT must be requested .
Assuming that " flight school hours " means flight time then <URL> suggests yes : 3.6 Logging of Flight Hours gained in the USA Some flight hour recording practices allowable in the USA do not comply with European and UK requirements . In particular : 2 pilots flying together in a single pilot aircraft both claiming P1 hours ; One pilot accompanying another on newsgathering or traffic control flights and claiming P1/PIC when they have not acted as Captain or signed for the aircraft . Flying hours of this nature can not be credited towards the requirements for Part-FCL or UK Licences . The last sentence implies that if hours logged in the US do comply with " European and UK requirements " then they can be credited towards licenses . If you need something more detailed and explicit then it may be easiest to ask the CAA directly .
<URL> notes that medical oxygen containers - whether for the storage , generation , or dispensing of oxygen - must be : 135.91 . a. 1 . i Of an approved type or in conformity with the manufacturing , packaging , marking , labeling , and maintenance requirements of title 49 CFR parts 171 , 172 , and 173 , except § 173.24 ( a ) ( 1 ) 135.91 . a. 1 . ii When owned by the certificate holder , maintained under the certificate holder 's approved maintenance program ; 135.91 . a. 1 . iii Free of flammable contaminants on all exterior surfaces ; and 135.91 . a. 1 . iv Appropriately secured . 135.91 . a. 2 When the oxygen is stored in the form of a liquid , the equipment must have been under the certificate holder 's approved maintenance program since its purchase new or since the storage container was last purged . 135.91.a.3.i-ii When the oxygen is stored in the form of a compressed gas as defined in title 49 CFR 173.300 ( a ) When owned by the certificate holder , it must be maintained under its approved maintenance program ; and The pressure in any oxygen cylinder must not exceed the rated cylinder pressure . 135.91 . a. 4 The pilot in command must be advised when the equipment is on board , and when it is intended to be used . 135.91 . a. 5 The equipment must be stowed , and each person using the equipment must be seated , so as not to restrict access to or use of any required emergency or regular exit , or of the aisle in the passenger compartment . 135.91 . b No person may smoke and no certificate holder may allow any person to smoke within 10 feet of oxygen storage and dispensing equipment carried under paragraph ( a ) of this section . 135.91.c No certificate holder may allow any person other than a person trained in the use of medical oxygen equipment to connect or disconnect oxygen bottles or any other ancillary component while any passenger is aboard the aircraft 135.91 . d Paragraph ( a ) ( 1 ) ( i ) of this section does not apply when that equipment is furnished by a professional or medical emergency service for use on board an aircraft in a medical emergency when no other practical means of transportation ( including any other properly equipped certificate holder ) is reasonably available and the person carried under the medical emergency is accompanied by a person trained in the use of medical oxygen . Part 91 does not seem to speak to medical oxygen Additionally , a <URL> notes that : In the DOT final rule , section 382.133 generally requires that air carriers conducting passenger service must permit someone with a disability to use an FAA-approved portable oxygen concentrator ( POC ) on all flights ( on aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 19 seats ) unless the device does not meet applicable FAA requirements for medical portable electronic devices ( M-PED ) and does not display a manufacturer 's label that indicates the device meets those FAA requirements . The page goes on to list approved oxygen containers . So , it seems that the FAA does not consider POCs to be hazardous , so long as they meet certain FAA approval standards . ( If you are asking about General Aviation requirements , I would assume an FAA-certified POC is okay to bring on a GA flight as well )
The NTSB actually <URL> the use of exterior cameras to the FAA in 2012 . It appears to be <URL> a <URL> , but it looks like you should contact your local FSDO for approval of an <URL> if you 're permanently fixing a camera to a plane . The grey area comes in that if the camera is temporarily attached , you should n't need special approval , but in practicality it could come loose and damage the plane . GoPro says this about affixing their cameras to planes : Industrial strength suction cup . Strong enough to pull dents out of a car door or stay attached to an airplane at 200mph + , proven though not endorsed by GoPro per FAA rules . There 's a <URL> where someone asked the FSDO to sign it off as a Minor Alteration , and it was determined that a short logbook entry would suffice : Temporarily installed a GoPro camera mounted to a standard inspection panel on ( Left/Right ) lower wing in place of the standard inspection panel . There are no electrical connections associated with this installation . This is a minor alteration as it has no appreciable effect on performance , flight characteristics , or other qualities affecting airworthiness ( refer to FAR 1.1 Major Alteration and FAR 21.93 ) . A net weight change of 9 oz is incurred with the temporary installation ; therefore , the weight and balance change is negligible ( refer to AC 43.13 1B , 10-2 ( c ) ) .
( This is similar to <URL> - and see <URL> in particular - but there may be some points here that deserve a separate answer . ) First , can you use a Canadian medical instead of a US medical , with a US pilot 's certificate ? The answer is no , with one ( ? ) exception . If it were possible , then people could shop around other countries to find the easiest medical for them , which would be a huge loophole and would allow them to simply ignore the FAA 's medical requirements . As a general statement , the country of your pilot 's certificate and medical certificate must be the same . The only exception I 'm aware of is when you hold a foreign license and medical , and then ask the FAA to issue a foreign-based private certificate under <URL> . See <URL> for more information but basically , you would have to hold a Canadian pilot 's license and medical first , and even then you would be limited by the privileges of the Canadian license . Second , could you get a US commercial certificate using a Canadian medical ? Yes , but only in a very roundabout way , and even then you could n't use it . You 'd first have to get an FAA foreign-based private certificate as I described above - which means getting a Canadian license first - and that certificate would be fine to use for a US commercial checkride . However , after passing the checkride you 'd still need an FAA second-class medical to actually exercise your new commercial privileges . Finally , another option would be to get a Canadian commercial license and medical , and then fly only Canadian aircraft in the US . I have no idea how practical that is because most countries do n't allow <URL> , but maybe there 's some way to make it work . AFAIK diabetes is only disqualifying if you 're insulin-dependent ; if you 're on oral meds you may still be able to get a Special Issuance for it . If you have any doubts about your personal situation then I 'd suggest consulting an AME and/or calling AOPA , if you 're a member .
I read the FARs for this one , and there is a rule : <URL> From what I gather , the rule is there to get liars in trouble . If you did n't lie , which you clearly have no reason to because your age does not disqualify you , I do n't think you have to worry about getting in trouble because it was the doctor 's mistake . However : ( <URL> ) ( c ) The following may serve as a basis for suspending or revoking a medical certificate ; withdrawing an Authorization or SODA ; or denying an application for a medical certificate or request for an authorization or SODA : ( 2 ) An incorrect entry , upon which the FAA relied , made in any logbook , record , or report that is kept , made , or used to show compliance with any requirement for a medical certificate or an Authorization or SODA . [ My emphasis ] Let 's pull out the important words and we get this : " An incorrect entry ... made in any ... record , or report that is kept ... or used to show compliance with any requirement for a medical certificate ... " A medical certificate is certainly kept or used to show compliance with a <URL> You have discovered an incorrect entry . Call the doctor that issued your medical as soon as you can in order to get it resolved , and do not accept a solo sign-off on this incorrectly filed document now that you have knowledge of the mistake . To give you a straight answer based on my interpretation of the law , yes ; this error would prohibit you from soloing until it can be corrected .
The aircraft 's Flight Management System ( FMS ) can be loaded with software that periodically sends position reports and flight tracking data to ground stations via ACARS . If the particular software in use sends the full flight plan or at least the next few fixes periodically with estimated times , this would expose any changes in the flight plan to the dispatch office . The incident flight in question had its ACARS turned off at some point and the " 12 minute " figure is probably derived from the time between the last ACARS message being received and the radar observed turn off course initiated . They would not be able to know exactly when the buttons on the FMS were pressed , but they could narrow the time down to a range when information changed between two automated reports sent via ACARS . Relevant chronology : Interval : 12 minutes .
There are 4 classes of cargo compartments listed in <URL> for transport category airplanes . The main concern with in-flight access is in regards to fire safety . Class A : Crew will easily discover fire from their station ( and therefore be able to suppress it as well ) Class B : There is a fire/smoke detection system , and access for crewmember to use a hand fire extinguisher Class C : There is a fire/smoke detection system to alert the crew , and a fire extinguishing/suppressing system installed Class E : For cargo-only aircraft ( no passengers ) : There is a fire/smoke detector , and a way to shut off air flow to the compartment So basically , there has to be some way to both detect and address a cargo fire . Class A compartments are those such as in the cockpit where a detection system is not necessary . It sounds like the ATR example would be Class B , since they had a fire indication , and the crew had access to extinguish the fire themselves . In larger planes with cargo in the lower hold , the compartments are usually Class C , so they have a detection system and a suppression system , and in-flight access is not required . As <URL> notes , the compartment may be accessible , but that does n't mean that crew could effectively locate or fight a fire in those areas . Especially for large cargo holds , a fire suppression system installed througout the hold is much more effective than crew members gaining access at certain locations . This also provides the benefit of isolating the main cabin from the fire extinguishing agents . Besides fires , there are <URL> where cargo compartment access could be helpful . But even in that case , it was better for the plane to just come back and land to access the cargo compartment .
There are 7 modes of warning Mode 1 . Large descent rate near terrain . Gear and flap position not a factor in the warning . Mode 2 . Large closure rate with terrain . Mode 2A . Occurs for a large closure rate if the flaps are not in the landing configuration and glideslope deviation is more than 2 dots . Mode 2B . Alerts for a large closure rate if the flaps are in the landing configuration . Mode 3 . Alerts for a large altitude loss during takeoff or during a missed approach with the flaps not in the landing configuration or landing gear not down . Mode 4 . Alerts when the airplane is too close to the terrain and the landing gear or flaps are not in the landing configuration Mode 4A alert when the landing gear is not down and gives the aural messages TOO LOW GEAR at low airspeeds , or TOO LOW TERRAIN at high airspeeds . Mode 4B alerts when the landing gear is down and the flaps are not in landing configuration and gives the aural messages TOO LOW FLAPS if the airplane is at low airspeed , or TOO LOW TERRAIN at high airspeeds . Mode 5 alerts when the airplane goes below the glideslope during approach if the landing gear is down . Mode 6 gives aural callouts when the airplane descends through set altitudes with the landing gear down . It gives callouts like MINIMUMS or DECISION HEIGHT . Mode 7 gives windshear warnings . Every one of these modes is altitude , speed and aircraft configuration dependent . In the Enhanced GPWS , these triggers are also changed based on the position of the aircraft .

Display of ownship 's position has a very strong effect on the mental model that the pilot has of it 's navigation . When the EFB displayed position is wrong , the change that the pilot will detect that by comparing to other instruments or outside visual are very limited . This is a safety concern . To have the EFB approved to display ownship 's position , the most straightforward way would have been to certify it under TSO C129a " Airborne Supplemental Navigation Equipment using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) " TSO-C129a has now been superseded by TSO-C196 which has slightly different requirements . Often class I or class II EFB will have a GPS receiver that technically could be used as the source of ownship 's position . The GPS receivers chips used in are not designed and certified against the " Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using Global Positioning System ( GPS ) " ( RTCA document DO-208 ) , which is a requirement of TSO-C129a or " Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Global Positioning System/Aircraft Base Augmentation System " ( RTCA document DO-316 ) which is a requirement for TSO-C196 . The major technical difference between simple commercially available GPS chips and aviation grade GPS chips is that the latter include a Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring ( RAIM ) function which does Fault Detection ( and Exclusion ) . If a GPS satellite would drift out of it 's orbit or GPS data gets corrupted in the receiver , an ordinary GPS chip would most likely display a position error , while an aviation GPS chip would either indicate a failure state ( fault detection ) or still display the correct position ( fault exclusion ) . This protects the pilot from being mislead by a map shift .
The EASA issued LAPL ( A ) is limited to 2to MTOM , 3 passengers max and only valid in European countries . A PPL ( A ) issued by an EASA country does not have these restrictions , but can be subject to local restrictions in the non-European country you want to flyin , e.g. you can not use the EASA PPL ( A ) to fly in the US without further paperwork . For more information , see the <URL> . Your LAPL ( A ) is a lifetime licence that contains SEP ( land ) and/or TMG privileges restricted to non-complex EASA aeroplanes with a maximum take off mass of 2 metric tonnes and a maximum of four people on board . You can fly more complex aeroplanes within the privileges if you have ' differences training ' signed off in your log book by a suitable instructor . The LAPL is also valid on non-EASA UK registered aircraft in the UK . The LAPL requires an in-date EASA Part-Med Medical Certificate , at LAPL level , but Class One or Class Two certificates can also be used . A valid JAA Class One or Two medical certificate is also acceptable . But you can not use your LAPL with an NPPL medical declaration . The SEP ( land ) or TMG endorsement on this type of licence is not issued as a rating . So there is no rating expiry date . Instead you must follow self-validity checks on your own flying history for the past 2 years to ensure currency on the day of your planned flight . Further Reading from the UK CAA : <URL> <URL>
No , EASA can not access anything . You will be asked to bring your medical records to the exams . Neither EASA nor your examining doctor is able to access any of your medical records without your consent . It 's restricted personal information . Some countries already have medical records in digital ( computerized ) form , but many still rely on written data . In any case , EU institutions have no jurisdiction outside of EU . You will also be given a questionnaire that will include a checkbox for any known medical conditions you have ( or had in the past ) . I do n't know what your condition is/was , but it might be a good idea to consult a private examiner first before checking anything on the list that might prevent you from getting a certificate issued .
I 've just arrived back home after being in the US for some months . I was required to have a FAA class 3 medical , because I did some flight training there , and luckily the one I 've received is also is a student pilot certificate with the number on it you require to register for DUAT . Some of my colleges did n't have this number and so they were not able to register until getting there FAA pilot certificate . This will be send to your home adress , most probably when you are home again . In the US you 'll only get a temporary certificate ( peace of paper ) . The only number you 'll find on it is your current license number . Now what you can try : One of my colleges simply wrote an e-mail to duats helpdesk where he described his situation , giving all the information they require on their registration page with his foreign license number and attached a photography of his license and a proof that he 'll be in the us for the next months . Less than 24 hours later he had a log-in . We had a student Visa , but if you do n't have something like this , just try it without it , or take a photography of something else looking trustworthy . Good luck and enjoy your trip ! Edit : I was just looking for the e-mail address , but for any reason my browser refuses to load duats website . As far as I remember , you 'll find it at the registration page . If someonewho can access the website likes to add the e-mail adress please feel free to do so , I would appreciate your help .
The air moves around the fuselage , which causes a localized increase in velocity around the aircraft . This increase in velocity causes a slight decrease in the outside air pressure , which effectively sucks air out of the fuselage , making the cabin at a slightly higher pressure altitude . The effect is localized . While the reduction in pressure , and increase in pressure altitude inside the cabin is small , many GA aircraft display a 40 foot or so difference in pressure altitude between the alternate static port ( inside the aircraft ) and the pressure altitude with the factory static port .
<URL> ( <URL> ) Arming button missing . According to your linked PDF , the system is coming soon . Looking at the most recent A350 cockpit photos on the internet , the arming button is missing in those photos , but of course it can be added later to existing aircraft . Per the A350 pilot briefing , the button will be left of the speed-brake lever -- <URL> A350 briefing . <URL> From the PDF in the question , highlighting the same button . <URL> says -- Such systems are under development by major manufacturers and are currently in use in some aircraft types . One such example I can confirm to have it is the Falcon 7X , they call it <URL> ( ADM ) . In case of a depressurization at high altitudes , the Autopilot and Auto throttle will guide the aircraft to safe altitude at maximum velocity . ADM is activated when Autopilot is engaged , the aircraft is above 30,000 ft. , and the cabin altitude is 9,700 ft. or greater . We just need to keep checking the latest A350 cockpit photos or wait until further information is released , I hope that helps .

I would actually assume the opposite to be true . Let us assume the vortex intensity and the induced drag are directly correlated . The induced drag coefficient can be expressed as : $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ cdot AR \ cdot e } $ $ c_L $ : Lift coefficient $ AR$ : Wing aspect ratio $ e $ : The so-called Oswald factor , a number which equals one for elliptic lift distributions . It decreases for distributions that deviate from the elliptic one . Most wing designs aim to achieve an elliptic-like lift distribution in order to minimise induced drag in clean configuration . As flaps , spoilers , air-breaks and so on are deployed the lift distribution will deviate substantially from the elliptic one ( see diagram ) , hence reducing the $ e $ factor and increasing the induced drag . If the first assumption still holds , an increase in induced drag will have been caused by an increase in vortex intensity . <URL> Additionally , significantly higher lift coefficients can be achieved with deployed high-lift devices , which also contribute to increase vortex intensity .
EASA itself does not require a RT license ( RT is usually legislated on national level ) , however , it gives the state issuing your license the possibility to include RT privileges as part of your license ( item XIII in the license ) . This is also the most common case , ie , your PPL will most likely include RT privileges , so you will not need an RT license in addition to this . What EASA state are you planning to have your PPL issued in ?
tl ; dr The flame would progress upstream into the compressor until it and damage it , fatally disrupt the carefully balanced flow and stall the engine , or both . long answer : In a turbine engine , there is a continuous flame where injected fuel is ignited by the already burning fuel downstream . Now you ca n't match the flow speed and the flame propagation speed exactly , because a small disruption could then blow out the engine and because both depend on the power setting in non-trivial way . So in normal operation , the flame can propagate upstream until it gets to the point where the fuel is not yet sufficiently mixed with air to burn and there it stays . If you injected the fuel before the compressor , the flame would progress into it and as it would engulf the last stage , it would damage it and it would also increase the pressure beyond what the preceding stages could maintain , which would stall the compressor and cause the engine to stop , either immediately due to lack of oxygen , or by causing more damage with each stall cycle . Note that spark-ignition ( gasoline and LPG and CNG ) engines usually do inject fuel before compression , but it limits their compression ratio to around 12:1 with high-octane gasoline , 14:1 with clever tricks . If the compression ratio was higher , the fuel-air mixture would ignite from the compression heat before the piston reaches the top-dead-centre and act against the rotation . In contrast compression-ignition ( Diesel ) engines have compression ratio at least 14:1 and inject the fuel only when it should start burning . While early turbines had rather low compression ratios , the newest generation is getting into the range comparable with Diesel engines where the fuel might ignite due to the compression heat alone -- they still use sparks for ignition , because the starter wo n't build up as high pressures in them , but it clearly shows they ca n't inject the fuel before it should start burning .

How do airports charge airlines for using their gates ?
Gates are usually not charged to airlines separately . Gate fee is usually part of the landing fee package . Landing fees are an important part of the airport revenue , with passenger fees . Airport pricing is subject to recommendations from ICAO , IATA , and other organizations , as regard scope of costs to be taken into consideration , and non-discrimination of airlines . Pricing is determined by the organization managing the airport and/or State or local administration . Single till vs dual till : Distinguishes between aeronautical and non-aeronautical ( commercial ) charges . Airport schedule pricing may use single or dual till . See : <URL> - IATA . <URL> . ICAO guidelines tries to maintain some principles for airport business across all countries : Landing charges : Should be based on the aircraft weight formula . The maximum certificated take-off weight as indicated in the certificate of airworthiness ( or other prescribed document ) should be used , while considering local restrictions that may affect aircraft maximum take-off weight . Allowance should be made for the use of a fixed charge per aircraft or a combination of a fixed charge with a weight-related element , in certain circumstances , such as at congested airports and during peak periods . Parking and hangar charges : For the determination of charges associated with use of parking , hangar and long-term storage of aircraft , maximum permissible take-off weight and/or aircraft dimensions ( area occupied ) and length of stay should be used so far as possible as the basis.Any period of free parking time for aircraft immediately following landing should be determined locally by considering aircraft scheduling , space availability and other pertinent factors . Other charges : -- Passenger service charges -- Security charges -- Noise-related charges -- Emissions-related aircraft charges Albeit a bit old , The Airport Business by Rigas Doganis has a chapter on <URL> which discusses this topic in depth . Extracts : Landing fees : Charged per aircraft , usually based on MTOW ( maximum takeoff weight ) . On most airports covers ATC , runways , taxiways , parking at stand or apron for a certain time ( e.g. 2 hours ) , use of gates / fingers / terminal for disembarking ( use for departure may be paying ) , take-off . Surcharges or rebates in addition of landing fees : For noise , peak-hour operations , Parking and hangar : Beyond the free-parking period covered by the landing fees . Usually based on weight . Passenger charges : per departing passenger , sometime per arriving passenger too . It is easy to find pricing for airports online . <URL> airport ( 2015 ) Rates are different for domestic and international flights . Charges per passenger for landing and passenger facility . For domestic flights , additional landing charges per ton of MTOW . Charges for diversion . Parking charges beyond 2 hours , paid per arrangement with airport . New York <URL> ( 2015 ) Charge for aircraft landing , per thousand pounds of MGLW ( maximum gross landing weight ) . Additional charge for day landing or takeoff ( not for schedule airlines ) . Charge for using public passenger ramp and apron area ( in some cases , when congestion ) . Charge for parking and storage , per 8-hour slot , based on MGTOW ( maximum gross takeoff weight ) . Agreement possible for operators of aircrafts . No charge for air terminal use . Charge for each passenger departing . <URL> ( 2013 ) Landing fee , based on MGLW , different between permitted and non-permitted air carriers . No charge for remote gates bussing service . Charge for using ramp , apron and remote area , ( in some cases , when congestion ) . Charge for parking , per 1000 lbs of MGLW , per day , after 3 hours .
We should not make statements about any particular airline . Air travel is and remains very safe , due to : Good practices imposed by the regulatory institutions . Feedback of things that went wrong in the past to prevent them from happening in the future . Very mature engineering and technology implementation Lots and lots of experience with reliability numbers over the decades . That being said , proper procedures do need to be followed and it could theoretically be the case that only minimal maintenance is carried out at some airlines , while others are more pro-active and lead the field in safety practices . Think Rainman , and the airline that has never crashed . Safety numbers of all airlines in the developed world are very good . Cheaper airlines must follow the same practices as more expensive airlines . The cheaper tickets are the result of better business practices , not of worse maintenance practices . Edit @Michael Kjörling points out a TV episode about a case of Madrid airport being closed , all traffic lining up for Valencia , and three RyanAir aircraft declare fuel emergency . Plus a LAN Chile declares engine out Mayday . Do n't know if this counts as evidence though , TV programs must find or produce a topic that is sensational enough for transmission . The safety numbers are still on RyanAirs side , their safety record is pretty good .
The practice of naming aircraft probably comes from the days of the flying boat , and the naval tradition of naming ships - <URL> had many named aircraft , and <URL> . Other airlines of the period had similar naming practices ( I 'm not sure who started it , but Pan Am 's fleet was well known for it ) . As a marketing tool telling folks they 're flying on " Clipper Emerald Isle from New York to Dublin " may have been more attractive to passengers than " Pan Am Flight 12345 " or N880PA . Particularly before the commoditization of air travel , when flying was still a new and novel form of transportation , having a connection back to familiar " sailing " metaphors may have helped get passengers on board and could help differentiate your service from another airline . Modern airlines do n't seem to push their aircraft naming as much as historic carriers did , but <URL> - in fact Lufthansa paints their plane names onto the fuselage , though I 'm not sure if they announce them to passengers . A skilled marketing department could build a brand around ship names , but I 'm not aware of any airline doing so today .
DeltaLima is correct but there is a little more to the story which he hints at in his link . This topic is known as Freedoms of the Air . There are five official in total , each dictating in what way an airline may operate in a foreign country . What KLM has done is a : Normal stop for those getting off . Technical stop for the onward passengers . Both are less controversial than what would essentially be letting a foreign operator offer flights in your country , which would not help local carriers ( and which would constitute Cabotage as DeltaLima says ) . The technical stop is defined in the second freedom of the air : Second Freedom of the Air - the right or privilege , in respect of scheduled international air services , granted by one State to another State or States to land in its territory for non-traffic purposes ( also known as a Second Freedom Right ) . The Third and Fourth Freedom states that the airline can load and unload passengers in a foreign country for transport to and from the carrier home country : Third Freedom of The Air - the right or privilege , in respect of scheduled international air services , granted by one State to another State to put down , in the territory of the first State , traffic coming from the home State of the carrier ( also known as a Third Freedom Right ) . Fourth Freedom of The Air - the right or privilege , in respect of scheduled international air services , granted by one State to another State to take on , in the territory of the first State , traffic destined for the home State of the carrier ( also known as a Fourth Freedom Right ) . ( Needless to say , 3 and 4 go hand-in-hand ) Source : <URL> See also this <URL> for easier reading . The other option , aside from not doing it for legal reasons , is that KLM can not justify the trouble and cost of doing it . Setting up more domestic presence ( websites , additional staff , pricing in regard to competition ) in a foreign country is a somewhat complicated business . There would be additional waiting time on the ground when stuff was loaded and paperwork sorted out . Furthermore , I imagine that KLM would like to block the free seats for the complete leg as long as possible ( which would generate the greatest revenue ) , so the actual number of available sub-segments for booking would not be that great .
First and foremost you should always be looking at the turn coordinator to see what is going on and applying rudder as necessary . In your specific case ( if we want to discuss the physics ) , basically what your instructor is saying is that you are using the ailerons to bank ( turn ) the plane and the rudder to counteract the propeller 's yawing moment . The rudder is simply counteracting the P-Factor : the inputs will change depending on how steeply you are banking . If opposite rudder is called for on your ball , then step on it . Perhaps more importantly , what your instructor is actually stressing is during your crosswind , base and final turns you should really be paying attention to staying coordinated . A great deal of Stall - > Spin - > Crashes happen in the pattern as planes slow down and dirty up , thus it 's extremely important in the pattern to watch your speed and your turn coordination .
As the previous answers have stated , their schedules are determined by what best suits their needs . However , those schedules can be complicated by contractual and curfew requirements . A contractual example : Thousands of expatriate Brits live in the south of Spain . They want their morning London papers . We would depart Stansted ( just north of London ) as soon as possible . We were contractually committed to have the load to Barcelona by 07:00 local , with huge penalties if we failed ( the papers were worthless by noon ) , and then on to Palma de Mallorca . Hopefully by now , they transmit the papers electronically and print them locally . A curfew example : A cargo flight departing Hong Kong bound for Chitose , Japan ( refuel there then on to Anchorage ) . The old Kai Tak airport at Hong Kong had a 23:00 local curfew ; Chitose had a curfew until 06:00 local . The solution to that was to depart Hong Kong just before the curfew , land at Taipei and park for a couple of hours ( I forget the exact time ) , and then continue to Chitose to arrive just after 06:00 local . All Japan airports at the time had a curfew from 23:00 local to 06:00 . You could go out to the south end of the airport just before 06:00 local , and set your watch by the first arrival of what was tens of aircraft , both passenger and cargo , whose departure time was determined by the need to arrive as soon as possible after the airport opened
Many ( especially larger ) airlines have a history and infrastructure for engines from a specific manufacturer and are unlikely to change that , the cost would extend far beyond just the cost of changing the contract . E.g. KLM has a massive investment in maintenance facilities for GE engines , workshops , spare parts warehouses , highly trained specialised technicians . Retooling to RR would be prohibitive for them . Of course a smaller operation without maintenance facilities of their own might be more flexible in that and just buy whatever is cheapest at the time , contracting out maintenance to various companies as needed . But even then , it 's often more economical to have a single maintenance provider doing all your work for you , which might well mean a provider who 's specialised in a single series of engines , for example if you 're based at Schiphol there 's a good chance you 'll be contracting out your maintenance to KLM and their GE specialised shops . So there are many good reasons for airlines to stick with a single engine supplier ( and to a degree with a single aircraft manufacturer ) , even if the cost of buying those engines is higher than selecting competing engines from another manufacturer . Say you 're going to save 0.1 % in your fuel bills for the 2 new aircraft you 're buying to increase the fleet of 20 with other engines you have already ( and that 's a big if , those engines are pretty close between manufacturers for a specific aircraft ) . You 'd need to fly a LOT for it to be worth building an entire duplicate maintenance network just for those few new aircraft . Of course if it 's part of a long term plan to replace the entire fleet with aircraft using that other manufacturer 's engines , that 's a different story . But mixed engine fleets tend not to be the most economical way to go , even if on one type manufacturer A is marginally more fuel efficient and on type B manufacturer B is marginally more fuel efficient ( and that 's what you 're going to see , marginal differences only ) . If you 're talking an operation like Delta or United , with hundreds of aircraft of each type , it might be a different story . But then too you 're talking about more aircraft with each manufacturer 's engines than most other airlines have in total , and they 'll have multiple maintenance shops themselves , making it easier to have a facility for each manufacturer ( and of course in case of the big US airlines , they tend to have ended up with that in the course of gobbling up other airlines anyway ) .
Some reasons for an airline to sell some of its fleet : they need quick cash ( as ratchet freak points out ) . This usually means the company is in serious trouble they 're changing their route network and there 's no more need for it ( e.g. KLM dropped a lot of very short flights in the 1990s and early 2000s , and got rid of the aircraft that were operating them as they were inappropriate for the longer routes that replaced them ) they bought out another airline and have no need for ( all ) its aircraft , or want to replace them with other types to keep their fleet homogenous ( operating many similar types is less economical than operating a smaller number of types ) they 're splitting part of their operations to a new company set up for the purpose ( the new company becoming the new owner of the aircraft , usually for a symbolic fee ) , for example a regional affiliate or a charter operation it may be more economical to replace the aircraft then to keep them . When NWA decided to replace their DC9 fleet with A320s this was for economic reasons ( lower maintenance and fuel cost for example ) , not because the aircraft had run out of fatigue life . The aircraft were old so most probably were scrapped , but some may well have ended up with airlines in other countries , replacing even older aircraft or expanding existing DC9 fleets there . and some airlines just want to portray a public image of always flying shiny new aircraft . I believe Singapore Airlines used to have a policy like that and replace everything it bought relatively quickly ( more so than most other airlines at least ) . PanAm was like that as well . If you have a reputation of exclusivity , this may add to customers ' willingness to pay premium to fly with you
Simply put , ExpertFlyer gets its data from purchasing it from the GDSs ( global distribution systems for airlines ) these are the same systems that travel agents ( online and off ) use to book tickets/travel for their customers . This has a cost but has advantages vs free but less reliable means of acquiring flight data . Other services may screen scrape ( take ) information from public airline websites , however airlines frown upon that . We have seen active campaigns by airlines to go after services that collect data in this manor . Please note , this post is not meant to be " promotional " however fully answering the question posed requires explaining how different services may acquire flight data . Also , if the name " ExpertFlyer Voice " did n't indicate to you , I am a representative of ExpertFlyer.com
Paper airplanes create lift just like any other airplane . Do n't let the wing cross section confuse you ; what the air " sees " is a different shape . When a flat plate flows through air at a positive angle of attack , the stagnation point of the flow ( where air splits into an upper and a lower flow path ) sits slightly below the forward edge of the wing . Now the streamline just above the one which hits the stagnation point has to negotiate the sharp corner of the leading edge , which will cause it to separate from the surface . This creates a small separation bubble which to the streamlines further up looks like a round leading edge , and since the rest of the wing has no curvature , the flow will attach again soon . The bigger the angle of attack gets , the farther back the stagnation point will be and the bigger the separation bubble becomes . At some point , which is promoted by leading edge sweep , the separated flow will not reattach , but produce a vortex , like the vortex which provides lift on delta wings . The picture above is from a simulation ; see the <URL> . Note the red color on the forward part of the upper side : This indicates low local pressure , which is needed to make the outer air negotiate the leading edge plus the separation bubble ( see <URL> for an explanation on the molecular level ) . In the separation bubble , low pressure is not accompanied by high flow speed since the separation turbulence has eaten up most of the kinetic energy . The actual nose radius of the paper wing does not matter , and it might even be zero ( like when you fit razor blades to the leading edge ) : The air will create its own airfoil shape by padding with separated air what can not be reached with attached flow . Paper airplanes have a low enough wing loading that their angle of attack is low and the separation does not become too big . All it needs is a center of gravity at the quarter chord of the wing ; that is why you need to fold the piece of paper first . It is interesting to watch a slightly tail-heavy , delta-shaped paper airplane fly : It will gradually reduce speed and will start to rock its wings when it approaches stall . Once one wing is going down , the sudden increase in its local AoA will increase lift so much that the rolling motion reverses , without noticeable yawing . The delta-shaped flat plate has effective roll damping right into the stall . The lack of yaw is mostly due to the high yaw inertia , but indicates also that drag buildup is moderate at best . Of course , after a few periods of rocking the nose will drop and it will pick up speed like any well-behaved airplane .
Lufthansa does . They actually prefer people they can train themselves , so they never learned things which Lufthansa considers bad practice . This becomes impossible if the airline grows quickly . Therefore , all the new carriers ( Etihad or Vueling , for example ) need to rely on hiring certified pilots . See <URL> ( only in German but speaking German is a requirement anyway ) . Thanks , Danny , for the link . Lufthansa has now adopted English as their corporate language , so I wonder how firm the German language requirement still is .
You can just look them up . Here 's a screenshot from Flightradar24 taken at about 1410 UTC on 22 May 2017 . I imagine in an emergency they 'd be given priority just like any other aircraft in distress . The crew might have specific orders covering that situation that requires them to head for a military base . Their operation is so secret , though , that I doubt we 'd find out unless a emergency occurs . <URL>
It depends on the type of bird and mammal species in native to the area and also the type of grass used in turfing ; some of them may not survive if mowed very closely . FAA 's <URL> concedes : Species-specific responses may be expected . ... Airport managers need to work with airport wildlife biologists to determine what species of concern in regards to aircraft safety are in their area and what the habitat needs are for those species . For most airports , FAA recommends a height of 5-8 " of grass . Considering bird , mammal and vegetation limitations , mowing at least monthly at a target of 5 - 8 inches may work in many airport environments as part of a wildlife hazard management program . ... Mowing at 5 - 8 inches should also reduce small mammal abundance .
Honestly ? It 's probably because they heard someone else do it , and thought it sounded cool ( or otherwise just got it stuck in their head ) . You 're 100 % right - saying the runway name is , if slightly longer , certainly a bit more informative . It 's the kind of thing that can help arriving pilots know which runway is in use , keeping later radio clutter ( " Um , uhh , Jeffco Traffic , um , say runway in use ? " ) to a minimum for pilots already on frequency . Even a ' one runway airport ' still has two runways ( 09/27 , for example ) , and it 's nice to know which one you should set up for when winds are light . The preferred terminology is more like " Jeffco Traffic , 3AC , clear 29 " .
Android by default has Google Now installed . Voice search listens for the words " Ok Google " when you speak , but phones also detect a long press in a headphone button ( on headphones with controls ) . It can also be fooled into activating by odd signals like the pop when you turn on the avionics master switch or loud droning noises like motorcycle and airplane engines . [ credit : @GdD 02/03/2017 ] In this case , it was the static and popping noises made by transmissions of the radio com that would interrupt recordings as it masked itself as the long press on the headphone jack . This would stop a recording and start the voice search app . A quick fix is to disable Google Now . This disables any Google features including " headphone long press " detection from the headphone jack . No other app uses the long press to activate , effectively eliminating the problem from ever interrupting your recording during flight . No need to download an app just disable Google Now in Settings > Applications > Google Now > Disable . Once this is resolved , I noticed that my video wo n't record past 4 GB . This is because of the FAT32 file system limit of my SD card ( default for Android SD cards ) . An app can fix this and automatically restart a new recording when the file system size limit has reached . There is no getting around this limitation of the file system other than restarting a new file .
ICAO ICAO Annex 11 and Doc 4444 confirm the usage of Upper . Airways are four groups per ICAO , the older group is <URL> . Those stand for Amber , Blue , Green , and Red . There are three other groups . So an airway named UG1 will be called Upper Green ( not Golf ) One on the radio . Example they give in Doc 4444 : N0450F310 L9 UL9 STU285036/M082F310 UL9 LIMRI ( ... ) the flight will proceed on Airways Lima 9 and Upper Lima 9 to a point bearing 285 degrees magnetic and 36 NM from the Strumble VOR . From this ( ... ) <URL> also confirms it , check page 251 : <URL> FAA ( for airways only ) Q is called Q ( kyo͞o ) on the radio ( not Quebec ) , J is called J , not Juliet or Jet ( Jet is what it means ) .

Note : the question asks about airways , the information here is not for tail numbers , navaids , etc. , only airways . See here for how the FAA decides on the designations : <URL>
The <URL> seems to be that no one knows for sure , but the most likely explanation is that before class A existed there was Positive Control Airspace ( PCA ) that started at FL240 , and DME was a requirement in PCA . The main reasons for requiring DME were : There 's a limited number of <URL> so it is n't easy to use cross-radials from other VORs for fixes or position reporting ; DME is a simple alternative If there 's no radar coverage then ATC can still manage lateral separation effectively using DME That all seems plausible enough , but some sources out there say that PCA started at FL180 , not FL240 , e.g. this <URL> : [ VFR on top ] was a principle [ sic ] factor in the <URL> and led to " Positive Control Airspace " ( PCA ) FL180 and above . Because of the speeds of the aircraft involved , non-radar procedures were unwieldy ( standards called for ten minutes between aircraft ; some 80 miles for a typical jet ) , even with the development of aircraft installed Distance Measuring Equipment ( DME ) and the reduced separation available between DME equipped aircraft ( 20 miles ) . FL240 is also where ATC starts using Mach numbers instead of knots ( ATC orders <URL> ) and the separation minima change ( section 8-4-4 ) . I do n't know if that 's for historical reasons or physical/operational reasons , but it looks to me like FL240 is considered the general starting point for high-altitude operations ( <URL> requires a high-altitude endorsement for aircraft that can operate above 25,000 ' MSL ) .
The Part 121 regulation that governs low visibility takeoffs are specified in 14 CFR 121.651 . It references company OpSpecs and 91.175 and Part 97 : " Standard " takeoff minimums are specified in 14 CFR 91.175 and would be the highest of : Non-standard takeoff minimums specified on the airport charts ( FAR 97 ) For aircraft , other than helicopters , having two engines or less -- 1 statute mile visibility . For aircraft having more than two engines -- 1⁄2 statute mile visibility . For helicopters -- 1⁄2 statute mile visibility . OpSpec C056 is issued to all 121 carriers , and basically just spells out the " standard " takeoff minimums that I listed above , and specifies that RVR must be used if it is available on the runway . OpSpec C078 is normally issued and allows taking off with lower than standard visibility as long as the airport does n't already have published higher than standard takeoff minimums . This is a fairly involved OpSpec with several optional paragraphs , and operators may be approved for takeoff operations down to and including 300 RVR . For those not familiar with the term , RVR ( Runway Visual Range ) is the distance that a pilot can see down the runway , measured by automatic equipment , and is measured in feet in the US . It offers approvals for the following visibilities : 1/4 SM / RVR 1600 : Touchdown zone RVR ( or mid RVR if touchdown zone is inop ) is controlling : Requires " runway markings or runway lighting provide pilots with adequate visual reference to continuously identify the takeoff surface and maintain directional control throughout the takeoff run .

The overwhelming majority of major airlines do lease at least some of their aircraft . And most airlines who choose to buy do not end up paying that full price tag . In the case of Easyjet , around half their fleet is leased ( as of 2013 ) . Leasing allows airlines with weak balance sheets or with poor future prospects to increase capacity without locking capital . In fact , the largest aircraft owners are aircraft leasing companies . For example , GECAS ( General Electric Capital Aviation Services ) , the largest aircraft lessor , currently owns around 1,700 aircraft , being operated by 230 airlines around the world . There are other ( not state-owned and generally low cost ) airlines , such as Ryanair , who are fond of owing most of their aircraft . What Ryanair does is negotiate very good procurement deals with Boeing ( by buying large packs of planes , all being B-737s ) , use them for around 5 years , and then sell them before their price has gone down too low . This takes a burden on their debt levels , but seems to work for them so far on the long run . This aircraft resell value is an important aspect to consider when comparing leasing vs purchasing , as well as tax incentives derived from amortization . Legacy carriers ( many of them state owned ) , on the other hand , have a tendency to purchase most of their fleet , and keeping them around for the full lifespan of the machine ( around 30 years ) . The actual price a company pays for a given aircraft is not public ( understandably ) and most figures you would be able to find are related to " list prices " . However , in 2005 Ryanair was forced to disclose facts about one of the massive ( by the time ) purchases of Boeing aircraft . Apparently , they paid <URL> . More current data on the actual price airlines pay for Boeing planes can be found <URL> , where Javier Irastorza analyses the discounts Boeing is applying to their aircraft based on a balance sheet assessment .
Adding to what the others have mentioned , bad weather is often a combination of low visibility , low ceilings , precipitation , high winds and lightning . Visibility and ceilings As mentioned in @fooot 's answer , ILS is available to land when in these conditions . Every airliner and crew ( and just about every airport they 'd go into ) is trained and equipped for ILS operations . A standard ILS approach is good in weather down to 200 ft ceilings and 1800 or 2400 ft visibility along the runway ( RVR ) . Further airplane and airport equipment and aircrew training can allow ILS category II and III operations , which reduce these numbers ( cat II is 100 ft vertical visibility and RVR 1200 , cat III goes down to essentially no visibility ) . To takeoff , a 2 engined airliner needs 5000 ft RVR ( 1 mile vis ) normally . Airport lighting and airline opspecs can reduce this as low as RVR 300 . Wind High winds are fine , but can make the landing more challenging . When the winds are strong and particularly gusty , a lower flap setting can be used to land and a faster approach speed flown . This will , however , necessitate a long landing rollout . Exceptional crosswinds can also present problems aligning the aircraft with the runway , and if you ca n't line up , you ca n't land ( note that some larger airplanes can land in a crab and do not need to align with the runway until the main gear are on the ground ) . Runway condition You mention the wheels are not powered , and this is true . However , the friction between the runway and the contact patch on the tire is the only thing keeping the airplane on the runway in strong crosswinds , so you need friction to land ( or takeoff ) if there is a crosswind component . Anything reducing friction is problematic ( rain , snow , ice , rubber , etc ) , With high water you risk hydroplaning and this ( or snow/ice ) can lead to departures from the runway sides or an overrun if braking action is insufficient due to lack of friction . Ice needs to be chemically treated and snow must either be treated or plowed at regular intervals ( while it is snowing ) . Ground handlers at the airport must also have deice fluid and the equipment to apply it to aircraft available for operations in snow . Lightning When lightning is in the vicinity , ground crews go inside as it is a deadly hazard to be on the ramp in those conditions . Summary All of these things contribute to lowered arrival rates into the airport and as conditions deteriorate you reach a point where you are spending more time dealing with keeping the airport open than departing airplanes and it makes sense to close the airport temporarily .

How do helicopter pilots practice auto rotation ?
You just fly your profile . Initially its with an instructor , but eventually you move on to training by yourself/copilot . You can practice full autos ( to a landing ) , but some airframes practice to a hover or in early stages . In the TH-57B ( Bell 206 ) , you can take it a full power-off landing during training since it is light enough . However , moving up to the TH-57C you do power-on recoveries , where you run the twistgrip back up to full open while you 're in the flare . You then initiate the recovery to arrive at a standard 5-foot hover . The C model has significantly more weight , which is the main reason . In the MH-60S its all power-on , recovery to a hover . Except we do not go to idle like in the 57s , we just rapidly lower the collective to get the needle split . Same process in practicing your scan , initiating the flare , and then pulling in power at the appropriate height once you 've leveled . Finish at 10 feet with some forward speed . ( Rumor is that Army does full practice autos in their 60s , but never confirmed that ) . Navy prohibits it in the MH-60S and almost certainly in the MH-60R as well . The explanation I received is that the airframe is meant to absorb the impact similar to your car during a full auto , and thus full practices can structurally compromise the bird .

This answer will be quite anecdotal ( I have not seen a survey on the question ) . It will answer the question for " most people I 've worked with " , and for " my " aircraft ( B737NG ) . Also , the usual disclaimer : different airlines/aircraft manufacturers may have different SOPs/instructions/limitations . Consult your manuals . In general : most pilots will leave FD on , IF it still provides useful and reliable information , without being an obstruction/nuisance ( i.e. when configuring it to give correct guidance would be more trouble than it 's worth , given that you already have visual references ) . This philosophy is also usually what you 'll find in an airline SOP , but in more formal language . I 'll try to provide some examples ( non-exhaustive ) to illustrate this depending on how you were set up before being cleared for the visual approach : ILS to straight in landing Leave the FD on until landing ( on my aircraft , B737NG , it will disappear at 50 ft RA ) , both localizer and glideslope will give usable and reliable information to the FD . ( Caveat : in visual conditions , ATC might be less strict about avoiding signal interference . They might for instance let an aircraft on the ground taxi to cross your runway while you 're on approach , which could cause localizer/glideslope interference ) . ILS to sidestep Most would turn the FD 's off . Both localizer guidance and glideslope guidance will be to the " wrong " runway . The FD is likely to be more of a nuisance than a useful tool . Non-ILS approaches with no centerline offset The Localizer/LNAV path will give good lateral guidance to the FD . The vertical guidance will depend on the approach and your equipment . If the aircraft generates a good quality vertical path , which crosses the runway threshold at a reasonable height ( 50 ft ) , there is no real good reason to turn the FD 's off . If all you have is vertical speed ( V/S ) guidance , it might be more helpful to turn FD 's off . Non-ILS approaches with centerline offset ( for example most VOR approaches ) At some point during the approach , you 'll want to abandon the approach course , and line up with the runway . Where this point occurs depends on specific approach , and how you intend to fly it . Example : A VOR approach to runway 36 ( runway heading 000 ) might use a VOR 1 nm east of the runway with inbound course 005 . You might want to stay on the inbound course of the VOR until it crosses the extended runway centerline . In this case , most people would keep the FD on until reaching this point , and then turn it off , as it wo n't give you any useful guidance afterwards .
Yes , advanced flight directors and autopilots for helicopters can control the aircraft in all axes , and often they have modes for hovering built in , including maintain altitude , lateral veloctiy hold , hover , and/or autolevel . Hovering is difficult because it requires more complex controls than maintaining altitude in an airplane . Helicopters have a different set of control axes than fixed-wing aircraft . Fixed wing aircraft are controlled in pitch , roll , and yaw , with thrust as an extra variable . On a helicopter the flight path is controlled through cyclic ( roll and pitch ) , collective , and throttle , with the anti-torque pedals as well to control yaw . Hovering the aircraft requires controlling of the cyclic to keep the aircraft over its target with no lateral movement , and collective and throttle to maintain constant altitude , although the exact procedures are a little more complex . While not present on low-end helicopters due to a combination of complexity and lack of necessity , advanced autopilots for helicopters do exist . Like on other aircraft , there is a wide variety in autopilots between simple functions to maintain attitude ( often called one or two-cue guidance depending on the number of axes used ) to complex FMS-integrated three-axis modes ( which would be " three-cue " guidance ) . The FAA <URL> states , for example , that " The most advanced autopilots can fly an instrument approach to a hover without any additional pilot input once the initial functions have been selected . " On the Agusta AW139 helicopter that I 'm familiar with ( although I 'm not a pilot ) , they have several modes that provide this functionality : an altitude mode to maintain a given altitude an altitude acquire mode to smoothly reach a desired altitude an autolevel mode to level off at the end of an approach segment a lateral velocity hold mode to maintain slow lateral motion or no lateral motion more exotic search and rescue modes providing capabilites to transition to a hover , mark-on-target descents to predefined altitutdes , etc. . A traditional hover would be achieved by combining a low lateral velocity mode with a zero vertical speed mode like altitude or autolevel .
Multiple-engine configurations use multiple freewheeling units that couple the rotor with the engine and allow the first to revolve faster than the latter but not the other way around . If just one of the engines fails , the freewheeling unit for that particular engine will effectively disengage the engine from the rotor ( as the rotor is now revolving faster than the failing engine ) , allowing the other engine ( s ) to drive it . How a freewheeling unit functions on a mechanical level is described on page 6 of <URL> document .

If you are asking if a plane can be taken from the gate all the way to the sky by auto-pilot I 'm quite certain the answer is no . Not because a plane ca n't configure itself for take off and power up the engines ( I 'm quite certain it can , though I would defer to more knowledgeable people for that ) . Not for that reason , but rather because there is no system in place to electronically guide an aircraft through a series of taxiways all the way to the base of the runway so that it can line up to take off in the first place . Keep in mind , ATC gives a lot of instructions for ground operations , funnelling aircraft this way and that via taxiway A through Z. They 'd have no way of telling an auto-pilot about these directions , there 's no computer to send out signals and there is no voice recognition build into the plane . If you told the pilots , they would have no way to input the instructions into the autopilot , nor would the autopilot know what to do if it ever received such instructions . It just is n't designed to follow taxiways . Also , beyond just taxiway layout , there are a lot of planes in close proximity on the ground , plus bunches of other important vehicles ( fire trucks , fuel trucks , de-icers , etc. ) Steering around all of those , faultlessly , would be quite the feat . We 've only just gotten to the point where <URL> , I think a plane navigating an airport ( and doing it while minding ATC ) is a bit of a ways off . EDIT : Raidri 's video does a much better job of <URL> and his comment is correct . I did underestimate how good the systems are these days . That being said , I 'm not changing my answer . There still , currently , is no way to convey ATC instructions to the aircraft . As a point of clarification : I saw the question as asking about technology in it 's current state . Will we eventually be able to do this . Heck yes , absolutely . A great deal of the technology is in place and what 's left is either right on the horizon or close to it . FAA clearance will probably take some time , but we 'll get there . I was mainly answer the question from the perspective of modern tech and what is currently ready to be installed on a plane .
Air forces use special training rigs rather than real ejection seats . <URL> Plenty of pilots have survived ejection ( Wikipedia says " As of 20 June 2011 ... the number of lives saved by Martin-Baker products was 7,402 from 93 air forces " ) The types of injury are illustrated by <URL> The ejection seat has been responsible for saving the lives of thousands of pilots around the world since its introduction in the late 1940s . Typical survival rates quoted in the literature vary from 80 -- 97 % . It is generally accepted that radiographic evidence of vertebral fracture can be found in 30 % -- 70 % of aircrew after ejection The reason real ejection seats are not used is almost certainly the high risk of injury . Ejecting clear from a high speed jet requires a lot of acceleration .
There 's no instrument you need for a good approach angle in good weather , it 's all done by eye . When you train as a pilot you develop a sight picture of what a good approach looks like , and you develop a sense of what a runway looks like when you get too low or too high . It comes from experience and practice combining with the human brain 's excellent spatial processing capabilities .
Aligning yourself in the middle of a straight taxiway is n't a problem . On the 747 , if you put yourself in the middle of the taxiway as you see it beyond the nose , you 'll be in good shape . If you 're the captain , you can hold yourself a little left of the perceived center , but not much , because you 're looking at from an eye level over 30 feet up as I remember . If the taxiway has those little metal reflectors sticking up on the centerline , you can play games trying to keep one of the nose wheels hitting them . You can just barely feel going across them . Or , since the nose gear is two wheels , you can play with getting the reflectors between the two wheels if you 're really bored . Turns on a taxiway present a bit more of a challenge insofar as keeping the center line because the nose gear is behind you , but one develops a feel for it . A 90 degree turn from a narrow taxiway onto another narrow taxiway is a little challenging , especially if the taxiway you 're on T 's into the one you 're turning onto . All you 'll see out the front window as you start the turn is grass . Also , on narrow taxiways , you ca n't see the taxiway out the side window from your normal sitting position . If you need to do a 180 on a runway , you need to remember that when you first get yourself on , say , the right side of the runway , the nose gear is n't there yet , and the wing and body gear have even further to go . You have to run yourself along the side of the runway a sufficient distance so that the airplane is aligned with the edge of the runway before you start your turn . Personally , I found taxiing a 747 one of the more fun things in life .
Short answer is no . First of all it is resolution advisory as you said . Its purpose , is to make the Pilots aware of an imminent danger/conflict . As with ' Terrain , Terrain ' , ' Pull up ! , Pull up ! ' , it is up to the pilots whether or not they will follow the instruction ( normally they always do , but there are exceptions ) . However when the pilots hear ' Climb , Climb ' or ' Descent , Descent ' , or another TCAS alert , they should immediately initiate the required action . After all , these days there are top-notch ATC and confliction prevention systems , as well as high-tec TCAS systems on most of the commercial aircraft .
Yes they do , and <URL> they 're better than paper ones . All sorts of aircraft can have electronic checklists , from large airliners to small Cessnas : modern avionics like the G1000 <URL> and the older but very common GNS430 <URL> . In the US at least there 's no legal requirement to use checklists in any form - electronic or paper - with some caveats : They 're considered a fundamental best practice in aviation , so if you do n't use them then someone could argue that you 're acting <URL> Incorrect - especially missing or incomplete - checklist use <URL> ( see <URL> too ) so clearly it 's in your own best interests to use them properly If you 're flying for an airline then your <URL> probably requires use of checklists , in which case they 're mandatory As for mobile devices , there are already many <URL> and <URL> that support <URL> . In some cases the app provides a template for a specific aircraft type , in others you have to enter it all yourself . There may be some copyright considerations , but third-party checklists are <URL> so obviously it is n't a huge issue . Finally , it 's worth noting that many pilots - especially those who own their own aircraft - <URL> for their own needs .
Can a sextant be used while flying ? Yes it can . Some aircraft like 747 for example had a sextant port to allow celestial navigation . How accurate/reliable is a sextant , both standing still and at 500 + mph ? Sextant is not accurate . At least not accurate enough for today 's navigation purposes . You can not perform a RNP-RNAV approach with a sextant . Per wikipedia , the best accuracy you can get with a sextant is between a tenth to a quarter of nautical mile . But it is a very good alternative if everything else fails . Are sextants found in any cockpits today ? As for sextants in modern cockpits , my best guess is you wo n't find any , at least in the form of one " left in a drawer " . See that image of a sextant being operated on a VC-10 . It 's more like a submarine periscope than a traditional naval sextant . <URL> Retrieved from <URL> unknown copyright owner . Finally , as KRyan notes and as voretaq7 wrote <URL> , pilots do n't need to know , but they can attend training in order to know .
do they fly in a pilot ( like mid-air refuel ) ? No , that is n't really feasible ! See answers to <URL> do they leave it to the co-pilot to take care of such situations ? Yes . In both normal and emergency situations , the co-pilot is able to fly the aircraft , navigate to a nearby airport and land the aircraft without the assistance of the senior pilot . From <URL> Here are some lines of defense : The remaining pilot must assume or maintain control Establish a safe flight profile and engage the autopilot ; use all possible automation Obtain cabin crew assistance Inform ATC If on an extended-range twin-engine operations ( ETOPS ) flight , the remaining pilot or PIC must assess whether to continue the flight , return to the departure airport or divert . The decision is based on : Weather conditions at the destination or alternate Reduction of flight time if diverting Workload involved in single-pilot operation Familiarity with the alternate Condition of the incapacitated pilot Availability of medical assistance Overall safety of the flight Arrange medical assistance upon arrival Brief a cabin crew member to assist if required Complete the approach and landing using the autopilot as much as possible A partially incapacitated pilot should not be allowed to participate in the subsequent operation of the aircraft , as judgment may be impaired After landing , seek immediate medical assistance See also <URL> The remaining pilot must first assume command and maintain control of the aircraft . Furthermore the position of essential controls and switches should be checked , and in nearly all cases , use of the autopilot should be made and an emergency be declared . Use of the autopilot and priority of air traffic service are two obvious and effective ways of maintaining a tolerable level of workload . The second step is to take care of the incapacitated flight crew member . The grounds for this are not entirely humanitarian ; if left unattended an incapacitated pilot can become a major problem and in any case is a major distraction to the remaining crew . Thus the incapacitated pilot must be moved out of the range of flight controls . In all cases , the advisability of removing a pilot ( perhaps unconscious ) from the seat must be dictated by consideration of the phase of the flight , the crew available , and the contours of the flight deck . Note : Consideration of the restraint and care of an incapacitated pilot dictates that cabin attendants are at least familiar with the operation of harness and seat controls Finally , and after the incapacitated flight crew member has been taken care of , the remaining flight crew should re-organise the cockpit work and prepare for landing . Details will depend on many variables including such considerations as the type of aircraft being flown , phase of flight , en route and terminal weather , and many others . How does commercial airlines prepare themselves for these kind of situations . I imagine that it involves the usual measures make pilots take regular medical tests . make pilots responsible for reporting own or crew illness , fatigue etc. prevent pilots eating the same meals in-flight . write procedures for pilot incapacitation in-flight . train flight crew to perform those procedures review and revise the above based on experience of relevant events . From what I 've read , non-pilot flight-crew are often given very basic training so that they understand the basics of flight . For example <URL> requires flight attendants initial training to include a pilot-incapacitation drill , an understanding of aircraft parts including rudder , ailerons etc , principles of flight , etc etc. . Do they specifically check if there are any pilots in the passenger manifest I believe the airline staff would often be aware of any airline pilots onboard ( e.g. <URL> ) but not of GA or military pilots flying as normal passengers .
When preparing for a flight , pilots will calculate many things , including their rotation speed . This is the speed in their takeoff roll at which they will start to pitch up , and hopefully the plane <URL> . The rotation speed is dependent on many things such as temperature , altitude , and aircraft weight . My answer <URL> discusses the lift calculations in relation to rotation . That question covered the importance of speed related to weight . More speed is needed to create the lift to take off with a higher weight . When the airplane rotates , it increases the angle of attack of the wing , which increases the lift coefficient ( if the wing does not stall ) . The pilots will pitch up at a certain rate , and they do not stop until they reach a climbout attitude higher than what is possible when the main gear is still on the ground ( <URL> ) . They count on the plane acheiving enough lift during rotation to leave the ground so that they pass that maximum pitch while in the air . If pilots underestimate their weight , they will calculate a lower speed than is necessary to provide the lift for takeoff . This means that when they rotate , the plane does n't have enough airspeed yet to create enough lift to take off . So instead of leaving the ground before fully pitching up , the tail strikes the runway . It may seem like an easy mistake to make , but thousands of pilots do it every day without a problem .
The pilots also need to use oxygen in case of smoke , fumes , or fire in the aircraft . Thus , they need enough oxygen to be able to get down and land in a fire scenario , which is much more than a decompression ! Fire procedures have the crew on 100 % oxygen at positive pressure to prevent them from breathing in smoke and fumes , while in a decompression , their masks mix oxygen with cabin air , in much the same way the cabin masks do . This is also why the cabin masks are not used in smoke/fumes scenarios .
Yes , for a while : Capt. Al Haynes , after <URL> on United Flight 232 . <URL> I was lucky enough to have dinner with Al Haynes a few years ago , and he told me that he had a very difficult time overcoming the guilt of the disaster . The talks he gives have been a way of coping . ( As a side note , he also donates all the money he receives from the talks to the survivors of the crash ) . Capt. Haynes has said the same thing in various interviews : The Seattle Times : Haynes said it took many sessions with a psychiatrist to overcome his survivor 's guilt . He resumed flying three months after the accident ; mandatory retirement at 60 followed two years later . <URL> NY Mag : It was very hard to get past the guilt of surviving . My job had been to get people from point A to point B safely , and I did n't do it . I felt that I had killed them . I had a lot of psychiatric help at the hospital and afterward . Finally , one psychiatrist said , " You 're not going to find an answer . You just have to accept that it happened . " <URL> AvWeb : Haynes said , at the time , that he remained troubled by the accident and constantly wondered if there was something he could have done , some overlooked decision that would have saved all aboard . <URL> Before his death , <URL> said something similar : " To find out 112 people did n't make it , that just about destroyed me , " Fitch once said . " I would have given my life for any of them . It was a really tough time . " <URL>
pilots need to be able to do work during turbulence . passengers do n't really like to be fully restrained .
They are n't " almost uniformly sheepskin " , but they are absolutely uniformly flame-resistant ( or self-extinguishing ) as required for aircraft certification . Sheepskin ( and other natural wool fabrics ) are both flame resistant and self-extinguishing ( which is why <URL> are often made of wool ) , and sheepskin tends to wear well , so it 's a good choice for the two seats that will absolutely always be occupied when an aircraft is being operated . In terms of comfort , sheepskin covers also breathe well ( so the pilots are n't sweating profusely while operating the aircraft - one of the reasons they 're popular accessories for cars ) . Other popular fabric choices are natural leather , flame-resistant synthetic leather ( vinyl ) , and various other textiles which pass the FAA " burn test " requirements ( test procedures are described in <URL> for light aircraft , <URL> for transport category aircraft ) .
In 727 and 747-100/200 aircraft and their simulators for the two airlines I flew those aircraft for up to my retirement in 1999 , all stall training was done in simulators , never in the actual aircraft . Stall training in the sim consisted of slowing ( or otherwise loading up the wing ) until the stick shaker started . Recovery was accomplished by unloading the wing and then adding power in that order . Whether unloading the wing was accomplished by just relaxing back pressure or by positive forward movement of the control column ( or by rolling out of a bank if you were in one ) was a judgement call . Typically the sim instructor wanted a significant stick shaker warning , not just a quick blip that you immediately stopped . Also , it was considered bad form if , once you stopped the stick shaker , it started again . Obviously that meant you had loaded up the wing again and were moving toward a secondary stall , which was a definite no-no . As I remember , that was more likely to happen if you made the mistake of leading with power rather than first reducing the angle of attack . Every once in awhile someone would want to play a bit and see how the sim reacted to a full stall . As I remember , the sim would just bounce around with a very high sink rate . I never felt its response to a full stall was at all representative of what the actual airplane would do . I experienced the stick shaker in flight in a 747 three times that I remember : once during a test flight in which that was part of the testing , once with a check airman who liked to play , and once on the line . The instance on the line was when I was still an f.o. , and it was the captain 's leg . He had extended the speed brakes for the descent . When he brought the power up for the final approach , he forgot about the speed brakes . The stick shaker came on immediately . He realized what he had done , and retracted them , and the stick shaker stopped .
No , but a hat to protect the head from the sun . You may call this the glider pilot 's headset ;-) <URL> Glider pilot with hat ( picture <URL> ) The flight noise is just a faint hissing sound , and the most noise is either produced by the electrical variometer or the radio . On a busy day and with everyone on the same frequency , I often switched the radio silent when high up . When you receive transmissions from tens of kilometers away , you often receive parallel transmissions , which result in a very loud and annoying crackling in the radio .

How does a self-centering rudder affect left-turning tendency ?
Adverse Yaw created by the propellor will vary based on aircraft and design . Lots of modern single engine aircraft do things to counter act adverse yaw but if we take a pretty neutral aircraft design and apply the tabs you reference all you will see is a slightly more aggressive rudder . Since there is a tab in each direction in a centered situation they will cancel each other out however they will cause the rudder to have a more drastic impact at smaller angles of deflection . What actually happens ? Does the neutral position of the rudder change at different power settings when flying straight and level ? Does this arrangement reduce your foot workload compared to other aircraft ? The neutral position of the rudder will always change a bit as the power settings vary . For this you have <URL> . Generally speaking a lot of GA planes have a bit of left rudder trim always in to counteract <URL> some even have permanent design features to do so . It should also be noted that <URL> is most prominent at high angles of attack and high power settings ( takeoff and climb out ) generally this also means lower airspeeds . Once you settle into cruise its effects are decreased . I have never felt that it adds to my work load when flying but <URL> may have a different opinion on that ... The design you mention does not really reduce workload , for that you would need something like a <URL> some new planes like the <URL> .
the aircraft I worked on in the army were deadlined whenever 1 % of total aircraft weight was removed , requiring either the part to be reinstalled or a total reweigh prior to next flight . That 's for internal equipment , which will affect the empty CG data . All aircraft lose weight during a trip . Aircraft designed to lose a lot of weight all of a sudden ( C-5 airdrops , B-52 carpet bombing ) have the details and limits calculated during the design . In the case of bombers , the ordinance will be hanging near the wings and will have a specific release order , usually back to front . A tailgate aircraft dropping something will also have very specific procedures based on the weight of the pallet going out the back door . If it 's delivering pizzas the procedure is along the lines of " whenever , dude " . If it 's a tank , it has to be positioned and locked down until the moment of release . The above is very noticeable by the flight crew . If the load stays ( or gets stuck ) on the back ramp , you 're usually done . I used to skydive - 10 people on the back end of a smaller tailgate like a Casa can and do cause the plane to stall . The rules were stay at the front until it 's your turn , then position and exit in a prompt manner . If the buzzer goes , let go NOW . Unlike a cargo plane , jump planes have 12,000 feet to recover from the stall .
The figure of 35 % might be ideal for a rudder on GA aircraft with decent effectiveness and high enough control forces so a good control feel is achieved . Generally , a rudder on a vertical tail is like a flap on a wing . It changes both camber and incidence of the vertical when deflected , thus helping the pilot to adjust the lateral lift force acting on the whole vertical . Therefore , the same <URL> can be used for rudders . A simple approximation for the amount of lift coefficient change per flap deflection angle $ \ eta $ is $ $ c _ { l \ eta } = \ sqrt { \ lambda } \ cdot \ eta $ $ where $ \ lambda $ is the relative chord of the flap and $ \ eta $ needs to be in radians . <URL> derived a formula using potential flow theory that is sligthly more complex : $ $ c _ { l \ eta } = c _ { l \ alpha } \ cdot \ frac { 2 } { \ pi } \ cdot \ left ( \ sqrt { \ lambda \ cdot ( 1 - \ lambda ) } + arcsin \ sqrt { \ lambda } \ right ) $ $ <URL> I plotted both together with a correction of the Glauert formula using wind tunnel data above . It is remarkable how close the simple formula matches the experimental data already . To be effective , the control forces on a rudder must not be too high , but also not too low in order to give good feedback to the pilot . For GA aircraft and gliders , a relative chord of 25 - 35 % has been found to give the best combination . Control forces grow with the square of the relative chord of their control surface since both their area and the lever arm of the additional forces acting on them grow linearly with their relative chord . In order to calculate the lateral lift change of the whole vertical , you need to know its lift curve slope $ c _ { l \ alpha } $ which is affected by its aspect ratio and sweep angle , <URL> .
I think it 's a little bit of both -- for most aircraft , how they behave in a turn is a byproduct of their designed aerodynamic properties . This question is actually quite complex to answer . Let 's assume you 're talking about a simple light aircraft , where control surfaces are mechanically linked to the controls that move them -- this ensures that anything you feel is related to what 's happening to the plane , and not necessarily to anything more complex ( like a fly-by-wire computer , or a hydraulic linkage with some degree of hysteresis ) . Aircraft turns are divided , by the CAA &amp; FAA at least ( see the FAA 's Airplane Flying Handbook , <URL> ) into three main categories : Shallow turns ( roughly speaking , < 20º angle of bank ) . These tend to become shallower if left alone . Medium turns ( roughly speaking , 20º < $ \ theta $ < 45º angle of bank ) . These turns tend to be stable without further pilot input . Steep turns ( $ \ theta > 45 $ º ) . These tend to become steeper if left alone , sometimes dramatically so . Let 's look at these in a bit more detail , with some explanation as to why these effects occur . Shallow turns . These tends to become less steep as the turn progresses , and most aircraft have a natural tendency to decrease the angle of bank throughout the turn . This tendency to lessen the angle of bank arises , I believe , entirely as a designed aerodynamic feature of the aircraft to have lateral stability . As shallow angles of bank are essentially a situation that 's is but a small perturbation about flying straight and level , it 's desirable for the angle of bank to decrease back to zero if left alone . If that is n't the case , the aircraft stability has to be actively maintained by constant manipulation of the control surfaces ( which is tiring or impossible for a human ) . This stability can be achieved through design features , such as ( i ) the dihedral of the aircraft 's wings , ( ii ) their sweep , and ( iii ) their height position -- if high , there is an increased degree of lateral stability due to the centre of mass of the aircraft being below the tilted plane of the wings , and , if disturbed slightly , it experiences a force $ F \ approx mg \ sin \ theta $ to " pull " the wings back upright again . The sole purpose of any degree of wing dihedral -- the angle they make with the horizontal -- is to improve lateral stability . If a perturbation causes one wing to drop , the resultant ( unbalanced ) force will produce a sideslip in the direction of the downward wing . In effect this is analogous to " creating " a flow of air in the opposite direction to the slip . This flow of air will strike the lower wing at a greater angle of attack than it strikes the upper wing . The lower wing will thus receive more lift and the airplane will roll back into its neutral position . Many small aircraft have a slight degree of dihedral on the wings . A similar effect occurs with ( ii ) swept wings -- when a disturbance causes an airplane with swept back wings to slip or drop a wing , the low wing presents its leading edge at an angle that is almost perpendicular to the relative airflow . As a result , the low wing acquires more lift , rises and the airplane is restored to its original attitude . As an aside , you do n't really notice you 're in a shallow turn , aside from the fact that you 're continually applying a little bit of stick and rudder . The $ g $ - loading is minimal . Medium turns . In this case , the aircraft is in a metastable state -- it will carry on at a constant angle of bank , but a ` shove ' to either side will result in the bank increasing or decreasing as appropriate . By this point , $ \ cos \ theta \ neq1 $ , and the outer wing is really generating a lot more lift than the other one -- and thus you 'd effect the angle of bank to increase , as it pulls the aircraft into the circle . The effects discussed above , however , still apply , and provide an effective restoring force back to the normal attitude . In a medium turn , aircraft are designed to have these forces balanced , and , in practice , you often need little-to-no aileron and almost no rudder to do a coordinated medium turn in a light aircraft . If it 's properly trimmed , you can take your hands off the controls and sit there merrily going around in a circle . Depending on your speed , the $ g $ - loading is apparent , but not great . Steep turns . By this point , one wing is generating almost no lift , and the other is generating quite a lot . We 've gone beyond the designed stability point of a medium turn , and the angle of bank tends to increase as the outward wing pulls the plane of the aircraft towards its axis of turn . This type of turn actively requires pilot input to maintain a constant angle of bank , and , depending upon the speed , it can physically be quite hard work . The $ g $ - loading of the wings is significant , and , as the stall speed of an aircraft approximately increases as the square-root of the $ g $ factor experienced , it 's entirely possible to enter an accelerated stall or even a spin here . You notice the
Since he does n't manage to make it back to the runway from his 2000 ft engine flameout run I was wondering if not deploying the RAT would make any difference due to reduced drag ? No , because it deploys automatically . Note that in the video in the first attempt the step is not done because there is less time . It is probably included in the checklist just in case the automation did n't do it 's job . Nevertheless , let 's try to estimate the drag . All I could quickly find about the RAT is that the attached electric generator provides 5 kW , but that should be enough . We need to take into account the hydraulic pump and power losses , but the generator would n't be insignificant part of the load , so we could guess that the turbine does not have more than 50 kW of drag . Now potential energy is $ E_p = mhg $ , differentiating by time we get $ P = v _ { vert } mg $ and solving for vertical speed $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { P } { mg } $ . Taking some " median " weight of 60 t ( A320 has MZFW 62.5 t and MLW 66 t ) and substituting we get : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 50 \ \ mathrm { kW } } { 6 \ cdot10 ^ 4 \ \ mathrm { kg } \ cdot 9.8 \ \ mathrm { ms } ^ { -2 } } \ approx 0.085 \ \ mathrm { ms } ^ { -1 } \ approx 17 \ \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ So the deployed RAT increases the rate of descent by less than 20 ft/min . Now the video mentions the best glide speed would be 205 knots ( I suppose it is for the 1 + F configuration ; for clean it sounds too low , though I do n't have a reference for this ) . Since the L/D ratio is around 18 , that would give the total descent rate about : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 205 \ mathrm { knot } } { 18 } \ approx 11 \ mathrm { knot } \ approx 1150 \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ Except , well , 18 is clean L/D . The L/D at 1 + F is a bit lower . I do n't have reference for that either , but something like 10 -- 12 sounds right , so : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 205 \ mathrm { knot } } { 12 } \ approx 17 \ mathrm { knot } \ approx 1730 \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ . That is about 100 times more . So the RAT might increase drag by 1 % . It was very rough estimate , so it may be 2 % or 0.5 % , but it definitely is n't that significant . Would the on-board batteries and windmilling engines be able to provide sufficient power for control surfaces ? The training manual mentions that If engine wind milling is sufficient , additional hydraulic power may be recovered . without saying at what speeds that would be , but generally the speed for wind milling engine restart are significantly higher that the best glide speed . I 'd say the necessary speed would be more than 250 knots . Also , are there real life incidents of a 2000 ft ( or lower ) dual engine failure that made a safe return to the runway ? Sully Sullenberger 's A320 had reached approx . 3,000 ft , yet he was forced to ditch rather than return . I ca n't find any other incidents involving dual engine failure on A320-family aircraft besides US Airways 1549 . And I am not aware of any incidents on any other aircraft that would fit that criteria either . It should however be noted , that flight 1549 likely had enough altitude to return to the runway -- if the manoeuvre was executed perfectly . A small mistake and they 'd crash into populated area since the airport is in the middle of a city . The Sullenberger 's great airmanship was in that he chose the worse option that he was certain he can make over the better option where he was not . Does the energy management differ drastically from type to type ? i.e. Among dual engined aircraft would some be easier to land from a 2000 ft dual engine failure than others ? Principally it 's the same for any type . But since turn radius increases drastically with speed , slower aircraft can turn faster and thus could return from lower altitude . Here 's a related question that discusses the manoeuvre ; and it 's dangers : <URL>
( Note : This answer is tailored to the U.S. / FAA , because that is what I 'm familiar with . All the citations and references are FAA materials . If anyone has any tips on possible international differences , please let me know and I 'll edit them in . That said , I believe the descriptions I give are fairly consistent across the world , even if the FAA reg citations do n't directly apply . ) In what situations does ATC ask for ident , and is it ever required by procedure ? Generally , " ident " is used to help a controller identify an aircraft 's secondary radar ( transponder ) return . By asking the pilot to " squawk ident , " the controller can ensure that the aircraft he/she is talking to matches the radar target he thinks is that aircraft . It can also be used for communication , to allow a pilot to respond if their radio transmitter has failed . Specifically : It is a method to allow a controller to identify an aircraft on radar , per section 5-3-3 of <URL> : When using only Mode 3/A radar beacon to identify a target , use one of the following methods : a. Request the aircraft to activate the " IDENT " feature of the transponder and then observe the identification display . For lost communication , per section 10-4-4 of <URL> : Take the following actions , as appropriate , if two-way radio communications are lost with an aircraft : c. Attempt to re-establish communication by having the aircraft use its transponder or make turns to acknowledge clearances and answer questions . Request any of the following in using the transponder : 1 . Request the aircraft to reply Mode 3/A " IDENT . " This last scenario is common when experiencing radio failures . If ATC suspects that you might be able to hear them but not to talk back , they might say something like " Cessna 12345 , if you can hear me , squawk ident . " If you reply by pressing the IDENT button , they can then issue you further instructions and ask you to acknowledge those instructions by pressing IDENT again . What does the transponder actually do in this mode ? In normal operation , every time the transponder receives an interrogation from a ground station , it replies with a data block containing certain pieces of information . <URL> : The encoded pressure altitude ( for Mode C transponders ) A 12-bit identification code ( this is the 4-digit code you select in the cockpit ) A single extra bit for the " ident " flag When you push the IDENT button in the cockpit , the transponder sets that extra " ident " bit in its reply data . Anytime the transponder is interrogated while IDENT is active ( for a set duration of time after you press the button in the cockpit ) , its reply data block will have the IDENT bit set . ATC computer systems notice this and cause the IDENT to be shown on the controller 's radar display . What does the controller see on their screen ? It depends on the type of radar system in use . Generally the radar target will either blink , its symbol will change ( or " blossom " ) , or an indication such as " ID " will blink in the aircraft 's data block ( where the callsign is shown ) . The AIM has some schematic pictures that show what an IDENT looks like on an ARTS-III scope ( an older system still in use at some TRACONs ) . See <URL> and <URL> . I will try to find some pictures of other radar systems such as those used at ARTCCs and newer TRACONs . Does it depend at all on either the code or the mode the transponder is currently set for ? The code does n't matter . The IDENT flag is an extra bit in the transponder 's reply data that 's independent of the 12 bits used for the code . Obviously the IDENT will only be observed if the transponder is operating ( not OFF or in a STANDBY mode ) . But the IDENT works in any mode used by normal civilian transponders ( Modes A , C or S ) .
I do not know the exact numbers for oleo stroke and so on , but this is how you would calculate this . A 747-400 weighs 400 tons on take-off and 296 tons on landing , maximum . See <URL> for the source of those figures . Next is the landing speed , this is approx . 160 knots = 82 m/s . Now let 's assume the pilot has misjudged the height and does not flare , but slams the aircraft with the 3 ° approach angle into the runway . It is supposed to survive this , so let 's just continue . This gives you a vertical speed of 4.3 m/s , and at 296 tons this is an energy of 2,750 kWs = 0.76 kWh , which needs to be dissipated by the landing gear . Now I make the assumption that the gear stroke is 0.5 m ( those who know please put it in the comments , and I will correct the calculation ) . We have 0.5 m to decelerate a mass of 296 tons from 4.3 m/s to zero . If we assume a constant deceleration , the force will also be constant and the sink speed will decrease linearly . The average sink speed during this process is 2.15 m/s , so it will take 0.23 s and an acceleration of 18.5 m/s $ ^ 2 $ . Force is mass times acceleration , so the force is 5,473 kN or 1.23 million pounds . This is just the inertial force to stop the descent . While taxiing to the take-off position , the aircraft will press with 400 tons = 878,000 lbs on the runway , since the wings do not yet produce any lift . This shows that even a hard landing does not stress the landing gear so much - after all , the acceleration is just shy of 2 g , acting on a much lighter plane . In reality , the landing gear of a 747 is staggered , so the inner main gears will touch the ground first . Also , I expect that the force will not be constant along the whole gear stroke . This will change the details of this approximation , but the general magnitude should not be different . <URL> goes into more details on how to calculate the damage an airplane will do to a given runway or apron . Now for the braking stresses . The landing field length of a 747-400 is 2175 m , and let 's just assume that the pilot forgot to use thrust reversers , aerodynamic drag was switched off that day , and all the braking power had to be supplied by the 16 main wheels . Let 's also assume that the pilot uses 1200 m of that field length for braking ( I 'm just making this up to get to an upper limit of what force will act on the tarmac ) . Now we need to decelerate from 82 m/s to zero within 1200 m. Linear deceleration means an average speed of 41 m/s , so the whole process takes 29.27 s. Dividing speed by time yields a deceleration of 2.8 m/s $ ^ 2 $ . To bring the aircraft to a full stop , we have an energy of 995,152 kWs = 276.4 kWh to dissipate along a distance of 1200 m. Using again Newton 's second law , we see that this requires a horizontal force of 829 kN = 186,322 lbs , which translates into 51,8 kN = 11,645 lbs per wheel . This is certainly more than what happens in reality , but to put it into proportion : The static load per main wheel at the maximum landing mass is 174 kN = 39,150 lbs ( assuming that 4 % of the mass is carried by the nose gear ) . This extreme ( horizontal ) braking force is still less than 30 % of the ( vertical ) static load , which is well below of the maximum braking coefficient of an aircraft wheel on a dry runway . EDIT : CGCampell correctly remarked that emergency procedures at take-off weight will produce the biggest braking loads . Now I will calculate the highest possible braking loads , and for this I need this plot of a polynominal for the braking coefficient , which is the ratio between vertical and horizontal forces before the tire skids . I do not know the source ; I collected it somewhere in the past and never found a reason to doubt its validity . Shortly before the aircraft comes to a stop , the highest friction coefficient is reached , and then little lift is produced by the wings , so the vertical tire loads are those of the static case . At 96 % of 400 tons acting on 16 wheels , this is 24 tons = 235,344 N = 52,907 lbs of downward force per wheel . Since the friction coefficient is 1 at low speed , the same load is transferred horizontally from each wheel to the ground , almost five times more than what I approximated for the landing above . Clearly , going to the limits produces much higher loads . Formulas used in the calculation : How to calculate the deceleration of a mass $ m $ from a speed $ v_0 $ to $ v_1 $ Energy has no absolute value , we just add or subtract energy . The amount of energy change $ ∆ E$ between the aircraft at a speed $ v_0 $ and at a speed $ v_1 $ is : $ $ ∆ E = \ frac { m } { 2 } \ cdot ( v_0 ^ 2 - v_1 ^ 2 ) $ $ The unit of energy is the Joule , which equals the Watt-second or the Newton-meter . Thus 1 J = 1 Ws = 1 Nm = 1 $ \ frac { \ text { kg } \ cdot \ text { m } ^ 2 } { \ text { s } ^ 2 } $ . Metric units are neat , right ? In physics , energy $ E$ equals work $ W$ , and work is performed when a force $ F$ travels along a distance $ s $ . As does the braking force , acting on the moving aircraft : $ $ E = W = F _ { brake } \ cdot s $ $ How do we g
Stall warning systems generally function on the principle of measuring pressure distribution or angle of attack . As each aircraft will have a different type of stall warning system , the necessary test will vary by aircraft as well . Here , I will answer based on aircraft that I have experience with , but these concepts should cover the majority of light aircraft . Aural stall warning systems can generally be divided into two types , pneumatic and electric . Pneumatic Pneumatic stall warning systems are found in many light Cessna aircraft , including the 172 and 177 . The following system description is from the Cessna 177 Maintenance Manual : The system is composed of an adjustable plate on the left wing leading edge , connected to a reed type horn by means of plastic tubing . The horn is actuated approximately 5 to 10 miles per hour above stalling speed as a negative air pressure area at wing leading edge causes a reverse flow of air through horn . See this excerpt from Figure 15-6 in the C177 Maintenance Manual depicting the pneumatic stall warning system and it 's location in the aircraft : <URL> To test this type of system , air must be drawn out of the system through the leading edge scoop located in the left wing . The maintenance manual and <URL> call for a test procedure as follows : Prior to flight , test the pneumatic stall warning system and determine if it is functioning properly , [ ... ] by covering the opening in the left wing with a clean cloth , such as a handkerchief , and applying a slight suction by mouth to draw air through the horn . A properly functioning horn will provide a sound that is clearly audible . The sound is something like that from a kazoo . In actual practice , speaking personally and from my observations , the " clean cloth " is typically dispensed with . Alternately , a <URL> is available for a small price if you would rather not have to put your mouth on a strange airplane . Failure of these systems will typically be due to a problem either with the horn -- such as a loose reed , or with the leading edge scoop -- such as a cracked or misaligned scoop . Electric Electric systems operate on some of the same principles , but use a movable tab -- instead of pneumatic suction -- to sense the change pressure distribution . This type of system is found on aircraft such as the Cessna 182 , Piper Cherokee , and Beechcraft King Air . The system operation can be generalized as follows : pressure changes cause the tab to move up thereby sending an electrical signal which will sound a horn in the cockpit . In some cases the tab actuates a microswitch . In more complex systems the tab actuates a transducer which signals a stall warning computer . The simpler of these types of systems can typically be tested with aircraft electrical power on by manually lifting the tab and listening for the warning horn . With the more complex King Air system , testing is accomplished with a switch in the cockpit which tests the circuitry and horn . In this system , signals from the stall warning transducer are blocked out by a weight on wheels switch when on the ground , with the effect that lifting the tab will not allow for system testing . Flight Safety ( FSI ) offers the following system description in their King Air 200/B200 Pilot Training Manual : The stall warning system senses angle of attack through a lift transducer actuated by a vane mounted on the leading edge of the left wing ( Figure 15-10 ) . Angle of attack from the lift transducer and flap position signals are processed by the lift computer to sound the stall warning horn mounted on the copilot 's side of the cockpit . The horn sounds when the following conditions are present : Airspeed is 5 to 13 knots above stall , flaps are fully retracted . Airspeed is 5 to 12 knots above stall , flaps are in the APPROACH ( 40 % ) position . Airspeed is 8 to 14 knots above stall , flaps are fully extended . The system can be tested prior to flight by placing the STALL WARN TEST switch , located on the copilot 's left subpanel , in the TEST position . This simulates a stall condition and sounds the warning horn . <URL> Figure 15-10 from the FSI King Air 200/B200 Pilot Training Manual Other Systems Other types of systems exist with which I have no actual experience , either as a pilot or mechanic . I offer the following information without much real knowledge of it , but hopefully with good sources . Others more knowledgeable than I might be able to verify it . The Boeing 737 has a stick shaker type stall warning system to provide the required warning , rather than an aural warning system . The SmartCockpit.com <URL> document gives the following system description : Stall Warning System The stall warning " stick shaker " consists of two eccentric weight motors , one on each control column . They are designed to alert the pilots before a stall develops . The warning is given by vibrating both control columns . The system is armed in flig
The gliding slope , which equals $ D/L $ , does not change with weight . Hence , starting from a given height $ h $ , the longest gliding distance will be $ d = h \ cdot max ( L/D ) = h \ cdot max ( C_L / C_D ) $ , i.e. , independent of weight . However , the gliding speed , and , consequently , the gliding time , do change with weight , and significantly . If $ C _ { L , max } $ is the lift coefficient when $ C_L / C_D $ is maximal , the gliding speed at best slope , $ \ bar { V } $ , is obtained from $ W = ( 1/2 ) \ cdot rho \ cdot \ bar { V } ^ 2 \ cdot S _ { ref } \ cdot C _ { L , max } $ .
Most of the time the turbulence we experience is termed " chop " , which is akin to what you experience on a boat on the lake -- bumps but no real altitude deviations . With altitude deviations we 'll call it " turbulence " . Within these broad categories we 'll qualify them with " light " , " moderate " , " severe " and " extreme " in reports to ATC and other aircraft . These reports do suffer from a fair bit of subjectivity with respect to aircraft type ( wing stiffness ) and pilot experience . If it is light chop , I 'll generally just ride it out and turn the seatbelt signs on . The first thing I 'll do if encountering moderate chop or turbulence is to query ATC and get ride reports from aircraft ahead of us and at different altitudes than us . From this information I 'll make a determination to ride it out or to request a climb/descent . If the turbulence was particularly bad , slowing down was an option , but I only came across that need a few times . Our ability to descend would often be limited by route length and fuel and major lateral deviations also depended on contingency fuel , so in some cases we had no choice but to stay in the chop . If the turbulent areas were well forecast or had lots of PIREPS , our dispatchers would sometimes route us differently . As for power adjustments , if we were n't slowing down due to aircraft limitations I would just adjust power so that maximum airspeed deviations stayed below Mmo .
$ V _ { MO } $ is a " maximum operating speed " . It is one of many " <URL> " defined for an aircraft that limit operation at various flight phases . All V-speeds are <URL> ¹ . The $ V _ { MO } $ is the maximum permitted speed for the aircraft . This includes a safety margin , so pilots can reasonably fly near that speed . Exceeding it is not immediately dangerous , but as it reduces safety margins , is an incident that should be investigated . There is another speed , $ V _ { NE } $ , the " never exceed speed " , which is somewhat higher and which marks the point where things start to get dangerous . When the aircraft exceeds $ V _ { NE } $ , <URL> may develop that will destroy the aircraft and/or important parts may break off as the <URL> becomes higher than what they are designed for . Also these speeds have their <URL> counterparts ² , $ M _ { MO } $ and $ M _ { NE } $ . At high altitude , the same indicated airspeed ( IAS ) corresponds to much higher true air-speed , since indicated airspeed decreases with pressure , while the same Mach number corresponds to slightly lower true air-speed , since speed of sound only depends on temperature . So at high altitudes , the Mach limits are reached first while at low altitudes the IAS limits are . Exceeding the $ M _ { NE } $ has different effect , though also dangerous . Above that speed flow separation occurs above the wing due to supersonic speed of the flow . This leads to loss of lift and significant down-pitching moment ( a.k.a <URL> ) , which aircraft not designed for supersonic flight may not have enough elevator authority to compensate . ¹ The airspeeds are given as <URL> , the speed measured by pitot probes , so they can be directly compared to the indication in cockpit ( aircraft with <URL> ( " glass cockpit " ) usually correct those measurement errors that can be estimated , showing so called <URL> ) . However it may not be just a simple number but may be tabulated depending on other parameters . In particular $ V _ { NE } $ and $ V _ { MO } $ may depend on altitude , because <URL> depends on <URL> and at lower density ( due to lower pressure at altitude ) the same TAS corresponds to lower <URL> / <URL> / <URL> . ² Mach number is true airspeed as fraction of speed of sound . In this case the limiting factor is formation of shockwaves due to the flow speed locally exceeding speed of sound around some parts of the aircraft .
You are n't missing anything obvious , ADS-B spoofing ( the sending of faked messages ) and tampering ( putting incorrect information into a message ) is possible as there is no message authentication built into the protocol . The receiving station has no way to check whether messages are fakes . There are some proposed solutions <URL> and <URL> , to my knowledge there has been no decision to change the protocol standard . Keep in mind that even if you add message authentication to the protocol there would still be ways to send faked messages . ADS-B uses GPS , there 's no reason you could n't fake the GPS data being sent to a broadcast unit . The unit would have no way of knowing the GPS data is not genuine , and would send position information thinking it was authentic . So even with authentication and security in the broadcast protocol you still can not implicitly trust the information sent as potential attackers have access to the actual transmission hardware and systems . This means in order to trust the information you have to validate it using another source . The FAA has been close-lipped about it , they say they have the situation covered but they wo n't say how . It may be that they feel that the continued use of radar in built-up and secured areas ( there 's no plans to ditch radar completely in favor of ADS-B ) will allow ATC computers to filter out the fakes . Radar is computerized , some smart algorithms would be able to match radar data to ADS-B broadcasts and alert when ADS-B data does n't match up . An aircraft trying to fly into the Washington DC zone would not be able to use spoofing to get close to a sensitive target for example . This would mean that the areas where spoofing is more likely to be successful would be areas where there is no radar coverage . Yes , someone could mask their aircraft 's true location or fake an airplane in these locations , however the benefits of the system would seem to outweigh the potential risks .
Turbulence affects aircraft in the same way whether it is banked or not . The difference however would be the end result of the turbulence . For example , if an aircraft were to encounter turbulence strong enough to roll the aircraft 20 degrees to the right , the end results would be a 20 degree bank if starting from level , but 45 degrees of bank if they were already in a 25 degree banked turn . If this were to happen it puts them closer to their stall speed because of the higher bank angle , and if they were already going slow and the airplane is at a low altitude , it could be a problem . Fortunately , most turbulence strong enough to cause this while at low altitude is caused by the wake turbulence of other aircraft or microbursts , and we have pretty good procedures in place to keep it from being a problem these days . If they are n't at a low altitude it matters even less because there is altitude for the aircraft to recover even if it does get into an unusual attitude .
It 's very normal for most students to struggle with the rudder initially . One aspect that got me while learning to fly : Unlike stick inputs is not ' applied pressure ' that measures the effect of the rudder , but the actual physical displacement of the pedal . It was quite usual for me to feel the need for right rudder , increase pressure on the pedal but with very little actual pedal movement , so there was practically no effect on the a/c . So I made a conscious effort when right rudder was needed to apply pressure enough To Move The Pedal . In other words if you want to double the effect of the rudder you need to double the pedal displacement , not double the pressure applied . Second thing that got me to using the rudder correctly : Make a mental note to use rudder when using the ailerons when changing power settings . Pretty soon these actions will become linked by the brain and you will do it unconsciously . Then with time you will also learn to use the correct amount . On feet stance I am pretty short at 1.70 m so I was usually selecting the closest setting for rudder which was placing the rudders very close to my knees , and as such it was difficult to properly use them ( as my body was literally resting on the pedals ) . I was once advised to push them further back and it has made a world of difference : adjust them so that maximum deflection requires just a little bit of hip effort and almost a straight knee . Try a couple of positions and see which one works best ; your instructor can help to show you the proper adjustment , and it does make a word of difference .
There 's virtually no chance of the pilot deliberately switching off all 4 engines , and even less chance of all 4 engines failing at the same time . It 's not entirely impossible for it to happen , but it definitely would n't be quietly ignored within the aviation community . I promise you that you would 've heard about it afterwards . That said , the A380 's engines are modern , quiet , and actually mounted quite a long way out on the wings , this makes them fairly quiet when idling , even when compared to other aircraft . This is particularly noticeable after a long flight where they 've been running at fairly high power for 8 or more hours , and is even more the case if you 're not used to the A380 , eg if you usually fly on common twins such as the A320 , 737 , 777 which are much louder within the cabin . I suspect , but ca n't be sure , that the engines were simply pulled back to idle ( minimum power/thrust ) and it sounded much quieter than you expected . But no , the engines were almost certainly not simply turned off , that just does n't happen . The only thing I can think of that would cause that would be a flame-out , and you 'd definitely notice that !
My answer was rather concise first , and I got the impression that I need to elaborate the question first . The question is about the best airspeed for maximum range . With wind . Best range means you cover the most distance while the wind is carrying the plane with it . If you have a headwind , the longer you stay aloft , the more you are carried back , so you better hurry up . With a tailwind , it helps to slow down because now the wind is helping you to cover even more distance . But how much ? We need to pick that particular speed where the change in fuel consumption just balances the change in speed over ground . I always found that easier to explain with gliders , and there you can really observe which polar point is best . Just picture yourself as an observer on the ground who sees the plane fly by in the distance . If you plot a line with the combination of positions and altitude , there must be one flight speed that produces a line where the flight path angle is the shallowest . This is the desired optimum . That has only little to do with optimum L/D - this is just one other point you can find with a sink speed polar . And it happens to be the point for best glide in still air . But there is so much more that humble polar will tell you , if you look at it the right way . With powered aircraft you need to pick the polar point where your fuel flow is lowest for the given speed over ground . Basically , you fly like the glider and add enough power to stay at the same altitude . That is all the difference . User2168 has answered that part already with a graphical solution . OK , now back to gliders . Please look at the plot below which shows airspeed on the X axis and sink speed on the Y axis . The solution is graphical : You start on the X-axis at the point which corresponds to the wind speed and put a tangent on the sink speed graph . Where the tangent touches the sink polar ( blue line ) , the plane flies at the best L/D for that given wind speed . Move the starting point to positive speeds for headwind and to negative speeds ( not shown here ) for tailwind . If the term " best L/D " is already reserved in your mind , please read this as the " best polar point " . It is really the same . Since User2168 has beaten me to the graphical solution , I will add an analytical solution . For powered flight things become more tricky , because thrust changes with speed . To simplify things , we can say that thrust changes over speed in proportion to the expression $ v ^ { n_v } $ where $ n_v $ is a constant which depends on engine type . Piston aircraft have constant power output , and thrust is inverse with speed over the speed range of acceptable propeller efficiencies , hence $ n_v $ becomes -1 for piston aircraft . Turboprops make some use of ram pressure , so they profit a little from flying faster , but not much . Their $ n_v $ is -0.8 to -0.6 . Turbofans are better in utilizing ram pressure , and their $ n_v $ is -0.5 to -0.2 . The higher the bypass ratio , the more negative their $ n_v $ becomes . Jets ( think J-79 or even the old Jumo-004 ) have constant thrust over speed , at least in subsonic flow . Their $ n_v $ is approximately 0 . Positive values of $ n_v $ can be found with ramjets - they develop more thrust the faster they move through the air . Now for fuel flow : This goes up and down with the power output of the engine . Again a simplification , but it helps to get to grips with the problem and gives useful results . This lets us re-formulate the problem as : At what airspeed do I have the best ratio between power and ground speed ? Mathematically , we want to fly with $ \ frac { P } { v_w + v } $ at the lowest possible value . $ P$ is the power , $ v_w $ is the wind speed and $ v $ the airspeed . To express the thrust behavior over speed , I break P up into a product of a constant $ K_S $ , the throttle setting $ \ delta $ and the speed like this : $ K_S \ cdot \ delta \ cdot v \ cdot v ^ { n_v } $ . Here is the general solution , pasted as a PNG to save me all the typing in the editor : Please note that implicitly the lift coefficient is on both sides of the equation . To solve it , you need to do it recursively , until speed and lift coefficient match . I took this form because of the similarity to the general form at still wind which can be found in many performance books . This here I did n't find anywhere , and it took me a while to figure it out . Thank you , Lnafziger , for the excellent question ! It gave me a chance to learn something . Now I have put the results into a plot . In order to eliminate the aircraft-specific parameters , it shows the ratio of $ c_L $ with wind over $ c_L $ without wind . The plot is metric , but will work for all units if you use the same units for wind speed and air speed . To give an example for the application of the correction factor : If you are flying in a 20 m/s headwind and your best range speed at still wind is 50 m/s ( approx 97 kts ) , the $ c_L $ needs to be 70 % of the $ c_L $ at still wind for piston-powered aircraft . This makes your corrected airspeed 60 m/s ( v is proportional to $ \ sqrt { c_L
A higher configuration number indicates that the flaps/slats are extended by an higher amount . In turns this means that for the same angle of attack the wings will produce higher lift ( and drag ) in the higher configuration . You achieve take-off when the lift is at least equal to the weight of the aircraft , and with higher flap/slat deflection you will have sufficient lift even when the nose is relatively low on the horizon , leaving plenty of margin against a tailstrike . On the other hand , if you are using a low configuration , the flaps/slats will be mostly retracted , and you will need a higher AoA to produce sufficient lift , meaning that you have to raise the nose of the aircraft more , leaving less margin against a tailstrike .
As long as the pilot is having a first class medical , her pregnancy should have no effect on the operations , at least legally , though the regulations differ from country to country . I 'm not aware of any FAA regulations that prohibit pilot ing during pregnancy . The closest it comes is in <URL> , which says ( noting that pregnancy is not a medical deficiency in any way and the regulation is taken here in the widest sense ) that : ( a ) Operations that require a medical certificate . Except as provided for in paragraph ( b ) of this section , no person who holds a medical certificate issued under part 67 of this chapter may act as pilot in command , or in any other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember , while that person : ( 1 ) Knows or has reason to know of any medical condition that would make the person unable to meet the requirements for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot operation As long as the pilot feels that she is medically fit and has a valid medical certificate , they ca n't be legally prevented from flying the aircraft . In case of other regulattions ( like EASA ) , pregnant women are not allowed to pilot after 26 weeks of pregnance . For example , <URL> says : ( c ) Pregnancy ( 1 ) In the case of pregnancy , if the AeMC or AME considers that the licence holder is fit to exercise her privileges , he/she shall limit the validity period of the medical certificate to the end of the 26th week of gestation . After this point , the certificate shall be suspended . The suspension shall be lifted after full recovery following the end of the pregnancy . ( 2 ) Holders of class 1 medical certificates shall only exercise the privileges of their licences until the 26th week of gestation with an OML . There are a number of medical issues that the pilot should be aware of while pregnant , so that appropriate measures could be taken , like , Ability to move the controls to their full extent . Ability to wear seat belts . Effect of high altitude operation on the foetus among others . The airline policy will vary and they have to consider a number of other conditions - for example , the ability of flight crew to egress during a crash etc. .
Simple Answer : Running the engine lean or rich at different altitudes . Longer Answer : There are a couple of reasons you want to adjust the mixture of a aircraft engine . Since air density changes with altitude , it 's a good idea to be able to change the fuel/air mixture at different altitudes . If you did not adjust the mixture at high altitudes you may not get full power because the air is thinner and now there is same amount of fuel being mixed with less air . All the unburnt fuel can cause issues like loss of power and/or fouling of plugs . Being able to lean the mixture at higher altitude lets you save fuel , so you can go further on a full tank . ( hence saving money ) Running a engine rich can help cool engine . Fuel acts like a coolant in this manner . Typically on climbing you want to run the engine a bit rich because your going slower and less air is able to help cool the engine . Traditional piston powered aircraft engines are shut off by pulling the mixture to the off position . This starves the engine and burns off remaining fuel in the cylinders . This topic can also bring up other discussions . Like EGT , CHT , running an engine rich of peak or lean of peak , monitoring fuel flow rate with a flow meter , and fuel injectors on fuel injected systems . Hope this helps .
Horizontal displacement : Tilt the rotor With the rotor blades rotating around a vertical mast , the total lift vector of the rotor is vertical and the helicopter hovers . If a translation is desired , this vector must be tilted so that an horizontal component can appear . This is done by tilting the rotor disc . The rotor disc is the plane of rotation of the blades . <URL> Rotor tilted forward : The helicopter moves forward . Rotor tilt : Change blades pitch The rotor disc is tilted using the lift difference between individual blades . For instance to tilt the rotor forward , each blade creates more lift when it is aft of the mast , less when it is forward of the mast , and the change is progressive between these two positions . The lift difference creates a torque moment on the mast , tilting the mast and the helicopter with it , at least this is our intuition . As you mentioned , the force does n't produce its effect instantaneously due to the gyroscopic precession . It is effective only 90 ° later . So the lift variation must have an advance of phase of 90 ° . For a forward translation , the lift is maximum when the blade is on the left , and minimum when it is on the right . The momentum is stored into the blade and released 90 ° later . <URL> The variation of lift is done 90 ° in advance . Lift depends on the angle of attack of the blade . Varying the amount of lift according to the position around the mast leads to varying the AoA around the mast : Increased AoA on the left , decreased on the right . <URL> Pitch varies according to the radial position of the blade . Change blades pitch with the swashplate Changing the pitch of a blade is done using a system of swashplates . A stationary plate is oriented in space by the pilot using the cyclic stick . Another plate is maintained in contact with the first one , but can turn freely with the rotor . This second plate is forced to rotate in the plane of the stationary plate , thus it oscillates constantly as it rotates . In turn , it creates an oscillation of the vertical rods ( horn links ) . Each horn converts the rod oscillation into a pitch oscillation on the blade . The blade is now pitched according to its instantaneous radial position relative to the mast , and according to the cyclic stick command . <URL> MBB Bo105 , based on photo by <URL> ( <URL> ) Horns are linked to different angular sectors of the swashplate The vertical rod transmits the stationary swashplate height at its current axial position . By locating the rod 90 ° ahead of the blade , the link takes care of the rotor precession . The mechanism is so that when the pilot pushes the cyclic forward : The swashplate is tilted forward . When a blade moves left of the mast , its horn link measures the height of the stationary swashplate in its aft sector , where the plate is the highest . The horn is pushed by the link to the maximum , and the blade in turn gets the largest pitch angle . The situation is reversed when the blade arrives on the right . The link is in contact with the forward sector of the swashplate , where the latter is at the lowest position . The blade gets a low pitch angle . <URL> ( Redrawn from <URL> ) Advance for pitch order can be adjusted as required By adjusting the offset of the horn link which interfaces the horn and the plate , one can adjust to the exact amount of advance required for a given blade .

How are Landing Fees Collected ?
This depends on the airport but at <URL> where I used to fly there was a $ 5 landing fee ( paid to the city of Philadelphia ) that was collected at the FBO ( where I rented the plane from ) when I paid for the rental . I think if you do not pass through an FBO they will hunt the tail number down and send a bill to the party that has the aircraft registered . Its tough to fly into an airport and not pass through the FBO ( unless you are just doing touch and goes ) . I would assume that for commercial traffic the airline/owning body pays and may even be billed by the airport monthly but I do n't know the specifics I only know what I have seen for GA traffic . If you are curious you can check out the Philadelphia Airport ( KPHL and KPNE ) <URL> which outlines the various fess and collection mechanisms the city imparts . Keep in mind these are city owned airports , see section V for details on collection but in short , Section V Part d Non-tenant Air Carriers and Operators not providing adequate surety or security in form and amount satisfactory to the Department of Commerce , to ensure payment of fees and charges , shall be required to pay all incurred fees and charges prior to aircraft departure . For the point of contrast lets take a small privately owned airport here in the US , <URL> in NJ has <URL> for parking and the such , but like most small airports like this , these fees are waved with the purchase of fuel ( usually at least some minimum amount ) . There would be no way to avoid paying ( well Im sure there is ) since usually the only way off the tarmac is through the FBO .
As late as possible to still meet your company 's specific stabilized approach guidelines ( mine were 500 ft VMC , 1000 ft IMC ) . If you need the drag , then use them earlier . In the EMB-145 in still wind or a headwind you could cross the FAF at 250 kts and clean and be on speed and configured by 1000 ' if you dropped the gear at the FAF ( and opened the speed brakes and the first notch of flaps all at once ) . Normally though , I 'd drop the gear around 1000 ' . Acronyms : VMC = visual meteorological conditions IMC = instrument meteorological conditions FAF = final approach fix EMB-145 is the type designator for the Embraer 145 regional jet
The answers to your questions vary greatly depending on the individual airline , type of equipment , what kind of flying they do , as well as contractual and union ( if any ) work rules . The one thing that is generally the same and as noted in the previous answer and comment , is that scheduled lines of flying are published to the crews , and a bidding system based on seniority is used to assign those lines . Also , can routes be classified into tough and easy ? What one pilot considers tough another may consider easy . A better way perhaps to think of it is that what one pilot considers desirable , another may not , and that will be reflected in how the individual pilots bid . Some examples ( but certainly not exhaustive ) : Young pilots with families would typically bid away from Christmas flying . I , however , not being a fan of Christmas and with all my children grown , deliberately bid to work on Christmas to open a no-work-on-Christmas line for someone else . In the northern hemisphere winter , I would bid into Australia , South America , or Africa because I do n't like the short days of winter . In the northern hemisphere summer I tended to bid into places where I stood a good chance of getting to a beach . A lot of pilots bid simply to maximize income . And there were those who bid to maximize overnights at a place where they had an ongoing personal relationship . Whether or not a pilot gets to actually fly a line as published is another matter . If you 're flying for a scheduled airline that does no on-demand charter work , and you 're going from one company station to another company station , chances are good that you 'll get to fly the line as published . If , however , you 're flying for a company that does on-demand charter work , the probability of flying the line as published goes down as the percentage of charter work goes up , and this is especially true with a mixed fleet of passenger and cargo aircraft . I flew for two commuter airlines , and I almost always flew my awarded bid line as published . Then I flew for two 747 carriers , both of which did a lot of on-demand charters . In the 12 years of flying for the 747 carriers , I rarely flew a line exactly as it was published . If was a matter of when you would have to depart from your line , not if . There are companies that do nothing but on-demand charters . In those cases what you 're bidding is not where you 're going to fly , but which days you will be on-call . Does n't more traffic in a particular area mean more tougher ? Some would consider it tougher , some more fun . A higher workload certainly , but I always felt that was more fun . There 's something addictive , at least for me , to running approaches in high-density traffic . It 's quite exhilarating really .
There are two main geometrical characteristics that affect the airflow in the situation mentioned . From one side you have a cylinder with wheels at the end ; on the other side during the transition you have an open cavity . Let 's talk about the first one . You actually have a cylinder flying perpendicular to the air speed . This is kind of canonical problem in fluid dynamics , there is a lot of literature about this problem , but to explain the effect I would like to take a simple example that I took from the website , the infinite 2D cylinder . For that , I include this picture of flow over a cylinder : Note for fluid dynamics experts : This is not relevant if Reynolds Number ( Re ) is around 10,000 , but for understanding the concept is good enough . So , imagine that we are cutting landing gear perpendicular to its length and we visualize the flow . What do we see ? Two main things ... Looking at the flow lines , they are almost not affected at 3-4 diameters of distance from the cylinder perpendicular to the flow direction there is a very local influence of the existence of the landing gear . However we see that down the flow there is a big influence with the creation of chaotic structures . That is creating a big increase in drag downstream of the landing gear and any surface behind . Basically ... low influence on the red direction and significant influence on blue . Answering your question , influences the wing in a local area . The influence anyhow is negative on the lift , as the flow is accelerated locally , reducing the static pressure below the wing , having a lift reduction , but is a local effect . This also have an influence on the wing lift distribution and a small effect on drag ... lower than the one directly produced by the landing gear itself . Now ... the cavities , they have a bigger influence , firstly because they have bigger extension parallel to the airplane surface ( the landing gear goes perpendicular to the airplane the cavity goes along the surface ) . Secondly , their flow behaviour is different , goes in and outside the cavity . I found this <URL> very good on this , but basically the flow behaviour is like these image : I found several flows similar to the second one , but depends on the airplane . You can see that flow will enter and go outside and will have a big influence . Finally , the biggest influence is found when the airplane is deploying or retracting the landing gears when you have changing conditions , difficult to predict and affecting the airplane dynamics . Usually you can notice it when landing or taking off , when landing gear is deployed you fell significant vibration on the airplane . Concerning your questions : How does the landing gear affect aerodynamics when deployed and when deploying ? There is a significant drag increase , slightly the lift , but also creates some unsteady behaviour affecting overall airplane mechanics creating vibrations ( anyhow , nothing not already taken into account ) . Is it different for aircraft whose landing gear do not retract into the wing ? I understand that you refer to airplane with non retractable landing gear . The effect is similar but usually the configuration tries to avoid having the landing gear close to the wing , as finally they do n't need to retract them back . Does this modify performance critical when taking off or landing such as stall speed , optimal climb speed ? Well , stall speed is usually defined by wing lift curve , and not so much affected by the landing gear . Usually the limitation is on the upper side due to separation . Climb speed is basically engine thrust minus drag , the drag increases the climb speed is lower . That 's why airplanes retract the landing gear as soon as possible .
The answer is quite simple : 1 . When touching down the nose is in a pulled up attitude , therefore the tail is farther down then normal . As soon as the airplane touches down ( on all wheels ) , the tail is higher , thus the hook is higher . You can see how the aircraft is in a nose up attitude , but gear and hook are on the same level . If the aircraft was sitting on all its tires , the hook would not actually touch the ground . ( This might not even be the case on all aircraft , though ! ) 2 . This is the much more important reason : The hook is hydraulically pushed onto the deck ( see Rhino Driver 's answer for more detail ) but as soon as the hook hooks to the cable , and pulls on it , that hydraulic pressure is overcome and the vectors of the forces go from where the hook is attached to the plane to where the wire comes out of the ground ( and vice versa ) . As you can see here , the hook is actually almost parallel to the deck . 3 . Last but not least : There is no space for two wires on one hook . Let 's say the airplane would catch the first rope , and for some reason ( it should definitely not happen , but let 's just pretend it does ) the hook is still on the ground where it would hook up to the second wire when crossing it , then it will maybe drag it along for a short time , but it ca n't really hook on as the hook is made to fit exactly one wire . This can be seen on this picture :
In the US , the military is not required to obtain FAA type certificates for their aircraft ; the FAA is not the authority certifying a military-registered plane 's airworthiness . They have the option of accepting an FAA type certificate ( which they tend to do on aircraft based on civilian ones ) , but they run their own certification agencies for airworthiness , which are all that matters if the plane is in the military registration system . Here 's an <URL> on the matter , here 's a <URL> on the option to use FAA certification on commercial derivatives .
It will either go through the airline 's existing air-to-ground system ( like the seat-back phones you pay $ 5/min for ) or they 've got a store-and-process-later arrangement with the card companies . ( Just because you ca n't use a phone does n't mean the airline ca n't , they just follow certain conditions better )
There is one frequency per sector and there can be two controllers per sector , one working the scope / talking to aircraft and one assisting with flight strips and coordination with adjacent sectors . If the sector does not require a second controller to coordinate and assist with flight strips , there will only be one controller doing all tasks single-handedly . In some cases , two sectors are combined and both frequencies are manned by the same controller , but this is only done in low-traffic times , where overlapping transmissions have a low probability . A good and well-written source to understand how ATC sectors and split workload works is the AVWeb Series of <URL> . See this related question for more information : <URL>
What a fix is has been answered <URL> but for now let 's just say it 's a known location that a pilot can navigate to if he has the right equipment . Fixes are shown on various charts and approach plates . As for using those fixes on an instrument approach , there are lots of variations and details but again , let 's ignore most of that for now . The basic concept is very simple : Fly to an Initial Approach Fix ( IAF ) Fly to other fixes as needed to execute the approach Land ( or go missed ) For example , here 's the RNAV ( GPS ) 36R approach at <URL> : <URL> You can see at the bottom of the map portion of the plate that both MASHA and FEWER are IAFs , so that 's where the approach starts . Let 's say you 're approaching from the south-west and you 've already descended to a reasonable altitude for starting an approach , following a <URL> or vectors from ATC . ATC says something like " N12345 proceed direct MASHA , cleared for the RNAV 36R approach " . That means that you are now cleared to execute the approach as shown on the chart , with no further instruction from ATC ( although they might have vectored you towards the IAF initially ) . The chart tells you that at MASHA you need to be at at least 3000ft MSL so you simply fly there at or above that altitude . Since it 's a GPS approach , you load it and activate it in your GPS unit , and you can follow the GPS track to MASHA . After MASHA , the next fix is ENIKY and the GPS track will lead you east to that fix ( which is a heading of 091 ° from MASHA ) . The profile view at the bottom of the plate shows that you must still be at or above 3000ft at ENIKY . Then you turn left to 002 ° and fly to UJOTY , where you must be at or above 2700ft . Then you continue to GEPDE at or above 1180ft . Then you land :-) Of course , I 'm ignoring a huge amount of detail here - like everything else printed on the approach plate ! - but since this question is about fixes the main point is that they 're simply a series of waypoints that you fly over ( <URL> ) to get to the runway . And obviously you also have to control your altitude as you descend , but the altitude is defined by the approach procedure , it is n't part of the definition of the fix itself . The same fix can be used in multiple approaches : MASHA and FEWER are also the IAFs for the <URL> ) . Even though different approaches define and use fixes in different ways , the basic idea is always the same : just fly from one fix to the next until you get where you 're going .
The limits of the $ V _ { r } $ and $ V _ { 2 } $ are determined by the <URL> in place . The rotation speed is the speed at which the pilot can the aircraft rotation for take off even when one engine is inoperative . Consequently , this speed should be more than the minimum control speed with one engine inoperative , $ V _ { MC } $ . The current regulations stipulate that the $ V _ { r } $ should be at least 1.05 times $ V _ { MC } $ . The safe climb out speed or takeoff climb speed is the speed which the aircraft should have reached at a given altitude . As per FAA regulations , this height is 35 feet above the takeoff surface . The <URL> $ V _ { 2 } $ should be at least 20 % greater than the stall speed $ V _ { s } $ and 10 % greater than $ V _ { MC } $ . The <URL> prohibit lifting the nose landing gear before reaching $ V _ { r } $ and retracting it till the aircraft is completely airborne . All aircrafts undergo these tests during their certification process and these data is used by the pilots . Another thing is that both $ V _ { r } $ and $ V _ { 2 } $ are given in terms of calibrated air speed .
Looking at the hurricane manuals for a few airports , evacuating flyable aircraft to a safer location tends to be the most common choice . From the <URL> Effective with the issuance of a Storm WARNING and/or Hurricane WARNING : Relocate flyable aircraft to other geographical areas , place under suitable shelter , or secure as appropriate . Also , from the <URL> Upon receipt of a Hurricane Warning , Airside Operations will : Initiate evacuation of all flyable aircraft and post Airfield Operations Senior Agents and Agents in detail to insure compliance and report results .
There have been quite a few incidents . Here 's one , <URL> Google will find others . I ca n't find links , but do know that there have been incidents caused by different issues such as ground locks not in place , failed struts , WoW logic failures and so on where when hydraulic power was applied , the gear retracted or collapsed .
The simple fact is that an unintended gear deployment could be catastrophic , as it has a profound impact on the flight dynamics of the aircraft ( one of the reasons there are warnings for both retraction and extension ) . The benefits would be marginal as checking gear down is part of the bread-and-butter procedures for all retractable gear aircraft . Keep in mind adding some automation to an aircraft has far ranging impact , just off the top of my head adding automatic gear mechanism would require : Standardization of the automation Modification of procedures Training of pilots , and then re-certification of pilots Training of maintenance crews , and then re-certification of the crews Possible change to the maintenance schedule of aircraft Certification of the new system by the regulator and you would still need a backup / redundant system ; and now you are back to the manual controls . I can imagine this being implemented in remote piloted or autonomous aircraft though ; as an additional workload relief .
The ILS is <URL> . The ground based bits The vertical range is 1.4 ° ( 0.7 ° above glideslope , 0.7 ° below ) and the horizontal varies , but is a maximum of 6 ° wide . What this means in terms of how many feet or meters off the centerline an aircraft is varies depending on where the aircraft is on the approach , but it 's generally correct to say that the closer an aircraft gets to the ILS antennae , the more precise the system is . The specifications for a localizer antenna require that it be no less precise than ± 10.5 m - this is for a Cat I approach , and it gets correspondingly more precise as the category increases . There 's always the risk of interference with the transmitters ; as noted in the comments , accidents have been caused by airport vehicles parked in the ILS critical area , interfering with the signals , and as the equipment ages it can require recalibration . The airborne bits It 's possible for receivers to have issues that could affect precision ; antennas can get loose connections or become covered in ice , while pilots might interpret indications incorrectly , misread reverse sensing , or <URL> . Regarding accidents You 're correct - there are many accidents related to landing operations . That said , you may be including those which were n't flying an ILS approach - it 's hard to say since you are n't citing anything . Still , it 's possible that there 's confusion between navigation precision and safety of flight . Many ( not all ) of landing accidents involving instrument approaches do center around human error rather than equipment failure ; pilots tuning in the wrong frequency or incorrectly setting avionics and instruments ( reversing the inbound course on an HSI causes reverse sensing , that sort of thing ) , or people on the ground screwing up .
APUs are like small jet engines , small enough to be started electrically . So you would use the power of the battery or an electric ground power cart to spin up the APU by its electric starter motor , and then introduce fuel into it once its spinning fast enough , just like a jet engine is started . Depending on the design , the electric motor will then either act as a generator to supply electrical power back to the aircraft or decouple when a separate generator is used . The APU will spin up , and besides spinning the electric generator , some pressurized air will be ' stolen ' from its compressor to supply " bleed air " for engine starting , the air conditioning packs , etc. . . Big APUs like on the Boeing 777 have actually two methods of starting : They have both an air-driven and an electric driven starter motor . The method of operation is as follows : When the APU is started with the engines off , electrical power from battery or ground connection is used . After the flight , the APU will be restarted before the main engines are turned off . In that case , the APU will be started by the air-driven motor rather than the electric motor , with pressurized air supplied by the still-running main engines . EDIT to answer question in comment : Depending on size , the APU will take something between 30seconds and 2 minutes to start . The big APU of the 777 will deliver electrical power after 2 minutes or so , small units you are likely to find on regional jets can do that after perhaps 45 seconds . Then , it takes an additional 2-4 minutes until you can extract bleed air from it . That is because taking air from the compressor increases the exhaust gas temperature of the APU , and you want the APU to warm up evenly . The same is true for the shutdown process : You close the bleed-air valve and then let the APU continue to run for another two minutes or so to cool down , then shut it off completely . This lowers the thermal stress on the unit . On modern planes like the 777 this process is automated : You turn the APU selector switch to OFF and that will close the bleed air valve , initiate a 2 minute cooldown period , and eventually turn off the APU completely . The only way to shut it down immediately is in fact the APU FIRE handle . So , you will turn the APU on typically while you are taxiing in after landing . Because of course you want it to be up and running and ready to take over the air conditioning by the time you are at the gate . Some APUs like those found on the MD-80s have two settings for bleed air extraction : NORM and ECON . ECON takes less bleed air , thus not increasing the exhaust gas temperature of the APU too much . On particularly hot days , using the APU bleed in ECON might help not overheating the APU if it is to be used for an extended period of time .
Ideally , fiber composites are bonded and connected by a <URL> . The scarf ratio is determined by the ratio of <URL> and the shear strength of the resin . If your fiber takes 3000 N/mm ² , the resin transmits 20 N/mm ² and the fiber content is 60 % , the ratio is 1:90 , so a 1 mm thick composite layer would need to be joined over a length of 90 mm . In reality , such a ratio is impractical to achieve , so lap joints are used when accepted by the certification authorities . This is the case for for composite gliders , where you will find both scarf and lap joints . In the early days of powered composite aircraft , fiber composites were seen with the experience of aluminium in mind , and treated with the same methods . Therefore , the <URL> and its contemporaries had to use rivet joints throughout the structure . The idea was that by riveting the airframe could be more easily disassembled for inspection and repairs . Riveting carbon fiber composites is quite problematic : You need to use expensive titanium fasteners because aluminium rivets would quickly corrode when in electrical contact to the electrochemically much nobler carbon fibers . Drilling and countersinking holes cuts the very fibers which you try to connect , so you have to double up on wall thickness what is destroyed by the riveting . But the FAA still insisted on rivets - even stringers on panels were riveted , when bonding would had been the most sensible solution . Aircraft engineers have an expression for composites that are treated like metal : Black Aluminum . The LearFan was pure Black Aluminum . Many of the engineers in this project ended up with Beech when they produced the <URL> , so many of the same techniques were transferred as well . At least , the Starship had a fuselage shell which was laid up on a mandrill and then cut right aft of the cockpit section to get the mandrill out . The splicing of the two fuselage sections was then done by a tapered lap joint ; if you want , a practical way of making a not-quite scarf joint . Today we have a new generation of engineers who slowly accept that the nature of composite structures requires their own methods of treatment . But you will still find riveted joints even in modern composites structures . Old habits are hard to break .
I will answer this for the US as that is the jurisdiction I know best . There are no airspace or ATC usage fees here in the US . The airspace and its resources are free for any plane of any size that conforms to the <URL> and is legal to fly in a given airspace . The <URL> for aircraft that fly through our airspace but neither land nor depart from the US . The only fee ( somewhat indirectly related but not a component of the airspace its self ) is for planes coming in from abroad who will need to pay <URL> . Strictly speaking you may be required to carry IFR charts or VFR charts on board to conduct the flight in question in US airspace . These must be <URL> . The FAA maintains them but the Pilot must pay for them . <URL> and they were purchased directly from them but this is no longer the case . If you extend the question to include airports the answer will drastically change for the US .
Assuming that the pilots have tried everything possible and the gear just does not like to come down : The general rule is to find a long runway , touch down as slow as possible . Here are sections extracted from Boeing 777 's Flight Crew Training Manual : Dumping fuel If time and conditions permit , reduce weight as much as possible by burning off or jettisoning fuel to attain the slowest possible touchdown speed . Elevator After touchdown lower the nose gently before losing elevator effectiveness . Rudder At touchdown speed , the rudder has sufficient authority to provide directional control in most configurations . Speedbrakes ( ... ) speedbrakes should be extended only when stopping distance is critical . Extending the speedbrakes ( ... ) may compromise controllability of the airplane . Reverse Thrust ( ... ) an engine making ground contact could suffer sufficient damage such that the reverse mechanism may not operate . Selecting reverse thrust ( ... ) may produce an additional asymmetric condition that makes directional control more difficult . Reverse thrust should be used only when stopping distance is critical . Landing technique The technique varies with the combination of failure . If one side of the main gears is missing , land the plane to the side of runway which corresponds to the extended main gear . I.e. if the left gear is down and right gear is up , land on the left side of the runway instead of centerline . Maintain wings level for as long as possible , and be prepared to brake on the left side to maintain directional control . If all the gears decide to hide in the gears bay , land on centerline and use rudder to maintain directional control . Rudder is effective until airspeed drops too low . After landing Evacuate the aircraft as necessary !
I do n't think that the article suggests " pilots are using ILS for landing only in bad whether conditions " . it simply says that under foggy ( i.e. in bad weather ) , ILS is used as visual approach is not possible . The use of ILS is at the discretion of pilots with ATC permission . The ILS localiser and glideslope can still be used as a reference during the visual approach ( even if the landing is not ILS ) . The decision is the pilots ' as the visual indicators and glideslope may not match . While it is true that ILS is much more precise and safer , you are forgetting the human factor - the pilot may want to ' fly ' the aircraft rather than letting the computer do it .
While there probably is an " ideal " attitude to impact water , and it would be nice to crash-land with exactly the correct attitude ... it 's very much a secondary consideration . By far the most important thing , when landing on water , is to land slowly . As such , your aim should be to land ( / crash ) with whatever attitude gives the lowest possible ground speed/descent rate at the point of impact . If that means a " normal " flare , do a normal flare . If that means a harsher flare with a tail strike , do that instead . The point is that you 're in an emergency situation , and your biggest priority is to get the speed right : you likely do n't have the luxury of trying to fine-tune your angle of impact and flare . Additionally , you always have the risk of over-flaring and stalling into the water instead , which is a worse end result . So yes , it may - with some airframes - be beneficial to have a tail strike , but you 're far better off just keeping the aircraft under the best control possible and reducing your speed as far as possible

Does a type rating give a person the privileges of an instrument rating in any category or class of aircraft which he/she is certificated in ?
61.63 ( d ) ( 1 ) requires that if you do n't have an ATP that you hold an instrument rating to obtain a type rating . The type rating itself does not grant instrument privileges . ( d ) Additional aircraft type rating . Except as provided under paragraph ( d ) ( 6 ) of this section , a person who applies for an aircraft type rating or an aircraft type rating to be completed concurrently with an aircraft category or class rating -- ( 1 ) Must hold or concurrently obtain an appropriate instrument rating , except as provided in paragraph ( e ) of this section . Paragraph ( e ) exempts aircraft incapable of instrument maneuvers and instrument flight from this requirement . This does mean that you can do the instrument checkride concurrent with the type rating . If your hypothetical PP-ASEL gets typed in a citation , he will end up with a PP-ASEL with instrument airplane rating and the citation type .
There are several model variations of that type engine . Refer to the <URL> . You will find listed the specific model number numbers and thrust for each approved engine . For example , here are the CFM engine models approved for specific model/serial numbers of the 737 . You will have to get the latest revision of the TCDS for new models , like the 737 MAX . This excerpt from the 737 TCDS shows the model variety of one type engine ( the CFM56-7B ) as approved for certain 737s : <URL>
Yes , a hot air balloon would change class , if you are adding an engine and propeller to provide thrust . With powered flight comes the need to provide some form of flight control ; at this point , you have an airship , albeit a <URL> . According to the FAA 's <URL> , and much like @voretaq7 's citation in another answer : An airship is an engine-driven , lighter-than-air aircraft , that can be steered . The FAA has a whole section on <URL> , for further reading .
It is a turbo charged piston aircraft ( much like turbo charged car , the engine is somewhat similar to that <URL> ( think <URL> ) ) . <URL> is generally short for Turbine-Propeller which is a propeller aircraft powered by a turbine engine . Turbo charged piston aircraft are piston driven engines with a turbo charger , many often may carry the T or TC designation after the model number . Such as the <URL> or <URL> In this case we can reference the <URL> Airframe &amp; Powerplant <URL> 315 HP Turbocharged Engine
This is explained in the <URL> ( page A-18 ) : Instrument Proficiency Check If a person fails to meet the experience requirements of section 61.57 ( c ) , a pilot may only establish instrument currency through an instrument proficiency check as described in section 61.57 ( d ) . An FSTD may be used as part of an approved curriculum to accomplish all or portions of this check . If specified in its LOA , an AATD may be used to complete most of the required Tasks . However , the circling approach , the landing Task , and the multiengine airplane Tasks must be accomplished in an aircraft or FFS ( Level B , C , or D ) . A BATD can not be used for an instrument proficiency check . Please see the Task Table in Appendix 5 for additional information . ( Appendix 5 , Instrument Proficiency Check Table ) . To summarize : If the simulator is an approved FFS , you can do the whole IPC in it If the simulator is an approved AATD , you can do everything except circling , landing and multi-engine tasks Otherwise , you need to use an aircraft
The answer to this lies in <URL> . In most cases , yes the type rating " upgrades " or " elevates " along with your license since the type rating is always evaluated at ATP standards , even if you only have a private or commercial certificate . Exceptions are type ratings for single-engine airplanes and type ratings that have a " VFR ONLY " restriction . 8900.1 excerpt : 5-710 PILOT CERTIFICATE LEVEL AND CATEGORY AND CLASS RATING . The following category and class rating ( s ) for which the applicant has qualified on the original or subsequent ATP practical tests are entered on the ATP certificate . A. Addition of Lighter-than-Air and Glider Class Ratings . A lighter-than-air or glider category rating may be added to an existing ATP certificate ; however , the rating may be added only at the recreational , private , or commercial pilot certificate level , as appropriate to the practical test completed . There is no provision for the original issuance of an ATP certificate with a lighter-than-air or glider category rating . B. Type Ratings . Type rating tests are conducted to the ATP standard for all grades of pilot certificate . Therefore , all type ratings in that category and class of aircraft for which the practical test is conducted in are upgraded after successful completion of the practical test . For example , a person who holds B-737 , DC-3 , and SK-62 type ratings on his or her commercial pilot certificate , and later satisfactorily completes an ATP practical test in a CE-750 , would have his/her B-737 and DC-3 type ratings elevated up to the ATP certificate . The SK-62 would not elevate up because the practical test was in a multiengine airplane . However , when the person satisfactorily completes an ATP practical test in a helicopter , the SK-62 would then elevate up to the ATP certificate . Therefore , all of the type ratings held on the superseded certificate carry forward at the new certificate level within category and class . NOTE : A type rating for a single-engine airplane may not be upgraded to the ATP level . 1 ) Except for type ratings and , under some circumstances , the instrument rating , other ratings indicated on the superseded pilot certificate are carried forward at the commercial , private , or recreational pilot certificate level , as indicated on the superseded certificate . 2 ) Instrument rating privileges are shown on the ATP certificate only if the ATP practical test was conducted under visual flight rules ( VFR ) only , or to retain instrument privileges that were held on the superseded certificate for a category of aircraft other than the one used for the ATP practical test . C. Type Rating Limited to VFR . A type rating bearing the limitation " VFR ONLY " may be added to an existing certificate other than an ATP certificate under the provisions of § 61.63 ( e ) . This limitation may be added to an aircraft type rating not capable of instrument maneuvers or procedures required on a practical test . The practical test must be administered under the appropriate ATP PTS for an aircraft type rating limited to " VFR ONLY " . A type rating bearing the limitation " VFR ONLY " may be added to an existing ATP certificate under the provisions of § 61.157 ( g ) . The practical test must be administered under the appropriate ATP PTS for an aircraft type rating limited to " VFR ONLY . " NOTE : There is no provision for taking an initial practical test for an ATP certificate in an aircraft that would require a VFR limitation .
Just call up ATC on the approach frequency and request flight following to see the location you 're interested in . They 'll assign you a transponder code and any restrictions . For example : N12345 : " Houston approach , VFR request for Cessna 12345 " Houston TRACON : " Cessna 345 , say request " N12345 : " Cessna 12345 is at 1200 ft , 3 miles south of Houston Executive , requesting flight following to overfly the Greenway Plaza area for sightseeing , aircraft type is a Charlie 172 slant Golf . " Houston TRACON : " Cessna 345 , squawk 4123 . " N12345 : " squawk 4123 for Cessna 345 " Houston TRACON : " Cessna 345 , radar contact . Cleared into Bravo , maintain at or below 3,500 , remain north of the University , advise when your sightseeing is complete . " N12345 : " Cessna 345 is cleared into Bravo . Will remain at or below 3,500 and north of the University . Will advise when complete . " Notice that it is preferred that you do n't give your entire VFR request in the initial callup to avoid overwhelming the controllers if they 're busy or not yet prepared to copy your entire request . Just ask for " VFR request " with your callsign and wait for them to ask for the details .
Wind direction mostly , planes take off best when facing in the wind as that means free airspeed so the takeoff roll is shorter . In busier airspace ( with multiple towered airports ) each airport coordinates the corridors so they do n't intersect depending on available runways , prevailing winds and relative demands on the airports . It is possible that it is dictated by noise abatement measures so night time flights pass over a nearby forest rather than wake up the capital .
The idle speed adjustment in any engine is to control the minimum RPM that an engine reaches , in other words how quickly it will run with the throttle all the way off . You want the idle speed to be high enough that the engine will not stop running when the throttle is pulled back , but not so high that it wastes fuel . On a carbureted engine the idle speed is typically adjusted using a set screw which allows a mechanic to quickly adjust the idle speed . This would be done when the airplane is serviced as part of its regular maintenance , or out of the service cycle if there 's a reported problem . The idle speed adjustment is unrelated to the mixture control and is not adjustable in flight .
If you mean a <URL> , then it 's easy . Airliners <URL> , so the longest range ones would typically have the longest endurance . The longest range airliners currently are the <URL> and the <URL> . The Wikipedia article <URL> may be of interest . This may or may not assist in your story , but there are two ways to increase the endurance : Fly slower , and/or Shut down one engine and increase the power of the other ( s ) 1 . Both 1 and 2 may require flying lower , and both will hurt the range . 1 Explained in the last part of <URL> , but in short it 's because jet engines have the lowest fuel flow per unit thrust when they are running at near their maximum continuous thrust setting .
After looking through the FAR 's , the answer is no , the rear passenger seat can not be occupied by somebody claiming to be a " safety pilot " . <URL> : ( c ) No person may operate a civil aircraft in simulated instrument flight unless -- ( 1 ) The other control seat is occupied by a safety pilot who possesses at least a private pilot certificate with category and class ratings appropriate to the aircraft being flown . ( 2 ) The safety pilot has adequate vision forward and to each side of the aircraft , or a competent observer in the aircraft adequately supplements the vision of the safety pilot ; and ( Emphasis Mine ) So the safety pilot basically has to be able to access the controls and have vision that supplements the pilot , meaning must be able to see as well as the pilot position would .
Statistically , there has got to be graphs you can combine to show the number of airplane crashes to fatalities and a graph with skydives ( without a chute/malfunctions ) to fatalities . I 'd venture to say that the odds are far greater to surviving an airplane crash than a freefall . Let 's look at the factors ... A freefall : your velocity in not slowed by anything your body is not protected by anything you have no control on where to ' crash ' A crash landing : passengers are slowed greatly by the aircraft passengers are greatly protected physically ( airframes are designed to minimize risks from explosions , shrapnel , and crash G 's ) there is a greater chance the aircraft can be controlled somewhat to crash in the best place . The only time it would be better to jump without a parachute is if you are <URL> or the aircraft is about to be <URL> .
No , you can not . <URL> : ( c ) Instrument experience . Except as provided in paragraph ( e ) of this section , a person may act as pilot in command under IFR or weather conditions less than the minimums prescribed for VFR only if : [ instrument currency requirements ] To accept an IFR clearance as PIC , even in VMC , you must be instrument current .
For a foreigner to come to USA to learn to fly , one would need an <URL> or <URL> visa . <URL> provides some information . You can get more information on <URL> 1 . Also , you can look at this meta question : <URL> Update : It appears that you are already in the US on <URL> visa ( it was n't mentioned in the question ) , you need to go through the security clearances mentioned in <URL> ( official version on <URL> ) . AOPA has put together the related information ( <URL> ) . I also found about <URL> 1 which has outlined the process . If you search on Google about Alien Flight Student Program , you will find a ton of information . 1 : Disclaimer I am not advertising any flight school .
Really depends on what you are flying , what 's growing , what season and what the roads are like . Our Cessnas have used gravel roads a couple of times , either due to problems aloft or at the airport ( bad weather ) . In the Alberta prairies finding a side road to land on is no problem whatsoever . 100 and 200-series Cessnas have fairly narrow fixed gear that can take an amazing amount of abuse , do n't know about other types . A real cornfield , with the corn fully grown , will destroy a light aircraft . The plants are 2-3m high with a hard , heavy log of corn at the top . Hit a couple of thousand of them at 100km/h ... ( Skydiving centers in corn country have firm advice for landing in the corn : keep your legs crossed . ) Ripe canola is also nearly 2m high and is a bushy plant interwoven with it 's neighbors . You 'll probably flip over forward . Wheat is the best choice .
ARINC Specification 664 calls for quadrax cable or fiber optic cable . Quadrax is a four conductor matched impedance ( 100 ohm ) cable . Connectors are MIL-DTL-38999 . <URL> <URL> The primary benefit is improved EMI protection and ruggedized connectors . The B787 uses fiber optic . A380 uses the quadrax cable .
Airbus used standard Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010 CPUs with 2.5 MiB of memory in the FBW system for A320 . Exactly the same chips that were used for computers at the time ( around 1985 ) so they were not expensive and were already tested . Over time they upgraded to newer version of those CPUs . Each computer is composed from two boards with different CPUs , one produces the control output and the other verifies it and shuts the unit down if they disagree . The boards run different standard embedded operating systems and the software was written by two independent teams to minimize risk of the same failure mode in both boards . Each board only does a little bit of work and the important units have backups . There are 4 units processing the sidestick input , 3 controlling elevator and ailerons , 3 controlling spoilers and elevator trim , IIRC 2 for yaw damper ( FAC ) , 2 for each engine digital control , 1 for each display etc. . The requirements did n't really increase much since then . It is still desired that the tasks are split across many independent boards to minimize effects of one of them failing . So a CPU with few MHz clock rate and few MB of memory would still be able to do the job . But such slow chips are not manufactured anymore , so they are probably using whatever was most common chips few years ago .
While there is not a specific physical system dedicated to instrument departures per se , there are procedures that rely upon instrument flight rules ( IFR ) navigation equipment that ensure obstacle clearance when departing from an airport in instrument meteorological conditions ( IMC ) . From the <URL> 5-2-8 . Instrument departure procedures are preplanned instrument flight rule ( IFR ) procedures which provide obstruction clearance from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure . There are two types of DPs , Obstacle Departure Procedures ( ODPs ) , printed either textually or graphically , and Standard Instrument Departures ( SIDs ) , always printed graphically . All DPs , either textual or graphic may be designed using either conventional or RNAV criteria . RNAV procedures will have RNAV printed in the title , e.g. , SHEAD TWO DEPARTURE ( RNAV ) . ODPs provide obstruction clearance via the least onerous route from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure . ODPs are recommended for obstruction clearance and may be flown without ATC clearance unless an alternate departure procedure ( SID or radar vector ) has been specifically assigned by ATC . Graphic ODPs will have ( OBSTACLE ) printed in the procedure title , e.g. , GEYSR THREE DEPARTURE ( OBSTACLE ) , or , CROWN ONE DEPARTURE ( RNAV ) ( OBSTACLE ) . Standard Instrument Departures are air traffic control ( ATC ) procedures printed for pilot/controller use in graphic form to provide obstruction clearance and a transition from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure . SIDs are primarily designed for system enhancement and to reduce pilot/controller workload . ATC clearance must be received prior to flying a SID . All DPs provide the pilot with a way to depart the airport and transition to the en route structure safely . Pilots operating under 14 CFR Part 91 are strongly encouraged to file and fly a DP at night , during marginal Visual Meteorological Conditions ( VMC ) and Instrument Meteorological Conditions ( IMC ) , when one is available . The following paragraphs will provide an overview of the DP program , why DPs are developed , what criteria are used , where to find them , how they are to be flown , and finally pilot and ATC responsibilities . There are many details involved in actually using these procedures to make safe departures in IMC . The <URL> is an excellent resource for pilots who want to review these procedures , what they provide and how to use them correctly . Here is an example of an ODP from my home airport , KCRG . There are some very tall towers less than 10 nautical miles from the airport . They are enormous and easy to avoid under visual conditions , but when IMC prevails these procedures are absolutely life-saving with such large obstructions nearby . They are taken from this <URL> . Here is an example of a SID . These are always graphically depicted and will usually be found at larger airports . Here are pages <URL> and <URL> of the full SID .
They are basically window-shaped screens , displaying a feed from a camera so the middle aisle suits ( where the alternative is a wall ) passengers can enjoy the " view " . The most interesting thing to me are the virtual windows . First Class passengers in the middle suite will have a set of " windows " like everyone else , only theirs will show images from an outside camera . <URL>
You have confused a turboprop engine with a turbocharged engine . They are very different and have very little in common . A turboprop engine is powered by a turbine engine geared to a propeller . Turbine engines have less power available at higher altitudes so answer " A " is correct . A turbocharged engine is a piston engine which is fitted with a small compressor driven by exhaust gas pressure . The compressor ( turbocharger ) can increase manifold pressure to restore sea level power at altitude . ( Turbo-normalized ) A turbo charger can also supply greater than sea level manifold pressure for more power . ( turbo-supercharged ) Both types of turbocharged piston engines can maintain full rated power as they climb , but they will eventually reach a limit where full power can no longer be maintained .

What kind of malfunction is an " artificial horizon " ?
Best bet is that there was an issue with the artificial horizon . If it was on an older aircraft without a glass cockpit , the gyro or its gimbal was probably broken causing the face to ' float ' around or just stick at an odd angle . Then it was then communicated poorly to you by someone . Other than that I have never heard of a " floating horizon " and a google search does n't yield any results either .
There are generally two ways of determining the ground speed from within the aircraft . The first is by using an inertial navigation system . This consists of a number of accelerometers and gyroscopes that measure all accelerations and rotations of the aircraft throughout a flight . By mathematically integrating all measurements this navigation system is able to compute the speed and position of the aircraft at any time . The accuracy will degrade over time but ground speed is usually not far off , otherwise position would be far off very soon . The second method uses external radio signals . Nowadays this is mostly GPS , but ground speed is also determined by using a number of VOR ( VHF Omnidirection Range ) and/or DME ( Distance Measuring Equipment ) stations . These navigation beacons are widely available over most continents . A navigation computer would select the right set of beacons and by analysing the rate of change of the beacon bearings / distances the aircraft 's speed can be determined . Modern navigation systems combine all these methods into a one solution . GPS , inertial navigation and DME measurements are then fused mathematically together to obtain a highly accurate and robust position and ground speed .
After some digging , I found an answer for myself : yes , some FBW airliners use artificial feel systems , but not all of them . According to <URL> , The [ Boeing ] 777 fly-by-wire system employs envelope protection . This feature of the artificial-feel system provides increasingly greater force when the aircraft is pushed to its limits . Conversely , Airbus does not provide any feedback to the pilots as their flight control system enforces control laws that can not be overridden by inputs ( source : <URL> ) : The positioning of the control surfaces is no longer a simple reflection of the pilot 's control inputs and conversely , the natural aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft are not fed back directly to the pilot . Getting regulatory , since I did some further research : 14 CFR 29.395 , certification of Transport Category aircraft , only <URL> ( i.e. , not break ) . This differs from how much force is required to " achieve the positive limit maneuvering load factor " or otherwise impart changes to the aircraft 's orientation ( <URL> / <URL> ) .
Birds regularly experience up 10-14 G according to this <URL> After looking at how birds and insects fly , scientists came up with the conclusion as to how birds cope with this is because : Animals will always have some advantages over machines , such as the ability to use their nervous systems to sense subtleties about the environment around them and alter their flight accordingly . further up near the top , it mentions comparisons between birds and high performance military aircraft , such as this : A Blackbird jet flying nearly 2,000 mph covers 32 of its own body lengths per second . But a common pigeon covers 75 of its body lengths a second . The roll rate of the aerobatic A-4 Skyhawk plane is about 720 degrees per second . The roll rate of a barn swallow is more than 5,000 degrees per second . Some military aircraft can withstand gravitational forces of 8-10 G ( Earth 's gravity is equal to 1 G ) . Many birds routinely experience G-forces greater than 10 G and up to 14 G . According to another <URL> the reason humans ca n't cope with high g 's as well is because : Every bit of our muscular-skeletal system is naturally crafted to deal with Earth 's gravity . Were you to travel to a planet that had a more significant gravity , a more massive planet with 5 G 's for example , you would either be unable to lift yourself off the ground , our the new weight-force would be so much that the air would be forced out of your lungs and your eyes would explode ( something gruesome for sure ) .
The answer is a qualified yes : It 's theoretically possible , but wholly impractical to provide a pressure source to your gyros from within the cockpit , at least the way you 're describing . Air-Driven gyros require a relatively constant pressure differential somewhere between 4 and 6 inches of mercury to operate correctly ( this can be " suction " or " pressure " , but as vacuum/suction systems are more common let 's stick with that term ) . We can split the difference and say we want to supply 5 inches of vacuum ( which is usually right in the middle of the " green arc " for most vacuum gauges ) - this is sufficient suction to keep the rotor spinning at an appropriate RPM so the instruments function as expected . Because a constant vacuum is required we can kill off one of the options : You wo n't be able to suck air through a straw to do this -- you would be constantly over-speeding or under-speeding the gyro rotor as you produce either too much vacuum ( inhaling ) or not enough ( when you have to let go of the straw to exhale ) . The variable pressure would vary the rotor speed , and your instruments would be totally unreliable within a few breaths , defeating the purpose of the exercise . A household vacuum can provide the necessary pressure differential ( <URL> tell me that " An average vacuum will have a [ suction ] rating of around 80 inches of water " , which Google tells me is around 5.9 inches of mercury . If you could hook the vacuum up to the aircraft 's system downstream of the vacuum regulator ( where the main vacuum pump hooks up ) you could theoretically power your gyros normally . There are some caveats to using a vacuum cleaner idea besides the obvious " How are you going to hook the vacuum up to the system ? " question : The vacuum cleaner specifications are presumably at or near sea level - they might not be able to provide adequate suction at higher altitudes . Powering the vacuum cleaner in this scenario is left as an exercise for the reader ( most aircraft with air-driven gyros do n't have household AC power in the cockpit - you could install an inverter , but vacuums pull quite a lot of power , so you 'd need a high-amperage circuit to supply it . The draw from the vacuum may exceed the capacity of the plane 's electrical system , and to remedy that we 're getting into complicated major alterations ... ) There are other more practical alternatives to an engine-driven vacuum pump to consider if you 're worried about the reliability of your vacuum source : <URL> makes a standby vacuum system that ties into the engine intake . For normally-aspirated engines this works well as long as the engine is operating at part throttle : The manifold pressure differential is sufficient that it can supply suction for your gyros . The downside is that you ca n't guarantee a stable vacuum source : at full throttle there will probably not be sufficient suction to operate the gyros ( particularly at altitude ) . Pneumatic venturi tubes can be used to supply vacuum for aircraft in flight . These are bolted on to the airframe and use the slipstream air moving through a venturi to create the necessary vacuum . In extremely slow flight these may also fail to provide adequate vacuum . Electric standby vacuum pumps are a popular option as they offer you the ability to keep using your main vacuum instruments regardless of throttle position or airspeed . The primary drawbacks are weight , space ( for the installation ) , and power to run the motor . Electric gyro instruments are a popular option ( though somewhat expensive ) : They provide a backup for the air-driven system using an independent power source .
Most accidents are referred to by flight number It depends who it is that is referring to the accident , and on who they are addressing . News media and the general public Newpapers and other media use flight numbers because that is the number known to friends and relatives of the individuals concerned and because most members of the public who have flown as passengers are very familiar with the concept of flight numbers but not really familiar with aircraft registration numbers . Investigators Investigating authorities have their own numbering schemes for accidents they investigate . Aircraft registration numbers change when an aircraft is sold to a purchaser based in another country . The only number that stays with an aircraft for its entire life is the manufacturer 's serial number . All these numbers can appear in official accident investigations reports . The registration number is usually prominent . <URL> <URL> <URL>
Q : Could it fly between any two suitable airports on Earth , i.e. further than 20038km ? A : Not likely <URL>
You are right , the horizontal tail of a conventional airplane appears to have a higher incidence , but the actual angle of attack is smaller than that of the wing . The wing , flying ahead of the tail , produces downwash , so the flow at the tail location has a distinct downward component . The downwash angle can be calculated from the lift coefficient and the geometry of the aircraft : To simplify things , let 's assume the wing is just acting on the air with the density $ \ rho $ flowing with the speed $ v $ through a circle with a diameter equal to the span $ b $ of the wing . If we just look at this stream tube , the mass flow is $ $ \ frac { dm } { dt } = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v $ $ Lift $ L$ is then the impulse change which is caused by the wing and equal to weight . With the downward air speed $ v_z $ imparted by the wing , lift is : $ $ L = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v \ cdot v_z = S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho $ $ $ S$ is the wing area and $ c_L $ the overall lift coefficient . If we now solve for the vertical air speed , we get $ $ v_z = \ frac { S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho } { \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v } = \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L \ cdot v } { \ pi \ cdot AR } $ $ with $ AR = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { S } $ the aspect ratio of the wing . Now we can divide the vertical speed by the air speed to calculate the angle by which the air has been deflected by the wing . Let 's call it $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { v_z } { v } \ right ) = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ A typical airliner cruise lift coefficient is 0.4 , and a typical aspect ratio is around 8 : This results in a downwash angle of nearly 2 ° if the lift distribution over span is elliptical . In reality , it is more triangular-shaped , so the downwash angle is larger near the center of the aircraft . Note that the engine nacelles of the <URL> are tilted 3 ° up to align them with the local flow . The resulting angle of attack is lower by those 3 ° , and if the angle of attack difference between wing and tail is less than that , the tail surface will appear angled upward . To achieve static stability , the tail will have to fly at a slightly <URL> .
Note : I am focusing on model of height-to-pressure relation in atmosphere , altimeter tries to follow and its limits of the model . There are , of course , limits of each particular instrument too , see answer by @ymb1 . [ EDIT : I have added more details on various uses of altitude and some more details what could be the limit for measuring absolute altitude ( it is not how thin air becomes , in fact ) , hope it answers your question better . ] Uses for altimeter reading Height displayed by common mechanical altimeter should be pressure converted according to the <URL> . This model makes few simplifications ( see the linked document for ex . ) , so it actually never gives exact height , except by chance . But as you are saying , it is anyway quite good approximation . When you are flying , there is few different reasons why you would need to look on altimeter . Obstacle avoidance , landing and maybe calculating final glide in glider . In this case it is really absolute height over terrain you need to know . To get this value you have to start with obtaining QNH , so already now altimeter itself is not enough ( in any altitude ) without external data . For greater precision you have to add more external data . You start with local temperature , but even then precision would be limited . The magnitude of error does not depend on your absolute altitude though , but ( in first approximation ) on height difference between airplane and station/place your QNH comes from . So you are lucky if you want to land . Given QNH comes from that particular airfield , your altimeter should read exact value just on touchdown . If you need to avoid obstacles at similar altitude , error will be likely acceptable for practical use . Again , it is not absolute altitude but relative difference what is causing this error . If you set QNH ( or runway altitude ) on airfield located 4000 ' above sea level and fly down to the see ( let 's say it is possible without traveling far away , so spatial change of air pressure is not an issue here ) , expected error of your altimeter will be similar as if you would fly 4000 feet up . It is because QNH ( pressure at the sea level ) is calculated based on the same model your altimeter is using , so model imperfections cancels out just at the altitude of this reference station . ATC , mid air collisions etc. . Absolute altitude is not important . Instead , you need to be sure that two pilots who see distinct values on their respective altimeters can expect not being at same altitude . For this purpose simplest model with minimum of external parameters works best . As it is of foremost importance that all altimeters involved converts pressure to height in the same way . ( Then , you need to expect pressure does not increase with altitude , but this is quite certain , as there will be always less air mass above you pressing down when you go upwards ) . Absolute altitude is completely unimportant here , or , for flying closer to terrain simple QNH-based offset will do . ( Otherwise STD pressure setting is used . ) Even simple altimeter ( in range of its physical limits of measurable pressure ) would work quite well for this purpose in any practical height . Aircraft performance and aerodynamics . That is service ceiling , choosing optimal cruise etc. . These parameters are usually denoted in altitude in a POH , but only for convenience . It is air density what matters for anything aerodynamic related . And air density is air pressure corrected to temperature . So " altitude " provided by pressure-based altimeter is " just right " for this purpose , you can correct it based on local temperature and you have the best possible value . Again , this will work in any height ( as long as POH and altimeter use same conversion between pressure and height ) . Note that for later two uses value provided by altimeter is actually better than , say , GPS-based height . Absolute altitude OK , what if you really want to know your absolute altitude in stratosphere or even higher . Is it possible to use your altimeter then ? If the altimeter converts pressure to height based on ISA ( true in most cases ) , the displayed value should be given by equation $ $ h = \ left ( 153.85 \ , { \ rm m \ cdot K ^ { -1 } } \ right ) \ cdot T_0 \ cdot \ left ( 1 - \ left ( p \ over p_0 \ right ) ^ { 0.19026 } \ right ) $ $ ( see the reference above ) , where $ T_0 $ is specified to be 288.15 K ( 15 ° C ) and $ p_0 $ is pressure you set in altimeter window . So , if you take such altimeter to space ( $ p = 0 $ ) it wo n't display more than 44 km ( or 145,000 feet ) , given it wo n't reach it 's physical/mechanical limits before . But , of course , the value becomes far from reality much earlier . Probably above the tropopause ( 10 -- 12 km ) , where assumption of constant temperature decrease with height used in this ISA model becomes completely invalid . You could improve the model , but it probably wo n't work too well without more external data . Nevertheless , problem is not that the air is thin . You can , in a way , measure air pressure even at low earth orbit few hundreds kilometer above ground
Please use the equations of <URL> . The numbers might be different , but the physics are the same . EDIT : Thanks to D_S for providing the link to the manual . When flown with the maximum allowable load factor of 1.5 g at 80.000 ft ( 48 ° bank ) , the turn radius at Mach 3.2 ( equivalent to v = 953.3 m/s in 80.000 ft ) will be 83.5 km . To be more precise , you will need to add the effects of earth rotation , but for now I leave this away . As you can see , the turn will still need 163 km or 103.7 miles , but not the <URL> which is more than 6 times bigger . To turn this around : A circle at Mach 3.2 which has a diameter of 1092 km requires a bank angle of 9.6 ° . That can hardly be called a turn .
NOTE : This answer is specific to the United States as the question uses an example approach procedure from an airport in the United States . Procedures may vary for other nations . Consult the respective Aeronautical Information Publication for specific guidance . As long as you hear the magic words " cleared approach , " you can begin your descent as soon as you cross the IAF the first time ( while beginning your teardrop maneuver ) and continue to descend to the minimum altitude while in the circuit , which is at or above 2000 for this particular procedure . Note that you MUST be on a published segment of the approach before making your descent , otherwise terrain clearance is not assured . The controller will expect you to proceed from the IF to the FAF after the first circuit is complete ( a course reversal maneuver , if executed counts as the first circuit ) . You must advise the controller if additional circuits are required in order to lose altitude . Also , if the controller clears you for a " straight-in " approach and doing so would result in an excessive descent rate , it is incumbent upon you as the pilot to advise the controller that you are unable .

The answer can be found in Annex 16 of the ICAO , a copy including the noise limits can be found <URL> . Below a little excerpt from the annex : ( a ) For acoustical changes to Stage 1 airplanes , regardless of the number of engines , the noise levels prescribed under § 36.7 ( c ) of this part . What are the ' Chapter 2 ' and ' Chapter 3 ' aircraft noise classifications ? Certificated noise levels for larger aircraft are classified by the ICAO ' Standards and Recommended Practices -- Aircraft Noise : Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation ' into a ) Chapter 2 types , characterised by the noisier , low bypass turbofan aircraft and early high bypass turbofan aircraft , and b ) Chapter 3 types , characterised by the modern , quieter , high bypass turbofan aircraft . Under European legislation , since 2002 , ' Chapter 2 ' aircraft ( of over 34 tonnes maximum take-off weight or with more than 19 seats ) have no longer been allowed to operate at European airports . There are separate noise certification schemes for small propeller aircraft and for helicopters . ( b ) For any Stage 2 airplane regardless of the number of engines : ( 1 ) Flyover : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 5 EPNdB ; the limit is 93 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral and approach : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2 EPNdB ; the limit is 102 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( c ) For any Stage 3 airplane : ( 1 ) Flyover . ( i ) For airplanes with more than 3 engines : 106 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 44,673 pounds or less ; ( ii ) For airplanes with 3 engines : 104 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 63,177 pounds or less ; and ( iii ) For airplanes with fewer than 3 engines : 101 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 106,250 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral , regardless of the number of engines : 103 EPNdB for maximum weight of 882,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 882,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2.56 EPNdB ; the limit is 94 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less .

Briefly , " overhaul " is n't a strictly defined term but it 's generally used to refer to the intensive inspection , maintenance and repair of an aircraft component , frequently - but not exclusively - the engines . The word overhaul by itself is a general term that 's used in all sorts of places but it 's not defined in <URL> , for example . The most specific definition I could find is in <URL> between the FAA and EASA : " Overhaul " means a process that ensures the aeronautical article is in complete conformity with the applicable service tolerances specified in the type certificate holder 's , or equipment manufacturer 's instructions for continued airworthiness , or in the data which is approved or accepted by the Authority . No person may describe an article as being overhauled unless it has been at least disassembled , cleaned , inspected , repaired as necessary , reassembled and tested in accordance with the above-specified data . Note that that definition only mentions " aeronautical articles " , which is very broad indeed and not limited to just engines , airframes or anything else . In the general aviation world , a very common usage of " overhaul " is in the context of piston engines , which have a <URL> ( TBO or TBOH ) set by the manufacturer . Once an engine reaches that number of hours , it needs to be overhauled . But even there , the term is n't precise and the FAA has a circular called Reciprocating Engine Overhaul Terminology and Standards that explains what it usually means : c. Overhaul . In the general aviation industry , the term engine overhaul has two identifications that make a distinction between the degrees of work on an engine : ( 1 ) Major Overhaul . A major overhaul consists of the complete disassembly of an engine . The overhaul facility inspects the engine , repairs it as necessary , reassembles , tests , and approves it for return to service within the fits and limits specified by the manufacturer 's overhaul data . This could be to new fits and limits or serviceable limits . The engine owner should clearly understand what fits and limits should be used when the engine is presented for overhaul . The owner should also be aware of any replaced parts , regardless of condition , as a result of a manufacturer 's overhaul data , SB , or an Airworthiness Directive ( AD ) . ( 2 ) Top Overhaul . Top overhaul consists of repair to parts outside of the crankcase , and can be accomplished without completely disassembling the entire engine . It can include the removal of cylinders , inspection and repair to cylinders , inspection and repair to cylinder walls , pistons , valve-operation mechanisms , valve guides , valve seats , and the replacement of piston and piston rings . All manufacturers do not recommend a top overhaul . Some manufacturers indicate that a powerplant requiring work to this extent should receive a complete overhaul . Apart from that usage , the term <URL> seems to be <URL> in the airline industry to describe maintenance facilities , but there is n't any specific definition that I could find . So there 's no single definition of " overhaul " . It just means that you 've very thoroughly inspected and tested something on an aircraft , whether it 's an engine or a wheel , and you 've verified that it 's fit to be used in flight , i.e. it 's airworthy . The reasons why it 's important are probably obvious ; they 're the same reasons that your car needs regular servicing to run safely , efficiently and reliably .
According to Wikipedia <URL> an American carrier type Kitty Hawk has a catapult capable of accelerating a mass of 35000 kg to 139 knots ( 71,51 m/s ) , and the system 's stroke is 76 m. From the terminal speed and the stroke , a simple calculation gives a mean acceleration of 33,64 m/s/s . Hence , and assuming the acceleration constant along the stroke , the time needed to reach 60 mph = 26,81 m/s is t = v/a = > t = 26,81 / 33.64 = > t = 0,796 seconds ...
<URL> : Airworthiness Directives ( ADs ) are legally enforceable rules issued by the FAA in accordance with 14 CFR part 39 to correct an unsafe condition in a product . 14 CFR part 39 defines a product as an aircraft , aircraft engine , propeller , or appliance . When an aircraft or other component is found to have flaws or other issues , the FAA will issue an AD specifying a solution to be applied to the item . The AD must be complied with , often by a date or total time on the airframe . The action required could simply be an inspection ( often recurring after , say , 100 hours of time in service ) , while in other cases requires modification , strengthening , or replacement of parts . One of the more prominent cases requiring ADs to be issued was the <URL> , which had issues with the tail 's structural integrity under high loads . The cost of complying with an AD falls on the owner/operator of the aircraft . Failing to comply with an AD renders the aircraft unairworthy . It also could incur FAA penalties , but more importantly , it could result in structural damage or failure , and in some cases ultimately cause a fatal accident .
Increasing horizontal stabilizer area increases pitch stability and the permissible range for centre of gravity at the cost of some aerodynamic efficiency . Stability in pitch means that the aircraft tends to maintain constant angle of attack ( which roughly corresponds to maintaining constant speed with pitch ) . An aircraft is stable in pitch if the aft surface flies at lower angle of attack than the front surface ( this applies to both conventional tails and canards ) . Making the horizontal stabilizer larger does the following : The absolute change in lift force on the horizontal stabilizer when angle of attack changes is larger , so the aircraft returns to the trimmed angle of attack faster ( increased stability ) . As centre of gravity moves aft , the difference in angle of attack between the surfaces decreases to keep the plane balanced , reducing pitch stability . If the horizontal stabilizer is larger , the angle of attack changes more slowly for the same change in lift , so the centre of gravity may be permitted further aft before the aircraft becomes not stable enough . As centre of gravity moves forward , the difference of angle of attack between the surfaces increases until angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer exceeds its stall angle of attack and control is lost . If the horizontal stabilizer is larger , it can provide more ( downward ! ) lift before it stalls , so the centre of gravity can be permitted further forward before loosing control authority .
I do n't think there is any regulation on max flying hours , just regulations on <URL> . The <URL> is the most frequent check , and according to Wikipedia : This is performed approximately every 125 flight hours or 200 -- 400 cycles . It needs about 20 -- 50 man-hours and is usually performed overnight at an airport gate or hangar . The actual occurrence of this check varies by aircraft type , the cycle count ( takeoff and landing is considered an aircraft " cycle " ) , or the number of hours flown since the last check . The occurrence can be delayed by the airline if certain predetermined conditions are met . The other checks include : B check - every 4 -- 6 months , requiring about 150 man-hours and is usually performed within 1 -- 3 days at an airport hangar C check - every 20 -- 24 months , requiring about 6000 man-hours , taking 1 to 2 weeks to complete D check - major maintenance check , occuring about every 6 years , requiring 50,000 man hours , generally spanning a couple months . Note that all of these times are approximate , depending on the exact maintenance plan filed by the airline and the aircraft type . Also cycle count may be factored into the maintenance intervals in addition to flight hours so aircraft that do many short-haul flights may have more frequent maintenance . So in any case , only looking at the A checks , if you can land , refuel , service , and get back in the air in 2 hours between 10 hour flights , the plane could stay in the air for 20 hours/day . Every 6 days , it will need some downtime for the A checks , let 's say the airline puts enough people on it to get the check done in 5 hours . So that 's 125 hours per cycle : 120 hours flying , 5 hours in maintenance . They can fit 4.83 of these cycles in a 30 day month so the aircraft could be flying up to 580 hours in any given month ( but that last A check gets deferred to the next month , so that means less time in the air that month . With longer flights ( which reduces the overhead from turnaround times ) and tighter turnaround times , the flight hours per month could be higher . If you really want the maximum for a month , then if you assume 125 hours per maintenance inverval and that the plane is kept in the air as long as possible with 0 turnaround time , that 's around 690 flying hours out of 720 total hours in a month . Of course , this makes a big assumption that the A check interval really is 120 hours , and that the time to do the maintenance is 5 hours , in the real world both numbers will vary based on aircraft , airline , and maintenance staffing levels . Plus , over the longer term , you need to factor the other , less frequent but also more time consuming maintenance checks ( B through D checks ) , as well as allow downtime for unexpected repairs .
It seems you are looking for domestic flights in the US . The FAA database is not public . You can use ADS-B tracking sites to look at the route . Remember instructions after takeoff ( departure and transition ) and before landing ( transition and approach ) are determined late and can be changed , depending on winds and other parameters . E.g. on Flight Aware , for <URL> between LAX and JFK , the route is mentioned : <URL> and can be decoded : <URL> These sites also create <URL> . After a certain number of days , it 's paying .
A Fixed Base Operator ( FBO ) is an entity - usually a commercial company - which provides " aviation services " at an airport . One of the main services they provide is fueling , either full service or a self service pump . They do n't all provide both 100LL and JetA , but most do . Larger ones provide other services , such as catering , lavatory service , pre-flight briefing computers and wifi access , ground power units , and tie down or hangar space for parking . Charges vary from place to place , most large FBOs will charge a fee for aircraft parking , but sometimes waive a day or so of that if you purchase fuel . They can often assist in arranging ground transport or hotels as well . Most are open hours like 7AM - 8PM , but that varies as well . Most self-service pumps can be used 24 hours a day . Some have a " crew car " available to borrow for a short trip to get lunch or run an errand , though calling ahead to check on that is important .
Whether it 's a twin - , tri - , or quad-jet , it very much depends on the aircraft design , airline policy , and conditions such as taxiway slope , contamination , weight , etc. . Read the below example for the Airbus A320 to get an idea : <URL> An example of what can go wrong when taxiing on two out of four engines ( or 1 out of 2 ) is having the aircraft in the wrong configuration . Like what happened on <URL> when the ground engineer had no steering or braking and <URL> : <URL> For the Airbus A380 : <URL> The minimum is a symmetrical two on the A380 ( likewise for the 747 ) . 777 In the 777 it is not allowed . That 's an example of how it depends on the aircraft design . Taxi -- One Engine Because of additional operational procedural requirements and crew workload , taxiing with an engine shut down is not allowed . High bypass engines require warm up prior to applying takeoff thrust and cool down prior to shutting down . If the engine has been shut down for several hours , it is desirable to operate at as low a thrust setting as practicable for several minutes prior to takeoff . Note : Single engine taxi with an inoperative engine is authorized consistent with good judgement . ( Boeing 777 FCOM ) Fuel saving According to this <URL> , the saving is about 4-8 kg of fuel per minute .

What is the working principle of tip jets ?
Tip jets spin the rotor by blowing out compressed air . It 's the same principle as a jet engine or a jet-ski impeller , just that the exhaust is pushed out through the rotors . Some designs even had jet engines on the rotor tips ! The primary advantage of the design are that there is no torque created , so no need for anti-torque rotors or thrusters , the tip jets also increase the rotor 's moment arm and mass , making autorotation safer in some cases , although the drag from the tip jets often slowed the rotors down in many cases . Some say it is easier to learn to fly and safer to fly a tip jet design as there 's no torque . There are very few systems which use tip rotors , the main disadvantages would seem to be a lack of efficiency and drag from the tip jets . The rotor design is complex as high-pressure air must be carried through them , causing many design and materials challenges . Also , lack of a tail rotor means there 's no way to pivot in hover unless unless you put some sort of tail thruster on .
The 737-900ER has ( two ) axillary fuel tanks in the aft cargo compartment , behind the wing ( and center of gravity ) with ~ 3400l capacity for increasing range ( from 2800nm to 3,200 nm ) . In usual conditions , unloading of passengers would n't be a problem as the fuel would 've been used up ; However , as this was an overweight landing with full fuel tanks ( the auxiliary fuel tanks weigh ~ 3t ) , the crew are just being cautious to prevent any incidents .
For the current format , it was 1993 when it was standardized . On July 1 , 1993 , a new , revised Terminal Aerodrome Forecast ( TAF ) format and code replaced the existing TAF code . This new code is in effect in most countries . The exceptions are the United States and Canada . These two countries issue Terminal Forecasts for domestic use and TAFs for the military and those airports serving international aviation . On January 1 , 1996 the U.S. and Canada will convert entirely to the new TAF code . After that date , the new code for weather reports ( METAR ) and TAFs will be used worldwide . The North American code used in the FT ( and SAO ) will be discontinued . Although the new TAF code is being adopted worldwide , each country is allowed to make modifications or exceptions to the code for use in each particular country . The TAF code , as described here , is the one used in the United States for those airports serving international aviation and will also be used after the January 1 , 1996 conversion date . The World Meteorological Organization 's ( WMO ) publication No. 782 " Aerodrome Reports and Forecasts " contains the base METAR and TAF code as adopted by the WMO member countries . ( <URL> ) <URL> also confirms the date for the US . The WMO publication No. 782 can be <URL> .
Oh , but they are all * correct ! First , we have to say that we are not talking about cause here . There is a flow around the wing and it has certain properties and neither is cause of the other ; they are both effects of the flow . What we are talking about here is explanations why every flow that produces lift also produces induced drag . And as far as explanations go , there can be more than one , because the physical theories have a lot of redundancy in them . You can usually arrive at the result by multiple ways . You can use the orientations of the normals ( the <URL> answer ) , you can use laws of conservation of energy and momentum ( <URL> answer ) or you can use the <URL> and that explanation will indeed involve the wake vortices . Because the potential flow theory is a mathematical apparatus for analysing fluid flow as a combination of vortices and from that angle of view , the energy is indeed carried away by the wake vortices . However , the wake vortex explanation has one problem : it is often associated with different misconception , the one that the vortices are caused by transverse flow around the tip and the resulting idea that it can be eliminated by doing something with the tips specifically . But that 's not what the potential flow theory says . According to the potential flow theory , there is a vortex originating from every point along the span and they combine to form the two tip vortices . So like the other explanations , it also clearly says the induced drag is related to any generation of lift . And if you understand that , it is correct . I still consider it unnecessarily more complicated . * All the three you listed that is . The ones that claim the wingtip vortex is caused by transverse flow around the tip are not , because it is n't . The wingtip vortex is just the vortex line of the overall wake ( and should preferably be called wake vortex ) .
All parts of an airliner 's horizontal surface move , not just the rear part . The rear part , called an elevator , can move much faster and is for maneuvering . The forward part , called a ( trimmable ) stabilizer , is for trimming and moves slowly . It is moved in response to changes in loading , speed or flap settings and positions the tail surface such that only small continuous elevator deflections are needed . It does n't need to move fast - high load factors would upset the passengers and overload the structure . <URL> A330 port tailplane root ( picture <URL> ) . Note the markings which show the range of incidence angles covered by the trimmable stabilizer . Benefits of a stabilizer-elevator configuration : Camber : The elevator deflection changes the camber of the airfoil of the tail surface and makes the production of the intended lift change more efficient . If the elevator deflection is supposed to create a downforce , negative camber is produced and vice versa . This reduces the drag which is created in order to maneuver the aircraft . Lower control forces : By moving a smaller surface , less hydraulics power , and on small aircraft , less muscle power is needed for the same moment change than with a full-flying tail or all-moving surface . Makes sense , right ? Better tailoring of the hinge moment derivatives : Two effects are important for getting the control forces right : The change in hinge moment over deflection angle ( $ c _ { r \ eta } $ ) , and the change in hinge moment over angle of attack ( $ c _ { r \ alpha } $ ) . With tabs , the right elevator hinge position , nose shape and control horns , both can be tailored individually , while a full-flying tail or all-moving surface will give the designer less freedom to manipulate both independently . Note that full-flying tails only emerged with hydraulic controls , because only those systems can manage the control forces of all-moving control surfaces at high speed . <URL> Horn balance and overhang balance on control surfaces ( picture <URL> ) Benefits of a full-flying tail surface By avoiding a contour break due to a flap deflection , all-moving control surfaces can avoid the shocks which would otherwise occur at high subsonic speed . This is their main benefit for combat aircraft . At supersonic speed , the uncambered surface will produce less drag , so for supersonic speed the all-moving control surface is more efficient . By moving all of the tail surface at high speed , an all-moving control surface will produce the highest rate of moment change over time possible . To produce also the highest sustained moment change , however , it needs to be larger than a comparable stabilizer-elevator combination because it forfeits the benefits of variable camber . The all-moving control surface has no gaps which could add radar reflections , allowing for a more stealthy design . Lower mechanical complexity . This is somewhat offset by the need for much beefier hydraulics .
This question devolves into two related questions . 1 ) When buying or leasing the plane , what is the most economical plane for this route ( and other routes that the plane may have to fly ) at your airline . One size does not fit all , what is optimal for one leg may be much less desirable for the next . " Economical " includes capital costs , maintenance costs , operating costs , and down-time costs . Are your maintenance facilities proficient on this type plane ? Are your pilots cross trained on this new aircraft ? 2 ) Years later your short term choices are limited to the aircraft in your inventory . What is the best available aircraft for this flight ? For the entire route ? Can this plane fit into the runways at the required airports ? Can the aircraft make the trip without stopping for fuel ? How many passengers have booked this flight in advance ? the questions that need to be considered are many . Short answer : " Oh , I think I 'll fly the Turboprop today " is not how it works . It is a long involved decision considering multiple factors all leading to what user16230 calls efficiency and what I will call profit . Same thing measured differently .
The <URL> is a variant of the Gulfstream V. From <URL> ( November 16 , 2015 ) for the G550 , it costs $ 4,731.05 per hour , give or take . ( Assuming the plane is paid for already . ) Adjusted for <URL> that 's $ 4,825.11 . Note that the GV is older than the G550 , and would generally cost more to operate . This figure includes fuel , maintenance ( parts and labor ) , engine reserves , auxiliary power units if applicable , and miscellaneous expenses to include crew travel , catering and cabin supplies , landing and parking fees -- all boiled down to a single number .
To become an Air Force pilot , you have to be a commissioned officer , there are few ways you can do that . First you can go through the Air Force Academy , which is probably the most common . Another way is to be in an ROTC program through your college of choice . The last way I know of is to graduate college and join the Air Force through the officer candidate school ( OCS ) . Regardless of the method you choose , there are certain requirements you must meet : Be a U.S. Citizen Have any 4 year college degree or be within 365 days of attaining it Minimum 2.5 GPA ( although I 'd be surprised if they took you that low ) Under the age of 28 by the board convening date Have a standing height of 64-77 inches and a sitting height of 34-40 inches Have no history of hay fever , asthma , or allergies after the age of 12 Meet USAF weight and physical conditioning requirements Normal color vision Meet refraction , accommodation , and astigmatism requirements Distance vision can not exceed 20/20 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better Near vision can not exceed 20/40 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better If you 've met those requirements you can then go through the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test ( AFOQT ) and through Military Entrance Processing Station ( MEPS ) for your intellectual and physical evaluation . If you pass those tests , you may be selected for the Officer Candidate School ( if not joining through ROTC or Academy ) . After that you go into undergraduate pilot training ( UPT ) where you spend a year learning to fly through academic and hands-on training . Depending on how you perform at UPT you will receive a seat assignment . Higher scores are selected for fighter training while lower scores move towards transport aircraft . You can voice your opinion on what you want to fly , but ultimately the decision is driven by the needs of the Air Force at the time you graduate UPT . After UPT , you will move to Advanced Flight Training ( AFT ) which is between 6 months and a year long depending on the aircraft you 've been assigned . After AFT you 'll be assigned a squadron and location . If you do n't meet height requirements There is a waiver process , although getting a waiver for height requirements is extremely rare ( if not completely unheard of ) . The issue is that the ejection systems are designed for a specific height . This process starts by appealing a medical review board which you are allowed to write a letter to argue your position , however even with a waiver you would probably not be assigned a fighter aircraft . You would probably be assigned an aircraft that does not have an ejection system like transport or mid-air refueling aircraft . As <URL> mentions in the comments , the T6 training aircraft is also equipped with an ejection seat and if you ca n't fly the trainer , you ca n't progress on . The only other alternative to be a US Air Force pilot outside of height requirements is to be an unmanned aircraft pilot . Source 1 : <URL> Source 2 : <URL>
The attachment rail/track width ( gauge ) is not fixed . It differs from plane to plane , and the chosen seat manufacturer obliges . 21 " or 55 cm seems the average though . <URL> Source : <URL> Above image shows B717 cross section , you can notice the 3-abreast and 2-abreast both are on two rails .

I 'm only able to find the following about bank angles , which specifically refers to turns while in a holding pattern : <URL> 6 . ( b ) : ( b ) Make all turns during entry and while holding at : ( 1 ) 3 degrees per second ; or ( 2 ) 30 degree bank angle ; or ( 3 ) 25 degree bank provided a flight director system is used . NOTE - Use whichever requires the least bank angle . This is also in the <URL> which under * High Performance Holding on page 3-25 says that a flight director has a bank angle limit of 25 degrees . If we use the above guidelines , then a flight director will use 3 degrees per second or 25 degrees of bank , whichever is less . My calculations give us the following bank angles and associated rate of turns1 : As you can see , a jet travelling at 480 Knots TAS ( not uncommon at altitude ) would require almost a 55 degree bank angle to make a standard rate turn , which would be an amount considered by almost anyone as excessive . When limited to 25 degrees of bank , this would result in a rate of turn of 1 degree per second ( or a 6 minute turn ) . Anything over 160 Knots TAS would be less than a standard rate turn , and once past 320 Knots TAS it would n't even be a 1/2 standard rate turn . As far as the 1/2 Standard Rate , they often use the 1/2 BANK autopilot mode at high altitudes . This would result in a rate of turn approximately halved , so a 360 degree turn would take 12 minute at the same 480 Knots TAS . ATC expects the normal bank in the terminal environment though , so it is n't used at lower altitudes . As others have said , transport category jets do n't even have a rate of turn indicator ( it is n't required by 14 CFR 25 if you have a third attitude indicator ) and they simply fly bank angles . Normal hand flying is limited to 30 degrees , which would allow a standard rate turn at a slightly higher airspeed , but then starts to taper off just the same . That being said , the <URL> does include this little tidbit in the section on turn indicators on page 5-21 : The dial of these instruments is marked " 2 MIN TURN . " Some turn-and-slip indicators used in faster aircraft are marked " 4 MIN TURN . " In either instrument , a standard rate turn is being made whenever the needle aligns with a doghouse . A standard rate turn is 3 ° per second . In a 2 minute instrument , if the needle is one needle width either side of the center alignment mark , the turn is 3 ° per second and the turn takes 2 minutes to execute a 360 ° turn . In a 4 minute instrument , the same turn takes two widths deflection of the needle to achieve 3 ° per second . So maybe at some point in the past it was more common ( or maybe faster but-not-quite-as-fast-as-todays-jets ) but you just do n't see that anymore . ( It could be where all of the references to 1/2 standard rate turns come from though . ) 1 Math adapted from the formulas <URL> .
In general , the method of getting the airspeed of any bird is pretty much the same : Measure the ground speed of the bird . Measure the wind speed in the area . Calculate the airspeed of the bird from these two values . The following excerpt from <URL> by C. J. Pennycuick et al. published by the Royal Society details one such method : We measured the bird 's air speed , for comparison with the predictions of theory , in two stages . First , we measured the ground speed vector , consisting of the bird 's speed relative to the observer 's position on the shore and its track direction , i.e. the direction in which the bird was moving over the ground , measured clockwise from true north . We also measured the wind vector consisting of the wind speed and the direction from which the wind was blowing , and then obtained the air speed vector ( air speed and heading direction ) by vector subtraction of the wind vector from the ground speed vector Other researchers have used Doppler radar for the same purpose and in case of high flying birds , one can simply fly along with the birds at the same speed and measure the airspeed .
Bugs simply make instruments easier to read with a very quick glance . If I need to steer exactly 162 degrees , which is easier ? To read where the needle is pointing or just see if the needle is pointing to the bug which I manually set to 162 degrees ? The bugs are set by rotating knobs on the gauges . Here , the heading bug knob is in the lower right corner . <URL> The way I often use it is to turn onto the next heading required according to my plan , then set the bug to that heading so that I can simply glance at the needle ( still pointing to the bug , good ) to keep me on course . Other uses : If ATC gives you a " next heading " , you will read back the instruction , then you can set the bug to that next heading so that a ) , you do n't forget it and need to call back and b ) can simply turn onto the bug when it 's time to turn . Set it to the departure runway heading on take off . To " fly runway heading " , just keep the bug at the top of the gauge . On arrival , set it to the landing runway heading . As a " gross error " check . You would not believe how many inexperienced pilots set off in entirely the wrong direction . As well as setting the heading bug to " first leg of the plan " , you check this along with " and the road should be on my left with the river on my right " . On some simple autopilot systems , the autopilot follows the altitude and heading bugs rather than having controls for these settings on the autopilot itself .
Flutter is a phenomenon that can occur when a structure is subjected to aerodynamic forces . It occurs not only in aircraft but also for example in buildings , power lines , road signs and bridges . Flutter is an oscillation caused by interaction of aerodynamic forces , structural elasticity and inertial effects . Perhaps the best known example of flutter is the bridge over the <URL> that collapsed due to flutter in gale force winds . Flutter in aircraft causes the wings and / or stabilizers to oscillate . When the airspeed increases the energy added in each oscillation to the structure by the aerodynamic forces increases . At some speed the damping of the structure may be insufficient to absorb the energy increase from the aerodynamic loads and the amplitude of the harmonic oscillations will grow until the structure breaks . A flutter test is performed to determine what speed flutter occurs yet is still damped . Theoretically an aircraft should be able to stay structurally intact up to the design dive speed ( $ V_d $ ) which is at least 1.4 times the design cruise speed . In flight tests , the $ V_d $ is not always demonstrated as this is very risky since there would not be any margin from breaking up . The maximum speed is slowly increased in subsequent flight tests with careful data analyses in between up to a point where the test team decides that it is no longer safe to continue . This establishes the maximum demonstrated dive speed ( $ V _ { df } $ ) ; the published maximum operating speed ( $ V _ { mo } $ ) and never-exceed speed ( $ V _ { ne } $ ) are well below $ V _ { df } $ to give margin from disaster . This <URL> in a Hawker 800 . The incident occurred not during testing but was caused by <URL> ( FAA PDF ) .
It 's been a while since my last lessons on radars , but . . The pulse length and the pulse repetition frequency play key roles in radar min and max ranges . The pulse the radar sends must be short enough to end ( and the radar switch to detection mode ) before the reflection returns . To give a rough example , if the pulse length is 2 ms , the theoretical minimum range would be equal to pulse distance in 1 ms ( 1 there and 1 back ) . The pulse travels at light speed , so you can calculate the distance there . Note that the pulse lengths differ a lot depending on radars , and presumably none of the are 1 ms long . Free quote from the book Understanding Radar Systems : Pulse length of 3 µs , which is a fairly typical pulse length for a long-range airborne surveillance radar , would give a theoretical range resolution of 450 m. However , other factors such as signal processing degrade the resoution , and in the given case the resolution would be around 750 m. Note again , that radars are designed to serve a specific purpose , for example a long-range surveillance radar emphasizes range over resolution . What it comes to fighters , most modern fighters have <URL> instead of pulse radars , which work continuously and handle the signal differently .
Tip jets spin the rotor by blowing out compressed air . It 's the same principle as a jet engine or a jet-ski impeller , just that the exhaust is pushed out through the rotors . Some designs even had jet engines on the rotor tips ! The primary advantage of the design are that there is no torque created , so no need for anti-torque rotors or thrusters , the tip jets also increase the rotor 's moment arm and mass , making autorotation safer in some cases , although the drag from the tip jets often slowed the rotors down in many cases . Some say it is easier to learn to fly and safer to fly a tip jet design as there 's no torque . There are very few systems which use tip rotors , the main disadvantages would seem to be a lack of efficiency and drag from the tip jets . The rotor design is complex as high-pressure air must be carried through them , causing many design and materials challenges . Also , lack of a tail rotor means there 's no way to pivot in hover unless unless you put some sort of tail thruster on .
They are designed to not stall at the tips first . Such a stall behavior would be highly problematic because it causes a pitch-up moment which exacerbates the stall . See the <URL> how nasty stalls with swept wings can become . <URL> describes the required stall characteristics : ( a ) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll and yaw by unreversed use of the aileron and rudder controls , up to the time the airplane is stalled . No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur . The longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the stall . In addition , it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls . Such a behavior is easiest to achieve when separation does not start at the wing tip . <URL> sometimes had trouble to achieve docile stall characteristics which led to the introduction of stick shakers . Today , changing the airfoil shape over span ( aerodynamic washout ) and wing twist ( geometric washout ) are combined to ensure that stall starts at the wing root . Regarding washout : With high-lift devices employed , the <URL> of the ailerons on the outer wing results in a strong effective washout . Here it is important to extend the slats over the outer wing to enable it to function well above the local angle of attack . The picture of an A300-600 below should illustrate the point . <URL> A300-600 in landing configuration ( picture <URL> ) But even in clean configuration some washout remains and allows the outer wing to fly at a lower lift coefficient which ensures a decent stall margin . A photo of an airliner wing on the ground might be misleading : The lift forces in flight will twist the swept-back wing such that washout is increased .
These weights are all based on the maximum an aircraft will ever see . The maximum allowed weight of passengers ( + luggage ) and cargo ( called payload weight ) is the difference between the Operational empty weight ( about 270,000 kg ) and the Zero fuel weight ( 361,000 kg ) . This means the payload weight is about 91,000 kg . The passenger and crew weight can be estimated by the following numbers : 175 lbs per pax + 30 lbs of baggage for short medium range distance ( or 40 lbs for long range ) 175 lbs per crew member + 30 lbs of baggage $ ^ 1 $ So let 's say that ( for easier calculations ) the average passenger + luggage weight is 100 kg . When we assume 530 passengers and 25 crew , then the weight would be $ 555 \ times100 = 55,000 kg $ . That leaves 36,000 kg for cargo . All the weights listed are , of course , maximum weights . That means that an aircraft in general does not meet these values . The maximum fuel weight is the difference between maximum ramp weight and zero fuel weight ( which is $ 562,000-361 ,000 = 201,000 kg $ ) . About 2,000 kg is taken for the time the engines are running while the aircraft did not yet take of ( for taxiing etc ) . This is the difference between maximum ramp weight and MTOW . The amount of fuel varies so much per flight that I really ca n't say anything about it . It depends on the air pressure in the flight path ( aircraft choose their routes depending on that , for a faster flight ) , weather along the route , and much more . For quite a good overview I suggest for you to read <URL> . I hope I answered your question sufficiently . $ ^ 1 $ Source : Jan Roskam , Airplane design , Part I : Preliminary Sizing of Airplanes ( 1985 )
What is the purpose of runway grooving ? The channels help to remove water from the runway . They also provide an area for the water to build up . With out these channels the water runs the risk of forming a thin surface covering the runway which can be very dangerous . As mentioned by john here in the comments this is usually known as hydroplaning and is the same as what happens to a car . How does the airport drainage system work ? This is a bit of a guess but I assume they work like any other road drainage system and it will depend on where the airport is located . <URL> that you may find of some interest . Here is <URL> , it 's a bit long but should cover what you are looking for . Why do airports remove rubber from the runway ? Tires obtain the best friction when they come in direct contact with the runway surface . Excess tire rubber that wears off and sticks to the runway can affect the tire/runway interactions . <URL> covers the main points pretty well .
Thrust vectoring is for flying outside the " normal " envelope ( which is characterized by attached flow ) . Airliners should really never leave this envelope , so they are perfectly fine with regular control surfaces . If you want to add thrust vectoring , it would make most sense if the engines are at the back of the airplane . On most airliners , it is really better to put them on and ahead of the wings , because in this location they help both with flutter damping ( mass ahead of the elastic line helps ) and bending relief . Putting the engine mass right where lift is created is better than carrying stresses all around the airframe , which would be the case with rear-mounted engines . The redundancy point is valid , but it would be more helpful to have redundant control surfaces , and this is exactly what airliners have . At some point , every airplane has to come down for a landing , which requires to throttle the engines . No thrust , no control ! Most extreme case : If one tail surface breaks off , I wonder if thrust vectoring would be up to the job of trimming the aircraft even with cruise thrust . Not only have the raw forces to be sufficient , the reaction time to control setting changes has to be quick enough to suppress oscillations . I am sure , however , that thrust vectoring will certainly not suffice in all flight phases . Thrust vectoring is perfect for situations at high angle of attack where you quickly want to point the nose of your aircraft at your adversary , so you get lock-on first . This is quite different from what an airliner has to do .
Since you seem not to be concerned about the usability of this hypothetical electric aircraft , let 's make some simplifications : The aerodynamics are so good that it does not create any drag . This is completely unrealistic but helps a lot to simplify things . Structure , controls and propulsion are so advanced that they leave one third of the take-off mass for batteries . Who needs payload anyway ? Efficiency is 80 % . Not even electric propulsion can be lossless . Energy storage is the best current technology has to offer . This would be about <URL> of battery for non-rechargeable lithium cells . To accelerate a battery of the mass m to a speed v needs an amount of energy $ $ E _ \ text { kin } = \ frac { m } { 2 } \ cdot v ^ 2 $ $ Flying Mach 2 at sea level is impractical ; it helps to climb to at least 6.000 m ( 20.000 ft ) to do so . This adds potential energy : $ $ E _ \ text { pot } = m \ cdot g \ cdot h $ $ Conveniently , the result is independent of mass , so the potential maximum speed is $ $ v _ \ text { max } = \ sqrt { 2 \ cdot \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ cdot0 .8 \ cdot1 { , } 800 { , } 000 \ \ mathrm { m ^ 2 \ s ^ { -2 } } - g \ cdot h } $ $ If we solve this for 6000 m , the speed at the end of the acceleration is 949.3 m/s , which is already <URL> . If you prefer to use rechargeable batteries ( 1 MJ/kg ) , the maximum speed drops to Mach 2.15 . If you start to add a reasonable figure for drag , you wo n't even make it to the speed of sound before the batteries are empty . Currently , propellers are the most sensible way to convert electric energy into thrust , and large , low-speed propellers are the most efficient type . If you think to drive a conventional compressor with an electric motor , its subsonic efficiency is already far worse than the assumed 80 % . Even its mass is <URL> with conventional gas turbines .

start question
Is there any reason for why the cabin temperature would suddenly become very high ?
Over Central Europe in the winter time , air becomes tremendously cold . Since warm bleed air from the compressor stage of a jet engine is used for cabin heating , the pilots might have set temperatures to maximum in order to warm the cabin . But being in a climb , almost all power of the engines is required for lifting the aircraft , thus leaving only little excess bleed air to be used for heating . During normal days and outside air temperatures this should be enough , though . By levelling out the aircraft , the engines are spooled back ( less power required than in climb - > hence more excess bleed air available - > higher ability to warm the cabin in cruise than in climb ) . If the pilots/cabin attendants just did n't realize this circumstance rapidly enough , the cabin is being flooded with maximum heating air from the engines .
The fan section of a turbofan engine is driven by the low pressure ( LP ) spool . This means that it is connected to two parts of the engine : The LP compressor , which must compress the air before it enters the high pressure ( HP ) compressor The LP turbine , which must receive the air after it exits the HP turbine The problem is that the HP section is efficient at high RPM . But the fan will reach aerodynamic limits as the fan tips pass supersonic speed . Fan blades are also harder to contain in the event of a failure as they spin faster . So to accommodate the fan , the LP section has to spin at a slower speed , which makes it harder to match with the high RPM HP section . There is also a limitation on air flow . The fan must be able to move a maximum amount of air , which is takeoff power at sea level . But it must also be able to function efficiently at cruise level , where the flow is faster but much less dense . Engine companies use different strategies to deal with these limitations . GE mainly makes the LP sections larger in diameter . This allows the blades to have a high velocity at lower RPM . This this requires the air flow to change direction more rapidly . Rolls Royce has created a 3 spool design , which allows each section to spin at a more optimal RPM . This adds complexity to the design . Pratt and Whitney is going with the geared fan approach . Similar to turboprops , there is a gearbox to allow the fan to spin at a lower speed than the engine spool that is driving it . This allows the turbine spool to operate at a more optimal RPM while still allowing the fan to spin more slowly . A slower fan can be larger , allowing for a higher bypass ratio . A high bypass ratio allows a turbofan engine to drive more air ( produce more thrust ) for less air going through the core ( burn less fuel ) . Modern large aircraft have engines like the <URL> on the 777 ( 9:1 bypass ) , with the latest engines on the 787 going even higher with the <URL> ( 9.6:1 bypass ) , and <URL> ( 10.8:1 ) . Smaller aircraft like the 737 and A320 currently use engines like the <URL> ( 5.5:1 ) , with the new <URL> going higher ( 9:1 or 11:1 ) . The PW1000G goes even higher ( up to 12:1 ) .
You are right , it helps to de-sweep the outer wing . However , as long as wings are made of aluminum , the manufacturing effort is significantly higher . The basic problem is the needed two-dimensional bending of the skin panels . Using a straight spar line and a straight leading edge requires bending only in one dimension , but when sweep changes , the skin panels would need to stretch in some corners while being bent . This requires much more expensive tooling , or a break in the structure which increases structural mass . Even <URL> I know of has a straight leading edge , even though the aircraft would have benefited from de-sweeping . Both the <URL> and the <URL> , which were designed by the same people before , had reduced sweep on the outer wing , and for good reason . When the multinational project started and they talked to the BAe engineers , the British side insisted on a straight leading edge for easier manufacture , ignorant of the fact that using composites made their point moot . Yes , that was practically the same company that had built the Victor before . Another disadvantage is the fact that any sweep change will convert bending moment into torsion , so de-sweeping the outer wing will introduce an uptwisting torsion which can excite wing flutter . If the wing 's aspect ratio is low , this is manageable , but with higher aspect ratios the wing needs to be stiffened . To answer your question directly : In the majority of cases it is aerodynamically advantageous to vary sweep with relative thickness , but it is not structurally and economically efficient . In the delta wings of combat aircraft which need to operate over a wide range of angles of attack , de-sweeping the outer wing produces indeed the best wing planform , even when economics is included .
Aircraft incidents are an extremely remote event ( they say that you 're more likely to be killed in a car accident on your way to the airport than a plane crash ) . Within all the incidents that engineers foresee , some are more likely than others . These incidents are included in pilot training ( and passenger briefing if applicable ) to increase the likelihood that it can be handled properly . Loss of cabin pressure is one of them . Technically air pressure inside the cabin can not be " lost " , but the term is used to describe a significant drop in air pressure . The masks deploy when cabin altitude is around 14,000 feet . Cabin pressure is provided by two methods : The engine actively pumping air into the cabin The fuselage is sufficiently sealed to contain air pressure inside ( it is not 100 % sealed , but the pump is powerful enough to overcome the small leakage ) Failure of any of these two components would lead to a loss of cabin pressure . Historically , causes of cabin depressurization has included : Failure of all engines , whether due to <URL> , <URL> , or any other reasons Failure of all air conditioning units on the aircraft <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>
For the longest Oceanic Crossing , the following are the top three contenders : Sydney to Vancouver Melbourne to Los Angeles Auckland to Vancouver Out of this , 1 and 2 pass over a few islands on their way , 3 does not pass over any landmass . Have a look at this : <URL> Image : ( Image Source : www.gcmap.com )
" Four hundred " was likely annunciated twice due to a bit of a dip in the terrain that would cause it to pass the 400ft level twice . The " hundred above " call-out is for 100 feet above decision height to let the crew know they will need to make their decision soon to either continue or go around . After that , you hear the " two hundred " and " minimum " call-outs right after one another . The " one hundred " call-out afterwards signifies 100 feet above ground level .
<URL> ( <URL> ) <URL> Yes , it 's possible . If it did n't separate , then it needs to be checked after the scary and cold flight is completed . There will be warnings if the canopy is not closed shut . <URL> ( <URL> )
<URL> has done some research that chronobiologically-adapted LED lighting can enhance passengers well being and they can sleep better during a flight . <URL> details about this research : Adaptive solid-state lighting ( SSL ) scenarios in which the color and brightness of lighting is varied during long-distance overnight flights results in passengers that sleep better and are more alert upon arrival . ... at the start of an overnight flight that warm-white light helps to stimulate melatonin production and increases passenger relaxation ... blue-rich cold light in the morning increased alertness There have been studies showing benefits of <URL> .
There is a ( relatively ) new requirement for Flight Attendants ( on aircraft with more than 20 passenger seats ) to be certified as per the FAA . This was done in the <URL> , in section 814 if you want to read it . The applicable CFR is <URL> . In summary it says : You have to have a certificate of demonstrated proficiency , this looks like a pilots license . Demonstrated compliance with the air carrier approved training program . Proficiency to read , speak , and write English Comprehend written material in English Ability to write incident reports and log entries/statements Carry out written and oral instructions Now , the actual physical requirements are up to the airline , as long as the individual can complete the training program , they are physically allowed to become a flight attendant ( physical appearance requirements aside ) . As for " legally " allowed , they need to be able to pass the same TSA background checks that pilots are subject to . So legally , almost all airlines require : U.S. Citizen or appropriate work visa Be able to enter/exit the United States without any issues ( no visa problems with other countries , although for regionals this may not apply ) Be able to pass a TSA/FBI background check No DUI or felony convictions within the past 10 years There is n't a lot more " legal " to it than that , they do n't have to demonstrate the use of safety equipment if the airline 's training program does n't require it .
For go-around , several things have to be done in the moment the decision is taken : Apply full power ( obviously ) , disconnect autopilot glide-slope mode , disarm spoilers and retract them if they are extended , disarm autobrakes and in some aircraft reduce flaps . Modern airliners , and some smaller aircraft , have a method for doing all of these at once via the <URL> . On Airbus aircraft it is done by just advancing the thrust levers to the TO/GA ( full power ) position , but on Boeing aircraft and many other types it is a separate button on or near the thrust levers . So if the crew " apparently decided to undertake this procedure manually " it means they moved the thrust levers forward and started changing the other things . And probably missed one of them . Notes : I am not sure whether lateral mode remains under automatic control or not and it probably depends on aircraft as some can connect autopilot to only roll or only pitch and others do n't . Pitch control is manual immediately after go-around in either case . The last flap setting usually adds a lot of drag and a little lift . In some types the drag is too large and the flaps have to be retracted to the last usable position . On other aircraft they can be used in any position and have to be left were they were to avoid loosing lift .
The Super Hornet ca n't even shoot a VOR approach , much less an ILS . We are TACAN / PAR only . That 's fine at the boat , because that 's how we operate , but apparently the Navy still has n't figured out that there are stationary airfields that do n't float . Maybe someday we 'll upgrade and get the finest in 1980 's technology . In all seriousness I 'm assuming it has to do with operational requirements and money . The less the Navy spends on stuff like ILS equipment , the more they can spend on stuff that goes boom . Also , if the weather is questionable at home we probably ca n't safely do our training mission anyway , and out at sea , we have some other systems that help us land on the boat in bad weather . It would be really nice though to be able to use civilian fields as legal weather alternates . It gets a little tricky sometimes when planning cross countries .
straight out of the Airplane Flying Handbook , pp 9-4 Operating the engine at idle speed for any prolonged period during the glide may result in excessive engine cooling , spark plug fouling , or carburetor ice . To assist in avoiding these issues , the throttle should be periodically advanced to normal cruise power and sustained for a few seconds . This procedure is common during emergency descents or steep spirals to prevent the engine from cooling off too much . If the engine mixture is excessively rich , spark plug fouling can occur . Fouling can be cleaned off the plugs by running the engine at Cruise power settings with a properly leaned mixture in about 10 or so seconds .
It depends on the autopilot and you need to read the AFM to know what the limitations are . All of the business jets that I have flown prohibit the use of the autopilot below a specific altitude ( between 50 and 1,000 feet depending on the autopilot and the configuration of the airplane ) . Nothing prevents then from being used lower but it is n't allowed . They will engage on the ground ( in fact it is part of the required preflight tests ) but have a specific prohibition against use for takeoff and landing . Other airplanes and autopilots however are approved for autoland all of the way down to a full stop , and some for takeoff as well . Speeds also depend on the autopilot . Some automatically disconnect if the aircraft receives a stall warning or overspeed signal but others do n't .
When the velocity of the airflow locally exceeds speed of sound above the wing a shock wave forms and the flow detaches beyond this shock wave . <URL> Similarly to stall , the supersonic separation of flow removes the component of lift produced by decrease of pressure on the upper surface of the wing and so the effects are similar . I causes reduction of lift and because centre of pressure is about quarter chord on the upper surface , but midchord on the lower , it causes a significant pitch-down moment , which might be impossible to recover even if the post-stall lift is otherwise sufficient to keep the aircraft flying straight . This effect is often called <URL> . Supersonic planes often have all-moving elevators to have sufficient control authority to compensate for it . A difference from normal stall is that after supersonic flow separation the lift remains proportional to angle of attack and so the aircraft continues to behave more or less normally except for the change in trim . Mach tuck may occur as low as Mach 0.7 depending on aircraft design , because the air moves faster over the wing . It can be delayed by using <URL> , because the shock waves only form when the air velocity component perpendicular to the wing exceeds speed of sound . Supersonic aircraft eventually encounter supersonic flow separation , but the lower surface lift is sufficient to balance the aircraft weight at that speed and altitude and the aircraft can continue flying with the upper surface flow separated . That 's not the case with most subsonic aircraft , which for efficiency reasons tend to cruise at altitudes where they have very small margin to stall . As the stall speed increases with altitude while speed of sound slightly decreases with the lower temperature there , the stall speed will eventually equal critical mach number , which creates the <URL> and absolute ceiling for the aircraft . For most civilian transport aircraft the range between stall speed and critical mach number ( where drag increases and supersonic flow separation would begin ) reduces considerably at cruise altitude , but they usually do n't have enough engine power to reach the actual coffin corner .
Here is an illustration of how cabin pressure changes during a typical commercial flight : <URL> image source : <URL> Note how when the pressure outside the aircraft is changing , the pressure inside the aircraft is also changing , but not as much . During the flight shown here , you would experience about the same pressure changes that you would in an unpressurized Piper Cub that only went to 7000 feet .
Airports can have a left , center and right runways . Memphis ( KMEM ) is a good example . Airports with four or more parallel runways are left and right with the numbers off by one . Los Angeles ( KLAX ) and Chicago ( KORD ) are good examples of such an arrangement .
I finally found an <URL> that discusses requirements for a control tower . They say : The FAA has the authority to establish control towers or discontinue control tower services through the National Airspace System when activity levels and safety considerations merit such action . In order to open a new tower , there must be a positive Benefit-Cost ratio ( which is a complicated thing to calculate ) . The FAA typically pays for the cost , and here is the criteria that they list : Criteria According to FAR Part 170.13 , the following criteria , along with general facility establishment standards , must be met before an airport can qualify for a control tower : The airport , whether publicly or privately owned , must be open to and available for use by the public as defined in the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ; The airport must be part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems ; The airport owners/authorities must have entered into appropriate assurances and covenants to guarantee that the airport will continue in operation for a long enough period to permit the amortization of the control tower investment ; The FAA must be furnished appropriate land without cost for construction of the control tower ; and The airport must meet the benefit-cost ratio criteria specified herein utilizing three consecutive FAA annual counts and projections of future traffic during the expected life of the tower facility . ( An FAA annual count is a fiscal year or a calendar year activity summary . Where actual traffic counts are unavailable or not recorded , adequately documented FAA estimates of the scheduled and nonscheduled activity may be used . ) The FARs specifically state that an airport is not guaranteed to receive a control tower , even if the airport meets all the criteria listed above . This is where the contract tower program comes in . The FAA , responding to an airport sponsor 's request for an air traffic control tower , can elect to establish a contract tower . The FAA can either elect to pay for the service in its entirety , or enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the sponsor , depending on the results of the benefit-cost analysis . Typically , the airport sponsor is responsible for 10 percent of the cost of construction and operations . For the Benefit-Cost calculation , they use the following criteria : Site-specific activity forecasts are used to estimate three categories of tower benefits : Benefits from prevented collisions between aircraft . Benefits from other prevented accidents . Benefits from reduced flying time . Explicit dollar values are assigned to the prevention of fatalities and injuries and time saved . Tower establishment costs include : Annual operating costs : staffing , maintenance , equipment , supplies , and leased services . Investment costs : facilities , equipment , and operational start-up . The article contains a lot more information , along with links to the relevant regulations , etc. .
Aviation is very energy-hungry . While hydrogen is quite efficient in terms of energy per mass ( <URL> ) , it is awful in terms of energy per volume . Aircraft today use their wings for fuel storage , which helps to reduce bending loads and uses a volume unsuitable to transport payload . This will not work for hydrogen . The biggest problem is <URL> , and none of the solutions is really attractive : Kryogenic : Storing the hydrogen at a temperature where it is liquid ( below 20 ° K ) greatly reduces volume demands , but now you need to add insulation , and even then the energy per volume is only a quarter compared to hydrocarbons . This is used in rockets , because they can rely on extensive ground support before launch and use up the stuff in a few minutes . Airliners , however , need to store their fuel over tens of hours , so their hydrogen tanks will be much heavier and bulkier than those of rockets . Compressed : This avoids the energy input for liquefaction , but now you need a strong and heavy pressure vessel . Current <URL> uses up to 700 bar pressure , but even then the volume demand is higher than that of kerosene for the same energy content . Hydrides : Some metals like magnesium or <URL> can bind hydrogen and release it when heated . However , even in the most efficient compounds like sodium tetrahydroaluminate , only 7.4 % of mass is useable hydrogen , making this exquisitely unsuitable for mass-critical applications like aviation . Currently a <URL> looks the most attractive and has been tested widely . The first ( partially ) hydrogen powered aircraft was the LZ-127 Zeppelin which used a mixture of gasses of equal mass per volume as air ( <URL> ) to power its engines . Tupolev designed and flew the <URL> , the first hydrogen-powered heavier-than-air aircraft , in 1988 . The results showed that the principle worked , but could not compete with kerosene . Currently , <URL> , but none with the hope of widespread application - as it stands , binding hydrogen chemically to carbon will still give the best way of storage ( liquid and unpressurized ) for aviation . Hydrogen becomes the best source of energy only when combustion speed is critical , such as in supersonic combustion ramjets ( <URL> ) .
In the examples cited , there is a slight increase in Density Altitude ( DENALT ) , which results in a slightly higher TAS . As the air becomes thinner , fewer molecules pass by the aircraft per mile , resulting in a lightly less loss due to drag . Increased temperature does not have the same range of change as altitude , however , it is nonetheless a higher DENALT , which is thinner air . As an aside , in practice , you will note that the throttle becomes wider open with less dense air , until it is fully open . ( Note that RPM is not the primary measure of power , rather fuel burn is . RPMs will become higher at higher DENALT for the same power . ) At that point there will be no more available power , and any increase in temperature or altitude can not be compensated for by increasing the throttle setting . You will also note that less energy is expended per mile at higher DENALT , not factoring in the cost of a climb to that altitude . Finally , a different practical example of this : When flying in icing conditions , conditions ( and the POH ) may call for continuous carburetor heat at altitude . When this is done , the engine should be releaned , as the DENALT will be higher , and if uncompensated for , will result in a rich mixture which could foul spark plugs .
First , AF 447 was flying into the top of a tropical storm . The air was much more humid and warmer than that of the <URL> . Next , in the absence of seed crystals or nuclei , water vapour or liquid droplets stay in the air down to <URL> without freezing . From the linked article : Droplets of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds . An aircraft flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets , which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft 's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes , unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate de-icing system . Freezing rain is also caused by supercooled droplets . So it was the impact with the probe which caused the supercooled droplets to freeze .

Are there any methods to predict the location of a jet aircraft from its sound ?
From a single spotting location , then yes by training . But for any location , then it 's very hard . <URL> when the sound reflects off the surrounding surfaces , e.g. , ground , buildings , etc. . And when the sound comes from above . Most mammals are adept at resolving the location of a sound source using interaural time differences and interaural level differences . However , no such time or level differences exist for sounds originating along the circumference of circular conical slices , where the cone 's axis lies along the line between the two ears . Consequently , sound waves originating at any point along a given circumference slant height will have ambiguous perceptual coordinates . That is to say , the listener will be incapable of determining whether the sound originated from the back , front , top , bottom or anywhere else along the circumference at the base of a cone at any given distance from the ear . Tilting your head might help though . So much so , airplane spotters in WWII judging only by sound <URL> and the entire Luftwaffe was sent looking in the wrong direction , only to realize the direction reported was incorrect and they had to land once they started running out of fuel . Göring freely admitted the laugh was on him , that he had sent the Luftwaffe on a mammoth tour of their own air space . But with computers it can be done using <URL> . Or good old <URL> : <URL> ( <URL> ) Chinese soldiers man a sound detector which directs the firing of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns , around the city of Chongqing , China , on May 2 , 1941 . P.S. Same problem arises when trying to figure out where an artillery fire is coming from or going to .
To give a comparison with an engine at idle : On the 737 NG , the <URL> can use 240 lb/hr when under load . It is rated at 90 kVA , <URL> on each engine . The engines can use about 850 lb/hr <URL> , which from those figures is about 1/10 of fuel flow at full ( takeoff ) power . So the engines use about 4 times as much fuel ( each ) as the APU does to just provide power . Of course these values will vary based on ambient conditions and the load placed on the systems ( like the bleed air system ) . This is why if a plane has to stop away from the gate for a while , they will shut down the engines and run on the APU .
2D is a simplification of real life ... it 's very difficult to translate something 2D to something 3D . However there are approximations but I can tell you that no exact method is available . One of the key components of drag that you are missing in 2D is the induced drag , which is the drag generated by a wing simply because it has a finite dimension . The difference in circulation created by each airfoil has an influence over the complete wing . There is a theory which is linear and non-viscous that helps to compute the aerodynamic components of the wing , based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoils the wing is made of . It also allows you to create twist . It is subject to simplifications such as as being linear and missing viscosity , but it provides a very good approximation for the effort ( analytical for a significant amount of cases , and excel does the work for others ) . The theory is the <URL> and what you just need to is : add the induced drag provided by the theory ( you do n't have it in your airfoil ) : $ \ C _ { D_i } = \ frac { { C_L } ^ 2 } { \ pi \ text { AR } e } $ You need to know the planform for being able to make the integral of your wing , but the following equation will save you some time : $ \ C _ { L3D } = C _ { l _ \ alpha } \ left ( \ frac { \ text { AR } } { \ text { AR } +2 } \ right ) \ alpha $

The Soviet <URL> ( and also the <URL> ) had an automatic ejection seat . The aircraft had two smaller engines for VTOL . If one of them failed , the seat ejected automatically once the aircraft rolled past 60 $ ^ \ circ $ . From <URL> : The pilot sat on a K-36VM ejection seat , with the ejection performed automatically in takeoff or landing excursions using an " SK-EM " system . The SK-EM system was automatically engaged after the aircraft rose a few meters from the deck ; it could be turned off manually , or would turn itself off if the vectored-thrust nozzles were more than 67 degrees to the vertical . These ejection seats were first developed for <URL> ( though never installed on them ) . The Yak - 36 had two side-by-engines , the failure of any one of which could flip the aircraft - this led to the development of an automatic ejection system that would activate aircraft seemed to be departing from safe vertical-flight parameters . According to <URL> , 18 automatic ejections have been recorded in Yak-38s .
There 's one I can think of immediately , and that 's the granddaddy of them all , the <URL> . The X-1 's control system was unassisted and it had no hydraulic system . The only part of the control system that was assisted was the horizontal stabilizer , which was <URL> . I think most of the early supersonic test airplanes were mechanically operated .
As others above have stated , the Kamov KA-50 family is fitted with an ejection seat . First the blades are separated from the blade sleeves , which remain attached to the mast ( rotor hub ) . a few fractions of a second later , the conventional upwards firing ejection seat is launched , using extraction rockets tied to cables to drag the seat clear of the airframe . This cutaway image shows it to reasonable effect . ' 46 ' indicates where the blade separates from the sleeve . The little sketch of the smoke on the lower right blade shows the separation , and the ' 18 ' and ' 19 ' show the extraction rocket . <URL> Digital Combat Simulations 's ( DCS ) line of computer simulations models the ka-50 , including the ejection seat .

Twin enigned aircrafts without counter-rotating propellers A great many twins do n't have counter-rotating props : One such aircraft is the BeechCraft Baron 58 , as seen in <URL> . Another aircraft I can think of is the King Air 350 . It is not any more or less common to have one or the other . Contra-rotating propellers Another interesting solution to the P-factor ( prop pulling towards one direction ) , especially on single engine aircraft is contra-rotating props , two propellers on the same shaft that spin in opposite directions . This is mainly for single engine racer aircraft , but there are multi-engine aircraft known to have it , such as the Soviet Tu-95 Bear bomber . The pic shown here is a Spitfire Mk . XIV : A better explanation of the P-factor P-factor is the term for asymmetric propeller loading , that causes the airplane to yaw to the left when at high angles of attack . Assuming a clockwise rotating propeller it is caused by the descending right side of the propeller ( as seen from the rear ) having a higher angle of attack relative to the oncoming air , and thus generating a higher air flow and thrust than the ascending blade on the left side , which at the other hand will generate less airflow and thrust . This will move the propellers aerodynamic centre to the right of the planes centreline , thus inducing an increasing yaw moment to the left with increasing angle of attack or increasing power . With increasing airspeed and decreasing angle of attack less right rudder will be required to maintain coordinated flight .

Some years ago there were a couple of flight schools on Malta , I 'm not sure if they are still operating , DuckDuckGo could probably tell you The most common way of getting a JAR ( pre-EASA ) PPL ( for UK trainees ) outside the UK used to be to go to a JAR accredited school in the USA . Florida was very popular . I expect there are schools in the US that are allowed to train to the EASA syllabus these days . I think you need to travel on a training visa to do this and I 'm not sure what is involved in getting one I think I 'm right in saying your flight test can be taken by an EASA examiner anywhere , no need to come home to do it ( and anyway you 'd want to do it over familiar territory ) A big warning to anyone learning to fly is not to pay upfront . Pay lesson by lesson . Flying schools can go bust very quickly , many students have lost a lot of money this way Personally , I would be wary of training outside the UK , the weather conditions and procedures will be very different from what you are used to , and a low-hours pilot could easily get caught out . Marginal conditions can go bad on you very quickly . If you do do this , try to get some supplementary lessons in poorish weather and get some time fly through UK CAS to get used to ATC procedures
Control means to be able to vary the forces which act on an airplane , both longitudinally and vertically . Ideally , any variation will create an immediate feedback , so the pilot can " feel " how much more action is needed for the desired change . If , however , the variation of forces builds up slowly , the dynamic answer of the airplane will make the closing of the feedback loop harder to achieve . The pilot might either overcontrol and get into an oscillation , or he/she will be too careful , and the desired change never happens or happens too slowly . Regular control surfaces are small , so they can move quickly , and their forces act on a long lever arm , so the control effect is large . Also , control surfaces change lift proportional to their deflection , so predicting the consequence of an input is easy and the feedback can be felt immediately . Even if the primary control surfaces are ineffective , several ways of control still exist . I will list them in order of reaction speed : The elevator can be replaced by : Pitch trim , Wing flaps , Thrust variation , if the engines sit above or below the longitudinal axis of inertia , Weight shifting , if fuel can be moved between tanks or payload can be shifted longitudinally . The last two options work very slowly , and while they can be used to limit sink speed , it will be extremely hard to avoid overcontrol and oscillations . Situations which need precise pitch control like landings are impossible to master for an unprepared human pilot when only such crude means of control remain . The rudder can be replaced by : Rudder trim , Ailerons plus pitch control in case of agile aircraft with low aspect ratio , Asymmetric spoiler ( if available ) , Asymmentric thrust . Again , the last option is rather slow and can not be used for precise directional control . The ailerons can be replaced by : Rudder plus dihedral effect , Asymmetric spoiler ( if available ) , Sideways fuel pumping . Here again the last option is too crude and too slow for maneuvering . If the aircraft is otherwise undamaged , and the flight dynamics are well known , a specially programmed autopilot could fly an aircraft even when using the last listed options , because it can much better predict than a human pilot how much effect its actions will have . Humans rely on a feedback loop for control , and this is not working anymore if the reaction time of the system is far above its eigenfrequencies of motion . Note the " if " : How likely will it be that only all control surface actuators have failed , but the aircraft is intact otherwise ? In most cases , the control failure is a consequence of another failure which will alter the dynamic response such that an autopilot would be unprepared . There are experimental autopilots which can adapt , but they are only used by the military so far . With the loss of most of its tail section , JAL123 would have been hard to control even if the equivalent of full rudder authority would have been given to the pilots . With thrust only , fighting the inevitable dutch roll motion by hand is impossible .
The best option is probably Jane 's Aircraft Recognition Guide . It is hard to find , but it has a large number of planes and has multiple editions .
Short answer : Yes for a short-range airliner , but it would cost a couple of seat rows . No for long-range travel . Longer answer : To burn 1 kg of Kerosene you need <URL> or 3.59 kg of O$ _ 2 $ . Its <URL> is 1.14 kg/l , so it will use 2.65 times the volume of fuel . A cryogenic tank with sufficient insulation is required , though . This means it should have as little surface area per volume as possible . You could not put the LOX into the wing tanks , but need something with a spherical shape somewhere in the fuselage . If a large commercial <URL> , it would need to add 359 tons of oxygen . This would be already close to its own takeoff mass , so adding the oxygen will make the airplane too heavy . If , however , you are content with a short-range version of the same airliner that consumes just 20 tons of kerosene for its trip , the needed 72 tons of LOX would require a volume of 63 m ³ which is equal to a sphere of 5 m diameter . This would fit nicely into the cabin of a wide body airliner and allow for some insulation . For cg reasons the tank would be right after the wing spar carrythrough , so the airliner would have two short cabins , one ahead and one aft of the tank . Sorry , the 747 hump can not be used for LOX storage - the cg shift would be too big . For running regular jet engines you would still need lots of process gas . To carry that along as well is impossible , even for a short hop . Process gas is all the nitrogen and extra oxygen which is compressed , heated and then ducted through the turbines and accelerated on the way out , but does not actively take part in the combustion . Without that mass of gas thrust would be much lower , or the exhaust speed would need to be much higher for the same thrust , turning the engine into a rocket .
A warm up apron is a portion of the airfield close to the runway entry , where the engine can be warmed up before taking off . It seems to be more frequently used in military documentation . There are such aprons at Cairns Army Airfield : <URL> <URL> Found in FAA regulations , e.g. <URL> : PAPI LHAs must not be located closer than 50 ft from a crossing runway , taxiway , or warm-up apron or within the ILS critical area . But also in other not regulatory documents , here for synonymous of hardstand : ... construction of the RMP test section and warm-up apron ( hardstand ) at the east end of Runway 04-22 . The RMP warm-up apron was successfully constructed and has been opened for traffic since October 1992 . Source : <URL> A vintage post-card : <URL> Source : <URL>
When an aircraft has been given a clearance to land on a runway , that runway is exclusively reserved for the landing aircraft . ( Except for LAHSO and " land after " operations , where only part of the runway is reserved for the landing aircraft ) . That means that no other aircraft or vehicle should be on that runway . In this case , clearly something went unplanned . Either the crossing aircraft was not given permission to cross , the landing aircraft no clearance to land , or ATC mistakenly cleared both the landing aircraft and the crossing aircraft to access the runway . Pilots should always check if the runway they are accessing is safe , and in this case the crew of the landing aircraft did apparently observe the incursion and aborted their landing . The crew of the crossing aircraft noticed the landing aircraft a bit late , but you hear their engines spool up as well as they cross . The sound of the go-around thrust arrives second later due to the difference in distance . The crossing aircraft seems to be taxiing toward the rising sun so they may have been blinded and missed the fact that they were crossing a runway .
Are there any still commercial airplanes in use that are still steerable with complete loss of all electric systems ? Do some commercial airplanes still have mechanical backup steering mechanisms ? <URL> On most ( * ) Airbus aircrafts , In case of a complete loss of electrical flight control signals , the aircraft can be temporarily controlled by mechanical mode . This is called and is the lowest level of control law ( after Normal , Alternate and Direct Laws ) The aircraft can be steered : Pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer by using the manual trim wheel . Lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals . The pilots are notified with : A red MAN PITCH TRIM ONLY warning appears on the PFD . But : Both controls require hydraulic power . This means that if the aircraft looses BOTH electrical and hydraulic power , is no more controllable . Usually there are pressurised hydraulic reservoirs that allow to have a minimum of hydraulic power even if there is total loss of electrical power , but if there is substantial damage to the aircraft that has severed the hydraulic lines , this is no more applicable .

Functionalities vary in <URL> : ( emphasys mine ) Primary Flight controls : Back-up Control Logical evolution of A320 / A340 / A340-600 family : Full Fly-By-Wire , with a " Back-up " as an additional precaution to keep control of the aircraft during temporary loss of : all Primary Flight Control computers all Electrical power supply A320 : full FBW controls , mechanical Back-up ( Pitch Trim &amp; Rudder ) A340/A330 : like A320 , additional Yaw Damper to improve Dutch Roll damping even in Back-up mode ( BYDU with hydraulic micro generator ) A340-600 : like A340 for pitch , Rudder becomes fully Electrical ( BPS + BCM : Back-up Power Supply + Control Module ) A380 : like A340-600 for Yaw control + BPS+BCM also power : Electrical Pitch Back-Up ( elevators ) linked to side-stick Electrical Roll Back-Up ( ailerons ) linked to side-stick Pitch Trim ( Wheel is replaced by Switches ) For the A380 , in particular : Active Stability Control functions : All levels of control laws ( Normal , Alternate , " Direct " and even Back-up ) include a Yaw and Pitch damping function
Yes , a hot air balloon would change class , if you are adding an engine and propeller to provide thrust . With powered flight comes the need to provide some form of flight control ; at this point , you have an airship , albeit a <URL> . According to the FAA 's <URL> , and much like @voretaq7 's citation in another answer : An airship is an engine-driven , lighter-than-air aircraft , that can be steered . The FAA has a whole section on <URL> , for further reading .
Because the wing is finite , while the airfoil is assumed to stretch out sideways indefinitely . The consequence is that on a wing you get spanwise flow outside of the plane of symmetry , while on the airfoil all flow speeds are in the airfoil 's plane only . Spanwise flow is caused by the pressure difference between lower and upper side which can equalise around the wingtips . This lets the pressure difference diminish towards the tips and especially in the rear part of the wingtips . The consequences are : Lift is <URL> on a " real " wing relative to a wing of the same airfoil with no such sideways flow . The center of pressure of a " real " wing is <URL> of the one of the airfoil . On a swept wing the air transverses the surface differently than it transverses the airfoil . Basically , a <URL> is added to the speed around the airfoil .

Cloud tops with no precip can be discerned from data provided in the Skew-t log ℗ charts that are part of this app <URL> Where the temperature and dew point on the skew-t charts are converged you can expect clouds . If the convergence extends into the freezing level indicated on the chart you can expect icing .
I 'm going to explain this for the Airbus ( also known as the Cockpit Door Locking System or CDLS ) : How exactly does the person on the inside " cancel the unlock process " ( Press a button , flip a switch , enter " counter code " , etc. . . ) If the code is entered for an emergency external opening , the pilot has 30 seconds after the request period to toggle the door button to lock to deny the request or the door will unlock . It pops back the the ' Norm ' position automatically . It seems there is a delay before the door opens . Is this correct ? What 's the duration of the delay ? 30 seconds , unless the lock button is pushed , in which case the request is inhibited for 5 minutes . What are the " authority levels " of codes ? Which levels exist , what do they mean ? What is the confidentiality policy regarding those codes in theory and practice ? ( Who gets what authority level code officially ? If stewards/stewardesses are not allowed to have the codes do pilots usually pass them on anyways ? ) There are indeed two codes , but I believe the normal access one is optional . The ( optional ) normal code just chimes the cockpit for an opening request , while a secret code to the best of my knowledge is shared among the crew to request emergency access . " There are two different access request types : " Routine " and " Emergency " access request . " These are however internal airline policies and differ from airline to airline , and I 've read in some cases that they might even have the same emergency code across the fleet . In any case , the pilot ( s ) can still decline access . Here is a <URL> as well . <URL> , Page 37 onwards . While the source suggests that the time can be changed , most sources I 've read refer to 5 minutes and 30 seconds as the standard times .

Has anyone attempted to board a flying aircraft mid-air ?
Sure . It was regularly done by the aerialists or <URL> . Barnstormers performed a wide range of stunts . Although many of them handled all their own tricks , others became specialists , either stunt pilots or aerialists . Stunt pilots performed daring spins and dives with their planes , including the well-known loop-the-loop and barrel roll maneuvers . Aerialists , on the other hand , performed such feats as wing walking , soaring through the air with winged costumes , stunt parachuting , and midair plane transfers . These were mostly done using army surplus biplanes after WWI . The performers boarded aircraft from a variety of vehicles , <URL> . This ticket for one of the performances clearly mention the midair plane transfers . <URL> Ticket for a flying circus ; Image from <URL> As time went by , lack of cheap aircraft and tightening federal regulations put an end to barnstorming . I 'm not aware of anything like that in modern times . Anyway , mid-air transfers are not easy and are quite dangerous , as <URL> .
Most of the items you can bring with you to maximize your chances of surviving an in-flight emergency are items you 're not going to be allowed to bring with you . About the only things I could recommend bringing along on a commercial flight are your cellphone and a personal locator beacon ( PLB ) of some kind , but frankly if your airliner goes down ATC is going to know where you were when they lost contact , ( and the plane has an <URL> already ) . You should also wear sensible clothing -- natural fibers like wool or cotton are the order of the day if in-flight fire is a concern . Polyester or other synthetic fabrics will melt to your skin and cause you to have a Bad Time . More directly addressing your question though , the items that spring immediately to my mind ( and why you probably wo n't be taking them with you ) are : A parachute ( what prompted your question ) Sure , you can bring your parachute . It 's kind of a useless security blanket though . From cruise flight you 'd basically be executing a high-altitude jump <URL> . You would require oxygen to remain conscious longer than about 30-45 seconds ( though an automatic-opening chute may save you here ) , as well as protective clothing to survive the low temperatures while you 're free-falling . Those concerns aside , remember that airliner cabins are pressurized and the doors are typically " plug doors " that open inward . No human is strong enough to open that door with the cabin pressurized , and if you 've lost cabin pressure for some reason you 're better off putting on that little drop-down oxygen mask like the nice flight attendant told you to in the safety briefing . You 're not going to save yourself if you pass out from hypoxia while putting on your chute and trying to get to the door . An oxygen mask / smoke hood can be useful in a fire . Most airlines are not going to let you carry an oxygen cylinder onto the plane ( as others pointed out in comments , oxygen and in-flight fires can cause more problems than it solves ) . That holds true for pretty much any kind of compressed gas because really , how do they know what 's in that tank ? A smoke hood using a filter ( or a sealed rebreather hood ) with no compressed air supply may make it past security , but ask yourself honestly : " Am I proficient enough to use an emergency escape smoke hood in an in-flight emergency ? " -- If you ca n't answer " yes " you 're probably putting yourself ( and others ) in more danger wasting time donning the hood versus just getting out of the aircraft . A life vest ( if traveling over water ) This is overkill on an airliner ( though those of us that fly little planes should seriously consider flotation devices when flying over water ) . Your airline seat cushion really CAN be used as a flotation device . Those big yellow slides also detach from the plane and make marvelous floats . Frankly if you need any of these items you 're in a situation where having your own Mae West is n't going to really enhance your chances of survival . A utility knife capable of cutting your seatbelt This is incredibly useful for a bunch of reasons , not just cutting your way out of your seatbelt . In fact I keep one in my plane . Sharp and/or pointy things make airport security nervous though - if you try to take such an item on an airline flight it will likely be taken away from you before you get anywhere near the plane . Food and Water Useful if you have to make an emergency landing in a remote area , but frankly airliners already have beverages ( some may even still have food ) . If you 're carrying a light snack you 're as set as you 're going to be in this department . Emergency Blankets Nice to have , but most commercial aircraft already have shock blankets on board ( and much like food/water , this is really only useful if you have an otherwise uneventful landing in a remote area ) . If it makes you feel better to have your own blanket you can get pre-packed ones that can fit in basically any carry-on for about $ 5-10 . Signal flares Again , mainly useful if you have an emergency landing in a remote area ( and your PLB and the plane 's ELT do n't work for some reason ) . Flares are good both for signaling rescuers and for starting fires to keep warm . I do n't know if rescue flares are still routinely carried on commercial airliners , but I can say with reasonable certainty that you will not be allowed to carry on your own . They do n't let you smoke on most airlines these days - they 're certainly not going to let you carry on a self-igniting flare !
A leaseback can be advantageous , especially when you use the aircraft for your own flight training and travel . But there are some things you need to watch out for : Other people will be using your aircraft - whether people admit it or not , nobody will take care of the plane as well as you do . If you think you might take issue with trash in the cockpit , a scratch on the panel , or a tear in the seat , you might want to give this a second thought . In my experience , flying clubs seem to have pilots that take better care of the aircraft , since membership is controlled . You 'll have to schedule your flights - just like everyone else ( though some concessions are usually made for the owner ) . The bottom line is , you wo n't be able to just get up and go fly somewhere at a moment 's notice anymore . You have to play by someone else 's maintenance rules - While you have to comply with FARs in any case , the lessee typically will have stipulations that they ( or their designee ) will perform any required maintenance on your behalf and your say in the matter will be limited . Of course , you still have the honor of paying for any maintenance performed ( typically at little or no discount ) . Your capital is tied up - This can be a good or bad thing . It 's good in the sense that aircraft tend to be a good hedge against inflation risk . It 's bad because you 're precluded from using the money on something else . This is one of the main reasons that flight schools/clubs LOVE leasebacks . If you 're looking to make money ... it wo n't happen - most leasebacks only help offset the expense of operating the aircraft . If you 're looking for a return on your investment , better to look somewhere else . Do it only to reduce the cost of ownership on something you want anyway . Finally , YOU take on the financial risk of the aircraft - in most leaseback situations , you are reimbursed for any use , but are still responsible for any finance and indirect ( and sometimes direct ) maintenance costs . These have to be paid , whether the aircraft is flying or not . And if business starts to slow down ... well , I 'll give you a hint : it 's not the flying club that has to pay to keep your plane airworthy . This is the main other reason flight schools/clubs LOVE leasebacks .
I 'm going to preface this by saying I 'm not a doctor , however I am trained in first aid and CPR . If you are asking whether it would be possible to revive someone who is in respiratory or cardiac arrest to the point where they could fly again then the answer is absolutely not . The movies make it seem like you can give CPR and 2 minutes later the person is running around shooting guns , however that 's very far from the truth . CPR and rescue breathing are techniques which can , if done properly , keep someone 's blood moving enough that radical emergency medicine may save their life . CPR cracks and/or breaks ribs and can cause internal injuries even when it 's done right , rescue breathing does n't generally cause injury , however anyone who has needed either will require days , weeks or even months of intensive care and recovery . As to whether it would be possible to administer CPR or rescue breathing to someone in a light airplane then I would say yes , with extreme difficulty and a low chance of success . CPR requires a lot of force , you use the full weight of your upper body concentrated on one single point on the person 's chest , unless you could lay the person flat on a hard surface you 'd probably be wasting your time , so if the seats reclined a person in the back seat may be able to lean over and do it , although that 's extremely chancy of working due to the angle and the cushioning of the seat . Rescue breathing is possible with a seated person , provided you can open the airway , getting the angle on that would be very tricky in the constrained area of a small cockpit . Again , if the seat could recline a person in the back would have a better chance of doing this . Most importantly to remember is that if the sole pilot dies or becomes incapacitated someone else has to fly the airplane . Struggling to get into position to perform CPR or mouth to mouth on a seated person would be a great way to snag the stick and send the airplane out of control . If there 's a back seater by all means let them give it a shot , but your best bet at survival is getting control of the airplane and calling ATC for someone to talk you through things , it 's happened before and has a remarkably good survival rate .
Drag ( and lift ) increases with density . Density decreased and so did drag . So at the same power , you can fly faster . Now I do n't know whether reduction of power of a normally aspirated spark-ignition reciprocating engine at constant throttle setting would be higher or lower than the reduction of drag . But the question says power setting .
I think the policy is completely justified . An analogy : You would n't allow an unsafe and unapproved car onto a highway in Europe where it presents a unjust danger to everybody else . You have to remember that the European Union is a fairly compact bunch of nations : To get to Paris from Southeast Asia or Africa , you 're probably looking at overflying at least two or three other countries . Thus , a single flight will have wider implications and involve multiple nations . The policy keeps everybody somewhat happy that they have safe airlines in their airspace . It also keeps their own citizens off the airline in question . I do not think that it is a question of ' caring ' . If they do not feel that the airline can safely fly , they ban it . Note that a fair number of the EU blacklist are automatically banned by country if they have insufficient oversight . It 's also not a permanent ' thing ' or sentence . Garuda Indonesia was on the EASA blacklist for two years until they brushed up , and are now back flying into the EU . Perhaps it might even have been good , since it pushed the company to improve their standards ? Here is a recent quote on the Iraqi Airlines ban : ATW understands from unidentified sources that 600 non-EU airlines had applied for TCO authorization . Most had been granted with few problems , but a small number of airlines were subject to greater scrutiny because of their perceived high-risk status . <URL> While perhaps less prominent , I think the United States will quickly block any unsafe airline from coming in , although perhaps on a more case-by-case basis . I believe there are other hurdles , such as airport security requirements , that have to be settled to fly into the United States and can act as barriers . I believe the same applies for any other nation . Other countries say no as well , just perhaps not being as ' vocal ' : Some Thai-registered airlines earlier faced flight restrictions by Japan , South Korea and Indonesia , following an audit of Thailand 's air operations by the UN-based International Civil Aviation Organisation . In June the agency raised a red flag over aviation safety standards and gave the country until November to tackle the issue . Meanwhile , the US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) last Friday gave Thailand 65 days to address shortcomings it had found . <URL>
If you know the pressure coefficient of the flow , the rest is easy . The equation for the pressure coefficient $ c_p $ is : $ $ c_p = \ frac { p - p _ { \ infty } } { q _ { \ infty } } = 1 - \ left ( \ frac { v } { v _ { \ infty } } \ right ) ^ 2 $ $ $ q _ { \ infty } $ is the dynamic pressure and contains air density $ \ rho $ and the flight speed $ v _ { \ infty } $ : $ $ q _ { \ infty } = \ frac { \ rho } { 2 } \ cdot v _ { \ infty } ^ 2 $ $ The equation for the local speed , relative to flight speed , is : $ $ \ frac { v } { v _ { \ infty } } = \ sqrt { 1 - \ frac { p - p _ { \ infty } } { q _ { \ infty } } } = \ sqrt { 1 - c_p } $ $ Now you need to know the pressure coefficient . At Mach 0.85 the local Mach number of the 747 wing , which has a wing sweep of 37.5 ° , is 0.674 . Since I do not have the airfoil of the 747-400 , I used one from the same family ( BACJ ) , found <URL> . If you are interested , many more can be found in Michael Selig 's <URL> . The plot is from a <URL> calculation of the 2D flow around BACJ at Mach 0.8 , so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt . Note that it shows a stagnation point , and , therefore , Mach = 0 at the leading edge . The leading edge of the 747 wing is swept by 45 ° , so it will only slow the orthogonal speed component to zero . Consequently , the 747 wing has a stagnation line where the lowest speed will still be Mach 0.6 . On the suction side , the airfoil reaches Mach = 1.2 quickly and even Mach 1.3 near the trailing edge . Modern , so called <URL> s can tolerate mildly supersonic speeds on their suction side , and the Boeing 747-400 makes use of them . However , since the wing sweep reduces Mach effects , the top speed will be Mach 1.2 or slightly lower , and the TSFOIL calculation shown here is not exactly correct for flight at Mach 0.85 , but gives a general idea what happens on the wing . To answer the many questions you posted directly : The shape of the airfoil is immensely important . Thicker airfoils need to displace more air , and higher flow speeds are created on both sides . Camber will increase the pressure ( and speed ) difference between both sides . Changing the angle of attack will add a roughly triangular difference , which is highest at the leading edge , to the difference between both sides . Lower side pressure is increased slightly , and upper side suction goes up by a lot at the nose . Good wing designs have a triangular lift distribution over wing span , with the highest lift at the root . Since the displacement effect of the fuselage is added to the flow effects , the highest speeds will be encountered at the wing root . Just look at the pretty pictures ...
The aircraft weight needs to be 70 kg or less . FlyNano mentioned this on their <URL> ( my paraphrasing ) : Do I need a pilot 's license to operate FlyNano ? According to the <URL> ... FlyNano is below the necessary weight of 70kg ... In Finland for example no classification , no aviation license or medical certification are needed . But skill is needed . Nevertheless a good understanding of water plane operation , rules and aviation safety is requested . ... I found that <URL> . But regardless , and emphasized by FlyNano also , pilot skills are required .
If you 're <URL> and simply have rain falling , the procedure does n't change , and it is n't a big deal ( talking fixed wing refueling with a boom here ; other communities ' procedures/capabilities may be different ) . The receiver 's windshield will have some amount of rain hitting it , but if it is n't particularly heavy rain then he should still be able to do the AR . If the visibility is really bad because of the rain , or if you 're getting into <URL> , then that 's the situation you have , irrespective of rain falling or not , and obviously you 'd rather have better conditions for doing the refueling . Going IMC momentarily while you 're hooked up may not be a big deal , as you can still see the tanker , but if you lose sight then the first priority is to get positive separation between the two aircraft .
No it is not required to contact approach . Unless you have to go through a larger D , C or B airspace to get there . I do n't know of any larger Ds in the US , but there are plenty of D-airfields underneath C and B airspace . In Germany ( and I think around Europe , not sure though ) , there 's a distinction between the tower-D and the approach-D ( the former being called D-CTR , and the other just D ) , to enter the approach-D you 'd have to talk to approach , but if you can sneak under/around it , go ahead and call the tower directly , let them know where you are , and they 'll tell you how to enter their airspace . In the US , they 'll probably just tell you to enter the pattern ( like " N12345 , enter and report the right base for runway 5 " ) . In Europe you need an explicit clearance and they 'll usually tell you how to enter ( like " DEFGH , enter control zone via Echo , report Echo " , Echo being a reporting point on the chart , Echo usually being to the east , with November , Whiskey and Sierra being north , west and south respectively ( usually , that is , there may be more , and they may be placed differently , but they 're always on the sectional or the terminal area chart )
The VOR and ILS CDI indicates difference , in degrees , between the radial selected and the radial sensed . If the plane was far from the VOR and we turn the course pointer 5 degrees , the CDI will move to one side . If the plane was close to the VOR and we turned the course pointer 5 degrees , the CDI would move exactly as much , because it indicates the angular difference in degrees . This is in contrast to a CDI slaved to GPS , which indeed indicates lateral distance from the selected track in miles ( en-route ; GPS approach has to simulate ILS ) . VOR does nothing with DME . DME is completely independent piece of equipment that was introduced later than VOR . The only relation is that there is a standard correspondence between VOR and DME channels and the DME receiver automatically tunes to the DME frequency corresponding to the VOR or ILS frequency tuned on your VOR/ILS receiver .
In the US , pilots of one carrier may end up flying another carrier to position themselves . This is not the preferred routing of pilots for economic reasons , but it happens . In that case there may be crew on board wearing a different carrier 's uniform . I know of no regulation prohibiting this practice .
If you are in or around NYC , flightradar24 will give you most , but not all , traffic including helos and ATC radar traffic . flightradar24 most likely has several ADS-B receivers in that area that not only catch aircraft transponder/UAT output , but they also catch FAA ADS-B ground station broadcasts . The ground station will broadcast any known traffic ( mode C radar traffic included ) that ATC is aware of to any client aircraft that are in the area that have their ADS-B output configured to inform the ground station that they are capable of displaying traffic data . Most private GA aircraft with ADS-B are configured this way because there are iPad apps that will display it while airborne . The ground station will broadcast that traffic and a local flightradar24 receiver gets it too and up it goes on the website . The data may be limited to just aircraft in the vicinity of the client aircraft but in an area like NYC , there are typically many GA aircraft ( clients ) out there at any time that are configured as ADS-B in capable .
If all else is equal , an increase in temperature will result in a decrease in density of air molecules . To fly , a wing leverages these molecules , so the aircraft will need to fly faster to generate the same lift . Therefore the takeoff and landing distances are increased . Engine performance is also impacted . Most engines outside of NASA breathe air and so perform better when that air is dense . Jet engines also have a maximum exhaust gas temperature they can withstand , and in very hot temperatures the amount of thrust they produce needs to be lowered so as to not exceed that value . This is the basic premise of how Airbus ' assumed temperature ' works , where the pilots tell the engine that the temperature is hotter than it actually is , so the FADEC automatically caps the thrust .
1 ) Why does n't the tower use satellite throughout the flight ? The narrow answer is that the control tower is responsible for a small geographic area . The " tower " does n't want to talk to the craft at other points in the flight , so the need is not there . It only wants to talk to the plane when it is close to the tower 's airspace . Other components of air traffic control that do need to talk with airplanes in flight also divide up regions of the airspace and have radio equipment situated to talk to the necessary craft . A larger answer is that ground control and aircraft communications were under major development for decades before satellite communications were available . The system we use today is heavily based on line-of-sight VHF communication radio over most populated areas . Since these systems are already installed in many thousands of aircraft , changing to something different like satellite communication requires a significant benefit , someone to pay for it , and a lot of time to allow for the change . 2 ) Does a control tower only send voice services through the direct link ? or does it send data as well ? Data is beginning to be sent via <URL> . You can search for CPDLC on this site and find several questions and answers about it , but it is considered only a supplement to the voice communication of ATC today . Are n't there security issues or power safety issues involved in ground to air transmissions ? Unauthorized transmissions are possible , but they are managed and have n't traditionally been a big problem . There 's another question about <URL> . But much of the answer is that since ATC is monitoring the frequency , unauthorized transmissions would be heard and responded to . I 'm sure that future digital delivery will change some of these issues , but that 's likely to be true whether the message is transmitted via local radio transmitters or satellite . Not sure if that 's what you meant by security issues . I 'm not familiar with power safety issues .
It 's a good question . Estimations of 120 kg weight savings of compressed air in the tyres have been made , that is not inconsiderable . A detailed estimation with dimensions from <URL> . The B777-300 has tyres size 52 X 21 R 22 : 52 is outside diameter in inches = 1.32 m 21 is tyre wide in inches = 0.53 m 22 is rim diameter in inches = 0.56 m Side area of the tyre itself = $ \ frac { \ pi } { 4 } ( 1.32 ^ 2 - 0.56 ^ 2 ) $ = 1.23 m $ ^ 2 $ . Volume of the tyre = side area * width = 1.23 * 0.53 = 0.65 m $ ^ 3 $ . The B777 has 12 of these wheels so total tyre volume = 7.8 m $ ^ 3 $ . Air at 1 bar pressure = 1.225 kg/m $ ^ 3 $ . Twelve wheels at 16 bar contain 7.8 * 1.225 * 16 = 153 kg of air . Weight savings in the order of magnitude of 150 kg , every trip for two to three decades , are nothing to sneeze at . Consider it the other way around : how sane would a person be if they would propose to put an extra 150 kg permanently on board because the extra fuel would be inconsequential ? To re-inflate the tyres , all infrastructure is on board already : jet engine final compressor stage pressure is definitely higher than the required 16 bar . From Rollys Royce The Jet Engine issue 5 : <URL> After cooling off from 700C - 1000K , to 30C = 300K , that is in the order of magnitude of the required air pressure for re-inflating the tyres . So technically , all is possible . The tyres can be re-inflated with existing infrastructure on board . Of course not with the existing unmodified infrastructure as it is now , it will need to be tweaked , but order of magnitude wise everything is on board already . Tweaking a tyre pressure inflator in the 21st century is a much simpler task than inventing the first autopilot in 1930 . I mean come on guys . Aluminium 1inch tubing weighs about a kilo a meter , and the engines are very close the wheels . 10 m extra tubing would be a lot . The hydraulic oil has a heat exchanger with the fuel in the wing , which is super cold just before landing , having spent all this time at -30 C. Let 's say that the total re-inflation installation weighs 30 kg tops . Where the whole idea falls apart is in the safety aspects . We 're approaching an airport with low fuel reserves and with flat tyres , too many things can go wrong and Murphy pops his head up from every corner . The undercarriage is a considerable weight and contributes virtually nothing to the flying and economic capabilities of the aircraft , but we better make sure that it pops out every time and can cushion the last stage of flight before all passengers can get safely off board . In air passenger transport , if safety needs to compete with economics , safety wins every time . @mikerodent suggests in a deleted post that the tyres could be filled with helium . Not a bad suggestion actually : helium weighs 0.164 kg/m3 , weight saving for the B777-300 is 132 kg and the tyre does not need to be re-inflated . The answer deserves to be undeleted and accepted .
In the event of a passenger dying on an airplane during flight , each case is different depending on the location of the airplane , the duration of that flight and the wishes of family or friends traveling with the deceased passenger . What happens to the flight ? If the death occurs before takeoff or shortly after takeoff , the airplane is landed back to that airport or the nearest airport . If it happens mid-flight , normally the flight is continued to its destination . Where is the deceased passenger placed ? If there is a seat available in first or business classes , the deceased person is moved there and covered with a blanket . If it is a full flight , that person may simply be strapped in more tightly and covered . This is done to ensure that the body is out of view of other passengers . A deceased person is never placed in the lavatory . It is not respectful and a major security concern . What happens at arrival airport ? The arrival airport is informed in advance about the situation . Hence police , ambulance and coroner are available . Some airlines keep body bags on board . Normally the deceased person is placed on a stretcher and is carried from the rear exit of the airplane using a lift truck and then placed in an ambulance . This might be done after other passengers have exited the airplane . What are the regulations ? FAA have regulations addressing several emergencies , but not specifically this one . An FAA spokesperson <URL> : FAA spokesman Les Dorr said he was unaware of any policies that specifically address what should be done if someone dies in flight . The airlines make those decisions on their own . <URL> mentions some incidents of this situation happening . <URL> is a company which provides airlines with medical help from emergency care doctors on the ground . They <URL> : ... there is one death for every 8 million passengers from the airlines [ they ] serve ...
It has happened before . There are definite cases of light civilian aircraft landing on a carrier , the most well known was in April 1975 when South Vietnamese Air Force Major Buang Lee landed an O-1 Bird Dog on the deck of the USS Midway trying to escape with his wife and 5 children from the fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces . Landing aboard an aircraft carrier presents several difficulties , namely limited landing roll and available deck space . A Nimitz Class carrier is just shy of 1100 feet in total length and 250 ft at its widest point . The designated landing area or LA is approx 75 x 650 ft. The ship is capable of steaming at 30 + kts so it can develop quite a bit of wind over the flight deck reducing the effective unarrested landing roll . Then you need to stop the aircraft once it 's on the deck . Carrier based fixed wing jets use tailhooks designed to work with the arresting gear and reduce the landing roll to about 330 feet . The largest carrier aircraft in service were the Douglas A-3 and the Grumman C-2 and E-2 , each one about the size of a regional jet . The largest aircraft which I am aware of which made a successful unarrested landing was a Lockheed C-130 . Large commercial aircraft like a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A-380 simply can not fit on the deck without the wings clipping the island or other deck antennas , etc , not to mention requiring landing rolls of over 3000 ft even in the most extreme short field attempts . So HAS a carrier aided a civilian passenger flight via recovery operations ? Yes but only with small aircraft . COULD a carrier aid in recovering larger commercial aircraft ? Possible depending on the size of the aircraft , its loadout and fuel state and performance capabilities .

At cruising altitude there is between 4 and 8 tons of pressure acting on the inside of the door . There are n't too many passengers capable of exerting that much force on the handle ( and even fewer handles that wo n't just snap off ) . Latch type doors have interlocks or over-center latches that prevent operation with a pressurized cabin . It 's theoretically possible to open the over-wing exits at approach altitudes when there is no pressure differential . Other than being windy/noisy it would not affect the flight in any way . Cabin doors usually open forward , good luck pushing them open against the airflow . If the person who pulled the window plug wants out , it 's their ( and only their ) funeral . I 've sat in the open doors of light aircraft in flight hundreds of times , legs in the breeze , no seatbelt , while the plane makes fairly steep turns toward the open door side . It 's not a problem .

Do crosswind takeoffs increase the chance of a compressor stall ?
The general FAA regulation on turbine engines on airliners is § 25.939 § 25.939 Turbine engine operating characteristics . ( a ) Turbine engine operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics ( such as stall , surge , or flameout ) are present , to a hazardous degree , during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the engine . ( b ) [ Reserved ] ( c ) The turbine engine air inlet system may not , as a result of air flow distortion during normal operation , cause vibration harmful to the engine . The FAA has published Advisory Circular 25.939-1 which provides more detail as to how this regulation should be met . The takeoff phase is critical for safety , so the FAA requires testing to show that : No adverse engine operating characteristics ( mild , moderate , or severe ) should exist after the power setting phase ( normally completed by 60 to 80 knots ) of the takeoff procedure through attainment of the enroute configuration and climb to 1,500 ft. above the airport . The " adverse operating characteristics " are defined in more detail earlier in the AC . So to answer the question , no , it is required by law that jet engines have no issue with takeoffs in crosswinds . The faster an aircraft is moving , the less the crosswind airspeed component is . Once the aircraft is flying , aside from control inputs or changes in the atmosphere , the air stream comes from straight ahead . The highest amount of relative crosswind will actually occur while the aircraft is sitting on the ground . Note that unlike the takeoff phase : Taxiing : No adverse engine operating characteristics ( mild , moderate , or severe ) should exist during taxiing except for operation in crosswinds and tailwinds where mild adverse operating characteristics are acceptable .
When the stall has developed the aircraft is no longer in normal control law for any axis ( see more in <URL> at OP-020 . P 14 ) : As soon as the aircraft is outside the flight envelope , the control laws transition to abnormal attitude which is the combination of : Roll direct Pitch alternate Yaw alternate . This is something between alternate and direct , and is intended to allow the crew to recover from the abnormal attitude and reenter the flight envelope without being prevented by some protections . A stall ( an excessive angle of attack ) is one of the conditions to switch to the abnormal attitude laws . You may read <URL> , while on a simulation site , it is very well written . There is also a presentation on <URL> at Eurocontrol . When the stall warning aural warning is active ( voiced " Stall " and cricket ) , the crew is expected to know they are in abnormal law . Reconfiguration in abnormal attitude law is indicated by different clues on the PFD ( e.g. $ \ alpha $ prot and $ \ alpha $ max indication removed from the speed strip , and green = replaced by amber crosses ) . <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> and the master warnings are activated . The aural alert is a single chime , ( level 2 failure confirmed in <URL> , page 25 ) . The reconfiguration is also indicated on the ECAM , but the indication can be moved towards the bottom of the list if messages with higher priority arrive . The law is reconfigured as direct when the landing gears are lowered . Regarding the aural warnings associated with stall and law reconfiguration , they are audible at the same time , or are intercalated , but none cancels the other , as it was heard for AF447 and reported in <URL> ( C-chord is the single chime ) : In sequence the alarms were sounding PULL UP , C-chord , STALL , C-chord , PULL UP , PRIORITY RIGHT .
<URL> lists the demonstrated crosswind component as 12KIAS . The 150 had a few variants so finding a published number is a bit more tricky . The Aerobat 's are sometimes listed as 13KIAS , sometimes 15KIAS - but in general its the same sort of range as the 152 ( ish ! ) . You will only ever see " demonstrated " next to these numbers , it is not the maximum possible - I regularly hear of people landing 152 's over that 12KIAS . The number does not change due to your license privileges , it changes based on what the pilot is comfortable with / able to handle safely . Personally I would be wary of any crosswind over about 9/10KIAS . In an emergency almost everything is an exception . Except aviate .
<URL> says 38 knots for the 777 . <URL> says 25 knots for the 777 autoland system . <URL> says for the : 737-200 , crosswind limit is 31 knots ; for the 737-300 thru -500 , 35 knots ; for the 737-600 thru -900 , 36 knots ; and for the 737-600 thru -900 with winglets , 33 knots .
Short Answer Very high temperatures limit how much payload and/or fuel you can load on a plane . Engines To help you visualize it , in hot air the air molecules are more energetic , which means the engine will have hard time compressing hot air vs. cool air . Losing thrust . Wings Hot air -- with the molecules spaced farther apart -- has less density , which reduces the lift capability of wings . Hot and High Vegas is not only hot , but also high , which means the air pressure is already less than at sea-level . Each plane has its own performance charts , and on each flight , the flight dispatcher and crew make sure the weather , elevation , etc. , would allow a safe take-off and climb . A plane is configurable for such changing elements . For example using higher thrust setting , or more flaps to augment the lift . If you have a very heavy plane , hot and high situation , and a short runway , then things become very marginal -- Engine Out -- not just for the take-off run , but also in case of an engine out during take-off , i.e. , losing an engine . The plane still has to be able to climb . That 's why in places like Ethiopia , South Africa , Australia , etc. , airlines preferred1 quad-jet planes over twin-jet planes . To have bigger margin of safety in hot and/or high operations , i.e. , to be allowed to carry heavier loads . 1 When tri/quad-jets were commonly offered alongside <URL> twin-jets of same class . Example of Impact ( Map generated using <URL> ) A cargo MD-11 plane taking off from Ethiopia en-route to Europe ca n't take off fully fueled , and has to stop in Cairo for a re-fuel . Note that if Ethiopia were at sea-level or cooler , a direct flight would have been possible . Landing For landing in a hot and/or high airport , the landing speed will be higher , so what matters is the runway length available for landing . Again there are performance tables for that . Rest assured , those things are checked and double checked . And no one can tamper with reported weather , because it is very critical to flight safety . Also , planes do have their own temperature sensors . Newer planes can even alert the crew if the gross-weight , configuration , runway length , temperature , and elevation <URL> .
Appearances can be deceiving . The view " behind " a Piper Cherokee looks something like the image below : no rear window so you ca n't see what 's behind you , but that really does n't matter since there 's no way to go " backward " in this aircraft using the flight controls . Visibility aside , ground handling is often a a complex production , particularly for larger aircraft or when you have a lot of aircraft in proximity to each other or obstacles . Moving small aircraft around typically requires at least 3 people . When you 're moving forward you will have the person operating the tug and two " wing walkers " who stand a few feet off the wingtips and walk along to make sure the wings are n't going to hit anything . When pushing an aircraft back in a tightly packed hangar there 's sometimes a fourth person walking ahead of the tail to make sure you do n't back the plane into something . Since there 's not usually much for the pilot to do inside the plane at this point , they usually serve as one of the walkers . Larger aircraft observe similar procedures , but for push-backs or power-backs it 's known that the area behind the aircraft is clear ( this is usually coordinated over the radio ) , and as long as the tug driver or pilot keeps the nosewheel on the appropriate pavement markings there will be wingtip clearance . Line personnel are also often stationed to <URL> in close quarters where positioning is critical ( e.g. when pulling an airliner up to a gate , or parking a small aircraft on a busy ramp ) . The other half of the picture is taxiing under your own power and control . When taxiing , it 's generally assumed that the pilot knows their aircraft 's dimensions and will avoid hitting things . This usually works out well , but <URL> . Airport taxiways are marked so an aircraft with a specific maximum wingspan will be clear of any obstacles while taxiing along the centerline , and as you 're generally only going forward that 's where visibility is most important ( you can assume if the area your wingtip was going to hit was clear 15 seconds ago when you last saw it and nothing was heading into that area it 's still clear now , and you 're relying on the pilot of the aircraft behind you to be paying attention and not taxi into your tail ) .
The reasons presented at ground school for the benefits of de-rated thrust takeoffs were twofold : less chance of catastrophic engine failure during takeoff less overall wear between overhauls It is from this standpoint that reduced thrust takeoffs are safer . As you point out , these are only authorized when the weights , temperature and runway length allow , but for the EMB-145 virtually every takeoff we did was eligible for reduced thrust . You point about ease of control with an engine out is countered by engine out procedures which involve setting max thrust on the remaining engine ( for two-engine ops ) . During takeoff roll in the EMB-145XR , this puts the other engine at 117 % power . With the exception of flying near $ V _ { MC } $ ( for light twins ) the extra thrust is a benefit and not a hindrance to control and if this is at or after $ V_1 $ you 'll want the thrust to go flying . Your question about a bird strike is going to go one of two ways : the bird hits the N1 fan and goes through the bypass ducting the bird hits the N1 fan and is ingested into the N2 compressor stages In either scenario a reduced thrust vs full thrust takeoff is not going to make a huge difference , but scenario 2 will be far more destructive to the engine than scenario 1 .
A deep stall or a super stall is a condition where the wake of the wing impinges on the tail surface and renders it almost ineffective . The wing is fully stalled , so the airflow on its upper surface separates right after the leading edge , which produces a wide wake of decelerated , turbulent air . Consequently , the dynamic pressure at the tail surface is much smaller than in unstalled flight , which is the main reason for the reduced effectiveness . Consider this case : The aircraft flies in a nose-up attitude , but on a downward flight path . Consequently , the angle of attack of the wing $ \ alpha $ is much beyond its normal operating range , causing a fully separated upper surface flow . Due to the T-tail configuration , the wake is hitting the elevator such that all of it is shielded from the regular airflow . The pitching moment of this configuration over angle of attack ( blue line ) looks something like this . First there is a stable region with a negative gradient at low values of $ \ alpha $ , followed by a minimum when the wing stalls , and then a region with a positive gradient , where the separation unfolds and the tail moves into the wake from above . This region is unstable in pitch , so without control input the aircraft will not stay there , but either pitch down or up until it reaches a stable region again . At high angles of attack follows another stable region with a negative gradient : Note that we have two trim points , one in the regular range of the angle of attack , and one way out to the right . In both cases the aircraft has a stable trim condition , so small disturbances are answered with force changes which will keep the aircraft at one of these points . Between the two , there is another equilibrium point , but here the airplane is unstable . If it pitches up slightly there , the pitch up will accelerate until it reaches the upper trim point . Now consider the control power of the horizontal tail . When it flies in undisturbed air , it can trim a wide range of angles of attack . In the deep stall condition , however , its control power is much reduced , resulting in a much smaller range of trimmable angles of attack . If the lower end of this range is right of the point where the pitching moment crosses into positive values ( here at $ \ alpha $ = 24 ° ) , the aircraft can not escape with elevator deflections ! Please note that the control power is not sufficient to enter the deep stall with quasi-stationary trim changes . The pilot needs to pitch up quickly and has to overshoot the static trim range in order to cross into the stable region above 30 ° angle of attack . There , his range of trimmable $ \ alpha $ s is too small to achieve the same overshoot backwards . To get out of this trap needs other changes : Either shift the center of gravity forward , or try to drop one wing . Unfortunately , both the ailerons and the rudder will also be much less effective due to the massive separation and the wake . In a number of cases , even experienced test pilots could not escape this condition .
<URL> starting at about 1:20 in . <URL> . This is a <URL> as well . It really seems to depend on mode but its summarized here nicely , Climbing into the front seats of the Osprey definitely does not produce the most graceful entrance : it requires some contorting around the armrest , center console and overhead panel . The cockpit is dominated by four night-vision-goggle-compatible , six-inch-square multi-function displays that allow access to flight , navigation and system information . Mechanical flight controls consist of a center control stick , thrust control lever ( TCL ) and rudder pedals . The control stick functions as cyclic control while in conversion and helicopter modes , but steadily fades into a traditional airplane control stick as the nacelles transition to airplane mode . The TCL moves fore and aft just like an airplane throttle , unlike a helicopter collective . It does operate as a collective control , however , and becomes a traditional throttle during the transition . While this may seem counter-intuitive to helicopter pilots , it actually makes a lot of sense , because regardless of the mode of flight , youre always doing the same thing : controlling the thrust vector . Forward on the TCL in helicopter mode is the same as raising the collective in a helicopter , and vice versa . The first couple of hours for helicopter pilots transitioning to the Osprey highlight a bit of collective dyslexia , but very quickly it never becomes a further problem . A spring-loaded , knurled rotary knob on the TCL that lies in contact with the pilots left thumb controls the nacelles . Roll the thumbwheel aft and the nacelles rotate to the vertical , roll it forward and the nacelles continue to the downstops . The controls follow the hands on throttle and stick , or HOTAS , concept , and have all the controls necessary on them to control multiple systems on the airplane .
It looks like its related to this <URL> that was issued back in may . You can find the <URL> but the pertinent chunk for the private pilot is ... ( 1 ) Private Pilot -- Airplane ACS , Power-Off &amp; Power-On Stalls . With the exception of performing a thoroughly briefed full stall maneuver , a pilot should always perform the stall recovery procedure when a stall warning occurs
Neither technique is " preferable " - the assumption that one is superior to the other is one of the most common <URL> ( and over-simplifications ) in aviation . With some notable exceptions ( like the Ercoupe which is incapable of a slip and lands crabbed ) a proper crosswind landing should involve elements of both techniques . Crabbing Crabbing involves turning the nose into the wind so that some component of the aircraft 's thrust is counteracting the crosswind , allowing the aircraft 's ground track to align with the runway . Advantages Flying on final it is advantageous to crab into the wind : It is aerodynamically more favorable than a slip , and as the aircraft is kept coordinated it is more comfortable for passengers than a slip . Pilots often find a crab subjectively " easier " to maintain for extended periods of time compared to a slip : It does not require the pilot to maintain " crossed controls " , and it 's similar to how we maintain our course in other phases of flight ( you were probably crabbing into the wind on downwind just a few seconds ago , and on instrument approaches flying the localizer in a crab is analogous to tracking a VOR on the enroute portion of your flight ) . Disadvantages On touchdown however landing in a crab will put a side-load on the landing gear ( the aircraft is traveling along the runway centerline , but the gear is not aligned with that direction of travel ) . In extreme cases this can damage the tires , cause difficulty controlling the aircraft , and possibly even damage the landing gear assembly itself . " Kicking out the crab " to align the landing gear with the runway requires an abrupt control movement at low altitude ( generally not a good thing ) , and if done too early the crosswind will begin to blow the aircraft across the runway ( leading to a landing that 's not on the centerline , a side-load on the gear , and in the worst case an unintended departure from the runway surface . Slipping Slipping involves banking the aircraft so that some portion of the wing 's lift is counteracting the crosswind . Ordinarily the aircraft would tend to turn in the direction of the bank , so opposite rudder is applied to prevent the aircraft from turning and maintain the ground track parallel to the runway . Advantages Touching down on the runway a slip has the advantage of allowing you to align your landing gear with your direction of travel ( down the runway ) and avoid side-loading the gear . It also allows you to touch down on the upwind landing gear first which helps to stabilize the early roll-out , and positions your ailerons appropriately for taxiing with the crosswind . Disadvantages Slipping down final however is likely to make your passengers uncomfortable - the plane is slanted in one direction , the rudder is pushing the nose around in the other direction , and folks start to feel like their butt is sliding out of the seat . Aside from passenger comfort a slip is a terribly inefficient aerodynamic arrangement ( you 're essentially trying to fly sideways ) , and not a " normal " way to fly in other phases of flight . You may have difficulty estimating the aircraft 's performance and require power to maintain your glide path in this configuration . Combining the techniques So a crab is advantageous on final ( and flying an instrument approach ) , and a slip is advantageous on touchdown . It logically follows that the two techniques can be combined to provide the advantages of both : Crab down final ( or on the localizer ) . At some point transition into a slip . Exactly where you make this transition is pilot preference , but the transition should be smooth , simultaneously bringing the nose around to align with the runway while banking into the wind to counteract the crosswind component . Touch down in the slip . Complete your rollout with the appropriate crosswind aileron deflection , controlling your ground track with the rudder as needed to prevent weathervaning .
Directional stability When a swept wing is flying in a sideslip , the windward side behaves like a wing with less effective sweep $ \ varphi _ { eff } $ and the leeward side like one with more effective sweep . Wing sweep causes a flattening of the lift curve slope for two reasons : The effective angle of attack is reduced by the cosine of the sweep angle . Only the component of speed normal to the quarter-chord line of the wing is creating lift , so a swept wing creates less lift per area than a straight wing . The increased lift rolls the aircraft , but also produces increased lift-induced drag which pulls it back to straight flight . The sketch above shows this for the <URL> . This effect is so strong that swept , high-wing configurations need anhedral to keep the sideslip-induced rolling moment down . For completeness , also the side force $ Y$ of fuselage and winglets is added and shows that the winglets help a lot to create directional stability . This is needed in case of the SB-13 because it has a nearly elliptical lift distribution . Using a triangular distribution ( N9-M ) or even a bell-shaped distribution ( <URL> flying wings ) avoids the need for winglets , but causes higher induced drag in straight flight . Another downside is a low directional stability at high speed , because this sweep effect increases with the lift coefficient on the outer wing . Longitudinal stability Wing sweep also helps in longitudinal stability by stretching out the wing lengthwise . This is important for flying wings which lack a separate tail surface . By changing flap angles at the center or the wing tips , the lift at the most forward or most backward sections can be changed for pitch control , and more sweep increases the lever arm of these changes . Also , in swept flying wings natural static stability can be achieved without the use of reflex airfoils , but by applying washout . Again , the higher the sweep angle , the less washout is required . Too much sweep ? Easily ! Sweeping a wing creates lots of problems : Sweep reduces the lift curve slope and the maximum lift of a wing . The maximum landing attitude with a highly swept , slender wing is severely limited by wing tip clearance , so swept wings need powerful high-lift devices . Sweep causes the boundary layer to be washed outboard , which will cause nasty stall behavior once a specific ratio of wing aspect ratio and sweep has been exceeded . This can be somewhat limited by wing fences , but should better be avoided altogether . Sweep changes mean that bending moments will partially get converted to torsion moments , requiring a torsional stiffening of the wing . For flying wings , sweep will let the aircraft center pitch up and down when the wing flexes . This creates a powerful interaction between the fast period mode ( which is only moderately damped in flying wings ) with the wing bending mode , resulting in flutter . Why sweep a wing at all ? Generally , an aircraft designer will allow only as much sweep as necessary . Wing sweep reduces drag when the aircraft flies with transonic or supersonic speed . Now the Mach effects depend only on the normal speed component , so they are proportional to the cosine of the sweep angle . For the N9-M this was not a factor , however , the B-2 benefits from it with a higher <URL> .
While Peter Kämpf already commented the effects I 'll take a look at the numbers . Do n't expect this calculations to be exact predictions , rather worst cases to know the magnitude of following effects : Mass increase due to rain drops Forces due to drops hitting the wing Early tripping of the boundary layer After deducing some equations I 'll feed them with the data of two different airplanes . Mass increase due to rain drops The dew layer you find on your airplane in the morning can reach a <URL> of 0.8 mm . Raindrops , which do not fill the complete wing surface , do n't usually exceed 2 mm diameter.Therefore taking an average distributed height of $ h_W = 1mm $ for the water on the wing should be still a worst-case prediction . $ $ m _ { Drops } = \ rho _ { W } \ cdot A \ cdot h_W $ $ $ A$ is the projected area of the aircraft on the horizontal plane and $ \ rho_W $ water density . Forces due to drops hitting the wing Normal <URL> are about 5 mm/hour and we already speak about violent rain with precipitation rates beyond 50 mm/hour . But let us take the <URL> ever measured : $ I_R = 38mm/min $ . Drops fall normally with $ v _ { Drop } = 10m/s $ . To simplify the calculation I 'll assume vertical rain and that once a drop hits the airplane it sticks to it . In reality you do n't accelerate every drop to the airplane speed nor slow its vertical speed down to 0 . i ) Drag increase $ $ \ Delta D = \ rho _ { W } \ cdot I_R \ cdot A \ cdot v _ { airplane } $ $ ii ) Lift decrease $ $ \ Delta L = \ rho _ { W } \ cdot I_R \ cdot A \ cdot v _ { Drop } $ $ To calculate the total drag ( $ D = C_D \ cdot \ frac { \ rho _ { Air } } { 2 } V ^ 2 \ cdot A$ ) I 've used $ C_D = 0.035 $ . $ V$ is the cruise speed of the aircraft . Early tripping of the boundary layer While it 's possible to find airfoil polars in rain searching the Internet , I 'll first look at a " bugs influence " diagram where you can see the effect of small disturbances at the nose without other effects overlayed . Bugs and raindrops are similar in size , therefore the comparison should be valid . <URL> <URL> The polar above shows how the drag can double ( 100 % increase ) just because of some small disturbances at the leading edge . Keep in mind that in modern profiles the effect will probably be smaller . The next polar is from a transport aircraft airfoil . <URL> <URL> While not so important as in the glider airfoil , the drag coefficient increase ( experimental results ) is everywhere at least a two-digit percentage . Airplanes I 've taken two airplanes with really different wing loadings : A1 would be something between the two Solar Impulse models and A2 a single engine four-seater like a Cessna 172 . The last three rows give the drag , lift and mass difference as described above as a percentage of its total value . SUMMARY For a normal GA airplane the water mass on the wings and the lift decrease influence due to raindrops hitting the wing even considering the worst possible conditions are low single digit percentages . While drag increase due to drops hitting the wing is relevant in the extreme case I took here , under normal conditions it should be below single digit percentages too . On the other hand the drag increase due to the early tripping of the boundary layer is at least a two digit percentage , at high lift coefficients even more . Airplanes with lower wing loading are more affected with rain precipitation .
Peter Kämpf would be the one to answer this definitively , but in the context of his full answer it 's clear that he is referring to the function of the vertical stabiliser during sideslip . If an aircraft is slipping the flow will have some component perpendicular to the vertical tail fin , and thus the fin will have some angle of attack . Sideslip too steeply and the fin will stall , just like any other aerofoil .
This depends on the type of radar system and its intended application . <URL> . The early radars could not tell the difference between aircraft types , any kind of movement was coordinated beforehand on the friendly side and anything that was not pre-arranged was considered foe . The early <URL> that resided on the <URL> could be trigger by as little as a dense flock of birds . The early radar data from the <URL> was processed on the <URL> a very early ( very primitive ) system for coordinating a great deal of weather , radar , and flight information . After WWII and through out the cold war era newer tech was built to solve the issue of coordination . The modern <URL> that is now in use provides at least some way to pick apart radar targets . With the advent of modern computer processing and the ability to analyze radar returns beyond <URL> it is possible to determine ( with great certainty ) the make of an aircraft by its <URL> ( and in some cases thermal signature ) . Also known as <URL> . Everything ( <URL> ) have a radar cross section and once a cross section has been identified it could be used again to check against future pings . One could go as far as to say there is some historical precedent around this . The general idea of " if it comes from over there is one of them , if it comes from over hear its one of us " is very much how <URL> and the identification of the actual plane was less important than identifying that it was there . If an unidentified target entered a radar area and did not identify its self , over the radio , with some kind of transponder and or at a preordained time it was intercepted . Not until visual identification was made was it not longer considered a threat . Here in the states by 2020 the civilian world will be sending <URL> to supplement ( and potentially replace ) radar returns .
It is not " this causes that " - all is happening together . Let me explain : For me to understand aerodynamics , it helped to disregard all that talk of vortices and induction , but focus on the pressure field around a wing . When the theory of flight was developed , electricity was new and exciting , and it just happened that electric induction could be transferred to lift . Now every author still copies the explanations from a century ago , but they are totally unintuitive . Every air molecule is in a dynamic equilibrium between inertial , pressure and viscous effects . Inertial means that the mass of the particle wants to travel on as before and needs force to be convinced otherwise . Pressure means that air particles oscillate all the time and bounce into other air particles . The more bouncing , the more force they experience . Viscosity means that air molecules , because of this oscillation , tend to assume the speed and direction of their neighbors . Now to the airflow : When a wing approaches at subsonic speed , the low pressure area over its upper surface will suck in air ahead of it . See it this way : Above and downstream of a packet of air we have less bouncing of molecules ( = less pressure ) , and now the undiminished bouncing of the air below and upstream of that packet will push its air molecules upwards and towards that wing . The packet of air will rise and accelerate towards the wing and be sucked into that low pressure area . Once there , it will " see " that the wing below it curves away from its path of travel , and if that path would remain unchanged , a vacuum between the wing and our packet of air would form . Reluctantly , the packet will change course and follow the wing 's contour , but not without spreading out ( = pressure loss ) . Spreading happens in flow direction - the packet is distorted and stretched lengthwise , but contracts in the direction orthogonally to the flow . This fast-flowing , low-pressure air will in turn suck in new air ahead and below of it , will go on to decelerate and regain its old pressure over the rear half of the wing , and will flow off with its new flow direction . A packet of air which ends up below the wing will experience less uplift and acceleration , and in the convex part of highly cambered airfoils it will experience a compression . It also has to change its flow path , because the cambered and/or inclined wing will push the air below it downwards , creating more pressure and more bouncing from above for our packet below the wing . When both packets arrive at the trailing edge , they will have picked up some downward speed . Behind the wing , both packets will continue along their downward path for a while due to inertia and push other air below them down and sideways . Above them , this air , having been pushed sideways before , will now fill the space above our two packets . Macroscopically , this looks like two big vortices . But the air in these vortices can not act on the wing anymore , so it will not affect drag or lift . See <URL> , including pretty pictures . What is lift ? Following the picture of a pressure field outlined above , lift is the difference of pressure between upper and lower surface of the wing . The molecules will bounce against the wing skin more at the lower side than at the upper side , and the difference is lift . Or you look at the macroscopic picture : A certain mass of air has been accelerated downwards by the wing , and this required a force to act on that air . This force is what keeps the aircraft up in the air : Lift . Either way , you will arrive at the same result . By the way : Most of the directional change happens in the forward part of the airfoil , not at the trailing edge ! Induced drag The misconception about those " wingtip vortices " and induced drag is hard to eradicate . Most authors copy what has been written before without clearly understanding the issue . Therefore I repeat it here again : <URL> is the <URL> of the <URL> . The vortices are only a consequence of downwash , which in turn is a consequence of lift creation . At the same speed , more induced drag is indeed linked to more lift , but the causality is different : Lift and induced drag are both part of the pressures acting on the wing . If you add up all the pressure forces acting on a wing , their resulting vector will point slightly backwards . The streamwise component is drag , and the component orthogonal to the direction of movement is lift . This is just a defininion , made for simplicity .
Let 's do some quick math . Air has a density of about 1.3 g/L and hydrogen has a density of about 0.09 g/L . The best case for lifting force would be storing the hydrogen at the same pressure as the surrounding air . This means that every L of hydrogen can displace 1.21 g of air , reducing the density of the aircraft . The amount of air displaced by the aircraft ( and therefore the <URL> ) would not change , but the density of the aircraft in that space would decrease . This would decrease the lift needed , but let 's see by how much . The greatest amount of free volume in an aircraft ( that is n't part of the pressurized section of the fuselage ) is the fuel tanks . An A380 has a fuel capacity of about 323,000 L . If we consider filling half of that with hydrogen , this would result in a total reduction of about 190 kg . An A380 has a max takeoff weight of 575,000 kg . This change would help but would be very small compared to the total lift needed . As David Richerby points out , <URL> would need to be pressurized ( if not liquified ) to fit enough onboard . This would increase the density above that of any displaced air , which would instead add weight to the aircraft . Perhaps the hydrogen could be produced instead of stored . Newer aircraft do have something called an <URL> , or onboard inert gas generating system . This system generates nitrogen which is used to fill the space in fuel tanks after the fuel is used . Being an inert gas , nitrogen can lower the amount of oxygen in the space below what would be required for ignition of the fuel vapors . However , this system splits nitrogen out of air , considering that our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen . Hydrogen would have to come from somewhere else , usually water , which would add more weight . Another problem with hydrogen is that when added to air <URL> , which would make the situation even worse . Considering the minor benefit , this would not be a system worth installing on an airliner . Regarding the feasibility of a hydrogen powered aircraft , <URL> and decided that this is not a good source of power for an aircraft . <URL> to store even liquid hydrogen would be too much for the aircraft to be very useful .
For my answer I 'm going to assume that someone is genuinely trying to shoot you down for some reason , it 's not some sort of legal intercept . If you ignore a legal intercept then I can see a warning shot being fired to get your attention , in which case I would tell ATC I 've been intercepted and get on guard ( 121.5 ) and communicate with them and follow their instructions , evasive maneuvering in this case is a bad idea . I 'm also assuming that no missiles are involved because if you are against a missile equipped enemy in a PA-28 the missile 's going to win . It may be called a Warrior but let 's face it , it ai n't . In the incredibly unlikely event that someone is trying to kill you without warning then communication with the ground would be my last priority in the situation you describe because ATC can not help you and you do n't have time to explain it to them anyway . If you have a one-button squawk emergency button by all means hit it , but first and foremost you need to keep positive control on the airplane . If you exceed your critical AOA and end up in a spin you are in a worse emergency and if you rip the wings off you are dead . If it is at night then turning off your lights would be a smart idea , this wo n't help if the fire is radar guided but it will if the fire is visual . If there 's a cloud very close by going into it is probably a great idea . Next you need to determine whether the fire is air or ground based . If it 's ground based you will know because the tracers will be going from below you to above you ( hopefully not through you ) then your best bet is to throttle up and clear the area as quickly as you can by staying on the same track so you get away from the guns . Diving will increase your airspeed allowing you to clear the area faster but keep it below the vne ! Some small left/right turns may help to throw of the aim of the guns , but large turns will only serve to keep you close to the guns for longer . If there 's terrain nearby which you can put between you and the guns then use it . If the fire is air based then the tracers will be closer to the horizontal . If you are being shot at from another aircraft then flying in a straight line is likely the worst possible idea , you need to maneuver . If your airplane is faster than theirs then dive and outrun them , but chances are you are n't going to be able to do that , so personally I would corkscrew down and cling to the nap of the earth . Use your short turning radius to its best effect and do n't fly a predictable path . Ideally I would use terrain and/or clouds to try and break visual contact so I can escape . If you can spare a few cycles in all this you should make a mayday call to ATC and tell them you 're being shot at , and whether it is another aircraft or someone on the ground . Say your intentions , your aircraft condition , and the number of people on board . This is n't likely to immediately help you , but it may help to keep someone else from flying into the same situation if there 's a nutcase on the loose with an anti-aircraft gun or someone 's strapped a 50 cal to their SR-22 and is playing red baron with passing aircraft . If you 're lucky local law enforcement or the military may be able to scramble something fast and take the heat off you , but most likely it 's all over by the time they get there .
I suppose with <URL> you mean a powered paraglider , as pictured below . <URL> Paramotor ( picture <URL> ) Since they obey the same laws of physics , they also stall , just like a fixed-wing aircraft does . There are , however , some peculiarities which should be mentioned : The shape of the wing is produced by ram air filling the <URL> , so speed will help to keep the wing inflated and in shape . At low speed and in gusty winds the risk of the parafoil collapsing ( severe deflation ) is higher . This was the reason for several fatal accidents in the early times of paragliders , when the aspect ratio of high-performance parafoils was increased beyond safe limits . Today 's designs will normally quickly recover from a deflation event , but not without a substantial loss of altitude . The pressure forces on the parafoil will change its shape depending on its angle of attack . At low speed the angle of attack is higher , resulting in a suction peak close to the leading edge which in turn will increase the local camber of the foil . This leads to severe lift loss in a stall , and recovery needs some altitude . A fixed-wing aircraft , on the other hand , can employ an airfoil with only little lift loss in a stall , so recovery needs less altitude . This is by no means universal - there are also fixed-wing aircraft with less benign stall characteristics . If the stall on a fixed wing starts near the wing tip , the aircraft might enter an uncontrollable roll . This can happen in steep turns and with badly designed aircraft . This is not possible in a parafoil ; it might instead slide sideways with a partially collapsed parafoil , but stay upright due to its low center of gravity . If the pilot panics and pulls his brake lines on one side during a stall , the parafoil can enter a spin . Similarly , if the pilot of a fixed-wing aircraft insists on applying rudder when stalled , the aircraft can also enter a spin . Generally , due to their low wing loading and the drag of the raiser lines , paramotors fly at much lower speeds than aircraft , so accidents involve less energy , but the pilot has no protection around her/him , so fatal accidents do occur more regularly than with fixed-wing aircraft . For paragliders , Wikipedia gives a number of 2 fatalities per year for 10.000 pilots .
The wing fence is more or less what it is called - a fence . For swept wing aircraft , the local flow is not along the direction of flight , as there is a significant spanwise flow from the center towards the tips . It can be seen in the following figure . <URL> Image from <URL> The end result is that the boundary layer continues to grow ( thicken ) in this direction , with outboard regions more prone to stall than inboard ones . Basically , the wing fences stop the spanwise flow , with the result being a new ( thinner ) boundary layer starts on the other side of the fence . In case of a vortex generator , the VGs basically create a vortex which re-invigorates the boundary layer by mixing free stream air with that of the boundary layer , thereby preventing separation .

Can you obtain a pilot license with impaired vision / being blind in one eye ?
It 's possible to get a <URL> : An applicant will be considered monocular when there is only one eye or when the best corrected distant visual acuity in the poorer eye is no better than 20/200 . An individual with one eye , or effective visual acuity equivalent to monocular , may be considered for medical certification , any class , through the special issuance section of part 67 ( 14 CFR 67.401 ) .
Nope . Your solo time must be done <URL> ( the FAA does n't come out and say it in those words , but that 's what the " aeronautical experience " requirements basically boil down to ) . You must also pass a <URL> and receive instruction in the particular make and model of aircraft you will be solo-ing in ( the second of which is impossible in an ultralight : You can not receive dual instruction in that aircraft as by regulation it can only have one seat ) . As you do n't need a pilot certificate to fly an ultralight you could just get one , get some basic instruction on flying it ( from someone who has flown them before ) , and go fly . <URL> thanks to modern materials and construction techniques . Your private pilot training &amp; solo experience would be helpful in flying certain types of ultralight aircraft , but it 's not required as long as you abide by the regulations applicable to ultralights . Similarly experience in the more " airplane-like " ultralights may help you out in the rest of your private pilot training , but that experience is n't required ( and not really " loggable " toward your training , through you can put it in your logbook if you wish -- just log the time as " Ultralight Flying " or something similar . )
You 're almost certainly talking about a <URL> , who is just an airport ( FBO ) employee who gives information to pilots on their request . The FAA 's Pilot Handbook <URL> : UNICOM is a nongovernment air/ground radio communication station which may provide airport information at public use airports where there is no tower or FSS . On pilot request , UNICOM stations may provide pilots with weather information , wind direction , the recommended runway , or other necessary information . If the UNICOM frequency is designated as the CTAF , it will be identified in appropriate aeronautical publications . The important point is that UNICOM is not ATC . A UNICOM operator can not give you instructions , clearances or require you to do anything . He can only give you information , and as PIC it 's up to you to decide how to use that information . The <URL> that Porcupine911 <URL> is a great example of that . A student pilot thought that UNICOM was telling him which runway to land on , whereas in fact the operator was only recommending a runway ( presumably based on the prevailing wind or whatever ) . Unfortunately , the operator recommended the opposite runway to the one that was actually in use by other pilots . Like pilots , UNICOM operators vary in their experience and competence . A good UNICOM operator ( in my opinion ) will give you the local wind and altimeter information , tell you if there are other aircraft in the pattern or nearby , tell you which runway is in use by those aircraft , and give you any essential safety information ( like a closed runway ) . But as PIC , I 'm still going to listen to CTAF and AWOS and look for other traffic before choosing a runway and joining the pattern . It 's also common for no one to reply to a UNICOM call ( because the operator is out fueling aircraft in his other role as lineman , for example ) , in which case you 're going to have to sort things out without it anyway . So there 's no need to " report " anything : UNICOM operators are a well-known and official service , but you have to know how to use them and what their limitations are .
Glider PPL will suffice , did it yesterday and three or four times in the past three months . That 's me in the front seat preparing to take a co-worker for her first glider ride in a <URL> : <URL>
Obviously the MEMS engine itself is not going to be detected : they 're only a few millimetres across . The question entirely depends on what you attach it to . Conventional radars have trouble detecting UAVs less than a couple of metres long , and replacing their power plants with micro turbines wo n't change that . My neighbours at <URL> already have a holographic radar system that can detect smaller targets such as UAVs more accurately . Again , changing the power plant technology wo n't change that . Micro-turbines are not intended to replace propulsion systems , but to replace batteries , allowing them to use denser hydrogen , methane , or methanol fuel . As far as I 've been able to find , they do n't produce break-even power yet , but it 's envisioned that they will become commercially relevant once they can produce more than 10 W ( about .01 hp ) , in a few years ' time . For comparison , a current , small , military UAV might generate tens of horsepower , and some experimental super-lightweight UAVs need as little as 5 hp , but with no payload or cargo . TL ; DR : ( a ) MEMS turbines are n't going to be relevant for UAVs for some years , and they 'll have to be much bigger than they are now ; ( b ) replacing the power plant wo n't make much difference to the radar signature .
It is no problem to have the same call sign on the same day . As long as the same call sign is not uses at the same time there is no problem . For VFR flights , the same call sign can even be used at the same time as long as it is not in the same airspace . Many of the ADS-B duplicated call signs on a single are aircraft registrations coded in the transponder 's aircraft ID field , typically from General Aviation flights
It 's a bad idea to give false information to a controller as a matter of practice . Instead of calling yourself a student when you 're not , it would be better to say you 're unfamiliar with the area or that your English is not perfect . Controllers are almost always accommodating to less-than-proficient pilots and will usually make allowances whenever time and traffic permits . If your English is not good , be sure and use simple , direct phraseology . Read the AIM to become familiar with the common phrases used with ATC . Even something as simple as hearing " radar identified " in Canada instead of the usual U.S. phrase " radar contact " has caused many a native English speaker to reply " say again ? "
Yes . <URL> ( n ) Limitations on student pilots operating an aircraft in solo flight . A student pilot may not operate an aircraft in solo flight unless that student pilot has received : ( 1 ) An endorsement from an authorized instructor on his or her student pilot certificate for the specific make and model aircraft to be flown ; and ( 2 ) An endorsement in the student 's logbook for the specific make and model aircraft to be flown by an authorized instructor , who gave the training within the 90 days preceding the date of the flight . <URL> ( a ) Operations requiring a medical certificate . Except as provided in paragraphs ( b ) and ( c ) of this section , a person -- ... ( 3 ) Must hold at least a third-class medical certificate -- ( i ) When exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate ; ( ii ) When exercising the privileges of a recreational pilot certificate ; ( iii ) When exercising the privileges of a student pilot certificate ; The student pilot only needs a student pilot certificate and medical when operating in solo flight . With that said , if there is any doubt that a medical certificate wo n't be granted it is a good idea to get that out of the way before spending money on flight training you will never be able to use .
Clouds can be formed in many different ways . Before we go through them , we need to establish some basic facts . Clouds are made up of liquid water , or solid ice . Clouds are not water vapour ; water is a gas , and is invisible . Once more , because this is important : clouds are liquid water , not water vapour . Water droplets in clouds are extremely small . Clouds are visible because light is scattered in these droplets . The water droplets can stay suspended in the sky due to friction and air currents . In order for water vapour to condense into liquid water droplets , to form clouds , condensation nuclei must be present . This can be tiny particles of dust or other impurities around which water droplets can form . This is where the idea of human cloud generation comes form - by adding condensation nuclei to the atmosphere , clouds are more likely to form . A mass of air can contain a certain amount of water vapour ( = gas ) . The maximum amount depends on several factors , of which the most important one is temperature . Cold air can contain less water vapour than warm air . If more water vapour is present than the air can contain , the water has to condense ( the opposite of evaporate ) , to form water droplets - clouds . So , how are clouds formed then ? By adding moisture Air can only contain a certain amount of water vapour . If we try to add more water vapour to the air , it " wo n't fit " . As a result , the water vapour will condense , forming visible water droplets - clouds . This can happen over a surface of water during a warm day , when surface water evaporates . The air wo n't be able to absorb the evaporated water , so instead it has to become liquid . Cooling from below ( advection ) Warm air can contain more water vapour than cold air . When a warm , moist airmass moves over a cold surface , the temperature of the air will drop . When reaching a certain temperature , the air becomes saturated - it contains exactly as much water vapour as it possible can . We call this temperature the dew point . If the air is cooled further , some of the water vapour in the air has to condense into water droplets . Imagine squeezing a saturated sponge - the water has to come out . Adiabatic cooling ( convection ) On a sunny day , the sun will heat up the surface of the earth . Because the surface is not uniform , it will heat up at different rates . A sandy field will get much warmer than a wet area , for example . The air directly above such hot areas will also be heated up , by radiation from the surface . Hot air has a lower density than cold air , so at some point it will start to rise ( " heat rises " ) . As this warm bubble of air rises , it will start to expand . This is because pressure drops with altitude . As the air expands , it will cool off . Now we 're back at the basic principle that cold air can hold less water vapour than hot air . As our bubble of air rises , and cools down , at some point , it will reach the dew point , and a cloud will form . The adiabatic lapse rate is the rate at which a bubble of rising air will cool off with altitude . Rising air will cool with approximately 3 degrees C per 1,000 ft of altitude gain ( dry adiabatic lapse rate - DALR ) , simply because it expands as a result of the lower pressure . When air starts to condense , and a cloud forms , this process releases latent heat . Simply put , it took energy to make the water evaporate , and this energy is released again when the water condenses . This means that once our bubble of rising air reaches the dew point , and a cloud starts to form , it will actually cool off slower . The saturated adiabatic lapse rate ( SALR ) is approximately 1.5 degrees C per 1,000 ft. Now , for how long will our bubble of air keep rising ? It will keep rising as long as the air surrounding it is cooler than itself . The general temperature of the atmosphere at a given location is known as the enviromental lapse rate - ELR or ELT . As long as the DALR is less than the ELR up to the dew point , rising air will form clouds . Frontal lifting A warm front is when a mass of warm air moves forwards , displacing a mass of colder air . Since warm air has a lower density than cold air , when the two air masses meet , the warm air will be forced upwards , above the cold air . This causes the air to expand , and cool . As this happens , the air might reach the dew point , and clouds will be formed . Orographic lift Orographic lift is quite similar to frontal lift . Instead of being forced up by cold air below , an air mass is forced upwards by terrain ( i.e. wind blowing towards a mountain ) . Then it 's the same old story - the air rises , expands , cools and water vapour condenses . Turbulence and convergence Mechanical turbulence , for example due to rough terrain , can cause vertical movements in the atmosphere . If these are large enough , air can be forced upwards , which , as we now know , will form a cloud . Convergence is when two air masses move towards each other , creating a vertical stream of air in the middle . This column of air moves upwards , an
No , it is not negligent . Landing performance data assumes no thrust reverser usage and thrust reversers can be dispatched inoperative per the Minimum Equipment List ( MEL ) with a logbook entry and possibly the inoperative reverser mechanically locked/disabled . With a single thrust reverse operative , depending on the aircraft and airline ops , the other one may or may not be used . If it is used , caution in maintaining directional control during landing is advised . Any such stipulations will be part of the MEL verbiage . A proper MEL action will consist of a logbook entry by the pilots or maintenance , a logbook sign-off by maintenance and dispatch notification of the MEL . Thus , the pilots , maintenance and dispatch are all aware of the issue . Lastly , and special requirements of the MEL will be noted by the crew when they consult the MEL book after noticing the MEL in the logbook and in the dispatch paperwork . In the airplane I am familiar with you could visually note the thrust reverser locking bolt during the walk-around inspection to verify that maintenance had done its job properly . This also presented a nice opportunity to query the First Officer and see how well they were paying attention during the inspection . The situation would only be negligent if proper procedures were ignored .
At that point it was indeed the flaps extending in preparation of takeoff ( you can see them moving through the rain ) . You would typically also be able to hear the cargo doors closing ( before the plane starts taxiing ) and the engines ramping up as you start to take off ( <URL> in the same video ) .
The FAA has <URL> . Basically it boils down to this : If your registration has expired you still have ~ 90 days to register the aircraft If a renewal application was first received by the Registry after the expiration date , the renewal process no longer applies . An aircraft owner may apply for registration of an unregistered aircraft under 14 C.F.R. § 4731 ( a ) , by filing an Aircraft Registration Application , <URL> , the $ 5.00 registration fee , and evidence of ownership ( if it is not already on file at the Registry ) . So it 's a " new registration " , but you can keep your N number . ( Yes , you have to use an official , FAA-Provided 8050-1 form - you ca n't download them anymore . You 're also going to want to talk to someone at the <URL> or your local FSDO before you start filling out forms because you do n't want your form to show up after the 90 day window or you wind up in the other category ... ) After about 90 days your N number is Cancelled &amp; unavailable for 5 years When an aircraft registration is not renewed , the cancellation of the N-number assigned to that aircraft will take place approximately 90 days after the expiration of an aircraft 's registration . Upon cancellation , an N-number will be unavailable for re-assignment or reservation for a period of five years . At this point you have to talk the aircraft registration branch , but my understanding is you are out of luck -- That N number is void and a new number will be issued when you register the aircraft ( at which point you must apply the new N number to the aircraft in accordance with <URL> , which typically means repainting at least part of the tail ) . You must get a new airworthiness certificate bearing the new registration number from your local FSDO . In both of these cases your airworthiness certificate is invalid * ( because without a valid registration you have no authority to operate the aircraft ) . In the first case you will not need a replacement airworthiness certificate ( because your N number has n't changed ) , but if your N number has been cancelled you will need a new airworthiness certificate issued with the new N number on it . Total time for all the paperwork to be processed depends on which bucket you fall into -- the aircraft registration branch usually has about a 30-day backlog ( <URL> ) , plus time for the post office to move the paper from point A to point B , so a lag of a little over 30 days is what you should expect . If a replacement airworthiness certificate is required that will probably add a few days to the process as well .
Pilot 's breath is not recorded on a flight data recorder , as it is not one of <URL> . However , if a pilot is breathing abnormally , the cockpit voice recorder may easily detect that as the breathing sound is captured by the CVR . A reference to this can be found in the <URL> for Germanwings flight 4U9525 , which states : ... the only sound to come from Lubitz is the sound of him breathing , picked up by the microphone on his headphone set . ... " We could hear human breathing inside the cabin , " said Mr Robin , " and this breathing noise we heard up until the moment of final impact . That means that the co-pilot was alive . Apparently he was breathing normally , so this is not someone having a heart attack , for example .
Generally speaking a pilot can ( physically ) do whatever they want : ATC does n't have a remote control . If you push the throttles forward and pull back on the yoke you will take off , no matter what mean things the folks in the tower are shouting at you over the radio . Practically speaking doing so can get you into trouble : You may be met in the air by planes with more guns than yours , or projectiles from the ground may be fired in such a way as to intersect your flight path ( " You might get intercepted or shot down by very annoyed military types . " ) -- even if that does n't happen you may face administrative or civil action for ignoring ATC instructions in the jurisdiction where you did this . I 'm not sure what the ATC policies are in Turkey , but the US FAA has a phrase specifically for this : ( you 'll find it in <URL> ) . The emergency authority of a pilot is also recognized worldwide ( at least in ICAO states - you 'll find it in Annex 2 , 2.3.1 , conveniently quoted <URL> ) , so if the pilot in command deems that remaining on the ground constitutes an emergency they can violate regulations to the extent necessary to meet the emergency ( i.e. forego getting a clearance and take off even if ATC is saying not to ) .
I will mention some considerations that were not mentioned above . First of all , it does make sense to buy a plane for training , and it can save you a lot of money on rent but you need to be aware of what you are doing . The positive side is that airplanes do not depreciate as fast as most assets of their kind ( it is not unheard of being able to sell an airplane for practically the same amount as you bought it several years ago ) . However , consider that : Usually an airplane you want to train in ( something sturdy and easy to control , like a C-150 ) is not an airplane you would like to fly most of the time ( traveling in a 150 is not a lot of fun , now a twin Comanche is a different story ... ) . Insurance costs for a student pilot ( even with various restrictions ) can nearly negate the advantage of not having to rent . So , if you would like to buy an airplane to mostly train ( and have some fun occasionally ) and then sell and buy a ' travel ' ( or aerobatic ) airplane , it can save you money . It is better to get your private first , however , so you can concentrate on initial training ( which is a handful ) without worrying about the ' pleasures ' of plane ownership .
Ill answer this for the FAA ( here in the US ) but keep in mind this differs around the globe . The FAA outlines some of their <URL> . They created a special website that has a lot of <URL> if you are interested . There are 2 basic scenarios here in the US , towered and un-towered operations . There can be a noise abatement or related procedure in place in both cases and it is both the pilots and towers ( when applicable ) responsibility for knowing them and abiding by them . Some of them may be set in place by local governments ( if its say a municipal airport ) and you may face local legal action for violating them . At a towered airport that has a noise abatement the tower will generally not vector you to that area or have you use a given runway provide conditions allow . For example when I fly out of KPNE there is an abatement in place , in this case they only list Rwy 15 arrival ( stay above the glide slope ) however there is another abatement in place on the weekends to keep you from flying over the heavily residential areas early in the morning . The tower vectors you appropriately for that one . <URL> ( <URL> ) At un-towered airports there may be a published noise abatement that you are requested to follow . For example I fly out of KDYL which has a noise abatement in place ( to keep you from flying over downtown ) . In this case we can see it noted in the AFD . Although its not fully explained the procedures are for RW 23 turn to 250 as soon as practically possible , for RW05 no turns under 1200 ft. and there are no touch and go 's at any time . <URL> ( <URL> ) In both cases the procedures have a similar outcome to what you have described , keep the airplanes away form the populated areas . The procedures vary heavily per airport and scenario but all generally strive for the same outcome . The <URL> but also provides contact info for directly reporting to the FAA . You can single out a given aircraft by accurately reporting the time of the incident ( and if its visible ) describing the aircraft . Granted it can be difficult at an un-towered field to know who exactly was departing if no one was around to see it or on the radio to hear it . Once reported the local authorities may have the right to fine you for the violation ( if that is the punishment on the books ) . For example in the <URL> . <URL> If a plane violates the Noise Ordinance , how much are they fined ? The initial phases of our violation process are educational : the first time an owner/operator violates , they will receive a complete packet including a copy of our Noise Ordinance , an outline of what the infraction was , a letter from GANC offering assistance with procedures , and a warning letter asking them to contact noise abatement staff . The second violation involves a notification letter of infraction and a request for a written noise abatement program , where we ask the owner/operator to communicate how they plan to operate without violating our ordinance in the future . The third violation is a fine of $ 100 dollars . The fourth and every subsequent fine of 300 dollars . Please note that Military aircraft are exempt from this policy . And it looks like , <URL> , the airport manager issues the fine and the payments go to the airport . This may vary by jurisdiction on how they chose to govern things like this . Over all the answer to your question is , yes airports can fine pilots ( well really owner/operators ) for noise violations . There are also <URL> that deal with engine noise but are generally handled during the certification phase of the air frame . This helps to reduce airport noise overall . As for global regulations the <URL> with the <URL> . ICAO has a set of policies you can <URL> .
In Canada , you are required to have 40 hours of ground school instruction . See <URL> : completed a minimum of 40 hours private pilot aeroplane ground school instruction on the following subjects ... Ground school instruction is defined as ( <URL> ) : classroom-type instruction generally given to one or more persons and covering an organized program of lectures , homework or self-paced study that adheres to an approved training program . So , you can learn by self-study , but it needs to be an approved training program . This would mean that a flight instructor would need to sign off on the self-study program . <URL> : If you are unable to attend a ground school , the self-study method can be satisfactory , provided you obtain the proper study materials and devote a reasonable amount of time to study . The regulation is at <URL> : Received an endorsement , if required by this part , from an authorized instructor certifying that the applicant accomplished the appropriate ground-training or a home-study course required by this part for the certificate or rating sought and is prepared for the knowledge test ... Because in both cases an instructor must sign off on your preparedness for the examination , and passing the examination demonstrates that you meet the standard , in my opinion , the only thing that would make self-study a bad idea is if self-study is not an effective learning method for you , which could delay your training .
Well , I have two answers for you - one personal , and one practical : Personally , as a pilot ( and very occasional airline passenger ) I think anyone operating a drone should be required to get a pilot 's license of some kind . Maybe I 'm just grumpy , but I spent a lot of time cramming the skills and knowledge into my brain that are required to safely operate in the US National Airspace System . It can get pretty complicated and crowded up there , and I think we need the operators of unmanned aircraft to have a thorough understanding of that . The last thing anyone wants is a UAV smacking into a plane because it wandered somewhere it should n't be PRACTICALLY though , it remains to be seen what regulations the FAA will impose for unmanned civil aircraft - they may require a pilot 's certificate ( speculating : In the category and class equivalent to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle you 'll be operating ) , or they may require a " remote operator 's certificate " of some kind ( perhaps with special emphasis on remote-operation-specific issues like command uplink delay ) , or they may not impose a requirement at all and treat them like model aircraft until the first accident involving one of these things causes a public outcry . <URL> , until the FAA issues a NPRM telling us what they 're thinking of doing here we really wo n't know - your guesses are as good as ours right now . I would suggest at least an Private Pilot Ground School course while you 're gearing up though -- and I would suggest it even if the FAA decides no license is requried for being a UAV operator . The airspace , chart reading , flight planning , and ATC portions of the course are something you 'll probably want to be familiar with ( and are broadly applicable across all kinds of aviation ) , and a good ground school course usually is n't that expensive . ( As to whether you take the knowledge test at the end of the course , that 's up to you -- the results are good for 2 years in case you decide to pursue a pilot certificate , but the test you have to take as a UAV operator may wind up being different from the one you 'd have to take as a private pilot , or may not exist at all , so you might just be setting yourself up for having to take two tests . Again , at this stage your guess would be as good as mine here . )
I 'd recommend reviewing Chart 5-23 from the PA-44 POH - Climb performance one engine operating - gear up for specific numbers based on aircraft weight and atmospherics . If you 're not seeing a positive rate of climb at your best rate of climb , single engine airspeed , then you 're not going to see it at the best angle of climb airspeed single engine either . By definition , Vyse is the best rate of climb that you 're going to see on a single engine ; any other airspeed , including Vxse , is going to give you a lower rate of climb , or greater rate of descent if a positive rate is not possible . And attempting to acquire and hold Vxse you 're getting close to the reverse side of the power curve , combined with ever decreasing rudder authority , it would be easy to have the aircraft drop below Vmc and depart from controlled flight .
First , let 's see whether it 's legal . <URL> notes that : 7 . EXPLANATION OF CHANGES . The following changes apply to all LAHSO . a. ... b. Solo student pilots will not conduct LAHSO . However , you could interpret that as not applicable to your situation , as you are not the sole occupant of the aircraft : <URL> ( a ) General . ... The term " solo flight " as used in this subpart means that flight time during which a student pilot is the sole occupant of the aircraft ... Though it might be allowed , note it does not say must : <URL> ... Student pilots or pilots not familiar with LAHSO should not participate in the program . I 'd recommend against doing so because LAHSO can add to your workload , especially if you 're a bit nervous on your checkride . Also , the AIM note on discouraging LAHSO is rather valid and if done improperly , can affect safety . Having said that , the examiner is likely to ask questions on LAHSO during your practical examination , especially since <URL> . This may include : Requirements to accept a LAHSO clearance ATC pharseology for LAHSO Pilot responsibilities while carrying out LAHSO In any case , always remember that you do not need to accept a LAHSO clearance -- if you do not feel comfortable with doing so , ATC will provide arrangements to land full-length on the same runway or another one . You should not accept a LAHSO clearance if you believe doing so would compromise safety . Note : this does not necessarily apply to all situations where a student pilot is prohibited from doing something that a private pilot would be able to do .

How to find past flight routes between 1977/82 Latin America and the former Soviet Union ?
Here are <URL> . In 1977 , from Latin America , <URL> Lima > Havana > Lisbon > Frankfurt > Moscow Mexico City > Havana > Lisbon > Frankfurt > Moscow It seems unlikely there were scheduled stops not listed , as if you 're including a 1h10m refuelling stop at Lisbon you may as well list them all :-) . Note that most of the international flights ( perhaps all the long-distance ones ? ) went into Moscow ; there were a few into Leningrad but all European routes . However , it is possible that Aeroflot provided a charter-type service to collect foreign students ( especially if it was some kind of large-scale state-backed scholarship scheme ) . In which case ... the " hopping " route and then to Leningrad ( via a fuelling stop somewhere ) seems quite plausible , but finding documentation on it forty years later would be incredibly challenging .
Your friend is right . Elevator trim is n't setting a pitch , it is compensating for control forces on the elevator , which vary with speed . If you are trimmed for level flight at 100 kias and reduce power the plane will initially slow . As it slows the trim will cause a nose-down moment causing the plane to pitch down . Given no input , the plane will equilibrate at whatever nose-down pitch is needed to regain the forces it was trimmed for , which means speeding back up to 100 kias . You are correct that to maintain 100 kias with reduced power the nose should be lowered , but the trim will take care of that for you . You might have a misconception about how trim works , based on your argument . A typical trim setup in light airplanes is essentially another control surface on the elevator : <URL> The elevator is the large control surface and that smaller control surface is the elevator trim . When you adjust the pitch trim you are adjusting this trim tab which provides a force on the elevator that counters aerodynamic forces . This is why the airplane responds in pitch to maintain constant aerodynamic forces ( e.g. constant indicated airspeed ) for a given trim setting . You can test this in the airplane easily . Take your plane up to the altitude you practice maneuvers at , set 75 % power ( or some other number ) and trim for straight and level . Add power and watch the plane climb , decrease power and watch it descent , both without touching the trim . Go back to straight and level and trimmed and accelerate without climbing -- note you are having to retrim as your speed increases . Decelerate without descending -- note you are retrimming as your speed decreases .
With many airplanes the longevity of the engine is a major factor in the price of the aircraft . Piston aircraft engines are generally good for 2000 hours of operation before they need to be overhauled , which is almost always painfully expensive . The more life left on the engine the higher the value of the airplane . SMOH and SFOH both have to do with the time since the engine was overhauled , both are in hours : SFOH = Since Factory Overhaul SMOH = Since Major Overhaul A factory overhaul means that the engine was sent back to the manufacturer for its overhaul , where a major overhaul could be done by anyone . In general factory overhauls are consistently good whereas non-factory overhauls vary more in quality . Factory overhauls are more expensive as a result . If you see an airplane that has 300 hours since overhaul then there 's plenty of life left , if you see one that has 1700 hours on the clock you know you are going to have to fork out a lot of cash much sooner , but you can get the airplane much cheaper . Another acronym you may see is SPOH , that is Since Prop Overhaul . Variable pitch propellers also have mandatory servicing requirements , and although less expensive it 's still not cheap , so a factor in the cost of the airplane .
There is certainly a difference , but most of it definitely has a good explanation . Most of it is overhead such as taxi time that applies to both flights ( almost ) equally . This has a relative big impact on short flights . The taxi out time for both flights will be about <URL> is not exactly known for its quiet taxiways . Both flights will add about 30 nautical mile for their departure route . Both flights will fly approximately great circle routes , probably less than 2 % extra distance during cruise . The LAX flight will typically do a straight in arrival , almost no extra distance there . The DEN flight will typically do a full arrival , 30 NM extra distance there . The taxi in at <URL> on average , and <URL> . Let 's assume that both aircraft fly 460 knot true airspeed with 20 knots headwind during cruise , so 440 knots ground speed . My estimates for the total flight times are then : JFK-LAX GC distance 2150 n.m Departure detour 30 n.m Arrival detour 0 n.m ( straight in ) Cruise detour 25 n.m Total distance 2205 n.m Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 2085 n.m. @ 440 kts = 4 hour 44 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 12 minutes Total time : 5h50 minutes Margin : 10 minutes JFK-DEN GC distance 1400 n.m. Departure detour 30 n.m. Arrival detour 30 n.m. Cruise detour 15 n.m. Total distance 1475 n.m. Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 1355 n.m. @ 440 kts = 3 hour 05 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 9 minutes Total time : 4h07 minutes Margin : 33 minutes
Each airborne flight has only one flightplan , which was submitted for that particular flight . The routing is embedded into that flightplan and only that one routing is valid for that flight . In case the routing is no longer available for the next flight due to airspace closure via NOTAM or airways being restricted by time of flight / day of flight , another routing will be used for that flight and submitted in the flightplan . In case the routing needs to be changed for an already airborne flight , a new IFR clearance is read to the crew en-route , which alters the existing flightplan . Alternate routings are usually managed by the airline 's dispatch / planning centre and the best routing for a specific flight is created by the dispatchers , taking into account weather , NOTAMS , restrictions and many other factors . En-route changes to a flightplan are made by ATC units and their data processing centres , if an impromptu change needs to be made due to airspace closures or other restrictions coming into effect which were unforseen .
Going around is a process , pulling up is an action . When ATC tells you to go around or you say you are going around it means you are initiating a set of actions to abort an approach . Pulling up is a single action , i.e. increasing the angle of attack in order to climb , and would be part of a go-around procedure . Pull up is a non-standard phrase , in most parts of the world at least , but you might hear it as ' pull up and go around ' in Canada . It also might be used in urgent situations to urge a pilot to act to avoid an obstacle or collision .
<URL> The probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew 's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach , including the published missed approach procedure , which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain . <URL> According to released information this cargo aircraft overran the runway after the crew aborted the take-off above Vr after experiencing pitch control problems . The final report of this accident is not yet published but a preliminary report is available . The investigation focusses on the payload distribution which may have caused imbalance leading to the perceived control problems . <URL> The aircraft crashed on final approach in low visibility conditions ( 800 meters ) . During the initial approach the crew had requested and ILS approach ( precision approach ) to runway 02 but then changed their minds and asked for a VOR approach ( non-precision approach ) to runway 20 . During the approach , after deactivation of the autopilot , the aircraft deviated 340 meters to the left and the crew subsequently announced they were going around . Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit tree tops and impacted residential buildings . The final report is expected in October 2015 . To me it seems the probable cause is the failure of the flight crew to properly execute the published instrument approach including the published missed approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft impacting the trees and buildings . <URL> The investigation into this accident is still running , only some preliminary information has been published . Preliminary data indicates that about 36 seconds after takeoff the engine no. 2 auto-feathered , about 46 seconds subsequent to auto-feather the engine no. 1 was shut off by the crew , resulting in loss of all thrust . The aircraft subsequently descended , stalled and crashed into a river . ATR-42 , 16 August 2015 , Trigana Air Service Flight 257 This accident occurred just a couple of days ago so there are few facts known yet and no preliminary findings are published . I will not speculate about the probable cause of this accident . The common thread in the first four accidents seems to be the failure to comply with established procedures resulting in the loss of the aircraft . In two cases ( Lao Airlines Flight 301 and TransAsia Airways Flight 222 ) the flight crew flew a controllable aircraft into the ground . In the case of the Air Niugini crash improper loading of the aircraft is likely to be the cause , resulting in the aircraft being not trimmed correctly for take-off . The crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 235 is the only crash that involved an aircraft system malfunction ( engine 2 failure ) . However , the ATR-72 can fly on a single engine so the failure itself should not have been fatal . The crew then shut down the other engine ( number 1 ) which sealed the aircraft 's fate . It is too early to conclude that the crew did n't follow the correct procedures here ; for example there may have been ambiguous indications from the engine instruments that led them to believe that engine no. 1 had failed . However with the information currently available it seems that the crew did not follow the correct procedures for shutting down a failed engine . The high number of crashes involving an ATR aircraft seems not to be related to the model itself , but to the safety culture and lack of training within a number of airlines operating the aircraft .

Yes there is a distinction , pitch , roll and heading are angles [ unit = radian ] and latitude , longitude and altitude are linear distances [ unit = meter ] . Together , these six parameters define the six Degrees of Freedom that define the momentary state of a rigid object with reference to the earth . All six are defined relative to earth axes . For the linear dimensions this is clear , we just need to define a suitable zero point . For the angles : Pitch is the nose up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Roll is the wingtip up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Heading is the angle relative to a suitable earth reference , usually magnetic north or geographical north . Conversion of aircraft axes into earth axes is a non-trivial matter and the cause of much confusion , for instance in questions comparing lift to weight : lift is always coupled to aircraft axes , weight to earth axes . The axes sets are defined as follows : Aircraft axes Origin : Centre of Gravity of aircraft X-axis : in the symmetry plane of the aircraft , + = forward to the aircraft nose Y-axis : in the span wise direction of the aircraft , + = to the right wingtip Z-axis : perpendicular to the XOY-plane , + = down into the floor . Earth axes Origin : Centre of Gravity at the start of the response X-axis : In the horizontal plane ( relative to gravity ) , + = pointing north . Y-axis : Perpendicular to XOZ-plane , + = pointing east . Z-axis : Pointing to the centre of the earth = + Edit Yes navigation lat/lon is given in [ degrees ] - the INS sensor ultimately converts displacement into proper navigational definitions of course . But for measuring 3-D aircraft inertial effects the SI system is used , and displacement is internally treated as a linear motion , units [ metres ] .
I 'm not at all sure what you 're asking , but maybe I can at least point you towards more information . First , the parts you mentioned define operating rules for different flight types ( I 'm simplifying a bit here ) : <URL> : rules for all flights in the US <URL> : rules for flights by a US airline <URL> : rules for flights by a foreign airline in the US <URL> : rules for ' on demand ' ( usually charter ) flights by a US operator Any given flight will operate under one or more of those sets or rules , e.g. a US airline flight from New York to Los Angeles would follow the rules in parts 91 and 121 ; a foreign flight from London to New York would follow parts 91 and 129 ( while in US airspace ) . Individual operators and airlines also have <URL> that are approved by the FAA and that can add more rules for specific situations . And I 'm not entirely sure , but it looks like <URL> effectively applies part 121 to foreign airlines too , by requiring them to comply with the same rules as US airlines : ( c ) Each foreign air carrier shall conform to the practices , procedures , and other requirements prescribed by the Administrator for U.S. air carriers for the areas to be operated in . Without knowing what your mysterious problem was ( and I understand you ca n't share it ) , I do n't think it 's possible to say much more than that . ( By the way , " filing " is something different . Filing a flight plan is required <URL> but they apply to all aircraft , even private flights . If I want to fly a C172 under IFR then I have to file essentially the same flight plan information that an A380 pilot will file . )
Polar curves for older airliners can be found in lecture notes or technical publications . The drag polars of the most recent ones , where no independent measurement is yet possible , are a closely guarded secret . If you see something , it will be restricted such that an important part of the puzzle is missing . For the polars to be meaningful , you need aircraft mass and flight conditions , air temperature and density and sometimes also engine thrust information to make any meaningful comparisons . Also be aware that the Airbus method to determine the reference area is different from Boeing 's , but at least those methods are published . Full disclosure is only available to potential customers on the basis of an Non-Disclosure Agreement ( NDA ) .
Here is a plot of cabin pressure on one flight . You can see a small increase in pressure right before takeoff . The decrease and increase in pressure is fairly constant during climb and descent . The pressure will change based on the aircraft 's altitude , and will not reach a minimum limit until closer to the aircraft 's service ceiling . This keeps pressure changes as slow as possible while giving a lower cabin altitude when below the service ceiling . <URL>
Nice question . There are several ways how to get these information . <URL> : free to use , no registration needed . World database of the airports and waypoints . From these information you could easily make DB for waypoints . EUROCONTROL EAD ( <URL> ) : free to use , registration needed . Big advantage - real and up to date information for all ECTL countries . But a bit difficult navigation . JeppView ( <URL> ) : very expensive SW , but the best in this time . You will find there all information which pilot needs . But it is not real database . Garmin for pilots ( <URL> ) : another not free SW , very similair to JeppView but lightweighted . NAVIGRAPH ( <URL> ) : Great DB of all things which you need in FMC . But I guess that they have it just for flight simulator . OpenFlights ( <URL> ) : free DB of airports , airlines and routes . You could downlod all data in one file :-)
The simplest thing is to ask someone local where runups are usually done : the FBO , Ground Control or another pilot . If you ca n't find out then you can do them anywhere you like as long as it 's safe . Some airports have specific runup areas but they are n't always obvious . For example , KPDK has runup areas at both ends of taxiway A , they 're shown on the <URL> as ' bulges ' in the taxiway but they are n't labelled . You might notice them when you land and taxi but you might not . I 've circled one of the runup areas in red here : <URL> If there are no runup areas , the ' default ' location is the one you remember from training : on the taxiway just before reaching the runway , angled into the wind . If the taxiway is wide enough , you can move to the edge so that other aircraft can pass you if they 're ready before you . That 's very common and it 's what many pilots will expect you to do , even if you have to block the taxiway for a couple of minutes . This is where you have to use some judgement : if you know that you need to take your time on runups - perhaps it 's an unfamiliar aircraft , or you 've just had maintenance done and you 're double-checking everything - then you might look for another spot where you wo n't be in the way . Blocking other aircraft from reaching the runway is always a possibility , but at airports with a lot of GA traffic - and especially a lot of flight training - it 's common and just something to be expected . That does n't mean you should take forever doing your checks and of course some other pilots will always get annoyed at even minor delays , but if the only safe place to do runups is the taxiway then just do them there and the others will wait . Another option is to do runups on the ramp or before entering the <URL> so that you do n't block other aircraft anywhere . That 's especially important at airports with scheduled commercial flights because they usually have very precise departure times and getting stuck behind another aircraft for even a few minutes could be an issue . If you 're in that environment , then you should definitely check with Ground Control what they want you to do . But be careful about doing runups on the ramp because of people and vehicles moving around . Also be wary about doing runups a long way from the runway : during a long taxi you might change something ( e.g. the mixture or fuel controls ) and then forget to reset it for takeoff . The one place you should never do runups is on the runway itself . Sitting there for several minutes blocking the runway for landing traffic and unable to see final approach behind you is n't a good position to put yourself in . Finally , avoiding blowing debris into other aircraft should be simple : just look around you , and do n't position the aircraft so that your prop blast is going somewhere it should n't .
Data Bus A quick Google search suggests the general approach is to minimise wiring by using a data-bus approach to carry information from multiple sources along a minimum number of wires See <URL> In earlier analogue avionic systems the number of cables used to transfer information between the various system components was considerable . With these systems , at least one pair of wires has been required for each signal and so a typical installation requires several pairs of wires . With the equivalent digital systems , all the analogue signals are converted into their equivalent and are assigned unique address labels to ensure there are no conflicts . These signals are then transmitted down a single pair of wires , which makes up a data bus . Aircraft data bus systems allow a wide variety of avionics equipment to communicate with one another and exchange data . The type of language used on an aircraft data bus is known as the protocol . There are currently different data bus standards ( protocols ) that currently account for most of the avionics data interchange on today 's aircraft , and these are : ARINC 429 , ARINC 629 , MILSTD 1553 , MIL-STD 1773 , CSDB and ASCB . I imagine that smoke detectors are just one example of the types of sensor that are integrated into such data-bus systems . I expect there are several data-bus systems for redundancy and perhaps to isolate different categories of data .

Been waiting for an answer but none coming so - guesswork and experience , since no citations or direct knowledge . It 's a mixture of both . Often , cockpit to cabin communication is one to one . Rather than use the cabin address , the crew will call a specific station for example , the rear galley . So if the captain wants a coffee , they will not use the cabin address , nor is there any need for a formalised language . Other comms may be most effective using cabin address but still not needing a formalised language , for example . This call would only happen after the passengers are belted in , since you are already in turbulence and the cabin crew do n't need a formal instruction to buckle up . In my experience , the initial call to warn of turbulence ahead is made one to one to a specific station , usually the purser or senior cabin crew member . That person will then instruct the rest of the crew . The fact that the crew has been asked to sit , means that the carts will be stowed and the cabin prepared . It 's just a part of their routine . In the case of unexpected heavy or severe turbulence , the crew probably do not need a call , since they know about it at the same moment the cockpit crew know but , a specific instruction might be given to indicate urgency . Some comms are most effective with an address and a formal command , for example . This is a safety critical procedure and is therefore specifically addressed ( " cabin crew " ) and a precise instruction ( " doors to automatic " , " cross check " ) . It was doors to automatic , not manual , and check the opposite door to make sure the person responsible for that door has done it , and done it correctly . Note that this particular command is normally given by the purser or senior member , and not from the flight deck . There is also a call to " all stations " which will call all the station phones and whichever crew member picks up will deal with the comms . As far as I know , the precise wording of instructions is not regulated but is part of company SOPs and check lists .
Flight testing is the process ( usually involving a number of test flights ) by which the capabilities and performance of and aircraft ( usually a new one or one which is substantially modified ) are established . Test flight refers to an individual flight which is used for testing purpose . it can be used either as part of flight testing or as a standalone for testing some minor modification .
Do n't use the autopilot , use the trim , and look outside ! Fixating on the instruments will not make you better . Know the sight picture out the windshield and what wing looks like in relation to the horizon . Set 25 ' altitude brackets and 2 ° heading brackets and hold yourself to them . It 'll seem impossible but you 'll get better . Set those brackets with the intent to hold them by looking outside , not chasing needles in the cockpit . Fly using the actual horizon as your reference , which is safer anyway , and make minor adjustments based on a periodic instrument scan that should become less and less frequent as you get better ( think 10-15sec between scans to start ) . Hold heading based on distant objects , not the compass or DG . Finally , use the trim . If it takes more than two fingers to adjust pitch , you are not trimmed . If you fly a plane with a trim wheel between the seats get used to resting your hand on it . Every time you change the power setting , retrim . In an updraft ? Retrim . Down draft ? Retrim . It 'll become second nature in no time .
You can find much of this sort of information at <URL> For example , searching for <URL> lists their fleet , and clicking the number of active for a model ( eg <URL> ) will list the tail number and other interesting information . From there you can click a <URL> for all the information along with a picture .
<URL> is the force or wind generated behind a jet engine , particularly on or before takeoff when high/full power is set , but also when the aircraft is taxiing . When an object moves through air ( or some other medium , e.g. a spoon through nutella ) , air is disturbed . This disturbance or <URL> is known as <URL> . It can also be called <URL> . The difference is that jet blast is only because of engines . Jet wash or prop wash or wake turbulence is because the airplane moves through air . If Mr Kevin Fast runs at say 100 mph doing this ( see picture below ) , you can notice significant wake turbulence , although the engines are off and there is no jet blast .

Is there an ARINC label/data that can be associated with a gyroscope 's precession ?
Short answer : No easy way . It may be possible for a crew to detect some drift by comparing the IRS mag heading to the magnetic compass . This does have problems though as the IRS does n't really ' measure ' mag heading . It works in true heading and calculates mag heading by applying a magvar correction from a table . Modern aircraft do not have free gyros that output data . They have inertial reference systems ( IRS ) . The IRS has multiple gyros and accelerometers and outputs a complete navigation solution . They also have an internal GPS ( or an input from an external GPS ) to improve their accuracy . So there 's not a lot of ' drift ' in the output solution . These units have internal integrity monitors and will report a fault to the crew if the nav solution exceeds limits . In some failure modes the IRS will revert to an attitude only mode ( ATT ) that just outputs raw rates and accelerations ( free-gyro mode ) . In this case , the crew can provide a heading update to set a heading . This will drift just like a stand-alone directional gyro . The crew will have to check it regularly against the mag compass and update as necessary ( ~ every 10 minutes ) .
There 's no tangible benefit to having a GROL in getting a pilots license of any kind as getting the license generally confers the right to use aircraft radios . In some places you need to get an RT license for aviation as a separate test , however that 's pretty minimal . A GROL is only good for repairing , maintaining , and running certain types of radio stations . An A&amp;P will let you work on airplanes , but it also does not help get a license . An A&amp;P will give you insights into how an airplane works , but you can get those insights without an A&amp;P . Having an A&amp;P and a pilots license might be a different story if you plan to work in remote locations where being able to fix your aircraft when it breaks is useful . It wo n't help you get a flying job in most places .
I would say yes you can as per the FAR as I read them the limitations on a PPL are § 61.113 ( a ) Except as provided in paragraphs ( b ) through ( h ) of this section , no person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire ; nor may that person , for compensation or hire , act as pilot in command of an aircraft So you cant act as Pilot In Command for hire or if there are passengers on board ( which in this case I assume there are not ) however if we look at the FAR for the official definition of " Pilot In Command " we will find Pilot in command means the person who : ( 1 ) Has final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight ; ( 2 ) Has been designated as pilot in command before or during the flight ; and ( 3 ) Holds the appropriate category , class , and type rating , if appropriate , for the conduct of the flight . The question is does taxing count as a " Flight " . I would think it does not and moving the aircraft around is part of maintenance ( thats how they log the hours on the trainer planes I rent ) . The FAR definitions section ( § 1.1 ) does not seem to contain one for " flight " so that may be open to interpretation . But as I read it you can taxi the aircraft for compensation as its not a " Flight " and thus you are not the Pilot In Command which is when the PPL rules would come into play in my opinion . However section § 65.81 states However , he may not supervise the maintenance , preventive maintenance , or alteration of , or approve and return to service , any aircraft or appliance , or part thereof , for which he is rated unless he has satisfactorily performed the work concerned at an earlier date . The key line ( Bolded ) is return to service . If Taxing counts as returned to service then ( unless rated to do so ) you may not be able to for this reason ( nothing to do with compensation ) . Note : I am not a lawyer nor an aircraft mechanic and can not guarantee that my assumptions are correct . The opinions stated above should not be used as official legal advice and there may be more information in the FAR that I have not come across . This was compiled after some quick reading and searching in the assumed correct places . Note 2 : I would assume that in a commercial setting ( and really any setting ) there are some insurance implications to this kind of operation ( especially with large aircraft ) . This may almost be a bigger concern than the legality of it ( although both are important ) . You would not want to get into the situation where you may be legally allowed to drive the plane on the tarmac but are not covered by the company 's insurance . Should you get into an accident you or your shop may become liable for the damages .
Yes . The <URL> avionics suite for the Cirrus SR-22 is equipped with a yaw damper in its GFC-700 AFCS . <URL> The King KAP140 autopilot also offers a yaw damper function for aircraft with a servo controlled rudder trim . <URL>

There is always a backup radio system as well as a several backup systems like for example a backup CWP ( controller worker position ) in case the primary fails . PANS-ATM ( ICAO doc 4444 ) in chapter mentions that Operational and technical issues to ensure that : [ ... ] communications , navigation , surveillance and other safety significant systems and equipment [ ... ] include adequate backup facilities and/or procedures in the event of a system failure or degradation . Emphasis is mine . Also there is a standby generator ( or even more than one ) that has to instantly take over in case of power supply failure but I ca n't find any regulations at the moment . As for the " what happens if the backup fails as well " question , we need to see the fuller picture that the document provides : d ) communications , navigation , surveillance and other safety significant systems and equipment : 1 ) are tested for normal operations on a routine basis ; 2 ) meet the required level of reliability and availability as defined by the appropriate authority ; 3 ) provide for the timely and appropriate detection and warning of system failures and degradations ; 4 ) include documentation on the consequences of system , subsystem and equipment failures and degradations ; 5 ) include measures to control the probability of failures and degradations ; and 6 ) include adequate backup facilities and/or procedures in the event of a system failure or degradation ; Emphasis is again mine As you can see backup is the last line of defense . An ATS unit should ensure that equipment is regularly maintained , it 's monitored , it 's tested and any failures should be prevented if possible and their impact being documented . If everything else fails , then you use the backup . And again the " include adequate backup " phrase can be translated as " if one thinks that a second backup is needed they should install one " . But the previous 5 clauses are there to eliminate that case .
There is quite a lot written on the topic , especially as part of " ground effect " vehicles research . For example , <URL> cite two different types of lift coefficient . The first one ( simpler and given here ) is based on flat plate airfoils and is a modification to the well-known $ \ frac { dC_l } { d \ alpha } = 2 \ pi $ : $ $ C_L = 2 \ pi \ alpha ( 1 + \ delta ^ 2 ) ( 1-2 \ zeta ) $ $ with $ $ \ zeta = \ frac { \ sin \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ and $ $ \ delta = \ frac { \ cos \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ In the above expressions , $ h $ is the height of the wing above the surface ( ground , water , etc. ) , $ c $ is the chord and $ \ alpha $ is the angle of attack . I strongly recommend you check out " ground effect " / " Ekranoplan " literature - should be useful .
I think you 're overlooking the primary reason pilots fly instrument approaches : the conditions do not permit flight by visual reference . The fact that a PAPI provides vertical guidance is more or less useless if you ca n't see it . Most ILS approaches involve a descent of at least 1500 ' from glideslope intercept . If you break out from the clouds at ILS minimums , you can be as low as 200 ' above the runway surface ; at 3 ° , that 's around 3/4 miles from the touchdown zone and the PAPI . It 's highly unlikely that the PAPI would be visible prior to that point , meaning the approach would be made with purely lateral guidance .
Spoofing GPS means broadcasting a false GPS signal - This is harder than jamming GPS which can be done relatively easily by broadcasting a strong random signal at the relevent carrier frequencies . GPS receivers use GPS ephemeris tables which tell them where exactly they should expect each satellite to be . So the false GPS signal has to look enough like a real GPS signal that the receiver will accept it and use it 's transmitted data in it 's calculations . Of course , if , for example , the expansionist president of a country with advanced avionics capability decided to supply sophisticated equipment and the associated personnel to a separatist group in a neighbouring country , it might be possible for them to bring about this kind of result . There have been <URL> of this kind of spoofing actually happening , so it appears to be possible . The U of Texas students built a GPS spoofing device for about $ 3,000 . A pair of students , the " attackers , " then sat aboard the upper deck of the White Rose , where their GPS spoofer emitted a counterfeit signal slightly stronger than the real GPS signal . This was a yacht at sea , presumably out of sight of land on a featureless ocean . It may be more difficult to achieve this with an airliner , which have a variety of navigational instruments , including radio navigation beacon receivers . Inconsistent indications may alert the pilot to a problem . Non-GPS navigational instruments/systems that may be found in an aircraft include : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>
I will answer this for the US as that is the jurisdiction I know best . There are no airspace or ATC usage fees here in the US . The airspace and its resources are free for any plane of any size that conforms to the <URL> and is legal to fly in a given airspace . The <URL> for aircraft that fly through our airspace but neither land nor depart from the US . The only fee ( somewhat indirectly related but not a component of the airspace its self ) is for planes coming in from abroad who will need to pay <URL> . Strictly speaking you may be required to carry IFR charts or VFR charts on board to conduct the flight in question in US airspace . These must be <URL> . The FAA maintains them but the Pilot must pay for them . <URL> and they were purchased directly from them but this is no longer the case . If you extend the question to include airports the answer will drastically change for the US .
Unlikely . The extra fuel burned would cost a lot more than the required Avionics upgrade . Both the 75/767 would be well below optimum cruise level .
Well , sort of . In Class G airspace you often find ATZs . This is airspace 2nmi radius to 2,000 ft around an aerodrome that is controlled by the aerodrome so take-off and landings . They are often not surrounded by Class-A or Class-D airspace and just control the immediate area around the aerodrome , and are full ATC unit , although sometimes only an AFIS . So , there is a little controlled airspace associated with it , but very little . An aircraft must have permission to penetrate it . In the UK a clear example is EGCL ( Fenland ) . However , if you count this as too much controlled airspace for your question , then no . It would not be practical to control landings or take-off when the aircraft is immediately in uncontrolled airspace . <URL>
the communication between the cockpit and the controllers is done by using Arinc protocols . And the data transmitted by probes to the controllers is done by CAN . That depends very much on the aircraft type . And when can we use each one of them ( Arinc and CAN ) When you design your own aircraft you get to choose . CAN stands for <URL> . CAN is a bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer . It has its origins in the automotive industry . ARINC stands for <URL> , Incorporated . ARINC is an organisation that amongst other activities produces technical standards for avionics and provides services to aircraft operators . Amongst the ARINC standards there are a number addressing data communications between avionics components . Most widely used is the <URL> standard which describes an avionics data bus . ARINC 429 allows a single transmitter to communicate data to up to 20 receivers over a single bus . Comparing CAN bus to ARINC 429 : Cable CAN : STP or UPT , possible to implement on fiberoptic cable ARINC 429 : STP Speed CAN : 1 Mbit/s ( high speed ) / 125 Kbit/s ( low speed ) ARINC 429 100Kbit/s ( high speed ) / 10-14 Kbit/s ( low speed ) Directionality CAN : bi-directional , connected units can send and receive on the same cable . ARINC 429 : uni-directional , a unit either transmits or receives from a cable . Number of units on a single bus CAN : unlimited , although in practice no more than about 32 units will be sharing a bus to avoid data collisions . ARINC 429 : one transmitter can serve at most 20 receiving units on a single cable . Since ARINC 429 has only a single transmitter , timely data arrival is guaranteed , while CAN has to incorporate transmission collision detection &amp; correction which incurs non deterministic time overhead . On the other hand , ARINC 429 only uses a parity bit for bit level error detection whilst CAN allows for various methods including CRC checks Some of this data is obtained from an article on CAN bus in <URL> . Newer ARINC busses like 629 or <URL> allow for higher speeds and bi-directional communication . These may eventually replace ARINC 429 ( but never underestimate how slow progress in aviation is )
Military aircraft rarely have any sort of keys or any sort of authentication systems , they rely on physical security measures to prevent people from getting to the airplanes in the first place , like fences , dogs , cameras , guards , and of course guns . If there were no physical barriers then you have 3 major barriers to being able to steal a fighter jet : Support : just about every military fighter aircraft has an assigned crew to prepare it for flight and help the pilot ( s ) get in it . Without this crew you 'd have to get the airplane powered up , fueled up , and then you 'd have to figure out how to get into it and get the ladder removed . There 's a lot of knowledge you 'd need to do all this , just knowing how to open the canopy is n't going to be immediately obvious Starting : starting up a fighter is n't like starting a car , you do n't hit a button and everything happens for you , there 's fuel tanks and pumps , hydraulic systems , electrical systems , and engine management . You 'd have to know where to find all of the switches , dials and levers , and the sequence in which to use them . This is n't something you 'd be able to guess , you 'd need knowledge of the particular airplane Flying : high performance jets are challenging to fly , and by flying I mean aviating , navigating , and communicating . Although modern fighters have a lot of computers to help out with this the systems require a great deal of training to use , and if you do n't know exactly what you are doing you are most likely going to dig a big hole in the ground If you know how to start and fly the airplane there 's nothing stopping you from doing it , provided you can solve the problems of prepping and getting in the airplane . In fact , it 's been done when pilots defect with their airplanes , see the comments below for some great examples .
Yes , the SR-72 project has indeed been officially announced . Lockheed <URL> back in 2013 . Apparently it actually did get quite a bit of attention at the time , enough to actually <URL> The source quoted in the question is correct that Lockheed 's announcement did confirm that the SR-72 would be hypersonic : But now Lockheed Martin believes it has the answer . " The Skunk Works has been working with Aerojet Rocketdyne for the past seven years to develop a method to integrate an off-the-shelf turbine with a scramjet to power the aircraft from standstill to Mach 6 plus , " says Brad Leland , portfolio manager for air-breathing hypersonic technologies . Also , from <URL> , confirming both the Mach 6 capability and the intention for it having at least the option of flying unmanned : Envisioned as an unmanned aircraft , the SR-72 would fly at speeds up to Mach 6 , or six times the speed of sound . <URL> , a technology demonstrator aircraft may be flying by 2018 : Lockheed has run scaled tests on components . " The next step would be to put it through a series of tests or critical demonstrations , " Leland says . " We are ready for those critical demonstrations , and we could be ready to do such a demonstration aircraft in 2018 . That would be the beginning of building and running complete critical demonstrations . As of now , there are no technologies to be invented . We are ready to proceed -- the only thing holding us back is the perception that [ hypersonics ] is always expensive , large and exotic . " Here 's a rendering of the proposed design from <URL> : <URL> Source : <URL> , which apparently took it from <URL> . Lockheed was <URL> to study the viability of their proposed combination turbine/ramjet engine solution for the SR-72 . Task Order No.NNC15TA03T provides for a parametric design study to establish the viability of a Turbine Based Combined Cycle ( TBCC ) Propulsion system consisting of integrating several combinations of near-term turbine engine solutions and a very low Mach ignition Dual Mode RamJet ( DMRJ ) in the SR-72 vehicle concept . Task Order NNC15TA03T is issued under Contract NNC10BA08B on a firm fixed price basis . Firm fixed price is $ 892,292 .
As one of my instructors was fond of pointing out , there 's pretty much a regulation for everything -- <URL> which is pretty short and to the point as far as government regulations go . The big rules regarding kites/balloons kick in for a kite " over 5 pounds " or a balloon " over 6 feet in diameter / 115 cubic feet of gas capacity " , and are : You have to keep them at least 500 feet below any clouds . You have to keep them less than 500 feet above the ground . You must be at least 5 miles from the boundary of any airport . If your kite/balloon is going to be more than 150 feet above the surface you 're also supposed to coordinate with the closest ATC facility ( who would theoretically put out a NOTAM saying " John Doe is going to be flying a kite/balloon/thingy here , between these hours . Please try not to hit it . " ) There are also some lighting requirements ( if you fly the balloon/kite at night ) , and visibility requirements ( but really , who wants to fly a kite in less than 3 miles visibility ? That seems like pretty lousy kite weather . ) As a favor to your local pilot community ( and to prevent having your wayward kite dragged off by a Cessna on short final ) it 's probably best to observe the three " big rules " above regardless of the size of your kite - a 6-ounce piece of balsa and cellophane can still make a lot of people 's days more interesting if it appears in an unexpected location .
You kind of have two questions in one - When can I call Clearance Delivery to get my clearance ? and How long is that clearance good for ? <URL> - the local controllers will usually have your clearance 30 minutes before your scheduled departure . Sometimes you can get this information a little earlier yourself - the new Flight Service tools like <URL> can give you expected clearance and flight plan routing information based on what you filed , if the ATC computer already knows what it 's going to do with your flight . <URL> , and you can do the same thing yourself with the Lockheed-Martin tools with a few more manual steps . You still need to talk to the controllers but if you know what they 're going to say it makes that conversation faster ! The second part can go one of two ways : The point of the " void time " is that the ATC system is reserving a spot in the system for you up until that specific time . After that ATC is going to let other aircraft use the airspace they were holding for you ( they may allow someone to make an instrument approach to the airport you 're leaving from , for example ) . This is used a lot for non-towered fields where you have no local controller to talk to . Clearances from Clearance Delivery at a towered field can include a void time , but they generally do n't because they assume you 're in the plane and ready to go at or around the time you call in , and you have local controllers to talk to if you have a problem during the run-up or something which delays your departure . Basically the clearance is good until someone tells you otherwise in that situation . The tool that gets used at towered fields more often is : You 've been issued a clearance , but you ca n't execute it until the tower has coordinated you a spot in the airspace . This is generally more efficient than reserving airspace with a clearance and void time when there are controllers to talk to , and if everything is working well your release should be ready right around the time you 're ready to take the runway for departure .
I ca n't speak for all pilots everywhere , but I 've flown both sticks and yokes from both the right and left seat ( as well as the front and the back seat in tandem aircraft ) and found the adjustment process between switching from right to left hand to be very quick . I found getting used to sight picture differences to be a much bigger challenge and , like many others before me , sideloaded my first few landings ( along with climbing/descending during turns ) until I got the hang of it . Other pilots I 've spoken to about this have expressed the same feelings ; there is a learning curve , but it is by no means insurmountable . At any rate , flying is far more of a mental activity , with masterful physical coordination being surprsingly far down the list of innate qualities a pilot needs . And no , I am not nearly ambidextrous ; in fact , my coordination abilities with my non-dominant hand are hilariously poor , as anyone who 's ever watched my try to toss a tennis ball during a serve can attest .
It 's on <URL> : <URL> RF-85655 's Open Skies flights over the United States since the beginning of 2017 Here you can see <URL> over Washington . Two of the recent routes <URL> . One of them flying as low as 3,800 feet . <URL>
For subsonic aircraft the Mach number is normally measured from dynamic pressure and static pressure , very similar to the way calibrated airspeed is measured . $ $ M_a = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 } { \ gamma-1 } \ left [ \ left ( \ frac { q_c } { p } +1 \ right ) ^ \ frac { \ gamma-1 } { \ gamma } -1 \ right ] } $ $ with : $ M_a $ , the Mach number $ q_c $ , the dynamic pressure $ p $ , the static pressure $ \ gamma $ , the ratio of specific heats ( 1.4 ) If there is an error in the measurement of either the dynamic or the static pressure both the indicated airspeed and Mach number will be affected . Note that the Mach number has no direct dependency on temperature . The true airspeed is calculated by the ADC from the Mach number and the outside air temperature . $ $ V _ { TAS } = M_a \ cdot \ sqrt { \ gamma R T_S } $ $ with $ R$ , the specific gas constant ( 287.05 for dry air ) $ T_S $ , the static air temperature The indicated true airspeed has a direct dependency on the static air temperature ( $ T_S $ , SAT ) also known as the outside air temperature ( OAT ) . The static temperature can not be measured directly since the air will heat up on impact with the temperature sensor due to adiabatic compression . Instead the total air temperature ( $ T _ \ mathrm { total } $ , TAT ) will be measured . The relation between the measured total air temperature and the static temperature is given by : $ $ \ frac { T _ \ mathrm { total } } { T _ { s } } = { 1 + \ frac { \ gamma -1 } { 2 } M_a ^ 2 } $ $ Since the measurement probe may not recover all the energy from the adiabatic heating a correction factor is introduced : $ $ \ frac { T _ \ mathrm { total } } { T _ { s } } = { 1 + \ frac { \ gamma -1 } { 2 } eM_a ^ 2 } $ $ This ' recovery factor ' $ e $ is determined empirically for the temperature sensor used . The display on the EFIS will show the OAT , which may be slightly off if $ e $ is not entirely correct . This will also affect the " true " airspeed indication . To conclude ; anything indicated in the cockpit can contain measurement errors , regardless whether it is called ' indicated ' or ' true ' . With the introduction of digital flight data systems the error correction tables have been moved from the manuals to the computer , which automatically corrects for them .

Can multiple helicopters be used to lift a heavy load ?
Yes , this is possible , as demonstrated in this video from almost 2 years ago : <URL> Each helicopter probably does not weigh more than the woman being lifted . The two helicopters are tilted such that the forces are in equilibrium with no collisions . Both are coordinated as two pilots are flying these by Line-of-Sight .
You have almost solved the problem yourself . The <URL> does not help you because , for some reason , it assumes <URL> to be equal to UTC . For your problem , LMT needs to be for 85 ° of East longitude . So , ignore that website and let 's move on . For every degree of longitude , you calculate 4 minutes of difference from UTC . You have already correctly calculated the LMT difference from UTC for 85 ° E : First of all , what I 've done is converting longitude into time as follows : $ $ t = 85 \ cdot4 = 340 \ hspace { 1mm } min = 5h \ hspace { 1mm } 40m $ $ This leaves you with the question of whether to add or subtract this difference , as you stated : But then , in order to compute the UTC time , what do I have to do , either adding up this time to the current LMT or subtract it ( and what is the reason ) ? Let me start with the reason -- the explanation of why we want to either add or subtract the difference between LMT and UTC -- and then give you the solution . LMT can be thought of as roughly equivalent to time based on the Sun 's position . It is not equivalent to that , which is <URL> , but it is related . Keeping that approximation in mind , consider the difference in time between when the sun reaches solar noon over Delhi , and when the sun reaches solar noon over London . As the earth rotates , the sun reaches solar noon first over Delhi , and then , a few hours later , over London . Thus you know that UTC will be a few hours behind Delhi LMT . This means that you need to subtract the calculated difference between LMT and UTC . Another way to put this is : LMT for East longitude is ahead of UTC ( subtract the difference to find UTC ) , and LMT for West longitude is behind UTC ( add the difference to find UTC ) . Thus a more proper way to perform your calculation mathematically would be to properly incorporate the negative sign : $ $ t = -85 \ cdot4 = -340 \ hspace { 1mm } min = -5 h \ hspace { 1mm } 40m $ $ Therefore , if the LMT in Delhi ( LON = 85 ° E ) is 17:45 , then : $ $ UTC = 12h05m $ $

Can helicopters fly IFR ? <URL> Do they use ILS ? <URL> . The only tricky part of it is the need to be slow at the end of the glide slope . An IFR helicopter can use any of the navigation and landing aids available to any other aircraft . This <URL> is interesting .
Pop out floats can be installed easily on any helicopter with Tubular landing skid type landing gear . Its essentially an auto-inflatable tube attached to the landing gear . Have a look at this :
FAA Advisory Circular ( AC ) <URL> covers " standards and recommendations for airport design . " It does not include any restrictions on proximity to bodies of water , but it does make the following recommendation in paragraph 319 ( a ) : It is recommended that the entire RSA and RPZ be accessible to rescue and fire-fighting vehicles such that no part of the RSA or RPZ is more than 330 feet ( 100 m ) from either an all-weather road or a paved operational surface . Where an airport is adjacent to a body of water where access by rescue personnel from airport property is desirable , it is recommended that boat launch ramps with appropriate access roads be provided . The actual FARs ( <URL> ) also do not state a limit . The only reference to bodies of water of any kind is in § 139.325 ( Airport emergency plan ) paragraph ( e ) : The plan required by this section shall contain provisions , to the extent practicable , for the rescue of aircraft accident victims from significant bodies of water or marsh lands adjacent to the airport which are crossed by the approach and departure flight paths of air carriers . A body of water or marsh land is significant if the area exceeds one-quarter square mile and can not be traversed by conventional land rescue vehicles . To the extent practicable , the plan shall provide for rescue vehicles with a combined capacity for handling the maximum number of persons that can be carried on board the largest air carrier aircraft that the airport reasonably can be expected to serve . So , bottom line : there is no limit , but airports are required to take water into due consideration when developing emergency plans , and the FAA looks at each airport and plan on a case-by-case basis during airport certification . As for the rest of the world , I have no authoritative information ; but as others have posted , it certainly seems like the situation is the same , there being numerous examples of airports worldwide built on natural or reclaimed land very close to water .
Most helicopter do n't carry radar ; there is no need for it . In civil helicopters radar is typically used for weather detection . In most use cases there is not real need for it because helicopters are usually operating under daytime Visual Flight Rules ( VFR ) and are staying away from clouds . For maritime helicopters that are used in search and rescue operations or off-shore operations on oil-rigs , weather is often installed . The typical location is in a radome in the nose of the helicopter . Examples are the <URL> or <URL> Military helicopters use radar for detecting objects . Depending on the nature of the mission the helicopter is designed for , the radar is underneath ( usually for navy operation , providing sea surface detection capabilities , see for example the navy version of the NH90 ) or on top of the rotor ( to look over obstacles such a hills / trees and provide fire control to their missiles ) . An example is the <URL> .
The NTSB defines Destroyed as Damaged due to impact , fire , or in-flight failures to an extent not economically repairable . Another common definition is : The estimated or likely cost of repairs would have exceeded 50 percent of the new value of the airplane had it still been in production at the time of the accident . This fact that the costs of repairing are estimated to be exceed the economical value of the aircraft does technically not prevent the aircraft to be repaired and made flyable again . It can be recertified on the original airworthiness certificate . See <URL> . Special attention needs to be given to the identification plate ( serial numbers etc. ) of the aircraft ; the original plates of the aircraft have to be installed . Do not expect any support from Bell as on their <URL> they state : There are some aircraft that have been destroyed in an accident or retired from service that are no longer considered to be genuine Bell Helicopter Aircraft . These aircraft will not be supported by Bell Helicopter . This makes resurrected Bell helicopters very difficult to sell in the future .
I 'll take a stab at this one , though I ca n't guarantee the correctness of my interpretation ( the regs do n't seem exactly clear on the subject - at least not to me , so there 's a lot more " inference " here than I 'd normally be comfortable with ) . In most cases under Part 91 the only requirement to be a " crewmember " is that the pilot in command says you 're a crewmember -- i.e. the PIC determines that a person is qualified to perform a specific duty and designates them to perform it . In the absence of anything more specific this is the only requirement I can turn up ( and it 's an inferred requirement - I did n't find anything specifically stating this , but <URL> strongly implies that it 's the correct interpretation . There 's also a <URL> which talks a little about who is a " crewmember " for purposes of riding in jumpseats that are placarded " For Crew Use Only " . That interpretation is based on Part 135 , but could be logically extended to Part 91 ( and possibly some 121 ) operations too ) . There are frequently more specific requirements though , particularly for positions that are important to flight operations . For example if you buy yourself a nice shiny <URL> to duplicate Amelia Earhart 's trip under Part 91 rules you still can not simply designate someone off the street to be the Flight Navigator : <URL> , and someone acting as the flight navigator would need to meet those requirements . There are also more stringent requirements that are imposed for Part 121 and 135 operators . For example they ca n't simply designate a person as a flight attendant based on the PIC 's determination that they are qualified : There are requirements for filling that crew position which must be met ( <URL> &amp; <URL> respectively , and possibly other regulations ) .
Yes , the details are in <URL> : 7 . Usage of Suitable RNAV Systems . Subject to the operating requirements in this AC , operators may use a suitable RNAV system in the following ways . ( 1 ) Determine aircraft position relative to or distance from a VOR ( see first note in subparagraph 7b ) , TACAN , NDB , compass locator ( see second note in subparagraph 7b ) , DME fix ; or a named fix defined by a VOR radial , TACAN course , NDB bearing , or compass locator bearing intersecting a VOR or Localizer ( LOC ) course And all fixes , procedures etc. must be loaded from the GPS database , you ca n't enter any fixes yourself based on lat/long or whatever ( section 9 ( c ) ( 1 ) ) .
The answer is quite simple : 1 . When touching down the nose is in a pulled up attitude , therefore the tail is farther down then normal . As soon as the airplane touches down ( on all wheels ) , the tail is higher , thus the hook is higher . You can see how the aircraft is in a nose up attitude , but gear and hook are on the same level . If the aircraft was sitting on all its tires , the hook would not actually touch the ground . ( This might not even be the case on all aircraft , though ! ) 2 . This is the much more important reason : The hook is hydraulically pushed onto the deck ( see Rhino Driver 's answer for more detail ) but as soon as the hook hooks to the cable , and pulls on it , that hydraulic pressure is overcome and the vectors of the forces go from where the hook is attached to the plane to where the wire comes out of the ground ( and vice versa ) . As you can see here , the hook is actually almost parallel to the deck . 3 . Last but not least : There is no space for two wires on one hook . Let 's say the airplane would catch the first rope , and for some reason ( it should definitely not happen , but let 's just pretend it does ) the hook is still on the ground where it would hook up to the second wire when crossing it , then it will maybe drag it along for a short time , but it ca n't really hook on as the hook is made to fit exactly one wire . This can be seen on this picture :
Given the hours required for the ATP , the chance of doing that rating alone in under a year seems pretty remote . Getting the private and commercial certificates done inside of a year is entirely possible , although not cheap . The writtens for the ATP are no big deal , but the hours simply will take a lot of time , as well as the right employment opportunity , to get . The number of FO 's at smaller ( regional ) airlines who have been flying for several years but who do n't yet have their ATP attests to the time required . You can ( and generally have to ) pay for the flight time to get your Commercial , but paying for all the flight time required for an ATP is simply beyond those of whose last name is n't Gates , Bezos , Trump , or etc. .
The vortex lift is the method by which highly swept wings ( like delta wings ) produce lift at high angles of attack . In the case of wings having sharp , highly swept leading edges like delta wings , the leading-edge separation vortex phenomenon occurs at subsonic speeds . However , the separation does not destroy the lift as in the case of low sweep wings ; instead , it forms two vortices which are ( nearly ) parallel to the wing edges . <URL> Vortices over a delta wing with a sweep angle of 70 ° , Separation in three-dimensional steady flow , ONERA In case of Concorde , the vortices look like this : <URL> Vortices over the Concorde wing , Separation in three-dimensional steady flow , ONERA A cross-section of the vortices looks like this : <URL> Flow above the Concorde Wing , Separation in three-dimensional steady flow , ONERA Unlike the ( bound ) vortex of the conventional wing , these are real in the sense that they represent an actual mass of air rotating at high speed compared to the air in front of the wing . The vortices form ' vortex sheets ' along the wing . Air is sucked into the vortex sheets and accelerated downward . As the airspeed in the vortex is high , the pressure is low . This low presssure on the upper surface produces lift . From Low Aspect Ratio Wings at High Angles of Attack at adg.stanford.edu : ... the leading edge vortices , increase the wing lift in a nonlinear manner . The vortex can be viewed as reducing the upper surface pressures by inducing higher velocities on the upper surface . <URL> Source : adg.stanford.edu Basically , the vortices increase the lift from the baseline ( potential flow ) values , with the extra force being equal to the loss of leading edge suction associated with the separated flow in high angle of attack highly swept wings . This analogy gives the same result as before . <URL> A Concept of the Vortex Lift of Sharp-Edge Delta Wings based on a Leading-Edge suction Analogy , Edward C. Polhamus , NASA Technical note D-3767 A major advantage of vortex lift generation is that it is effective at high angles of attack , over which the wings would normally stall . Actually , that Concorde used this method of lift generation is the reason for the high AoA during landing and its droop down nose . <URL> Source : <URL> One thing to be noted is that vortex lift generation happens at high angles of attack or in case the wings are designed to generate separated flow ( with sharp edges as in Concorde ) in normal conditions . Otherwise the lift generation is by conventional means .

Not in the US . The C162 's <URL> says : The Model 162 Skycatcher is not equipped or certified for IFR flight That means that under <URL> it may not be operated IFR . But , <URL> allows an exception for aircraft not certified for IFR to be operated under IFR in VMC only : A. IFR Training in Visual Meteorological Conditions ( VMC ) . Instrument flight training may be conducted during VMC in any aircraft that meets the equipment requirements of part 91 , § § 91.109 , 91.205 , and , for an airplane operated in controlled airspace under the IFR system , § § 91.411 and 91.413 . An aircraft may be operated on an IFR flight plan under IFR in VMC , provided the PIC is properly certificated to operate the aircraft under IFR . However , if the aircraft is not approved for IFR operations under its type certificate , or if the appropriate instruments and equipment are not installed or are not operative , operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions ( IMC ) are prohibited . The PIC of such an aircraft must cancel the IFR flight plan in use and avoid flight into IMC . An autopilot is n't required for IFR flight in the US ( see <URL> ) and <URL> you linked . I did n't check the full equipment list to see which required instruments are missing from the C162 , but even with full IFR equipment if it is n't certified for IFR then it ca n't be operated in IMC per the regulations above .
If you are talking about externally carrying/deploying other aircraft , this has already been done with the B-52 ( albeit for testing purposes ) carrying the <URL> . I 'm not too sure about having an aircraft drop out of a cargo bay such as the C-130 . On a side note <URL> were used extensively during WW2 and some were capable of carrying light tanks . The gliders were usually towed behind larger bombers to give them the required altitude and speed . They were used because of their wooden construction allowing a stealthy approach due to the reduced radar signature .
Yes , but you need <URL> . A rigid head does not have any hinges , instead , the blades flex up and down . Wings do n't know or care if they are upside down or right way up , indeed , <URL> . It only cares how much airflow there is and at what angle it hits it . Here 's an <URL> and a <URL> Perhaps the best around is <URL> Here , Dennis Kenyon shows <URL> He gets close to inverted but never actually flips over .
2D is a simplification of real life ... it 's very difficult to translate something 2D to something 3D . However there are approximations but I can tell you that no exact method is available . One of the key components of drag that you are missing in 2D is the induced drag , which is the drag generated by a wing simply because it has a finite dimension . The difference in circulation created by each airfoil has an influence over the complete wing . There is a theory which is linear and non-viscous that helps to compute the aerodynamic components of the wing , based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoils the wing is made of . It also allows you to create twist . It is subject to simplifications such as as being linear and missing viscosity , but it provides a very good approximation for the effort ( analytical for a significant amount of cases , and excel does the work for others ) . The theory is the <URL> and what you just need to is : add the induced drag provided by the theory ( you do n't have it in your airfoil ) : $ \ C _ { D_i } = \ frac { { C_L } ^ 2 } { \ pi \ text { AR } e } $ You need to know the planform for being able to make the integral of your wing , but the following equation will save you some time : $ \ C _ { L3D } = C _ { l _ \ alpha } \ left ( \ frac { \ text { AR } } { \ text { AR } +2 } \ right ) \ alpha $
Your second question is really easy to answer : Q : How do aircraft designers make landing gear that can land on a grass field without plowing into the ground and ripping off ? A : <URL> <URL> <URL> A wide , low-pressure tire has a larger contact patch with the ground , spreading the aircraft 's weight over that larger area helps prevent the tire from digging into the ground , and lets the aircraft roll more easily on rough or soft surfaces . Your first question - How much weight can a grass strip support ? is a much tougher one . The bearing strength of an unimproved surface depends on a number of factors ( some big ones : The composition of the runway bed , its drainage , and what kind of surface cover - turf , rocks , etc. - it has ) . If you look at aerial photos of <URL> you 'll notice part of the runway complex includes a dry lake bed : <URL> Some pretty heavy stuff has taken off from and landed on those runways - <URL> . Similarly <URL> , a Boeing 737 , landed on a levee at NASA 's Michoud Assembly Facility ( and was subsequently repaired and took off again , though they used an access road for the takeoff rather than the grass levee ) . Conversely if you tried to land a Cub on a grass strip that 's saturated with water after a rainy month there 's a chance your tires might sink into the mud . <URL> , which includes some discussion of how their bearing strength ( and thus maximum landing weights , tire pressure limits , etc. ) can be calculated , but each unimproved runway will be different , and the values will likely change over time .
There is no regulation against doing so provided that the third person in the cockpit is type rated for PIC privileges on the aircraft and has a waiver from the FAA to operate the aircraft as a single pilot ( they are available with some additional training . ) In practice , this would almost never occur both for safety reasons and cost . In addition full motion simulators are available for most aircraft type rated for a two person flight crew , so it would just be more feasible to carry out the training in one of these using simulated IMC , which is arguably more realistic and accurate than flying the real thing under the hood .

Did commercial airliners have microwave ovens in the past ?
Generally speaking , airliners do not have microwave ovens for safety reasons . I could not find any reference where commercial airplanes used to have microwaves . Probably some smaller business jets have them . Some flight attendants <URL> that they can warm your food , but some <URL> that they will not for legal and health reason . As also <URL> in comments to the question , meals are not heated at the airport . Airline catering companies like <URL> prepare the meal near the airport and deliver it to the airplane . Inside the airplane , they use <URL> to heat it .
Since you mention Dublin , I am going to give an answer that describes the situation in Europe . Other parts of the world may have different procedures , although I believe they will be similar . Usually a flight plan must be activated within a given time window to ensure that there is enough capacity ( airspace , ATC staffing , departure &amp; arrival airport constraints ) along the route to handle the flight . If the flight is not departing with this ' slot ' a new flight plan needs to be requested and approved by the <URL> ( NMOC ) ( Previously called Central Flow Management Unit ( CFMU ) ) . The controller is not responsible for filing flight plans and can not be tasked with doing the paperwork for the crew . The crew therefore needs to contact their handler or flight operation centre to refile a flight plan . The NMOC will reassess the flight plan and verify that there is capacity along the planned route to handle the flight . If there is n't , the flight may need to be planned along another route or an additional slot delay will be given .
No , it could not fly much faster with the available energy . Lift is a question of wing area and dynamic pressure . Solar Impulse 2 has 269.5 m ² <URL> to carry its 2.3 tons of mass . This is a wing loading of just 8.53 kg/m ² ; much less than even gliders have ( they start at around 30 kg/m ² ) . This allows it to fly very slowly ; if we assume it flies at the lift coefficient $ c_L $ for <URL> $ $ c_L = \ sqrt { \ pi \ cdot AR \ cdot \ epsilon \ cdot c _ { D0 } } $ $ and guess the zero-lift drag coefficient $ c _ { D0 } $ to be 0.029 and the aspect ratio $ AR$ to be 19.18 , the result is 1.377 . This is already close to the maximum lift coefficient , which I expect to be 1.6 . Now we need the lift equation to calculate the speed which is needed to keep it flying at this lift coefficient : $ $ v = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 \ cdot m \ cdot g } { c_L \ cdot S \ cdot \ rho } } $ $ Let 's assume it flies in 9000 m altitude where <URL> , the result is 16.13 m/s or 58 km/h . Now consider that it will fly at the beginning , late at night and at the end of the flight at lower altitudes , and may not be able to fly a straight course ( maybe to fly around bad weather ) , and the 55 km/h look entirely plausible , if not outright speedy . At sea level , the optimum range speed is only 9.96 m/s or 35.86 km/h , just about its take-off airspeed . Flying faster would need more energy and would not allow Solar Impulse 2 to recharge its batteries for the night hours . <URL> to be possible at all .
In normal operations there are regulations against this sort of thing ( as Dave has said ) . But there have been a few emergencies where the First Office or the Captain have become incapacitated ( due to medical emergencies ) , and the remaining pilot has declined to ask if there is another pilot on board to help fly the plane . Here is an example from 2011 of a <URL> ** , I have heard of others but ca n't find references . So , admittedly , that may be the only actual occurrence . So , to finally answer your questions : Very rarely , in an emergency situation , there can be a single pilot on a commercial airliner . Granted , there were passengers on board , so I 'm not sure it fits your narrow definition of " solo " , but it 's about as close as it 's going to get . For completeness ( though I do n't think it counts ) , there have been a few instances of a single pilot stealing a commercial jetliner . For example <URL> . There were actually two people involved , one was a mechanic , the other had a private pilots license ( hence the pilot was " soloing " ) . The aircraft has not been seen since ... so it 's assumed it ended badly , and , for the record , it 's also assumed the pilot was coerced ( if indeed he was even flying the plane ) . There are a couple more incidents , namely this <URL> , which was stolen by a mechanic , circled for an hour , then crashed . And also this <URL> , which was actually stolen by a Captain form Air Botswana . He circled the airport for a couple of hours demanding to speak to everyone from his girlfriend , to his boss to the President of Botswana . They were actually arranging to have him speak with the president when he crashed his plane into two other Air Botswana ATR-42-320s that were parked on the ground . He was the only one killed . Again , though , I 'm not sure if these fit the criteria you are looking for . But in that last one , at very least , he was the only person on board the aircraft , it was a commercial aircraft and he was in fact a Captain . But to say all this an irregularity would be an extreme understatement ... ** For clarification : The reason I state this is the only example I could find is because it 's the only one where I could find a report where it was specifically stated the remaining pilot had no help . To quote from the report : Once the initial Cabin Crew assistance was complete , the Captain indicated that he did not need assistance in operating the aircraft , although this was suggested in the operator 's procedures for pilot incapacitation . The First Officer took no further part in the operation of the aircraft . No inquiries as to the possible presence on board the aircraft of either medically trained personnel or qualified pilots were made . All other examples I saw either specifically stated that a new co-pilot was found , or they skipped that detail entirely . All of that being said , I somehow doubt this is the only case , it 's just the only one I could explicitly verify .
The answer : High heels ! The <URL> would punch a hole in the aluminium or composite flooring , and a carpet is the lightest way to distribute the loads such that the local pressure from high heels can be tolerated . This is the real reason . From <URL> On the floor of the fuselage also very high localized loads can occur , especially from small-heeled shoes . Therefore floors need a strong upper surface to withstand high local stresses . Other reasons are improved noise absorption and damping of vibrations . Nobody likes it when the floor panels start to resonate when excited by some engine or pump frequency . With composite panels now in widespread use for cabin interiors , manufacturing flaws need to be covered , and carpets serve this purpose well . From <URL> : Because sandwich panel facesheets are very thin , core print-through is common . Further , pinholes can form as phenolic resins outgas during reaction and cure . Therefore , panels visible to passengers typically are surfaced with some type of decorative material to cover surface flaws . Floor panels can be painted or covered with flame-retardant carpet .
Yes , commercial airplanes have landed or crash landed in water many times . If I am not mistaken , you are asking about scenarios when the on-board <URL> and life raft are used . <URL> is a list of water landings . Examples when a life raft was used are ( in addition to <URL> ) : On 22 October 1962 , a Northwest Airlines DC-7C with 7 crew and 95 passengers made a successful water landing in Sitka Sound . ... The plane stayed afloat for 24 minutes after coming to rest in the water , giving the occupants ample time to evacuate into life-rafts . In 1993 , <URL> , a Boeing 747 -- 409 , ended up in water after it overran runway 13 ... All of the 396 occupants donned life-vests , boarded the eight slide/rafts and no fatalities resulted .
Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft have what is called envelope protection which is to prevent pilot inputs from exceeding structural limits as well as keep them from getting the aircraft into an upset flight regime ( stall , overbank , etc. ) . The philosophy behind it is that , if the pilots need to perform an extreme maneuver they can be as aggressive with the controls as they want , confident that they wo n't break the plane . Boeing generally disagrees with this approach saying that , in an emergency , the pilot needs to have all possible force at his disposal , even if it breaks the plane . See the <URL> Federico linked to in comments for more on this . Of course , the Airbus system can only provide these protections when systems are all functioning properly . If part of the system is not working the protections are removed . Examples : <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , As far as AA587 , the A-300 is not a fly-by-wire aircraft and does n't have envelope protections . It 's debatable , though , if envelope protection would have helped in that situation . None of the rudder inputs by itself was outside of the structural limitations of the aircraft so the computer would probably not have prevented them . The failure was due to the inputs being made in quick succession which quickly fatigued the composite material of the rudder . The computer can be programmed to know , for instance , how much g-force the structure can take . But it would be difficult to determine what complex combinations of inputs might exceed the strength of the design .
Brake temperature sensors are quite common on airliners . Turnaround times of large aircraft are often impacted by the required cooling time . This is because during take-off the brakes must be cool enough to absorb the heat of a possible rejected take-off . Brake temperature and tire pressure indication on the Airbus A330 ( note the deflated tire &amp; high temperatures ) Source : <URL> t
Most airliners have a protection system for this which is based on Weight-on-Wheels ( WoW ) : sensors which detect load on the wheels ( which implies that the aircraft is in contact with ground ) . For safety reasons this can be bypassed and there 's usually a small lever in connection to the gear lever to do this . This image illustrates the 737 gear lever where you can clearly see a " lock override " which fills this functionality ( red part ) <URL>
The achievable roll rate depends on altitude . At sea level , big aircraft have very low roll rates , because their roll damping is very high due to the large wingspan . Roll damping goes up with the square of the wingspan , whereas the aileron moment grows linearly with wingspan . If the aircraft flies high enough , the roll rate will go up inversely to the change in density . This is because the flight speed increases inversely with the square root of density , so the same roll rate will cause less change in the local angle of attack on the outer wing ( which is the mechanism which causes roll damping ) . Thus , in 12 km altitude the roll rate will be twice of what it is at sea level ( at the same CAS ) . That is why large airliners have special high-speed ailerons at midspan : They suffice for control , and using the outboard ailerons would stress the wing a lot more . Also , outboard ailerons on high aspect ratio wings cause considerable torsion , such that the wing twist from aileron deflection will reduce aileron effectiveness . Inboard ailerons are much less affected by this effect . I would wager to say that any airliner will be perfectly capable of 15 ° / s roll rates if you deflect the outboard ailerons ( without overstressing the wings ) . The high altitude research airplane <URL> had a roll rate during approach of only 2 ° / s ! This was no real problem , because the large wing ( 56.5 m wingspan ) would not be affected by gusts when the aircraft flew lower than approx . 30 m . The turbulence is so small scale close to the ground that the gusts would average out over the large wing , and the aircraft calmed down when sinking below 30 m , even in gusty weather . At 18 km altitude , however , it handled almost like a fighter aircraft .
For the complete electrical failure in the aircraft , the following systems have to fail : The onboard power generation system , usually a synchronous generator has to fail in all the engines . The APU ( Auxiliary Power Unit ) has to fail . The RAT ( Ram Air Turbine ) should fail to deploy . The batteries and static inverters should fail ( this wo n't help in controlling the aircraft , just added for sake of completeness ) . The probability of this happening is very very low , and can be discounted . It is more probable that some other system ( for e.g , hydraulics ) fail before this happening . So far , to the best of my knowledge , no complete power loss has been reported in any fly by wire aircraft . The reason the Airbus aircrafts are controllable in case of electrical failure is due to the fact that the fly-by-wire system has multiple redundancies that offer layered protection : Normal Law offers all the protections ( like stall , load factor etc ) . This is the system in operation during normal flights . Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability , load factor and stall protections Abnormal Alternate Law limits the load factors and offers yaw damping only Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces , while still giving stall and load factor warnings In case all these fail , the system reverts to mechanical backup , where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals . In case of mechanical backup , the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available . In case of electrical failure , as long as hydraulics are OK , the pilot should be able to control the aircraft . However , usually , if there is no power , there is no hydraulic pressure ( except reservoir , maybe ) and the control is lost . In case of the <URL> , only hydraulics was lost and power was available . There are some more points to consider in case of total electrical failure . In case the control surfaces are moved by electric power ( like 787 ) , power loss means loss of control . Power loss implies that the engine thrust can not be controlled ( of course , the engines wo n't be operational in that case anyway ) . Some fly-by-wire aircrafts are unstable by design . In these cases , any power loss will lead to loss of control and crash . I 'm not sure there is any direct mechanical linkage in civil airliners . The amount of force required to operate such a system would be enormous . Bottom-line is , in case of complete power failure , the aircraft is as good as dead . One example is a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner ( which was not fly-by-wire ) , that <URL> due to a lightening strike . The aircraft entered into a uncontrolled flight , which loaded the aircraft beyond limit , resulting in its disintegration .
If you are seated behind the wings , but close , you can usually see black markings ( thick line and a number ) near the inboard side of the engine pylon which indicate their extension . Some might not be visible when the wing is in cruise configuration . Same goes for leading edge slats , only you 'd need to be seated near the overwing emergency exit to see those . I 've personally seen them on both Airbus and Embraer jets ( no recent flights on Boeing airframes so ca n't confirm if they mark them too ) . <URL> ( <URL> )
Dead space ... Not much room in the tail to put other stuff , and it fits . Plus it has a nice empty space just outside for the exhaust pipe to exit without the hot gasses hitting anything . Put the APU in the nose and you need a long pipe somewhere to get rid of the exhaust . More weight , more space , etc. . Put it in the wing and you 're looking at uneven weight distribution ( you want it at or near the centerline ) . Leaves the tail area as a logical place , and there just happens to be space there as well in most aircraft .
Aerodynamically , you want the aspect ratio to be as high as it can be ( for a given wing area ) . You want infinite wingspan , because that results in no induced drag . But that is not very practical at airports , and a bit heavy . Structurally , you want short stubby wings because they have a very low bending moment . In fact structurally , you want zero wing span . But that is not very practical at take-off time . As always , aerodynamic desirability implies structural objections , and vice versa . The aerodynamicists need to strike a deal with the structures engineers : a balance needs to be found . As long a wing span as possible , with as thick a profile as possible , using a material that is as light as possible . So a long wingspan is desirable and is only limited by structural constraints : as you say , at a certain point the longer wing span 's increased weight will offset any aerodynamic advantages . In aluminium , the optimum was reached over the course of a few decades . But now there is a new material with a better strength/weight ratio : composite carbon fibre . Carbon is much stronger than aluminium , and it is woven in a matrix of resin , with most wires running in the direction of highest stress . With carbon fibre , even the direction of material strength can be optimised . And the B787 and A350 have even higher aspect ratios than the B777 .
Firstly , " co-pilot " is not a term that is really used anymore . When people say that they usually mean the First Officer . It 's a bugbear of mine because " co-pilot " implies that there is one real pilot and a half pilot , when the reality is an airliner needs at least two fully qualified pilots to fly it safely ! When it comes to actually flying the plane , the two pilots have designated roles - Pilot Flying ( PF ) and Pilot Monitoring ( PM - sometimes this is called Pilot Not Flying ) . Both the Captain and the First Officer share these roles - usually one of them is PF on the outbound leg and the other one is PM on the inbound leg . The PF manipulates the controls to actually fly the plane , whereas the PM handles communications and other required tasks that do n't involve actually flying the plane . The biggest difference between a Captain and a First officer is responsibility . The Captain is the Pilot In Command ( PIC ) , who has ultimate responsibility for everything that happens throughout the flight . There are some practical things that only Captains can do , like flying into some tricky airports , landing in strong crosswinds , and on many aircraft only the Captain can use the steering wheel ( or Tiller ) for taxiing . Historically there was a strong heirarchy - the Captain was the boss and the co-pilot was , you could say , a servant . This posed big problems , because the Captain is not always right . The advent of Crew Resource Management ( CRM ) has brought this down to a much more desirable level - where there is still a heirarchy to ensure decisions are made , but not so much that they are unquestionable . The future of the First Officer role will be one of continuing to recognise that they play an important role in a functioning cockpit , rather than just there to serve the Captain . And hopefully people will stop calling them co-pilots !
Yes , it can happen , but it 's pretty uncommon . Airliners arrive at the destination airport having been sequenced by ARTCC ( " Center " ) and Approach so that they are showing up in an orderly sequence , spaced out so that there is adequate room between them . They may be set up for an ILS , or they may see the field and accept a visual approach , but either way the flow is generally quite predictable and orderly . VFR traffic , by its nature , is less controlled and ordered , so it 's more likely in that sort of an operation that you 'd have two aircraft in positions to arrive at the runway at about the same time , so a solution like a 360 on downwind or on final becomes necessary . With a flow of airliners ( and other IFR traffic ) spaced out at 3-5 miles apart , that solution would create as much trouble as it would solve , because now the conflict is with the aircraft behind the one that circled , rather than with the one in front of it . What does happen more frequently , is the 360 happens much farther out from the airport , and that 's called " going into holding " due to traffic saturation . Maybe the airport is over-loaded with arrivals , or it had to suspend operations while the active runway was changed from 18 to 36 ( or whatever they are at a particular field ) , or there is weather affecting the approaches which slows down the rate at which it can accept arrivals . The Approach and Center controllers will work to keep the flow of traffic coming into the airport neat &amp; orderly , which means delaying aircraft before they get to Tower 's airspace ( i.e. the " traffic pattern " ) . Ideally , they will do this with speed adjustments to get the desired interval , but sometimes the delay needed is more than speed adjustments alone can accomplish . Then they 'll put the arrivals into holding for however long it takes until they can start sending them in again . That 's the more common airline version of a " 360 on final " ... doing 360 's with 10 mile legs on a really , really extended final -- 100 + miles out ! In the case of a go-around that turns downwind , rather than a 360 on final , the typical solution would be to extend turning final out until there is adequate space . Staying on downwind past a 5 or 10 mile base &amp; final is highly undesirable for a VFR pattern , but for airliners where everybody has an ILS and does n't really have to maintain sight of the runway , it 's no big deal . For big airports , extending the traffic pattern out to longer finals is highly preferred over having jets circling on final .
There are lots of problems . Sight is just generally important when flying . Even in airliners , most approaches are still flown manually and often visually . Any significant degradation of sight is going to be a problem when flying any type of airplane . Red/Green/White <URL> are used by air traffic control in the event of a radio failure . The inability to differentiate red from green in this case would be an enormous safety hazard ( e.g. did tower just clear me to land or tell me to keep circling ? ) <URL> / <URL> lights use colors to indicate whether you 're above , below , or on the proper glide slope for a runway . While it 's possible to land without them , it 's a significant reduction in safety . Lights at airports are color-coded to indicate whether a particular road is a runway or taxiway , how close you are to the end of the runway , that a runway is in use , etc. . Landing on a taxiway is usually a bad idea , so it 's best if you can tell the difference . The navigation lights on airplanes themselves are color-coded . The right wingtip has a green light , the left wingtip has a red light , and the back has a white light . This lets other pilots easily determine which way you 're going and , in case of conflict , who should yield ( seeing a red light on another aircraft means that they 're to your right and , therefore , you should yield to [ i.e. divert around ] them . ) Colors are used on aviation charts to indicate all kinds of things , including class of airspace , type of special-use airspace , whether a field is controlled or not , type of route , elevation of terrain , where you should expect to see city lights at night , etc. . You need to be able to distinguish these things quickly and accurately , even in low-light conditions . Some cockpit instruments use colors to indicate various things . These include color bands on airspeed indicators , color of annunciator lights or their on-screen equivalents ( i.e. red for warning , amber for caution , green for gear down , etc. , ) echo intensity on a weather radar display , etc. .
It did n't directly lead to the tail separating . What separated was n't just the de-ice boot , it was the whole leading edge on the left stabilizer . That caused a stall of the left horizontal stabilizer and an increase in drag on the left side . The wings of an aircraft have a tendency to pitch the aircraft down ( as they 're behind the center of gravity and provide a force upwards ) , while the stabilizer produces a force downwards to keep the plane 's pitch stable . With the loss of lift on the left stabilizer , there was less downforce ( leading to a pitch down ) , more downforce on the right than on the left ( leading to a right roll ) , and more drag on the left than the right ( leading to left yaw ) . These rather violent motions led to massive aerodynamic loads on the plane , resulting in the next failure : the left wing . When this failed , the plane violently rolled right , for reasons I 'm not quite sure of ( I get violently rolling , but am unsure why it was to the right ) . This roll stressed the plane even more , and that is when the tail ripped off the plane . The direct cause was extreme aerodynamic forces caused by the flight path , not the leading edge separation itself .
The minimum altitude for autopilot engagement is generally the acceleration height or around 400 ' AGL though this can vary between operators . The question of when the autopilot is actually engaged is a more complicated question and is subject to pilot preference . Personally , I generally hand flew until the first level off or until climbing and accelerating through 10,000 MSL . Others may turn it on as soon as allowed and most fall somewhere in the spectrum between the two .

Has Air Traffic Control ever had to talk a first time pilot through a landing due to an emergency ?
The answer is yes . One example was on April 2 , 2012 . Helen Collins , an 80-year old Grandmother was forced to take the controls of her husband 's CE-414 and land it at Door Country Cherryland Airport ( KSUE ) after her husband had a massive heart attack at the controls and died . She managed to circle the airfield and call 911 on a cell phone . The emergency dispatcher contacted the FAA who got in touch with ATC . A KSUE based private pilot named Robert Yuksonavich took off and joined her in formation , talking her through what was about to happen and flew her wing on several practice approaches prior to the landing attempt . On landing the Cessna 414 skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the grass , breaking the nose gear off . Helen survived with only minor injuries ; her husband was pronounced dead on the scene . A brief piece by the CBS morning news featuring commentary by Capt Chesly Sullenberger about the incident . This is the full ATC of the accident

It will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft , but I will try to give some general estimates . Time on the Ground Part of what you are referring to what is sometimes called <URL> . It 's not really directly related to my calculations for your overall question ( though it is certainly a factor for short-haul jets ) , but in <URL> , minimum turn times for the Boeing 757 was studied , and it was found that the estimated turn time for a 757-200 was 52.5 minutes , based on actual operations . The 757-300 , a stretched model with more seating , would take about 59 minutes . From <URL> , presented by United Airlines , they show a general guideline MSGT ( Minimum Scheduled Ground Time ) , that is a generalization depending on flight locations , field facilities , and airlines . Some times are : Boeing 747 : 80 minutes Boeing 777 : 70 minutes Boeing 767 : 60 minutes ( -300 model ) Boeing 737 : 35 minutes ( -300 model ) Airbus A320 : 40 minutes <URL> has a discussion of a number of airliner turn times , however none are from official sources . Most vary between 20-45 minutes , depending on if cleaning is required . So for a typical airliner we can say it takes about 45 minutes-1 hour for a typical servicing . Aircraft Lifetime Now as to how many times they fly , you can find their aircraft design cycle limit ( essentially , how many takeoffs and landings it can make in its lifetime ) in <URL> ( summarized <URL> ) . Some listed numbers : Boeing 747 : 20,000 cycles Boeing 777 : 40,000 cycles Boeing 767 : 50,000 cycles Airbus A320 : 48,000 cycles ( 60,000 hours ) Airbus A300 : 40,000 cycles So for a ' typical ' airliner we can say it can survive about 40,000 cycles in a lifetime You can find the average age of airliners in different places online . <URL> splits up by airline and aircraft , and most airliners have an average age of 12-15 years . But note that this is the active fleet . The average age at retirement for an airliner is now <URL> . You can find a related Aviation.SE question <URL> Aircraft Usage <URL> discusses the average cycles and flight hours per day . Long haul aircraft ( like the 747 , 777 , A380 ) tend to spend more hours in the air per flight , but also have less cycles per day . I ca n't find official sources , but the thread presents a couple example averages for peak usage rate : Delta Boeing 757 : 9.5 hours/4 .8 cycles United Boeing 747 : 13.2 hours/1 .6 cycles ( I find these probably accurate , as there have been some publicized accidents that have much higher usage , like <URL> , which flew 48,740 hours and 39,781 cycles in 15 years - about 7 flights/day ; short-haul jets like the one in the article end up with more cycles than long-haul , as I noted above ) . It is difficult to find hard numbers , but overall , the average flight length for a short-haul jet is about 2 hours , whereas a long-haul jetliner is around 6-7 hours . Again , there are a lot of variables in this question , but using the above data , we can estimate the answer to your question , using these estimated figures from above : 40,000 cycles ( ~ 20,000 flights ) 25 years 2 hours/flight This means approximately 40,000 flight hours for a typical short-haul jet ; over 25 years ( 219,000 hours ) , this works out to about 1 hour in flight for every 5 on the ground . Obviously this varies widely , but for a ballpark number , that 's the best I can do . The highest usage would be a heavily used long-haul jet used on the longest routes from a busy airline ( i.e. trans-Pacific ; Middle East to U.S. ) , whereas the lowest would be a moderate-length flight on a low-volume route . In general , you are probably looking at about 1:3 to 1:5 air : ground time .
There are almost always opportunities to volunteer . However , joining CAP is a larger commitment than simply saying " I 'd like to volunteer to fly . " You will need to attend regular meetings and perform non-pilot duties such has becoming an administrative officer or participating in recruiting and fund raising activities . For some squadrons , the budgets are tight , and the ratio of pilots to flights can be high . The complaint I heard from CAP members back in Idaho was that they hardly ever got to fly . This may be less true in other areas . My suggestion to you would be to contact your local squadron . In your case , this will be a squadron within the <URL> . They have senior squadrons located in <URL> , <URL> , <URL> and elsewhere ( senior squadrons are for adults 18 + , whereas cadet squadrons are for children under 21 . There are also composite squadrons for both seniors and cadets ) . Talk to them about their mission and what the experience would be like . If you 're still interested , attend some meetings ( you 'll need to do this before they 'll let you apply anyway ) . Then , after you have a good sense of what will be expected , if you believe in their mission , and you 're willing to put in the time required , you should join . If all you 're looking for is a way to build cheap ( or free ) flight hours as a private pilot , then that is probably the wrong reason to join , and you will likely be disappointed . * Note from editor : The oddity in the ages of membership for the senior and the cadet groups should be explained . A person may join as a cadet in a squadron up to their eighteenth birthday , however , if they became a cadet before that , they may continue as such until their twenty-first birthday . Anyone joining the Civil Air Patrol after eighteen enters into the senior branch .
Emergency landings often dictate landing at the safest airport , not necessarily the closest one . As I said in the comments , the flight was operating IFR and had turned the window heater on presumably for anti-ice . It could be that a line of weather was preventing VFR operation at closer airports and they diverted to the closest possible VFR airport . When encountering an emergency there are things you do n't want to do . You do n't want to panic to get the aircraft down if the aircraft is perfectly flyable . You do n't want to make major configuration changes , especially multiple ones , quickly . Pilots are taught to <URL> in that order . As a pilot you should prioritize flying the plane , work the problem , and determine the safest place to put down . It is possible in this case that they could have continued IFR , but if they encountered icing below the missed approach point they would have been put in a situation with icing and no visual references . It is also possible that the pilots recognized that some electrical problem was at fault , and even without icing conditions they would want to remain VFR because they did n't trust the electrical system would continue to function throughout the IFR approach and landing .
A rainbow is created by refraction of sunlight so you have to be in the right position to see it . The effect is only created at some distance . A rainbow that you see from the ground may appear to be in a particular place in the sky . An airplane could fly through that space and it might appear to you that it is passing through it The occupants of the airplane , however , would not see a rainbow there .
It 's an interesting question , and <URL> they did award one to the guy who designed the current FAA license card : The FAA awarded Dahlvang his own ( honorary ) certificate , nicely framed with a gold seal . But it does n't say what 's printed on that certificate and I assume it is n't actually valid for flight . If you give someone a real pilot 's license you give them the authority to operate an aircraft and I ca n't imagine the FAA handing out licenses to unqualified people . Orville Wright did get an honorary certificate , as did other ' old-timers ' , but that pre-dates the FAA and again it is n't clear if they were ' real ' certificates or not : <URL> <URL> I do n't know if that really answers the question , but anyway in practical terms I think it 's probably a lot easier for the FAA to come up with a suitably impressive but legally worthless certificate rather than give someone a real one and deal with the legal issues involved in breaking their own rules and possibly federal law .
I 'm pretty sure it works without the smart phone . If I understand correctly , the smart phone app simply relays the imagery from the camera , which can be useful for navigating especially if you do not have a clear line of sight . <URL> ran <URL> on this very model , which might interest you .

I 've never seen anything about pilots fighting during the flight but on <URL> they fought before the flight then proceeded to fly anyway . There are differing accounts of whether it was physical or just verbal . The captain claims he was punched for calling his older copilot " uncle . " On <URL> apparently they got into such a heated argument that when they landed , the flight attendant made the passengers disembark . They continued on in a different plane with a different flight crew . There are reports of a fight between pilots on a <URL> flight but finding out what actually happened will be difficult . On <URL> the captain started ranting and raving to the point where flight attendants and passengers had to remove him and physically restrain him for the duration of the flight . There 's <URL> of the incident . He was charged with interfering with a flight crew but was found not guilty by reason of insanity . And on <URL> the pilots did an emergency landing when two flight attendants got into a brawl .
There 's no tangible benefit to having a GROL in getting a pilots license of any kind as getting the license generally confers the right to use aircraft radios . In some places you need to get an RT license for aviation as a separate test , however that 's pretty minimal . A GROL is only good for repairing , maintaining , and running certain types of radio stations . An A&amp;P will let you work on airplanes , but it also does not help get a license . An A&amp;P will give you insights into how an airplane works , but you can get those insights without an A&amp;P . Having an A&amp;P and a pilots license might be a different story if you plan to work in remote locations where being able to fix your aircraft when it breaks is useful . It wo n't help you get a flying job in most places .
I have n't seen the Breaking Bad episode , but in my experience any aviation related scenes in films and series are usually stretching reality beyond the breaking point . But it is possible that a single mistake can cause an accident . The probability of that happening is extremely remote , though . Typically there are a number of safety barriers ( also called defensive layers ) in the system ( 1 ) that prevent any single mistake from developing into a collision . However , every barrier has a small probability of not catching the problem ( e.g. due to it not being perfect or being in state of maintenance / failure ) so eventually a crash could result from a single mistake . This is often called the Swiss Cheese Model ( originally from Reason , J. ( 1990 ) Human Error . Cambridge : University Press , Cambridge . ) <URL> When an accident happens , sometimes the phrase " all the holes in the Swiss cheese lined up " is heard , and you now know why . While the first hole might be the mistake of a controller , the other holes may not be mistakes but are certainly rare circumstances and flaws in the system . Accident investigation focuses on identifying these contributing factors . In the <URL> mentioned by Portree Kid , two immediate causes have been identified ( 2 ) : The imminent separation infringement was not noticed by ATC in time . The instruction for the TU154M to descend was given at a time when the prescribed separation to the B757-200 could not be ensured any more . The TU154M crew followed the ATC instruction to descend and continued to do so even after TCAS advised them to climb . This manoeuvre was performed contrary to the generated TCAS RA . The first cause can be seen as a mistake by the controller , however that mistake could only happen because of a number of contributing factors ( systemic causes ) : Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company did not ensure that during the night all open workstations were continuously staffed by controllers . Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company tolerated for years that during times of low traffic flow at night only one controller worked and the other one retired to rest . In addition to the above , the Short Term Conflict Alerting ( STCA ) system did not display conflicts to the air traffic controller because of maintenance ( not listed as a cause in the report , but discussed in the text ) . The second cause is not a mistake by the crew of the TU154M , but a latent failure in the way ACAS/TCAS II was introduced . Never did anyone give guidance on what to do if the controller and the TCAS gave conflicting instructions . In the report this is identified as a systemic cause : The integration of ACAS/TCAS II into the system aviation was insufficient and did not correspond in all points with the system philosophy . The regulations concerning ACAS/TCAS published by ICAO and as a result the regulations of national aviation authorities , operational and procedural instructions of the TCAS manufacturer and the operators were not standardised , incomplete and partially contradictory . So while the accident was caused by a single mistake from the controller , there were also many flaws in the system , which all together allowed the mistake to develop into an accident . ( 1 ) By system I mean the aviation system as a whole , not only the air traffic control ( computer ) systems . ( 2 ) <URL>
It has happened before . There are definite cases of light civilian aircraft landing on a carrier , the most well known was in April 1975 when South Vietnamese Air Force Major Buang Lee landed an O-1 Bird Dog on the deck of the USS Midway trying to escape with his wife and 5 children from the fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces . Landing aboard an aircraft carrier presents several difficulties , namely limited landing roll and available deck space . A Nimitz Class carrier is just shy of 1100 feet in total length and 250 ft at its widest point . The designated landing area or LA is approx 75 x 650 ft. The ship is capable of steaming at 30 + kts so it can develop quite a bit of wind over the flight deck reducing the effective unarrested landing roll . Then you need to stop the aircraft once it 's on the deck . Carrier based fixed wing jets use tailhooks designed to work with the arresting gear and reduce the landing roll to about 330 feet . The largest carrier aircraft in service were the Douglas A-3 and the Grumman C-2 and E-2 , each one about the size of a regional jet . The largest aircraft which I am aware of which made a successful unarrested landing was a Lockheed C-130 . Large commercial aircraft like a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A-380 simply can not fit on the deck without the wings clipping the island or other deck antennas , etc , not to mention requiring landing rolls of over 3000 ft even in the most extreme short field attempts . So HAS a carrier aided a civilian passenger flight via recovery operations ? Yes but only with small aircraft . COULD a carrier aid in recovering larger commercial aircraft ? Possible depending on the size of the aircraft , its loadout and fuel state and performance capabilities .
Yes , we can ask you to plan your landing roll in a certain way . We wo n't technically instruct you to brake the aircraft in a specific way , but simply to aim for a specific taxiway after landing . There can be different reasons for this , but generally it is an attempt to expedite traffic flow on the ground at the airport . For example , if you are landing on a long runway and your parking position is near the far end of the runway , I might ask you to keep the plane rolling down the runway and vacate at the end , in order for you to have a shorter taxi time . It could also be that the taxiway you would normally use to leave the runway is blocked by another aircraft or vehicle , and I want you to leave the runway via a taxiway that is further down the runway . However , extending the landing roll does extend the runway occupancy time as well , so if there is another aircraft behind you on short final I will not offer you to perform a long landing roll . This is also why you should always ask ATC if you are planning to perform a long landing for one reason or the other -- if we have someone else just a couple miles behind you , we might have to instruct them to go around if you do not vacate the runway like we expect you to . With regards to reverse thrust specifically , there are airports where the use of reverse thrust is only permitted in special situations . This is to reduce the noise level at and around the airport . However , this is purely a regulatory thing , and is not actually related to ATC . ICAO offers the following guidance on the subject ( DOC 4444 ) : 7.10.3.1 When necessary or desirable in order to expedite traffic , a landing aircraft may be requested to : a ) hold short of an intersecting runway after landing ; b ) land beyond the touchdown zone of the runway ; c ) vacate the runway at a specified exit taxiway ; d ) expedite vacating the runway . 7.10.3.2 In requesting a landing aircraft to perform a specific landing and/or roll-out manoeuvre , the type of aircraft , runway length , location of exit taxiways , reported braking action on runway and taxiway , and prevailing meteorological conditions shall be considered . A HEAVY aircraft shall not be requested to land beyond the touchdown zone of a runway .
Probably <URL> . Though , I should note , that there is some credible evidence that only one person was actually flying the plane and the other may have been forced into coming along . So you could probably consider it to have been stolen by one person , and that person appears to have not been remotely qualified to fly it . When it was leaving the plane seemed to meander down the taxiway to the runway , like the pilot had no idea what they were doing , and then it took off . It has n't been seen since , and most credible theories think it crashed in the ocean . But <URL> abound . A close second would probably be <URL> ( <URL> plane reference ) , also stolen in Africa . This time by an employee of the company who was , unfortunately , suicidal . He flew the plane around the airport for a few minutes demanding to speak to everyone from his boss , to his significant other to the president of the country . He eventually crashed it into a couple of other ATR 's the company owned . In reference to the " I 'm writing a story " line . I would suggest that a 727 probably is n't the optimal plane for a single person to steal . They 're older and difficult to manage on your own . I think a much better option would be a more modern aircraft , like an <URL> or a <URL> . They have avionics that allow for one person to reasonably fly the plane . Granted , they are very new and may be harder to steal . Probably the sweet spot between " new enough to be flyable by one person " and " old enough to have one just sitting around to be stolen " would be something like a <URL> or an <URL> . Both are still quite large , but a skilled pilot could probably operate one on their own if they needed to . In fact , <URL> .
No because aircraft are categorized by their <URL> ( 1.3 times stall speed ) . <URL> VAT -- Speed at threshold used by ICAO ( 1.3 times stall speed in the landing configuration at maximum certificated landing mass ) By knowing the category , ATC is able to use appropriate speeds . The category is not actually listed anywhere , so the controller will have to know the approach category by heart for each aircraft type . E.g. if the controller sees " B738 " as the aircraft type in the flightplan , they have to know that the corresponding approach category is C. More : <URL> <URL> ( for the US )
Preflight Planning Let 's say that you 're on approach to a remote airport to refuel , with 1-2 hours of fuel remaining in your aircraft . ... The nearest airport is 3-4 hours away ... First of all , it looks as if the pilot has already broken several regulations in order to end up in this situation . He either did n't file an alternate , or if he did then he did n't carry enough fuel to get to it ( and additional reserves as required ) . If the runway is closed for an extended period of time , there would likely have been a NOTAM stating that the runway would be closed . All of this sounds like poor preflight planning , and probably the ' ole careless and reckless thrown in for good measure . The Problem Contacting ATC to request permission to land , they tell you that the only runway is closed for an unspecified reason and will not reopen for ~ 2 hours . Okay , we need to figure out what the " unspecified reason " is because this can change things dramatically . <URL> Is it for endangered migrating turtles ? <URL> Is it for construction ? In any case , he needs to use all available resources . Talk to ATC and explain the situation . Ask them how they can help clear the runway so that we can land . He should tell them that an emergency is imminent without their assistance . They will do everything that they can to help you , including coordinating with people on the ground to get out of the way . Be creative . Did you know that there is no regulation ( in the US ) requiring you to land on an actual runway ? Ask them if you can land on the taxiway . For that matter , land in the grass beside the runway . It would be better than going for a swim or crashing after running out of gas ! Let 's presume the airport is surrounded by ocean , and the aircraft is not certified for ditching . Ummm , who cares if it is certified for ditching ? If you are over water , it does n't matter . If you are over land , it does n't matter . If you have a choice , pick land ( even if it 's off-airport ) . Supposing ATC refuse to reopen the runway , is the pilot permitted to land anyway ? Well , they would n't really do this unless there was a really good reason , mainly meaning that it would be dangerous for the aircraft to land there ( like in the second picture above ) . In this case , we ca n't really ignore ATC and land anyway until : Declaring the Emergency ... so you choose to hold , hoping the runway is soon reopened . After waiting a while , the runway is still not reopened , so you declare an emergency . At least our poor pilot did this right . Rather than blindly continuing to hold , he declared an emergency . Getting on the Ground Now we have a lot more latitude and options , and ATC is better able to help us because they can pretty much do whatever it takes to save the aircraft . This can change a " Sorry , there is nothing I can do . " into a " Cleared to land any runway or taxiway . " all on its own . They may throw in a " Landing at your own risk . " if there are still hazards , but that 's just to clear them of liability . Even if they still refuse , you can simply advise them of what you will be doing and go ahead and do it . Keep in mind however , that it may be better to scope out an off-airport landing site if the danger is so great that ATC wo n't allow you to land even under such dire circumstances . Remember , the pilot is the final authority for safe operation of the aircraft . Get on the ground and sort it out after the fact . ( Poor turtles ... ) In the end , just do what you can to stay alive , and preferably use the airplane again . There are going to be tons of questions and probably major legal battles . Someone will probably go after the pilot 's certificate . On the bright side , he will be around to actually see it happen though .
Yes , there are . The <URL> is one example of an aircraft designed with a retractable tailwheel . <URL> Source : USAAF via <URL> , Public Domain ( USGOV-PD ) Another example would be the <URL> : <URL> Source : <URL> , cc-by-sa-2 .0 Doubtless there are also other examples of aircraft similarly equipped with retractable tailwheels .
If an aircraft encounters a serious problem quite soon after departure that forces it to land immediately , the aircraft may be above its certified maximum landing weight . This is because there is still a lot of fuel in the tanks , which adds a lot of weight . As @RonBeyer mentioned in a comment , landing overweight can have a number of serious consequences . When landing a heavy aircraft , stopping it on the runway already requires a lot of energy ( or rather , a lot of energy needs to be converted into something else ) . If the aircraft is heavier than it is designed to be on landing , this may cause excessive stress on the brakes . In extreme cases , this can make the brakes catch fire . Now , open flames under an aircraft that is almost fully loaded with fuel is the recipe for disaster . In some cases , even though the crew brakes hard on landing , the aircraft may be so heavy that stopping on the runway is impossible . A runway excursion will then follow ( a situation where the aircraft leaves the runway onto the grass or similar ) . This is not neccesarily dangerous , but it certainly can be , depending on the surrounding terrain : <URL> ( image from <URL> . This aircraft was not overweight , but I still think the situation shown in the picture is relevant to this question . ) Obviously , in an emergency ATC , and in turn the fire and rescue crew at the airport , need to be prepared for such events . If ATC expects an aircraft will be landing overweight , getting the crew to confirm this will allow ATC to inform the fire crew that they can expect brake fires or a potential runway excursion . It can also enable the rescue leader to position the fire vehicles at the best possible position , which would be further down the runway than normal , since the landing roll will be longer . So basically , it 's a way to get information to the rescue crew so that they can prepare for what might be coming . Depending on the type of emergency , ATC will also ask the crew about other details , in some cases also with the purpose of passing this information on to the rescue crew , since the rescue crew will normally not be in direct contact with the cockpit as long as the plane is in the air . See also this related question : <URL>
The only passenger needs that would result in a non-scheduled landing would be a medical emergency or acts/threats of violence of the level that prompt removal of the passenger is needed ( with law enforcement coordination ) . A passenger forgetting his wallet would not result in a diversion . An aircraft deviation to enplane more passengers and proceeding to the scheduled destination would be a highly unusual situation and would not be for passenger needs , it would be for operational needs .

Why simple paper planes fly better than most " realistic " paper plane models ?
The reason is really the size ! Air molecules have the same size if they flow around a small paper airplane or a big real airplane , but since their relative size is so much smaller when they flow around the real airplane , friction effects are much smaller for the big airplane . When comparing airplanes of different sizes , a dimensionless <URL> is most helpful . It is basically the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the airflow , and the formula is $ $ Re = \ frac { l \ cdot v } { \ nu } $ $ Nomenclature : $ Re \ :\ :\ : $ Reynolds number $ l \ :\ :\ :\ :\ :\ : $ characteristic length , for example wing chord $ v \ :\ :\ :\ :\ : $ airspeed $ \ nu \ :\ :\ :\ :\ : $ kinematic viscosity of air Flows with the same Reynolds number behave identically , but your scaled-down aircraft flies at a very different Reynolds number than the original ( both speed and characteristic length are a lot lower ) , so the airflow around it will be very different . For it , the air looks more like a syrup when that around the original is like flowing water ! Therefore , lift creation needs different means at this scale ( wings with more chord , for example ) , and the paper airplane is better suited to cope with this particular flow condition . The next difference is wing loading : The paper airplane is very light ; its mass per area is low . Therefore , it can fly at a slower speed than your scaled-down real airplane , and it will be easier for you to launch the paper airplane properly into the air . The scaled-down airplane needs to be thrown harder , but still straight , and this might be another reason for it falling down quickly .
While there are many exceptions to east-west runways , generally speaking <URL> ( which blow from a single direction ) blow east-west rather than north-south . It happens because of Earth 's rotation generates <URL> . <URL> There are <URL> besides prevailing winds . <URL> occur near the equator and flow from either the north or south towards the equator . They curve towards the west due to the spin of the Earth . <URL> blow close to the north and south poles . They blow away from the poles and curve east to west . Hence , most of the runways are Eastish-Westish ( not exactly East-West ) .
The problems are two-fold : The airspeed is much higher in flight than when landing , so the thrust reverser doors would have to be much stronger , and therefore heavier to withstand the additional forces , along with the relative wind making them harder to close . What happens when it gets stuck in the deployed position ? Now you have to shut down a perfectly good engine and have additional drag on the airplane while in flight . ( Bonus ) It is n't really needed on most airplanes with spoilers , flaps , etc. that accomplish the same thing .
It is a mixture of factors . All else being the same : a contrail at a higher altitude will last longer ( the lower temperature slows the sublimation of the ice cristals ) a contrail formed in air with higher humidity will be bigger and last longer ( more water is being turned into ice ) If there is not enough ( relative ) humidity , the contrail will not form at all . See for example this image : Image from <URL> The contrails start forming on the east , near the clouds where you have a higher humidity , and do not form on the west , where no cloud is present and you have higher temperature/lower humidity . I 've often noticed that planes flying on more or less the same track , headed in the same direction leaves different contrails . What you observe might be airplanes flying at different altitudes and thus encountering different humidity/temperature combinations , giving birth to contrails with different histories .
Well , yes , bigger wings to provide better lift , but the also produce more induced drag in the process . The wings on an airliner are optimized for cruise in high subsonic and transonic flight where a slender , swept wing works well . While this is great for cruise flight , the trade-off is this style of wing requires a very high approach speed for landings which in turn require very long runways to accelerate the airplane on to reach rotation speed for takeoff or to decelerate the aircraft on once it has landed . The Boeing Company successfully addressed these problems in the early 1960 with the development of the 727 airplane as a regional airliner . It made use of a type of flaps called <URL> ( see Fig 1 ) in concert with leading edge extensions . Fowler flaps . These style of flaps consist of a series of segments attached to tracks or support linkages running chordwise , allowing the flaps segments to extend and retract by rolling along said tracks . <URL> Fig 1 . Typical Fowler flap installation When deployed these give the effect of changing the airfoil shape from a slender , slightly cambered airfoil into a wide airfoil with a large camber . Fowler flaps have an additional advantage to them in that partial deployment creates a large increase in lift with limited additional drag , very useful for takeoff , while when fully deployed they create a lot of drag in addition to higher lift .
Jessica Cox explains it herself in this video : <URL> She 's using her legs in place of hands ( I.e , using her feet to manipulate the controls , throttle etc ) and she specifically flies an Ercoupe which has no rudder pedals .
Let 's say you have two aircraft that will reach the same point in space at the same time , and your job is to keep them three miles apart . One way to do it is to calculate how many knots the second aircraft should reduce their speed so that at the time the first aircraft reaches the point , the second aircraft will have fallen three miles in trail . Unfortunately for you , this means that you have to work a time-speed-distance-wind problem for every single aircraft that you , as a controller , handle . Alternatively , you pick a point three miles away and tell the second aircraft to fly there . Air traffic controllers are human , and humans are better at angles than we are at numbers . The simplest thing for controllers is usually the best thing - they 've got lots on their mind already without making them do math too ! This might change in the NEXTGEN air traffic network ( where everyone has a GPS position and speed readout right there on the screen ) but for now , easy is better than hard .
The problem is not the wind speed per se , but the combination of factors . Let 's start from the data ; this is the METAR for Athens on the 17th of July , the day of the fires : METAR LGAV 171220Z 03026G38KT CAVOK 32/10 Q1016 NOSIG = I have highlighted the wind speed data . It says that the wind at Athens airport was on average at 26 kts , with gusts up to 38 kts 26 kts of wind at high altitude would not be a problem for a CL-215 26 kts of wind near ground ( to drop the water it has to do low passes ) and at low speed ( it has to go as slow as possible to be precise ) can be highly dangerous , as proximity with the ground increases turbulence . Let 's also consider the mountainous terrain around Athen ( and the fires were on the side of a mountain ) , windshear and turbulence were probably quite strong . ( See also this question : <URL> ) 26 kts was the average wind speed , gusts were up to 38 kts , increasing the risks of such operations . In addition to the above , let 's remember that these aircrafts have to fly over fires , that will create additional turbulence through the rising hot air column that they generate . ( thanks to <URL> ) I do not think that a hard limit for such operation exists , as said above is the combination of windspeed , terrain configuration and mission that determines if an aircraft can perform it or not .
Adding to <URL> , a Defense study -- <URL> -- showed that : ... the precision of movement of the hand and fingers decreases as an unsupported arm is extended . As helicopters need more precise and constant inputs than fixed-wing aircraft , having your arm rest on your thigh is better in terms of comfort and precision .
Turbulence is always a nuisance . It will require more control inputs to stay at the desired polar point , which increases drag . Also , small-scale turbulence will cause earlier transition of the boundary layer , which is important for gliders with a laminar airfoil . Powerful turbulence might even overload the airplane 's structure . Jet stream turbulence is low and only becomes noticeable at the boundaries between the fast moving air of the jet stream and calmer air above and below . To stay unpowered in the jet stream is impossible - any unpowered craft will lose altitude due to drag when moving through the air , and even a balloon will be hard to stabilize at the altitude of highest wind speed . Even a kite is not unpowered - it needs some force acting on the line ; either by an airplane flying below or by something holding the end of the line on the ground . If you want to know what makes turbulence more bearable : Higher wing loading , lower aspect ratio and <URL> will help . A higher wing loading means higher airspeed , so the relative speed changes from turbulence will become smaller . Both aspect ratio and sweep will reduce the lift curve slope , so changes in angle of attack will result in smaller force changes .
Attitude is rotation of the body frame of reference ( its principal axes , whatever it means ) relative to a chosen frame of reference . For aircraft : The body frame of reference is the longitudinal , lateral and vertical axes , where the longitudinal-vertical plane is the plane of symmetry and longitudinal axes is chosen to point generally forward , along cabin floor if there is such a thing . The chosen outside frame of reference is the local horizontal , which is plane perpendicular to the local weight ¹ vector , and in that plane the main axis is chosen either as projection of either local magnetic inductance vector ( magnetic heading ) or Earth rotational axis ( true heading ) . Regarding " true horizon " , in the sense of where the you see the ground/sky boundary , that ca n't be used for defining attitude at all , because it is not a plane . The line connecting you to the " true horizon " ahead and the line connecting you to the " true horizon " behind is not the same line , so it ca n't be used as axis . Instead , horizon is defined in terms of horizontal , the plane orthogonal to the weight vector ( and tangent to the Geoid , the ' idealized ' sea level ) . To fly level , your velocity vector must point along the local horizontal . In most aircraft it means your pitch is slightly positive . This is because most aircraft are designed to never need to fly at negative pitch ² and as the angle of attack for level flight depends on weight and speed , most of the time your pitch will be slightly positive . ¹ Not " gravity " , because it centrifugal force due to Earth rotation is included . Actually , the instruments measure the value including the centrifugal force due to the movement of the aircraft , which might be slightly different from centrifugal force on stationary object . The immediate measurement also includes the inertial force due to acceleration ( the forces ca n't be distinguished ) , but this is eliminated by averaging , because the average acceleration ( over several minutes ) is known to be zero or close enough for practical purposes . ² There are some exceptions that do normally fly slightly nose-down , like B-52 , which does it because its unusual gear does not allow it to rotate on take-off , or DHC-6 Twin Otter , which apparently does it to provide better view during slow short take-offs and landings .
I found this on <URL> " Some call signs are less obviously associated with a particular airline than others . This might be for historic reasons ( South African Airways uses the callsign " Springbok " , hearkening back to the airline 's old livery which featured a springbok ) , or possibly to avoid confusion with a call sign used by an established airline . Companies ' assigned names may change as a result of mergers , acquisitions , or change in company name or status ; British Airways uses BOAC 's old callsign ( " Speedbird " ) , as British Airways was formed by a merger of BOAC and British European Airways . Country names can also change over time and new call signs may be agreed in substitution for traditional ones . " Before America West bought US Airways , their callsigns were Cactus ( associated with the deserts of the American West ) and USAir . After the merger , the combined airline kept the better-known ( airline ) name , and the other airline 's callsign . Now , after the acquisition/merger of American Airlines , they 're using that airline 's name and callsign . Leading to more than a few radio calls recently ( late spring / early summer 2015 ) along the lines of
( This answer is based on light aircraft in the US . ) Leaving aside any scenarios where you must file IFR ( class A , IMC ) and any where you ca n't ( pilot and/or aircraft not IFR-capable ) , it comes down to whether the ' overhead ' and benefits of operating IFR are worth it for your particular flight . By the way , your question seems to assume that IFR is required at night , but night VFR is legal in many countries . The ' overhead ' of operating IFR is firstly in planning : there are different rules for fuel reserves , altitudes , airspace , alternate airports , weather minimums etc. . Generally speaking you need more time and thought to prepare and file an IFR flight plan . Secondly , operating IFR potentially places a lot of restrictions on you : ATC can delay your takeoff , <URL> , put you in a hold , require position reports , and generally keep you busy . As a pilot , you have to perform at a ' higher ' - or at least different - level . For many people , that 's already reason enough to file VFR if conditions allow ( do n't forget that in the US there 's no need to talk to ATC at all on many flights ) . But the purpose of the flight is important too : IFR more or less assumes that you 're flying from A to B on a fairly direct route . If you 're training , or sightseeing , or dropping parachutists , or just flying around for the fun of it then IFR is n't really appropriate or useful . You can just <URL> instead , which gives you the benefits of ATC keeping an eye on you , without any of the IFR rules to follow . And regarding your comment about IFR letting you fly in more weather conditions , there 's a pilots ' saying in the southern US ( and probably many other places ) that " if the weather 's good , file IFR ; if it 's bad , file VFR " . The reason is that Florida and other southern states get a lot of convective activity and it 's very common to have to pick your way between thunderstorms and building cumulus towers to get where you 're going , or just for a more comfortable ride . By remaining in visual conditions you 're able to see what 's going on with the clouds and being VFR means you 're more or less free to change course and altitude as needed to avoid them . If you 're IFR , ATC may put you in a cloud layer where you ca n't see anything and vector you closer to the buildups than you 'd like . VFR just gives you a lot more options in general . Finally , are there any scenarios where only VFR is allowed , even for IFR-capable flights ? This might be different in different countries , but offhand I ca n't think of any in the US . IFR minimum altitudes are higher than VFR ones , so you ca n't fly IFR at 500 ' AGL , but I guess that 's not really what you 're thinking about . Maybe someone else will come up with something .
It has to do with the local speed around the airfoil . In a canard configuration , the forward wing has to produce more lift per area than the main wing in order to have <URL> . This means the suction is more intense , and the pressure on the upper side of the airfoil right behind the leading edge is lower than on the main wing . Also , the angle of attack of the wing is higher , presenting a larger area to the oncoming flow . Large droplets of supercooled water will simply splash on the leading edge and freeze there instantly , causing clear icing . In a conventional aircraft the tail surface will provide very little lift , and in many cases even produces a <URL> . Now the main wing shows lower pressure on the forward part of the airfoil , just where ice collects the most . In the special case where the tailplane is in the wake of the wing , some of the water droplets will have frozen to the wing already and less water will be available to cause tailplane icing . The capacity of air to hold water depends not only on temperature , but also on pressure : The lower the pressure , <URL> . Condensed , super-cooled water , or liquid water hitting a cool surface , will form ice . Now you have both components needed for the explanation . Pitch stability is the explanation for the higher propensity of canard wings to collect ice than conventional tailplanes !
There is no reason to limit the number of anti-shock bodies to 3 or 4 . In most modern aircraft , the anti-shock bodies are the flap track fairings which usually house the flap mechanisms . As such , their number is determined by among other things , the wingspan , the size of control surfaces and the number of actuators required for their actuation etc. . This usually limits their number to around 4 due to weight and other considerations . However , there is no reason there should only be 3 or 4 of them . For example , the <URL> has a whole lot of them . <URL> Source : www.avioners.net
Aside from the obligatory <URL> answer , there are some components on an aircraft that will certainly fail at a higher rate than other components . From the Piston GA side of the equation I can name a few ( some of which are also applicable to turbine aircraft ) . Incandescent Light Bulbs A lightbulb is a supremely unreliable device : A delicate bit of wire is suspended in a thin glass envelope and heated until it glows - then subjected to vibration ( from the engines , turbulence , etc. ) in flight . We use them all over the airplane -- Position lights , landing lights , cockpit instrument lighting , etc. . If you think about how often incandescent light bulbs burn out in your house it 's probably not surprising that they fail quite often on aircraft . <URL> . We still use incandescent lightbulbs because they 're cheap : A $ 0.25 light bulb can be replaced multiple times before its cost even approaches the capital investment in a better solution . Modern aircraft are incorporating an increasing number of LEDs to replace incandescent lightbulbs - these solid-state devices have a lower failure rate ( and other benefits ) . Batteries Much like your car aircraft rely on batteries for some functions ( like starting the engines or the APU ) . Batteries have a finite service life and will eventually fail to hold a charge and need to be replaced . Sometimes <URL> . We still use batteries because hand-propping aircraft can be dangerous , and getting the APU turbine up to speed without a battery would be nearly impossible . Also if the engine-driven generators fail the battery is a useful source of electricity to help you get to a safe landing site . Spark Plugs Piston engines are spark-ignition , and spark plugs have a variety of failure modes ( they can become fouled with lead or carbon deposits , the internal resistor can fail , or the electrodes can simply wear out ) . These failures are not uncommon : Statistically if you fly piston aircraft long enough you 'll probably encounter at least one of them . We use spark plugs for obvious reasons : Unless the fuel is ignited it does n't generate any power . Without power the propeller does n't turn ( at least not very fast ) , so there 's no thrust . No thrust means no flying . Tires Tires are another aircraft component with multiple failure modes . Interesting ones include leaks ( air leaving the tire at a rate fast enough to be a problem ) , " catastrophic " failures where the tire explodes or disintegrates while rolling , and " self-protective " failures ( where the tire reaches a temperature that melts the fusible plug and causes it to deflate to prevent it from exploding ) . Tires are also used for an obvious reason : Aircraft that constantly belly-land require expensive maintenance ( to say nothing of the damage they do to the airport ) , and the alternatives - skis , pontoons , or flying boats - are limited in the areas from which they can operate . Air Filters On piston engines there is normally an intake air filter which is designed to keep dust and grit out of the engine . These filters can fail by becoming clogged ( which I suppose is n't really a failure : The filter is doing its job ) , and certain paper filters can fail by disintegrating and being ingested into the engine ( the FAA has issued <URL> on this subject ) . We still use air filters - even the paper kinds that can disintegrate - because ingesting dirt into a piston engine greatly accelerates wear . The required maintenance on the air filter costs less than increased overhaul frequency .
Its a bit dated but here is a <URL> . Keep in mind these are navy pilots , often considered the best of the best and in peek physical condition . Based on the publish year I would suspect all subjects were male as well . Here is <URL> on reaction times for pilots on low sleep . This is <URL> , might be of some help . An additional question I have related to this is , how can one design an aircraft to make it difficult for pilots to enter PIO 's ? This is an interesting question and in some regards could be its own question here . One of the big debates ( mainly between Boeing and Airbus ) is if systems like this should exist and who has the final say in terms of control deflection . Airbus takes the approach that the computers should prevent the pilot of say pulling back on the stick and stalling the plane . While Boeing generally allows pilots to be the final say and while their systems will warn of a stall you can ultimately pill back the column until the plane stalls . In terms of how you would design something like this you would have to limit control input after an approach to oscillation was detected .
Normally , an airfoil is optimized for best lift/drag ( L/D ) efficiency for a certain flight profile ( usually a compromise ) . Since most of the time for most aircraft inverted flight is not an issue , you get an airfoil that is optimized for upright flight , and this is best achieved with asymmetric geometries . However , depending on the <URL> any airfoil can ( and will ) generate " negative " lift , only much less efficiently so , than for the optimized regime , resulting in increased drag . The desired angle of attack for conventional aerodynamically controlled aircraft is maintained by the elevator . For symmetric airfoils commonly used for aerobatic planes , the performance for upright and inverted flight is quite similar . For 99 % of all other airfoils inverted flight will work up to a certain point , depending on the available power , CG , the maximum lift and rudder forces availabe before stall . As a result , for some aircraft , a stable inverted flight can not be maintained , while for others it could be ( but with varying penalty to performance , stall speed etc ) . The aerodynamical possiblity of inverted flight is of course limited by structural and other considerations .
Early autopilots would only control one degree of freedom . Starting with the yaw damper of the <URL> , they were a simple feedback loop involving a gyro , a single control surface and some damping circuitry . Example : A roll gyro was coupled to the ailerons and kept the wings level . Commanding a bank angle would simply shift the zero point of the gyro to a different angle , and some damping made sure that the movement was slow and did not overshoot . This , however , would neglect any cross coupling . Banking flight needs more thrust to keep altitude , but the roll autopilot would not " know " of engines or throttles , just ailerons . The same was true for analogue pitch and altitude hold systems which had a simple feedback loop with the throttle and the elevator , but no other controls . Modern digital autopilots , starting with the one in the <URL> , control all axes in parallel and use a multitude of sensors and feedback loops to control the whole aircraft in one go . This is much easier to achieve with digital control , and gives smoother responses since cross-coupling effects can be anticipated and corrected before they manifest themselves .
Regarding holding onto the landing gear as the aircraft takes off , or otherwise getting into the wheel well , stowaways do try this on a regular basis . As other answers have said though , they then find that there 's no access through to the rest of the plane , so they 're stuck in the wheel well . At cruising altitude ( above 30,000 ft ) the air temperature will typically be below -50 degC . Surviving at this temperature needs specialist clothing and breathing apparatus , which stowaways usually do n't have . The result is that they usually freeze to death . Perhaps mercifully , they 'll lose consciousness above about 10-15 ,000 ft due to lack of oxygen , so they wo n't experience this happening to them . At major international airports such as Heathrow , there are regular cases of bodies found in fields ( or even in gardens ) along the flightpath , as aircraft drop their landing gear and the frozen stowaway falls out . Occasionally they do survive . Generally this will be because they 've wrapped up warm before they leave . The aircraft tyres can also be warm , which helps too . And it 's more likely on a shorter flight , of course . It 's pretty rare though .

How does an aircraft taxi ?
Aircraft are not always moved with <URL> ( the small vehicle you refer to ) . Much of the time , they operate under their own power . Airliners are generally pushed back from the gate using a tug , as that 's the simplest and most efficient method . They then taxi to the runway ( and all the way up to the gate , after landing ) using their own engines to provide thrust . This is true of both jets and propeller aircraft . Some work is being done on self-contained electric-powered ground propulsion ; one major player in this area is a company called <URL> . They use high-torque motors and the aircraft APU to allow the aircraft to move itself without starting its engines or requiring a tug to be connected and disconnected .
There is actually a legal Australian definition for aircraft , in Part 1 section 3 of the <URL> : aircraft means any machine or craft that can derive support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air , other than the reactions of the air against the earth 's surface . So those drones you can buy from the store are aircraft ( and if you knock one out of the sky because it annoys you , you are technically bringing down an aircraft and could be punished ) . However the latter half of that definition suggests hovercrafts are not aircraft . Also , the minimum height over populated areas in Australia is 1000ft , and 500ft over non-populated areas ( <URL>
This depends on what exactly you want the aircraft to do : Immediately depart the hold and fly directly to another fix : N1234 cleared to ' clearance limit ' via direct ' fix ' and then as previously filed . Immediately depart the hold and fly an assigned heading : N1234 Cleared to ' clearance limit ' via radar vectors . Fly heading ' heading ' . Proceed to another fix after passing the holding point inbound : N1234 After ' holding fix ' , cleared to ' clearance limit ' via direct ' fix ' and then as previously filed . Fly the published approach after passing the holding point inbound : N1234 Maintain ' altitude ' until ' holding fix ' , cleared ' approach name ' . Altitude Lastly , add the altitude to any of the above clearances if it is different than the current altitude by adding a climb/descend and maintain ' altitude ' clearance .
Almost always a plane going to a boneyeard is flown to the general area . Typically they are taxied , towed or dragged away from the airport itself . CHEAP is the key word in any recycling / 2nd-hand operation . Planes at the end of their economic lives , that can not be flown because of damage or lack of maintenance , tend to be moved out of sight , valuable bits and hazardous materials removed , and the hulk reduced to scrap using normal construction/demolition equipment . The scrappers near Mojave airport work the same way , in a bare dirt lot down the street from the storage adjacent to the airport . I 've been to AMARG * , at Davis-Monthan , to Mojave Airport/Spaceport and a facility for smaller , general aviation , aircraft , Cessna 150s through commuter and business turboprops/jets . The later had a large , grass , field , for last landings . Other planes arrived by truck , in pieces . Most airplane museums are near an airport , but exhibits are less likely to fly in . A plane headed for a museum or restoration shop , even as a donor , is often disassembled and sent by truck , train or ship . But restoration is n't scrapping , the economics are different . * AMARG , or the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group ( previously known as AMARC , the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center )
The number will vary depending on the aircraft type &amp; installed engines ( how much fuel it holds , and how much fuel it burns per hour at taxi speed ) , but the ballpark figure is " Much less than the range in flight " , because the specific fuel consumption figures ( how much power , and thus distance , you get per unit of fuel burned ) are less favorable during taxi than at cruise . To work an example I used the numbers for an A320 <URL> and not checked it burns 270-330kg / hr ( depending on the engines installed ) so let 's split the difference and say 300kg/hr as an average . The A320 can hold around 15,000 kg of fuel , so doing the division it could run its engines at taxi power for around 45 hours . If we assume a taxi speed of 20kts for 45 hours the aircraft could theoretically taxi 900 nautical miles ( 1036 statute miles , or 1667km ) , a little less than one-third of the range in flight .
For the general question , the answer will be " it depends on the aircraft . " Specifically for the 787 , though , the ' 7E7 ' program was officially announced on <URL> . The program was later renamed to 787 . It received its type certificate on <URL> and flew its first passenger revenue flight on <URL> . So , from the time the program began to the time of the first revenue flight was about 8 years and 9 months . Of course , this is not including the R&amp;D time invested on different projects whose R&amp;D ended up being used either partially or completely in the 787 design before the 787 program itself began . It should also be noted that not every airframe they start developing ever actually flies . Notably , Boeing worked on designs including <URL> and the <URL> ( which would have cruised at Mach 0.98 ) before beginning the 7E7 program . In addition to completely new airframes , aircraft manufacturers also commonly make derivative airframes based on existing product families . Current examples of derivatives in development include the <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> ( " neo " stands for " new engine option . " ) However , development time on derivatives can vary widely depending on how much modification is being made to the existing airframes and the level of resources being devoted to the project ( which depends on market pressure . ) For a past example , the 2nd-generation Boeing 777 aircraft were announced on <URL> with the first aircraft , the 777-300ER , being certificated on <URL> , and first service entry on <URL> . This gives a time of about 4 years and 2 months from announcement to first service entry . This was likely slowed by the sharp downturn in aircraft orders following the 1999-2000 " . com bust " and , especially , the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. Also important is the FAA rule for applying for a type certificate . This will apply for new programs like the 787 , but not for derivative programs like the 777X , which amend the original type certificate and do not need a new one . In <URL> : An application for type certification of a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years and an application for any other type certificate is effective for 3 years ... So once Boeing applies for a new type certificate , they have 5 years to get the type cetificate approved , unless they convince the FAA upfront that more time is needed . If the time runs out they must reapply , and the new type certificate would require the aircraft to comply with all new regulations passed since their original application .
Drag ( and lift ) increases with density . Density decreased and so did drag . So at the same power , you can fly faster . Now I do n't know whether reduction of power of a normally aspirated spark-ignition reciprocating engine at constant throttle setting would be higher or lower than the reduction of drag . But the question says power setting .
Depending on where you are it will take around 4 hours to 3 days , if the location is know . Depending on how remote your location is , and if the SAR team knows your location ( Sometimes forgotten by pilots after a emergency landing . ) . If the location is n't known , the search can take up to 2 weeks , finding you and your passengers dead . Let 's say temperature is -10 degrees Celsius , it will take around 1-3 hours without any clothing or external heat source ( like a camp-fire ) to start hypothermia . Although the critical point of Hypothermia is 25 degrees Celsius , people survived 14 degrees Celsius . The best thing you can do during this plane crash is stay closely together and if possible start a camp-fire . Drink hot water ( just take some ice and put it on the fire ) with a lot of sugar ( or anything else that gives you energy ) and just do anything to keep yourself heated until help arrives . If possible , keep the navigation lights , strobe lights on of the plane until battery runs out of fuel . This increases the chance being found in time .
The key when selecting an aviation mechanic or shop to maintain your newly purchased plane is " time in type " : You would not take a Cessna 172 to the United Airlines maintenance facility at JFK , not would you take an A380 to the local Cessna service center ( even though it would be perfectly legal to do so ) . If you 're buying a new aircraft ( of any type ) the manufacturer will be able to recommend an authorized service center for you , and you 'll probably want to use an authorized service center ( especially for warranty work ) . If you 're buying a used aircraft you can still contact the manufacturer and ask about authorized service centers . They will usually be happy to give you a list of places near you that can work on your aircraft , and who are blessed by the factory to perform warranty service , complete mandatory service bulletins where the manufacturer is supplying parts / covering labor , etc. . Aside from manufacturer recommendations there are a lot of other ways to find a maintenance shop that beat simply asking Google and picking one at random . For the most common single-engine piston aircraft ( your typical Piper Cherokee , Cessna 172/182 , etc. ) you can almost certainly find a mechanic at your local general aviation airport - ask the FBO where you 're storing the plane for recommendations or talk to other pilots on the ramp about who they use for maintenance . For more esoteric aircraft ( high-performance singles , twins , vintage/classic/warbirds , etc. ) your best resource is often a type club ( e.g. . <URL> for Beechcraft Bonanzas , or <URL> for the Piper Comanche ) - Google can help you track down a type club , and the members can help you find mechanics who have experience working on your particular airplane . Type clubs are also a great source of other information ( like where to find parts ) .
This is related to an answer I gave <URL> about why aircraft typically do not have mirrors and external cameras . Short answer : yes aircraft do have sensors to detect damage , but not the kind of damage you 're talking about . Long answer : to design or decide what sensors to put on the aircraft and where , we have to get started with failure modes . There are at least a million way for components to fail , however , some failure are more likely to occur than others . Do we have sensors which detect failures / abnormal situations ? We do ! We have sensors for control surfaces , hydraulics , gears , tire pressure , cabin pressure , engine temperature , oil pressure etc. . Here is an image of one of the cockpit screens on a Boeing : <URL> ( <URL> ) OK , so why not more sensors ? Because sensors can fail . Now that would be a nightmare to troubleshoot : the sensor says the right outer landing light is not illuminated . Is that true ? Let me exit the aircraft and take a look ... . It turns out that : Many failure modes are " internal " , e.g. a valve malfunctioning . They are invisible on the exterior of an aircraft . Aircraft rarely collide with any other objects . Relying on visual indication is actually a good thing , because it is reliable and it 's free . Building an array of sensors covering each skin on the aircraft would be extremely complex , the construction cost would be high and the system would be heavy . Sensors are just another component of the system . The more sensors , the more likely something will fail . At some point one has to trust the underlying component to function without relying on system indications . Perhaps this is the kind of system you have in mind : <URL> ( Screenshot of " Stealth " ( 2005 ) , 01:01:11 ) Nah , that 's just Hollywood artistic license .
Aircraft are not always moved with <URL> ( the small vehicle you refer to ) . Much of the time , they operate under their own power . Airliners are generally pushed back from the gate using a tug , as that 's the simplest and most efficient method . They then taxi to the runway ( and all the way up to the gate , after landing ) using their own engines to provide thrust . This is true of both jets and propeller aircraft . Some work is being done on self-contained electric-powered ground propulsion ; one major player in this area is a company called <URL> . They use high-torque motors and the aircraft APU to allow the aircraft to move itself without starting its engines or requiring a tug to be connected and disconnected .
How do the engineers , maintenance team , etc know if an aircraft has metal fatigue ? First of all , is not an " aircraft " that has fatigue , but a component . To the naked eye , there is no way to detect metal fatigue until it starts being too late : you can only see cracks that are already forming and/or propagating . There are tools available to allow for early detection , my bachelor 's thesis was about one of these : the <URL> of certain materials is used . A light coat of one such material is applied on the new component and the photoelastic properties and exams done during the lifetime of the component tell the maintenance people what is the current status of the inner layers of the piece . Another method uses electric resistance , as metal fatigue , by cracking the metal , increases the resistance . Depending on the scenario , X-rays could also be used . What do they do to " minimize " metal fatigue or repair it ? You can not minimize fatigue , once it starts setting in , it is an irreversible process . You can delay the likely catastrophic failure by applying strengthening elements around the affected one , but the safest course of action is to replace the component and recycle the old one .
Some aircraft may have a special " ETOPS APU " that can be purchased , but many aircraft simply have THE APU that they come with . It is maintained to the standards required in the approved ETOPS program , and is either run during the ETOPS portion of the flight , or else has some means to ensure that it will reliably start even when cold-soaked . ( For instance , at least one ETOPS program requires that the APU be started shortly before the top-of-descent on enough flights to " prove " that it does , in fact , start up reliably even in a worst-case cold-soaked scenario . ) Most ( perhaps all ) APU 's in aircraft currently in production have the general capability of being started in flight , so that particular aspect of things is n't unique to the ETOPS world . Documenting the reliability of the APU is a uniquely ETOPS thing , but so much of ETOPS is about exactly that : demonstrating and documenting just how reliable the hardware is . It often is n't different hardware , but the same equipment as in a non-ETOPS aircraft , but maintained &amp; tracked to higher standards .
Lets attack this from a few different angles . then night hits and its now pitch black with zero visibility ? There is plenty of visibility at night , a clear night is just as nice as a clear day . As a matter of fact when the air cools at night and clouds roll out you can some times see farther than you can during the day . Here 's me on a VFR approach ( Piper Warrior ) in to KLNS at about 10pm one night , you can see the runways are lit up nicely and can usually be spotted from 5 - 10 miles out depending on altitude . <URL> Here is us earlier that night heading away from KABE ( those lights are Allentown PA ) <URL> ( photo credit to my girlfriend who was bravely sitting in the back ) As you can see you can still make out the horizon and plently of land marks . While it may be different during the day you can still fly VFR at night . zero visibility ? Zero visibility during the day is the same as zero visibility at night and as mentioned in the comments will require you to <URL> if you want to fly. , How does he not run into mountains and the like ? Not flying into the side of a mountain is a topic of its own . You should check out <URL> to that very question . From a more general stand point there are lots of ways to navigate in an aircraft . <URL> that covers most of them . The only thing that is not really feasible in a small single pilot aircraft if you are solo is celestial navigation although it could be done .
As a tower controller , in case of an unexpected unusual situation for an aircraft on final approach , this will be my list of priorities : Clear the runway of other traffic Determine if fire and rescue services need to get involved ( Call fire and rescue services ) Call approach and ask them to stop inbound traffic . In case of other traffic on final behind the emergency , coordinate missed approaches Instruct other aircraft on final to go around , in accordance with the coordination with approach The above points will take me no more than 30 seconds to get through . This takes care of the most immediate priorities . I will then await the landing of the emergency plane , and coordinate with fire and rescue as appropriate . As for departing traffic on the ground - aircraft on their gate will be instructed to stay there . Aircraft taxiing to the runway will either continue to the runway holding point or be turned around to a gate , if available - this depends on whether I expect the runway to be closed for a long time ( say , more than 20 minutes ) . The same , more or less , applies to VFR traffic in the control zone intending to land . They can hold in the air if I expect to reopen the runway shortly , otherwise they might have to find an alternate ; I will coordinate any diversions with approach . Once I have a hold of my own traffic , I will call the operational supervisor and inform them of the situation . They will take care of stopping additional inbound traffic if required , and coordinating with adjacent units and sectors . I might also call approach again directly to let them know how the situation is developing . It will be up to approach , in cooperation with the supervisor and based on the information I provide , to determine if aircraft on initial approach should be diverted , or if they can hold in the air awaiting a runway reopening . Each individual aircraft will require individual handling , to determine if , where and how they want to divert . Once the runway is reopened ( after fire and rescue have finished their work , the emergency airplane has been removed , runway inspection carried out and so on ) , I will coordinate with approach and the supervisor to start inbound traffic again ( possibly with a reduced rate ) , and start getting my own departures rolling again . As you can see , there are a lot of " if 's " in the above . A lot of decisions have to be made , and the basis for making said decisions changes depending on the situation . There is no set checklist or rulebook for when something like this happens , because the required actions will vary . But that is what we get paid for after all - as an air traffic controller you have to be creative and flexible , especially when unusual situations occur .
How are aircraft aligned with these bridges They are not ( but read on ) Aircraft are aligned to a point on the concrete , not to the jetbridge ( s ) . It is the jetbridge itself that carries out the final alignment to the aircraft door . Jetbridges are actually motor vehicles with wheels , tyres , motors and ( often ) steering . It just happens that their rear end is tethered and their bodies articulate and/or telescope to accomodate the motion at the " front " end . . You <URL> using a set of controls at the end furthest from the terminal building <URL> <URL> I believe some also have what is effectively variable height suspension like old Citroens ( except I imagine it is hydraulic or jack-screw ) . The aircraft is driven to the terminal so the nose wheel follows a guide line and stops at a marking appropriate for the aircraft type . Then the jet bridge is <URL> up to the aircraft door . As the aircraft is gradually burdened with self-loading freight and sinks on it 's suspension , the jetbridge metaphorically <URL> so that the SLF do n't trip up or fall into the aircraft . That is , the jetbridge maintains alignment , the aircraft is pretty passive in the job of alignment . I have to admit I did n't notice these jetbridge controls for many years as I was usually either busy rushing to my seat or busy rushing to the baggage reclaim . One time there was a delay at the aircraft door that was long enough for my bored gaze to alight on the controls and for the thought to briefly wander across my mind - " I wonder what would happen if I pressed that ... "
There is no virtually no lag on attitude indicators . The traditional ones are based on a mechanical gyroscope . Due to the gyroscope being gimbaled , it remains in a fixed attitude . When the aircraft changes attitude , the gyroscope in the attitude indicator remains at its original orientation . When you look at the attitude indicator you are looking basically directly at the gyroscope , packed in a nice horizon displaying wrapping . The modern attitude indicator in a glass cockpit gets the attitude information from the Attitude and heading reference system ( AHRS ) . There is of course some lag associated with digital data transfer and display refresh rate , but these effects are too tiny to be noticeable by humans . The first generation of these systems used mechanical gyroscopes as well . Nowadays most AHRSs uses <URL> or <URL> . These gyroscopes use <URL> of light travelling clockwise and counter-clockwise through a circular path . The accuracy of these systems is very high and there is no delay . Another technology that is used is are Micro-electromechanical Systems ( MEMS ) gyroscopes . The are based on a vibrating structure . The direction of a vibration tends to remain in the original direction , even though the supporting structure rotates . MEMS are relatively cheap compared to RLG and FOG but they are less accurate . Due to developments in the automotive and mobile telephony industry where attitude sensors are used for various applications the accuracy of MEMS gyroscopes has improved while their costs have decreased . This makes them now interesting for application in avionics .
Directional stability When a swept wing is flying in a sideslip , the windward side behaves like a wing with less effective sweep $ \ varphi _ { eff } $ and the leeward side like one with more effective sweep . Wing sweep causes a flattening of the lift curve slope for two reasons : The effective angle of attack is reduced by the cosine of the sweep angle . Only the component of speed normal to the quarter-chord line of the wing is creating lift , so a swept wing creates less lift per area than a straight wing . The increased lift rolls the aircraft , but also produces increased lift-induced drag which pulls it back to straight flight . The sketch above shows this for the <URL> . This effect is so strong that swept , high-wing configurations need anhedral to keep the sideslip-induced rolling moment down . For completeness , also the side force $ Y$ of fuselage and winglets is added and shows that the winglets help a lot to create directional stability . This is needed in case of the SB-13 because it has a nearly elliptical lift distribution . Using a triangular distribution ( N9-M ) or even a bell-shaped distribution ( <URL> flying wings ) avoids the need for winglets , but causes higher induced drag in straight flight . Another downside is a low directional stability at high speed , because this sweep effect increases with the lift coefficient on the outer wing . Longitudinal stability Wing sweep also helps in longitudinal stability by stretching out the wing lengthwise . This is important for flying wings which lack a separate tail surface . By changing flap angles at the center or the wing tips , the lift at the most forward or most backward sections can be changed for pitch control , and more sweep increases the lever arm of these changes . Also , in swept flying wings natural static stability can be achieved without the use of reflex airfoils , but by applying washout . Again , the higher the sweep angle , the less washout is required . Too much sweep ? Easily ! Sweeping a wing creates lots of problems : Sweep reduces the lift curve slope and the maximum lift of a wing . The maximum landing attitude with a highly swept , slender wing is severely limited by wing tip clearance , so swept wings need powerful high-lift devices . Sweep causes the boundary layer to be washed outboard , which will cause nasty stall behavior once a specific ratio of wing aspect ratio and sweep has been exceeded . This can be somewhat limited by wing fences , but should better be avoided altogether . Sweep changes mean that bending moments will partially get converted to torsion moments , requiring a torsional stiffening of the wing . For flying wings , sweep will let the aircraft center pitch up and down when the wing flexes . This creates a powerful interaction between the fast period mode ( which is only moderately damped in flying wings ) with the wing bending mode , resulting in flutter . Why sweep a wing at all ? Generally , an aircraft designer will allow only as much sweep as necessary . Wing sweep reduces drag when the aircraft flies with transonic or supersonic speed . Now the Mach effects depend only on the normal speed component , so they are proportional to the cosine of the sweep angle . For the N9-M this was not a factor , however , the B-2 benefits from it with a higher <URL> .
TCAS works by sending interrogations to other aircraft 's transponders . The transponder will reply to the interrogation in a similar way it responds to radar . From the time difference between the interrogation and the reply , the distance to the other aircraft is calculated . The reply itself contains the altitude of the other aircraft . The explanation below gives an insight in the basic working of the TCAS algorithm . In reality it is more complex to deal with all kinds of exceptional situations . The distance and the altitude difference with the other aircraft is tracked to identify a trend . From successive distance measurements the closure rate is determined . With the closure rate and the current distance ( slant range ) an approximation is made of the time to the closest point of approach ( CPA ) . This is done by simply dividing the range by the closure rate , the result is called ' range tau ' . The same is done in the vertical plane . Dividing the difference in altitude by the vertical speed difference leads to the vertical tau . If both tau 's are less than certain threshold , a Traffic Alert ( TA ) is raised . When the tau 's are less that another ( lower ) threshold , a Resolution Advisory is given . The TA is a ' heads up ' indication , the RA is an instruction that must be followed by the pilot to reduce the collision risk . The threshold times depend on the altitude , ranging from 20 seconds ( < 1000 ft AGL ) to 48 seconds ( > FL200 ) for TA 's and from 15 seconds ( < 2350 ft ) to 35 seconds ( > FL200 ) for RA 's . Below 1000 ft AGL , RA 's are inhibited . Originally TCAS did only give Traffic Advisories in the form of a " Traffic , traffic " annunciation . There was no avoiding action indicated . With the introduction of TCAS II in the second half of the '80s the Resolution Advisory made its entrance . RA selection In selecting a resolution advisory , there are two basically two steps . The first step is to select a sense , either upward or downward . This is based on a calculation of how much altitude difference can be achieved at the CPA by either starting a climb or descent , assuming the target will maintain its vertical rate . In the calculation the reaction time of the crew and acceleration and climb / descent rate of the aircraft is assumed ( 5 seconds , 0.25 g , 1500 fpm ) . The second step is to select a magnitude . The algorithm is designed to be the least disruptive to the flight path , whilst still achieving a minimum vertical separation . RA coordination When a RA is selected , it is transmitted to the other aircraft . When the other aircraft receives that message , it will only use the opposite sense for its own RA . In the rare case that both aircraft transmit their RA intent at the same time , the aircraft with the higher Mode S address will give in and reverse its RA sense if it is conflicting with the other . Algorithm versions Over the years various improvements are made to TCAS II . The initial TCAS II systems had version 6.0 of the algorithm , later replaced by 6.04 a in the mid 90 's . Further system evaluation lead to the development of version 7.0 , implemented from 1999 . Following a near mid-air collision in Japan in 2001 and a mid-air collision over Uberlingen , Germany further changes were made leading to version 7.1 . Changes that were made include : the wording of the RA 's logic to limit the vertical path deviations logic to prevent nuisance alerts in RVSM airspace and on closely spaced parallel runway operations logic to detect non-compliance to an RA improved RA sense reversal logic TCAS &amp; ATC TCAS RA 's take precedence of ATC instructions . The fact that one of the two aircraft followed ATC instructions , and the other TCAS RA 's contributed to the Uberlingen accident . In case a pilot is getting a TCAS RA he should notify ATC . ========== The FAA has produced an <URL> which provided some interesting reading on the topic .
Not all commercial jets have autobrakes , and the ones that do usually have a company policy dictating when it will be used . The criteria for activating the brakes are different depending on the manufacturer and model of aircraft , but are typically some combination of : System must be armed A certain takeoff power setting must be set by the throttles A certain airspeed must be obtained Thrust levers must be pulled back to idle Aircraft must still be on the ground Usually for a rejected takeoff it does use max braking , however the autobrake usually has different settings for landing along the lines of " light/medium/max " braking . Each setting will use a different amount of runway for landing , much like lightly pressing on the brake pedal in your car versus jamming it to the floor .

start question
Is it possible to " pimp up your aircraft " with an audio system ?
Absolutely not , as it would not be in the sense of security . It would block engine sounds ( eg you wo n't be able to hear a rough engine ) It would block warning sounds , for example stall warnings It would block any other abnormal sounds You will have problems understanding ATC ( and they will have even more problems understanding you ) These are just some reasons out of my head . If you want to listen to music inflight , buy a good headset with an AUX-In socket , those normally reduce the volume as soon as a transmission is incoming . And apart from the audio volume , it would also put a high load on the battery / alternator , which are probably not able to handle such a high load .
It 's entirely possible . Attitude control works the same way during autorotation as it does during normal powered flight . It 's a good thing , too ... during an autorotation you want to target your descent toward a suitable landing spot :-) To ( say ) roll right , moving the cyclic causes the swashplate to move in such a way that the rotor blade 's pitch ( angle of attack ) is greater during the left-side portion of the blade 's travel , and lower during the right-side portion . This produces more lift on the left side , which causes a right-rolling moment on the helicopter . The fact that the collective is all the way down and that the rotor 's RPM is being maintained by airflow through the rotor does not change the way the cyclic produces attitude changes . The anti-torque pedals still work too , although during an autorotation the pilot will promptly apply full right pedal , since lowering the collective will essentially eliminate torque from the rotor . Pedals can still be used for yaw though , as the tail rotor is still spinning ( it is linked to the main rotor ) . The " 180 ° turning autorotation " is a common maneuver taught in basic training , where the pilot must set up the autorotative descent and then complete a 180 ° turn toward a landing spot . For more information about autorotations in general , I recommend the FAA 's ( free online ) <URL> . See page 2-24 for a general description , and page 11-2 for procedures/technique . There are also lots of autorotation demonstration videos on <URL> that show maneuvering to a landing spot / 180 ° turns during the auto .
The screens are LCDs , which have a polarized filter layer over them . That layer is usually placed at a 45 ° so they are misaligned with your polarized sunglasses which are aligned vertically . You can confirm this is the problem by turning your sunglasses at different angles and see if the screen changes .
Unless you tell us which book you read this in ( and what exactly it said ) , it is not possible to answer your question ( the answer depends on whether the zero angle of attack is that of the airframe or the airfoil ( wing ) ) . We can try for a general answer though . As far as angle of attack is concerned , there are two kinds - geometric and absolute . First , angle of attack is the angle between some reference line and the freestream ( i.e. the velocity vector ) . The selection of reference line determines the ' kind ' of angle of attack . Geometric angle of attack , $ \ alpha $ is the angle between the chord and freestream ; this is the one usually used . Absolute angle of attack , $ \ alpha_a $ is the angle between the freestream and the zero lift line ( the line , which when parallel to the freestream , produces no lift in the wing ) . The geometric and absolute angles of attack can be related through $ \ alpha_a = \ alpha - \ alpha _ { L = 0 } $ , where $ \ alpha _ { L = 0 } $ is the angle between the chord and zero lift line . <URL> Relation between geometric and absolute angles of attack , image from <URL> For a cambered airfoil , the zero lift line is negative i.e. the airfoil will produce lift even when the geometric angle of attack is zero ( in this condition , the absolute angle of attack is positive ) . For a symmetric airfoil , of course , the zero lift line coincides with the chord and as such , the airfoil produces no lift when the geometric ( or absolute ) angle of attack is zero . As far as the lift is concerned , what matters is the absolute angle of attack , while we usually use the geometric one . Simply put , what matters is the absolute angle of attack of the wing . If this value is positive , lift will be produced and level flight is possible , whatever the aircraft attitude .
A meteorite could hit an airplane , sure . There 's no known cases of it happening because meteorites which survive atmospheric entry are very rare , and airplanes are pretty small so the likelihood of it happening is extremely low .
The EUROCONTROL example you give , allows controllers from all member states to work in Maastricht Upper Area Control ( Netherlands ) and provide ATC over Belgium , ( part of ) Germany , Luxembourg and the Netherlands . Many of the controllers there are not from any of these four countries so they are foreign air traffic controllers . Also EUROCONTROL is only providing Upper Area Control above the four countries mentioned above . All member states have their own Air Traffic Control providers , some have more than one . Within EU countries ( note that not all EUROCONTROL member states are EU member states ) we have freedom of labour movement . So for EU citizens there should be no official barriers to work as a foreign controller in another EU member state . Apart from the intra-EU rules , some ATC organisation within the EU are open to applications from outside the EU . For example the Dutch Air Traffic Control Organisation LVNL is open to <URL> . Applicants are not limited to citizens of EU countries . ATC at airports is becoming a commercial business . The companies that you mentioned provide civil ATC at various airports around the world . Another example is ATC at London Gatwick Airport : the contract was <URL> . Outside the EU I know that there are many foreign controllers work in the United Arab Emirates . They are looking for <URL> at this moment as well .
The list of approved maneuvers is in the POH , and I 'm sure the Lomcovak is not listed . If you are willing to do unapproved maneuvers , the issue is that because the aircraft tumbles rather than flies in this maneuver you have a few things to worry about : it starts with an outside maneuver , it is inverted , and the exit requires a high-speed dive which will exceed Vne or the +6 g the 152 Aerobat is rated for .
Why Mach 10 ? Would Mach 3 or 4 not be enough ? See <URL> and <URL> for the complications which arise at higher speeds . The linked article is full of misrepresentations - of course will the Busemann biplane create lift at sub-supersonic speed ( what is that , anyway ? I read it as subsonic speed ) . Give it a proper subsonic airfoil and it will do so just like any other biplane , and even with the trapezoidal airfoil it will do so , albeit with more drag . It will also create lift and drag if operated at a proper angle of attack below its design speed ( maybe that is meant by sub-supersonic speed , but the author never clarifies that ) . <URL> Busemann biplane as shown in the linked article ( <URL> ) Did you note that the shock lines in the graph only occur between the two wings ? That means that on the outer surfaces you will only see ambient pressure . The pressures internally cancel each other , and the result is that the Busemann biplane will not create any lift at its supersonic design speed in order to do its magic . As soon as it starts to create lift , it needs to create shock waves on the outside which will invariably be audible . That the researchers at Tohoku claim them to be 85 % weaker is easy if they omit to mention to what they compare it . Now look at the bulky passenger compartment on the top wing . This is clearly not optimised for supersonic travel ( please compare it to the fuselages of the Concorde or the Tu-144 to get an idea what works ) . No , this article is just utter nonsense .
As Lnafziger says , a conventional landing is impossible for anything more than a tiny aircraft STOL aircraft ( Carrier ' runway ' length : 200m ) . As you state however , if it was an emergency , the aircraft carrier has a special net which it can fold up to stop planes , and since it can stop an F18 Hornet , it could probably take your Cessna as well :)
There is actually a legal Australian definition for aircraft , in Part 1 section 3 of the <URL> : aircraft means any machine or craft that can derive support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air , other than the reactions of the air against the earth 's surface . So those drones you can buy from the store are aircraft ( and if you knock one out of the sky because it annoys you , you are technically bringing down an aircraft and could be punished ) . However the latter half of that definition suggests hovercrafts are not aircraft . Also , the minimum height over populated areas in Australia is 1000ft , and 500ft over non-populated areas ( <URL>
I think the answer is no . If you think about V1 as primarily based on runway length , it is certainly possible for an aircraft to easily reach Vr long before reaching the " point of no return " as far as stopping distance is concerned . However , you must also consider the meaning of Vr . This is when the aircraft is going to rotate . After rotation and leaving the ground , the distance required to still stop on that same runway increases significantly . For this reason , maximum V1 is generally considered to be Vr ( see <URL> ) . In large aircraft , rejecting a takeoff after leaving the ground is generally discouraged , unless the pilot feels that the plane could be uncontrollable . It 's must safer to continue the takeoff and fly for a normal approach . However , <URL> . In smaller aircraft , it 's more reasonable for the aircraft to take off and then land safely ( I 'm thinking a C172 on one of the low density altitude runways you linked to ) .
The order is " Aviate , Navigate , Communicate " . As a pilot , your first responsibility is to keep the plane flying . After that it is to avoid hitting something or to avoid getting lost . After that comes communication . There are many instances of in-flight emergencies where the pilots never talked to anybody about it , because they were busy flying the plane ... According to FAA , is it required to detail/explain ( maybe file some kind of official document ) your emergency to some kind of authority ? The FAA has many procedures on reporting accidents , incidents , and emergencies . Whether or not you report it depends on what the emergency was . If its a very sick passenger , there may be no reporting required . If your control cables failed , you are required to report it . I 'll update this answer with the regulations as soon as I find them all . Quick answer is any time you declare an emergency or " PAN-PAN " , call the FSDO and let them know . Also depending on the nature of the accident/incident , you may be required to immediately notify the NTSB . See <URL> If you do have to file an explanation , what information do you have to supply ? This depends again on the nature of the emergency , and the FSDO/NTSB will ask you for the proper information when you file the report . At the very least they are probably going to want a narrative of what happened , and depending on what took place , you may want to contact your lawyer first . ( Note : You may have to contact the NTSB immediately but it does n't say you need to provide details , just that there was an incident , so the NTSB would be your first call " I had an incident " , short and sweet , and the lawyer second . ) Also what would happen if they " did n't believe " that situation was an emergency ? Its not ATC 's responsibility to determine if you are lying or not . When you as a pilot say " emergency " you have their full attention . After you get on the ground and the emergency turns out to be you forgot to call your girlfriend/wife and wanted to get ahead of other traffic , then the FAA will get involved . Until you are on the ground , an emergency is handled as priority , regardless of the reason . <URL> who abused the " emergency " system by landing on a public beach in New York because of an airsick passenger and an engine that was " running a teensy bit rough " . He did n't officially declare an emergency , and I ca n't find any record of official enforcement action against him for doing that . Note the NTSB did not investigate this " incident " .
You can sail a seaplane , but there are a lot of considerations . For starters , it makes a big difference as to whether you 're talking about a seaplane where the hull is in the water or a floatplane . A floatplane sitting up on its pontoons ( floats ) is more up in the wind , but it 's also more susceptible to rough water because of its higher center of gravity . My personal experience with sailing a floatplane was with a J-3 cub with an 85 horse engine on rivers and lakes . If we wanted to back onto the shore , we had to sail it since there was no reverse pitch propeller . For purposes of explanation on how to do it , let 's say that there 's no wind , but we 're on a river with enough current that the movement of the floatplane with the current when the engine is off gives the floatplane a wind relative to the water . Further let 's say the river is flowing from east to west , and we want to back onto a beach on the north shore . We land and stop the engine upstream from the beach . As the floatplane drifts it will weathervane into the wind . Thus , with the controls neutralized , we 'll be facing west and moving downstream in mid-river with the current , but not as fast the current because of the drag of the wind on the aircraft . The rule of thumb is that you point the tail towards the shore you wish to get to . We do that by applying left rudder and right aileron . Thus we have increased the drag on the left wing , which will swing the nose left , and the left rudder will also swing the nose left . Thus the nose is now pointed a few degrees toward the left shore ( south ) , the tail toward the right shore ( north ) . The airplane will then sail to the right shore ( north ) relative to the direction the aircraft nose is pointing because the the aircraft is moving backwards relative to the water . The trick in this instance is vary the control input to arrive at the downstream point you want . For practice , I used to have students sail to alternate sides of the river on Oregon 's Willamette River downstream from the city of Eugene .
The flashing lights help to make the airplane more noticeable . They have also been <URL> to <URL> . This is offered as an option or <URL> for <URL> of aircraft . In addition to helping the pilots to see ahead of them when on the ground in dark conditions , landing lights help to make planes more visible to others . The FAA requires landing lights to be on for commercial flights under 10,000 feet , and <URL> at least when near an airport or in low visibility . Flashing the lights makes them less likely to be confused for something like a star at night .
As far as I can tell ( and from my own experience ) , you do n't need any TSA approval for a checkride . Looking at the regulations , <URL> defines flight training as " instruction received from a flight school " ( including from individual instructors ) . A checkride is n't instruction , as you said , although I ca n't find a regulation that explicitly says that ( probably because there 's no real need for one ) . And looking at the FAA 's requirements for checkrides : The FAA 's <URL> for an instrument checkride do n't mention security or say that they have to check anything related to the TSA or AFSP as part of the preliminaries ( see section 5-434 , Establishing Eligibility and 5-446 , Procedures ) There 's no mention of the TSA either in <URL> ( apart from some notes on verifying identity ) There 's also nothing in the <URL> about the TSA or security either , which makes sense because that should match the checkride eligibility instructions . My own experience is also that it is n't relevant to the checkride . I 've done two instrument checkrides after getting the TSA 's approval for training and neither DE asked me for any information about the TSA or AFSP , they were only interested in my logbook ( and medical etc. ) . I suppose there could have been some extra check behind the scenes or in IACRA that I was n't aware of ( and my TSA approvals were still valid ) but I doubt that was the case . Finally , I realize that all this still does n't give a positive confirmation that it 's allowed , so if you want to have that I suggest you call the AFSP hotline and/or your local FSDO to get a definite statement .
I 'm not sure if you 're asking about general export regulations , in which case <URL> is useful , or the more specific licensing question . But regarding licensing it 's clear that you may not fly a US aircraft from the US to Brazil with only a Brazilian license . <URL> says : ( a ) Required pilot certificate for operating a civil aircraft of the United States . No person may serve as a required pilot flight crewmember of a civil aircraft of the United States , unless that person : ( 1 ) Has in the person 's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft when exercising the privileges of that pilot certificate or authorization -- ( i ) A pilot certificate issued under this part and in accordance with § 61.19 ; ( ii ) A special purpose pilot authorization issued under § 61.77 ; ( iii ) A temporary certificate issued under § 61.17 ; ( iv ) A document conveying temporary authority to exercise certificate privileges issued by the Airmen Certification Branch under § 61.29 ( e ) ; or ( v ) When operating an aircraft within a foreign country , a pilot license issued by that country may be used . In other words , you can use your Brazilian license to fly a US aircraft in Brazil ( see 61.3 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( v ) above ) but otherwise you need a US license or a special authorization ( <URL> covers leasing and commercial operations so it almost certainly wo n't apply to you ) . I know very little about this , but at least in theory it looks like your options are : Get a US license yourself , perhaps a foreign-based license based on your Brazilian one ( see <URL> ) Get some special permission from the FAA Pay a <URL> company to fly or transport the aircraft to Brazil Register the aircraft as Brazilian before it leaves the US ( this may not even be possible ) And those are only the FAA/aviation issues , you have to think about customs and general import/export regulations too , both in the US and Brazil . I would look for some specialized help with this .
This answer assumes that the question is in the context of the FAA 's jurisdiction . The red , green and white lights are position lights . They are required from sunset to sunrise by <URL> . ( a ) During the period from sunset to sunrise ( or , in Alaska , during the period a prominent unlighted object can not be seen from a distance of 3 statute miles or the sun is more than 6 degrees below the horizon ) -- ... ( 1 ) Operate an aircraft unless it has lighted position lights ; A solid red or solid white light on the underbelly does n't correspond to a configuration that I am familiar with and does n't meet the legal requirements . I have , however , seen some older varieties of rotating beacons that if broken may become a solid red light mounted on the underbelly . Some older models actually have a motor that actuates rotation . If one had a failed motor it could appear as a solid red light . The strobes are anticollision lights . The answer is also in <URL> . If anticollision lights are installed , they must be used unless the pilot turns them off in the interest of safety . The most common reason for this is if the aircraft is flying in the clouds and the diffuse strobing lights are a distraction or cause of disorientation such as <URL> . ( a ) During the period from sunset to sunrise ( or , in Alaska , during the period a prominent unlighted object can not be seen from a distance of 3 statute miles or the sun is more than 6 degrees below the horizon ) -- ... ( b ) Operate an aircraft that is equipped with an anticollision light system , unless it has lighted anticollision lights . However , the anticollision lights need not be lighted when the pilot-in-command determines that , because of operating conditions , it would be in the interest of safety to turn the lights off . <URL> is also relevant . Parts of it deal with the FAA requirements for both position and anticollision light systems . It states that aircraft may not be operated without position lights . It also states that aircraft may not be operated without anticollision lights installed with some exceptions . There are some provisions by which a flight may be conducted legally with broken lights so that it may be repaired . One such provision is also found in <URL> . ( 11 ) For small civil airplanes certificated after March 11 , 1996 , in accordance with part 23 of this chapter , an approved aviation red or aviation white anticollision light system . In the event of failure of any light of the anticollision light system , operation of the aircraft may continue to a location where repairs or replacement can be made . If you 're really interested , and I mean really really interested , the FAA released <URL> which contains a lot of technical data on exactly how these lights are to be built in terms of intensity , color and position . Delving into this document should be reserved for the truly bored and those who manufacture aircraft lighting .
I heard of a A320 landing , no lights , both generators out , RAT deployed ... , made a successful landing . Is this possible ? Yes A United Airlines Airbus A320-200 , registration N409UA performing flight UA-497 from New Orleans , LA to San Francisco , CA ( USA ) with 109 people on board , was in the initial climb when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit , levelled off at 5000 feet and returned to New Orleans . The crew reported before joining downwind that they had lost all instruments and requested to be talked down by ATC via Precision Approach Radar ( PAR ) . The crew descended to 600 feet where they got visual contact with the water of Lake Pontchartrain and continued visually for a landing on runway 19 about 10 minutes after departure . During landing the aircraft blew both right hand main gear tyres , went left off the runway , stopped with all gear just off the paved surface north of the intersection with runway 10/28 , and was evacuated via slides . A number of passengers needed medical attention due to smoke inhalation . Post landing photos showed the RAM Air Turbine ( RAT ) deployed . Runway 01/19 was closed for about 10 hours . The crew told passengers that they had lost all electronics and were flying on minimal backup systems , landing would occur overweight with minimal braking and minimal steering ability . From <URL> Early on , NTSB investigators suspected a faulty fire-warning sensor in the cargo hold . And they tentatively concluded that the cockpit crew had skipped a portion of the pre-flight checklist then failed to restore power to some equipment , making it more difficult to carry out the emergency landing From <URL> Basically it seems there was nothing wrong with the aircraft apart from a faulty smoke sensor . The crew missed this in their preflight checks , noticed it after take-off and then turned off all the electric generators ( they were supposed to turn one back on according to the checklist - they did n't ) . Anyway , they landed the plane OK on emergency power from batteries and RAT . with only 28VDC ( battery power ) * On the A320 the RAT supplies the ESS bus , not main buses 1 and 2 . It powers both the AC ESS bus and the DC ESS bus through the ESS TR ( transformer rectifier ) . So that 's not just 28V DC but AC too . In the interval after both main generators failing and APU being unavailable , I believe the DC batteries power the DC ESS bus until the RAT is deployed and providing power ( which should happen automatically and quickly ) . So in this short interval there is only DC power on the DC ESS bus .
Trim is simply a force that offsets the neutral position of the control surface . On aircraft with mechanical controls it is provided aerodynamically via trim tab , but it can also be provided by springs , hydraulics , or simply by adding the selected offset in the fly-by-wire computer . Since F-16 , F-18 and F-22 are all fly-by-wire , the last option is most likely . In fact , all these fighters are aerodynamically unstable , which requires using " cooked " controls where centred stick commands the computer to maintain straight flight and the computer then adjusts the stabilators accordingly , doing small corrections all the time since the flight path would quickly diverge without that . So there is no trim in the traditional sense at all .
Assuming that you 're in category 3 ( aircraft under 12,500 lbs ) then an approval is only valid for 365 days , so if you want to continue flight training after that then you need to request a new one : Once you have permission to train , you have 180 days to begin training and 365 days to complete the approved training . Both of these time periods start from the day you receive approval . For example , if you begin flight training 30 days after you have been approved , you now have 335 days to finish . If you do not finish , a new training request must be submitted . That 's from the <URL> ; the TSA 's <URL> is a bit more difficult to use .

Are turbine engine reconditioned after severe FOD damage caused by bird strikes ?
The damage is assessed and then a determination is made whether or not its economical to repair the engine . It will truly be taken on a case by case basis . However , FOD damage to the engine does n't automatically mean the engine will be scrapped , and I think you 'd be surprised with the damage they can suffer and still remain in service after repair .
By not flying through thunderstorms . For a small aircraft , the lightning is not the most hazardous part of a cumulonimbus ( Cb ) cloud system . Mature Cb clouds have huge updrafts underneath them , which can cause enough turbulence to upset most aircraft . Heavy rain and hail is also commonplace underneath Cb clouds . Even the rain can be heavy enough to damage wooden propellers and any components on your leading edge ( such as the <URL> found on the Tiger Moths I fly ) . Hail can put holes in your canvas , which are expensive to repair - if you manage to get the aircraft home at all . This turbulence and rain persists for a much longer period and across a wider area than the thunderstorm itself . For these reasons , the chief protection against thunderstorms is by training and procedure : student pilots are taught to avoid Cb clouds when they 're visible , and to plan flights to avoid areas where Cb are forecast . Weather forecasts and reports specially call out Cb clouds to help with this , and ATIS messages often warn of " cumulonimbus cloud in the vicinity of the aerodrome " . Protecting a wooden aircraft specifically against lightning is not hugely worthwhile , because it 's unlikely to be able to stay in the vicinity of the Cb cloud for long enough to be at risk of a lightning strike . It just wooden happen .
The ones I know of <URL> ( out of production ) <URL> ( they claim its the only pressurized piston single on the market ) <URL> ( out of production ) <URL> ( falls under experimental but is in " production " none the less ) For what its worth this is a pretty small category of plane to begin with . The M22 was not very successful ( although it was ahead of its time ) and there are not that many left flying ( less than 20 I think ) . The P210N saw some better success and the Mirage seems to be selling but in the end of the day extra maintenance and complexity of the plane its self does not lend to a very practical plane considering there size and performance numbers . If we are talking about the less produced or experimental designs we can add , <URL> - One of the early test beds for pressurization <URL> - Altitude record plane <URL> - Another early frame used for testing
When you are not restricted by the size of a cargo hold , your cargo can become much bigger . See below how a <URL> lifts the fuselage and wing root of a Tu-134 . I have not checked whether this is a record , but I would expect that the world record will involve the Mil-26 somehow . Mil-26 lifting a Tu-134 carcass , seen from below ( <URL> )
The valves will not be able to maintain cabin pressure until the plane descends to 10,000 feet at best glide speed . The oxygen masks will deploy before then . At least that was the case for <URL> , an A332 that ran out of fuel over the Atlantic and glided to a deadstick landing . The <URL> on page 96 ( see the table ) estimates that oxygen masks deployed at 06:37:50 , when the cabin altitude reached 13,500 ft. This was about 11.5 minutes after fuel exhaustion , and only 7-8 minutes before landing at 06:45 . So they would have landed within the 10 minutes of supplemental oxygen . Even a much longer glide would have allowed them to descend below 10,000 ft before the supplemental oxygen stopped . TSC 236 is AFAIK the longest glide in a transport category aircraft to date , so if they did not " encounter a situation where they have to choose between oxygen and best glide " ( to use your phrasing ) , then probably no one else did either . Note : The report used the ' worst case ' leak rate of 700 ft/min for their calculation . The footnotes explain that the leak rate would decrease as the aircraft descended ( because the pressure differential between the cabin and the outside would decrease as the aircraft descended ) . If anyone is interested , there is more info on pages 28-29 of the report about the cabin pressurization .
I 've heard about lots of bird strike incidents that occured during a takeoff roll or the early phase of takeoff climb but hardly heard of bird strikes on approach or landing . This is always a dangerous thing . Only because you hear more bird strikes that occur on takeoff , it does not mean there are more at takeoff . I found , for example , <URL> about bird strikes from the year 2000 . It says : [ ... ] 38 % of the bird strikes occurred during take-off and climb , and 56 % during approach [ ... ] That means there are more bird strikes during approach than on takeoff . I assume things have n't changed a lot since then . This question is even answered in the <URL> : Q : Do most bird strikes occur while in flight , at takeoff , or landing ? A : About 60 % of bird strikes with civil aircraft occur during landing phases of flight ( descent , approach and landing roll ) ; 37 % occur during take-off run and climb ; and the remainder occur during the en-route phase . A more specific statistic : <URL> <URL> Possible reason for subjective perception of bird-strikes happening more often during departure I thought a little about it and came to following possible reason : After a bird-strike on final , the pilots will continue landing . It would be unwise not to land immediately . For the passengers it will look like a normal landing . If the bird damages the engine , there is only a small change of sound , because the engines are running very low . However , when a bird-strike occurs while taking off , there is immediate action taken by the pilots . And because the engines are at or near full thrust , the sound of a dying engine can be perceived by the passengers . Last but not least , a departing aircraft has a much higher speed than a landing one , which means more damage . So , for newspapers , a bird-strike at take-off is more <URL> . More damage to the plane than a bird-strike on final Passengers not reaching their destination Dramatic passenger interviews about their " near-death-experience " A newspaper is not interested in a bird-strike on final , where everything went fine and no passenger noticed anything . To support my theorem , I googled " bird strike " and clicked on the " News " - tab . I looked through every article that had to do something with an bird-strike incident . 5 out of 6 articles were about a bird-strike on take-off . That 's over 80 % .
You can not " switch off " a stage of a turbine engine . As seen <URL> jet engines are a single block mechanically locked together : all the stages ( compressor AND turbine ) connected to the same shaft . If the shaft turns , all connected stages turn with it . You can have designs with multiple shafts , but this increases the complexity ( design and maintenance ) heavily . Even if we assume for a moment that you could have 1 shaft per stage , stopping one of these would be generally a bad idea . For acoustic reasons the number of blades on the stationary part of the stage and those on the rotary part must be prime to each other ( example : 37 blades on the stationary side and 39 on the rotary one ) ; this means that when the rotary part stops you can not align all the blades with the stationary ones , creating drag and losses within the engine , thus reducing the efficiency . How would efficiency of a Jet Engine change , if we assume for a second that its a possibility , to stop a few stages ( turn them into free instead of locked ) ? You would still decrease the efficiency : compressor stages are the ones actually <URL> ( you would then produce less thrust * ) and the turbine stages are the ones extracting energy from the exahust . * : you could even risk having the flame going upstream if you stop too many compressor stages and not having enough pressure at the combustion chamber inlet .
As mentioned Commercial should really be " Civilian " which includes Private and Commercial . Lets assume that military includes the various branches that employ pilots ( Navy , Air Force , Marines etc ) . In the end of the day everyone flies a plane ... A chunk of military aviation is devoted to combat related missions , this is something a civilian will never see ( at least as far as I know ) . This includes but is not limited to surveillance , escorts , combat and other military related missions . The military operates troop transport and cargo planes much like commercial operations do and they have pilots who fly them . I would think the tasks are very similar since moving people and cargo is moving people and cargo whether for the military or a civilian organization . The military obviously had access to flying some planes that would be tough to get into as a civilian ( fighter jets mainly ) . One operation that Civilian pilots will never see is take off and landing on a carrier . That is unique to Navy operations and as far as I know there is no way to do it as a civilian or even train for it ( unless you can buy a carrier ) . As far as regulations go the military aircraft and pilots are subject to military regulations ( in terms of up keep and things like that ) and must adhere to those rules which I believe are different in some cases than the FARs that govern US commercial and Private operations . That being said , if flying in US airspace the same rules apply to military planes that apply to civilian planes .
There are certainly a large number of incidents/accidents in military jets involving rudders . I 've listed a few cases , not necessarily in takeoff/landing . A Block 25 F-16C suffered structural failure during flutter tests with the AMRAAM missile . The rudder delaminated and tore off , and the pilot managed to land the aircraft . <URL> Source : f-16 . net B-52 vertical stabilizers were prone to failure during operation at low altitudes . While under testing , a B-52H suffered catastrophic failure of vertical stabilizer . The pilots managed to land the aircraft with help from Boeing test engineers . <URL> " <URL> " by United States Air Force - USAF . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . However , in other <URL> , the same failure caused fatal crashes . A USAF investigation blamed <URL> for the loss of an F-15 near Hawaii in 2008 . The investigation concluded that most probably both rudders in the jet failed due to failure of the aileron-rudder interconnect . F-14 suffered from rudder hardover <URL> , one of which lead to loss of the aircraft . <URL> found the reason was due to mechanical failure of a stop plate attached to the hydraulic actuator .
No two bird strikes are the same when it comes to engine parameters , we can look at <URL> . Bird strike in both engines , yet only one showed above-normal EGT . In a jet engine , the bypass air assists in cooling , damage will disrupt this air flow . The core might still be running , or flammables ( oil , fuel , etc. ) might leak and catch fire . In an engine fire , EGT-rise is one of the confirming factors . However , according to the <URL> for Sully 's plane : No in-flight or postaccident fire occurred . So if it is just an engine failure , the engine will spool down . Even if the damage prevented the windmilling , EGT should still drop . If the EGT sensors were damaged , an indication of EGT reading failure is to be expected . Also the engine vibration indicator should show very high vibration after the bird strike . <URL> ( <URL> )
No clearance is issued without the pilot requesting it . But a request is not just something you do on the radio . The interesting questions here is : how do pilots request something ? The most common way is through a flight plan . By filing a flight plan , the pilot details the planned flight , from departure to destination , via a predefined route , with a requested speed and level . ATC will issue a flightplan clearance prior to departure or prior to entering controlled airspace . This covers the general flight , and basically lets the flight take place . During the flight , specific details need to be requested by the pilot - such as taxi - but only if the controller is not already aware that the flight is ready for whatever it is they are requesting . For example , during radar vectors for approach , ATC already knows that the flight is requesting approach at their destination ( since the destination is noted in the flightplan ) , so ATC will clear the flight for approach without needing the pilot to explicitally request it . Same goes for landing clearance . The pilot does not have to explicitally say " request to land " , because this is already a part of the flight plan . ATC will automatically issue a landing clearance when appropriate . ATC can issue instructions or clearances to flights that deviate from their flightplan if needed for safety or efficiency reasons . For example , ATC may instruct a flight to change level due to traffic ahead on the same level . But the flight plan is always the basis for all clearances .
Weight , cost , reliability and maintenance . See <URL> Safety See <URL> In terms of safety several aspects can be highlighted : As far as power source redundancy is concerned the number is increased from 3 to 4 since 2 electrical systems replace 1 hydraulic system . Furthermore an additional margin of safety results from the introduction of the hydraulic/electric dissimilarity in the power sources : This provides further protection against common failures , such as maintenance errors , which may affect all the hydraulic systems , whatever their number . Moreover the electrical power provides flexibility in routing , resulting in an easier segregation of power distribution routes against engine burst and other " particular risks " , and an isolation and reconfiguration capability that hydraulic systems can not offer . The reduction in the total number of hydraulic components results in improvements of the MTBF and dispatch reliability , by elimination of potential leakage sources . The elimination of the generation and distribution components associated to one of the hydraulic systems ( pump , reservoir , filters , plumbing ... ) and the replacement of the associated hydraulic actuators by electrically powered actuators results in weight savings .
In addition to the reasons given by @Daniele , there are two others that I can think of : security and lack of visibility . At Amsterdam Schipol for a time at least in the 1990s there were two airlines , El Al and Tower that were escorted from the gate to the runway and from the runway to the gate because there was a concern about what we would now call terrorist activity . They used a follow-me car in front and , as I remember , a light armored vehicle ( wheeled , not tracked ) at each wing and a following vehicle . There are occasions , especially in 747s where the pilot eye level is high , that after landing in minimum conditions on a well lit runway ( think centerline lighting , etc. ) you turn off the runway only to find that you ca n't see the taxiway edges all that well . The solution is to call for a follow-me car . Once after landing on 22R at KJFK with the barest of minimums , we asked for a follow-me when we were concerned about being able to keep to the taxiway .
You can get a rough idea by <URL> . Airlines do report technical problems ² to their overseeing aviation safety board ( in India it is , somewhat unusually , part of the civil aviation authority , DGCA ; in most countries it is a separate agency , e.g. NTSB in USA ) . And those publish them . Also for technical problems , aviation safety board of country of manufacture would be consulted , so NTSB should know about most technical problems of B787 and it should be possible to find them in their bulletins . The <URL> collects such reports from various sources . Only incidents that occur in flight get reported and only " interesting " subset of them , but if there were any serious problems with a type , they would come up . Further if some problem requires mitigation steps to be taken , the civil aviation authorities publish airworthiness directives , that describe steps airlines must take ( and under which conditions and until when ) to be permitted to operate the aircraft . Since Boeing is based in USA , any airworthiness directive regarding it would most likely be first published by FAA and usually taken over by aviation authorities in other countries . As far as I know , the batteries were the only serious issue of B787 that required immediate modification throughout the fleet . There are many small ones , like any aircraft , but there does not seem to be anything else that would be significantly more common or serious than on other types . ¹ AvHerald lists aircraft by their ICAO identifiers in the article titles ( and full name in the text ) . The ICAO identifiers distinguish the series , so Boeing 787-8 gets B788 . ² Those that affect safety . So non-working in-flight entertainment would not have to be reported , but a short-circuit in it should be .
Several things come to mind , but they will all reduce efficiency and/or cost money , so they will not be popular with engine users : For turbofans : Reduce the <URL> of the spinning parts by reducing the bypass ratio . Inertia is mass times distance , so making the engine diameter smaller should have the biggest effect . Increase temperature margins for the turbine . Today , the electronic control ( called <URL> for Full Authority Digital Engine Control ) will limit the amount of fuel that can be injected into the combustion chamber to limit the temperature in the turbine . By running the turbine hotter for a few seconds the turbine torque can be increased , at the cost of a reduction in the lifetime of the turbine . For turboprops : Reduce blade pitch momentarily to unload the propeller , so more torque is available for spooling up the engine core . This , however , reduces thrust when it is needed most . Reduce secondary loads by disconnecting generators and closing bleed valves . This is already done by todays engine control , however . The best way of dealing with the slow engine response is operational : Avoid situations where the need for a rapid spool-up might arise or enter those situations not with engines set to idle , but to some medium power setting . Carrier pilots do this routinely by spooling up the engine shortly before touchdown , so they will have the required thrust at their disposal if the tail hook fails to catch any of the <URL> . Thanks to RalphJ for pointing out that turboprops use the same tactic . Helicopters never let the engine run in idle while in flight . If less thrust ( turboprops ) rsp . lift ( helicopters ) is needed , both adjust pitch to set the desired thrust/lift and keep engine RPM up . Now the mass flow through the engine core is the same as at full thrust , only the amount of heating in the combustion chamber is reduced to adjust the power output of the engine . When more thrust/lift is needed , the pilot adjusts pitch and fuel flow to set the desired thrust/lift level . Since the engine is already running at top speed , the change is not delayed by inertial effects .
Turbine is turbine . If you burn fuel to spin a turbine that drives a compressor , it 's turbine . I counted all turboshaft time as " turbine " when reviewing resumes for pilot applicants . Understanding the theory behind turbine engine operation is what everyone cares about , whether is was a turbo-this or a turbo-that is not as important . Contact a few insurance brokers just to be sure . Falcon Insurance , AOPA , TrueCourse just to name a few .
Generally , a compressor can not work efficiently at supersonic speed due to the shockwaves , the role of the <URL> and diffuser is to slow the air below Mach 1 . There is a similar need for a ramjet , so that the combustion can occur within the engine and produce thrust . The cone position and diffuser geometry are adjusted according to the airspeed . The overall shape of the diffuser is diverging . From <URL> , the diffuser decreases velocity and increases pressure according to : $ \ frac 1 \ rho \ ; dp = - \ mathrm V \ ;d \ mathrm V$ where $ \ rho $ is air density . Look at this video : <URL> for more details about how pressure and velocity are affected in a nozzle / a diffuser . Here is a summary : <URL> The J58 is turbojet within a ramjet . The forward section of the engine has a complex role . It adapts to a large range of speed ( 0 to Mach 3.2 ) and altitude ( 0 to 85,000 ft ) , and modifies the airflow to work either as turbojet , or as a ramjet , depending on the airspeed . <URL> Simplified adjustment of the airflow ( <URL> ) . Actual mechanism used at different airspeed ranges in the J58 : <URL> ( <URL> )
VERICOR POWER SYSTEMS has a patent for these valves , number and title The patent includes the following image : SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide for a control and method for arresting flashback in a gas turbine engine combustion system having a venturi for delivering a mixture of air and fuel to a combustion chamber and a valve for controlling the amount of air flowing to the venturi . The present invention achieves this object by providing a flashback control system and method having a flashback detection routine , a valve position trim routine , and a reference flame temperature adjustment routine . The flashback detection routine detects a flashback in the venturi by comparing the temperature at the venturi to the temperature of the air entering the valve . The valve position trim routine receives this flashback signal and in response causes the valve to open until the flashback is arrested . Finally , to prevent the flashback from recurring , the reference flame temperature adjustment routine adjusts a reference flame temperature in the control system so as to prevent the valve from returning to the position at which the flashback occurred . These and other objects , features and advantages of the present invention , are specifically set forth in , or will become apparent from , the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings . The patent can be <URL> , however , it has expired .

During testing , the rear fuselage is protected by a beam made of oak or even steel to distribute the tail strike loads and to protect the aircraft skin . A340 during tail strike tests . This one is literally blazing along the runway ... For normal operations , the protection is removed . However , tail strikes must not cause flight-critical damage , so a few precautions are taken during design : No hydraulic or electrical lines must run along the bottom of the rear fuselage . If there are still mechanical control elements like pushrods , they and their collapsing supports must not be close to the bottom of the fuselage . The tail strike location must be outside of the pressurized part of the fuselage . The main protection against tail strikes , however , is procedural : The <URL> to allow lift-off before a critical pitch attitude is reached . Delta wing aircraft are much easier to over-rotate , so the Concorde used a retractable tailwheel for tail strike protection :
end question
start question
How many planes do ATC controllers assist in taking off/landing each day ?
From the title of your question ( taking off / landing planes ) , I assume you are asking about a tower controller . As you may know , most air traffic do n't work in a control tower , but are en-route controllers working in an ACC ( area control center ) . The number of planes a tower controller handles each day is of course highly dependent on the airport traffic conditions ( november , for example , is a quiet month ) . I work in an European single-runway airport , where the runway capacity is 40 flights / hour ( landings and departures included ) in optimal conditions . Controllers usually work around 5 effective hours per day , so the theoretical maximum number of planes would be 200 planes . In practice , it is very unlikely that a controller will actually control that number of aircraft , because the runway is used at maximum capacity only during peak hours ( early morning , late afternoon and beginning of the evening ) . Also , a tower controller does n't only work at the tower position , she will also be typically work a clearance delivery and an approach position .
I reached out to the <URL> and asked this question . To my surprise , I got an answer back in less than 12 hours . As of December 31 , 2014 , they report : 219 private pilots 951 commercial pilots 4007 ATPL holders 20 MCPL holders For a total of 5197 pilots licensed in Hong Kong .
Some TMA arrival sectors can be further split up into an arrival/pickup part and a director/feeder part . The arrival controller is responsible for getting aircraft separated either onto downwinds or onto transitions , where they are handed off to the director . The director is then only responsible for turning these aircraft onto the approach , in most cases the ILS . Essentially , the arrival or pickup tries to get everyone onto the correct separation and speeds , so the director or feeder can turn and clear the aircraft onto their approaches , i.e. feeding the ILS with aircraft . <URL> ( Source : SentryRaven - Own Work ) The above picture shows the TMA airspace of Frankfurt ( EDDF ) . The TMA arrival controller would clear aircraft onto the transition or a vectored downwind and hand them over to director . The director position would then vector the aircraft onto the ILS for a handoff to tower .
Well , the 3 points you make are easily demonstrable to be true , and also a fairly unique feature of all three if looked at side-by-side . The 747 is the only one with an obvious hump towards the front of the aircraft . This upper row of windows is unlike either of the other two Photo Aldo Bidini : : source : <URL> The A380 has an entire upper row of windows - it does indeed have 2 full decks . Richard Vandervord source : <URL> If it has 4 engines , but neither a half upper deck and hump or a full upper deck ( and it 's an airbus ! ) then yes it is an A340 Aero Icarus source : <URL> However , that is not all the 4 engine passenger aircraft . The BAe 146 is a 4 engine regional airliner , and you could add to your distinguishing features " has a T-tail , must be a 146 " Adrian Pingstone source : <URL> And then we 're into the Ilyushins . The Il-96 , is easily distinguishable from the similar ( ish ) A340 as it is considerably smaller - hard to tell from a close-in photo , but in real life if one were parked next to the other the IL-96 is smaller . Anna Zvereva source : <URL> The Il-86 has 4 engines but does not fit your criteria , as it only remains in service with the Russian Military , but the Il-62 is still in commercial service . It 's very easy to distinguish by having its 4 engines mounted on the tail Tim Rees source : <URL>
Well in regard to " How are these situations resolved ? " you 've already answered your own question in a way : the intended recipient responds with something like <URL> or " Calling center , say again . " ( If they are expecting to hear from a specific aircraft they 'll often respond with " N12345 , say again . " , and if the frequency congestion is really bad controllers may add " All other aircraft standby " ) . As kevin42 pointed out this is very similar to what digital <URL> systems do - they detect a collision ( " Blocked " ) , wait a while , and try their transmission again . As a practical matter , two-way voice communication over the radio is possible , but difficult : for example a discrete " uplink " and " downlink " frequency as you have with some radio systems would be impractical in the sort of mesh topology that you have with aviation radio ( you could implement it for a single air-to-ground pair trivially , but aviation radios are also used for air-to-air communication , and it 's important that pilots hear what 's going on as this enables them to build a mental picture of the airspace , as well as ensure that they 're not blocking other pilot 's transmissions ) . Regarding analog-vs-digital , the traditional AM radio used in aircraft has one major advantage over its digital counterparts : when two digital signals overlap the result is garbage -- you ca n't recover any of the information . When two analog AM signals overlap you get heterodyning ( the two signals mix , and your receiver pipes that mix into your ears ) . The resulting mixed signal sounds AWFUL , there 's an ear-bleeding squeal from the out-of-phase carriers and the voice modulations combine to a garbled mess much of the time , but with experience you can usually pick out one of the communications ( particularly if you 're close to one of the transmitters , where it will overpower the more distant signal ) . The ability to step on a transmission as described above this can be useful : Instructions have been issued over a " stuck mic " before to get other aircraft off the frequency . In a similar vein , if you have an emergency you probably are n't going to listen before you talk - you 're going to key the mic with your mayday and even if the controller misses half of what you 're saying under the heterodyne noise they 'll know there 's an emergency when they hear the other half of your transmission and tell everyone else to standby while they talk to you . In both of those situations a digital system implementing CSMA/CD would detect that the frequency was in use and not transmit ( and if were a digital system and transmitted anyway both digital signals would be garbled and unusable ) .
You did n't mention any specific jurisdiction but for the FAA , the expected actions are in the <URL> . Section 5-2-8 says : When you observe a Code 7600 display , apply the procedures in para 10 − 4 − 4 , Communications Failure Section 10-4-4 gives general instructions for comms failure , it 's too long to quote in full but the first paragraph summarizes it : In the event of lost communications with an aircraft under your control jurisdiction use all appropriate means available to reestablish communications with the aircraft . These may include , but not be limited to , emergency frequencies , NAVAIDs that are equipped with voice capability , FSS , Aeronautical Radio Incorporated ( ARINC ) , etc. . The instructions suggest some specific actions : Broadcast via NAVAID frequencies Ask the aircraft to use its transponder or make turns to acknowledge instructions If comms have n't been reestablished within 5 minutes , ATC is instructed to consider it as suspicious : If radio communications have not been ( re ) established with the aircraft after 5 minutes , consider the aircraft 's or pilot 's activity to be suspicious and report it to the FLM/CIC per FAA Order JO 7610.4 , Chapter 7 , Hijacked/Suspicious Aircraft Reporting and Procedures Section 10-2-5 also says that lost comms are an emergency from the ATC perspective and should be escalated to the <URL> . If comms are n't restored within 30 minutes then the aircraft is considered overdue , which triggers another set of procedures listed in section 10-3 . As for clearing airspace or whatever , there are no specific instructions in the orders , it just says that : When an IFR aircraft experiences two-way radio communications failure , air traffic control is based on anticipated pilot actions . In other words , ATC expects IFR pilots to follow lost comms procedures as per <URL> and will direct other traffic accordingly . Finally , one ' routine ' lost comms scenario is when ATC ca n't contact an aircraft because of poor radio coverage . This happens a lot with smaller aircraft ( which fly relatively low ) operating in remote areas and ATC might ask another aircraft , usually a higher-flying airliner if possible , to contact the first aircraft and relay their call : N12345 , this is BigAir 123 with relay from Denver Center .
When the controller says heading , he means heading . So if he wants you to go into a specific direction , he will take wind into account . The reason for issuing heading are : Every aircraft can fly it , because a compass is fitted on every aircraft . Track keeping requires more sophisticated avionics . If two aircraft fly adjacent to each other , the wind will offset them by the same amount and therefore separation is assured . Quite often a controller will ask you to report your present heading prior to instructing a one so he can make more accurate adjustments to your course , especially if you were under own navigation before being vectored . With Mode S radars and the right equipment in the aircraft , the current heading can be downloaded from the avionics without the pilot being aware of it .
This varies due to operational need and airline standard operating procedures . On my aircraft ( an <URL> ) we turn on the APU roughly ten minutes prior to pushback and shut it down shortly after starting the engines . If we plan on taxiing on one engine we will shut it down after the first engine start and perform a cross-bleed start on the second engine . Other operators leave the APU running for second engine start . If performance requirements demand the engine bleed to be off for takeoff we will leave the APU on until after takeoff to provide cabin pressurization until the engine bleeds come back online . We typically leave the APU off for the remainder of the flight and do not turn it back on until the next flight , unless ground power is unavailable or unreliable at the destination , in which case we will turn it on after landing as we approach the gate . The APU can also be left on ( or started in flight ) to assist with various abnormal or emergency situations where bleed air or electrical power generation might be needed . Each APU installation will have a different flight envelope in which it can be started / used and is specified in the aircraft 's operational limitations .
<URL> The probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew 's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach , including the published missed approach procedure , which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain . <URL> According to released information this cargo aircraft overran the runway after the crew aborted the take-off above Vr after experiencing pitch control problems . The final report of this accident is not yet published but a preliminary report is available . The investigation focusses on the payload distribution which may have caused imbalance leading to the perceived control problems . <URL> The aircraft crashed on final approach in low visibility conditions ( 800 meters ) . During the initial approach the crew had requested and ILS approach ( precision approach ) to runway 02 but then changed their minds and asked for a VOR approach ( non-precision approach ) to runway 20 . During the approach , after deactivation of the autopilot , the aircraft deviated 340 meters to the left and the crew subsequently announced they were going around . Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit tree tops and impacted residential buildings . The final report is expected in October 2015 . To me it seems the probable cause is the failure of the flight crew to properly execute the published instrument approach including the published missed approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft impacting the trees and buildings . <URL> The investigation into this accident is still running , only some preliminary information has been published . Preliminary data indicates that about 36 seconds after takeoff the engine no. 2 auto-feathered , about 46 seconds subsequent to auto-feather the engine no. 1 was shut off by the crew , resulting in loss of all thrust . The aircraft subsequently descended , stalled and crashed into a river . ATR-42 , 16 August 2015 , Trigana Air Service Flight 257 This accident occurred just a couple of days ago so there are few facts known yet and no preliminary findings are published . I will not speculate about the probable cause of this accident . The common thread in the first four accidents seems to be the failure to comply with established procedures resulting in the loss of the aircraft . In two cases ( Lao Airlines Flight 301 and TransAsia Airways Flight 222 ) the flight crew flew a controllable aircraft into the ground . In the case of the Air Niugini crash improper loading of the aircraft is likely to be the cause , resulting in the aircraft being not trimmed correctly for take-off . The crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 235 is the only crash that involved an aircraft system malfunction ( engine 2 failure ) . However , the ATR-72 can fly on a single engine so the failure itself should not have been fatal . The crew then shut down the other engine ( number 1 ) which sealed the aircraft 's fate . It is too early to conclude that the crew did n't follow the correct procedures here ; for example there may have been ambiguous indications from the engine instruments that led them to believe that engine no. 1 had failed . However with the information currently available it seems that the crew did not follow the correct procedures for shutting down a failed engine . The high number of crashes involving an ATR aircraft seems not to be related to the model itself , but to the safety culture and lack of training within a number of airlines operating the aircraft .
A <URL> measures the time spent in a general aviation aircraft with the power on . Planes differ in that time is easier to record than distance . For a given airspeed , the distance covered by the aircraft depends on the wind , altitude , and other factors . Modern airliners would record the period each engine has run , flight time , cycles ( one cycle is one pressurization/depressurization cycle ) , etc. , <URL> . Those records are then used to track the <URL> ( TBO ) . Same as with cars .

It was necessary for Concorde to fly much higher , and not a voluntary decision . A higher cruise altitude increases the demands on the airframe ( examples : <URL> , <URL> ) and is only accepted when it comes with sufficient benefits . An airplane needs a certain wing area for realistic take-off and landing distances . Also , details like the <URL> need to be observed , so the wing area must be large enough to create enough lift at low speed . Lift is proportional to the square of airspeed and air density . The faster a plane flies , the lower the density can be to create sufficient lift . By flying more than twice as fast as a Boeing 737 , the Concorde could fly at a fourth of the density by this reasoning . Air density ( symbolized by the Greek letter $ \ rho $ ) halves approximately with every 5500 m of altitude increase . However , the slender wing needed for low supersonic drag is not as efficient as the sub - / transsonic wing of a 737 , so a little more density was needed for the Concorde . The 737 is designed for cruise between 8000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.526 kg/m ³ ) and 12000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.312 kg/m ³ ) , and the Concorde flew between 16500 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.154 kg/m ³ ) and 18000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.121 kg/m ³ ) .
You can find the 4 segment climb profile described for transport category airplanes in the <URL> and codified in <URL> . The full 4 segment profile described below assumes an engine failure at $ V_1 $ and stipulates a climb and speed profile to clear obstacles . During normal all-engine ops this profile is still technically in place but you 'll hit your speed and altitude targets in such a way that you 'll takeoff into a climb with increasing airspeed and no intermediate level off ( you will still likely use parts of the profile for your flap retraction schedule ) . The segments of the climb are : Liftoff to 35 ' and $ V_2 $ At liftoff you are assumed to be in takeoff configuration with at least one engine not operating . After liftoff you will retract the gear and accelerate to $ V_2 $ while climbing . The goal here is the reach 35 ' height before the end of your takeoff distance . Note that for propeller aircraft , this height is 50 ' instead of 35 ' . 35 ' to acceleration height flown at $ V_2 $ During this segment you climb at $ V_2 $ until you reach a height at which it is safe to level off and accelerate . This height is called the acceleration height and is normally 400 ' AGL . However , this value can vary per runway and will be available to you in your performance data for a particular runway . Level flight at acceleration height to $ V _ { FS } $ You are clear of all obstacles , and now your goal shifts from altitude to airspeed . Level the airplane and accelerate . Continue climbing at $ V _ { FS } $ to 1500 ' ( typical ) Once $ V _ { FS } $ is reached you will continue to climb at that airspeed . This will also mark your transition from takeoff flaps to a clean configuration . The height of 1500 ' is a typical value but may be different based on obstacles for a specific runway . Enroute climb Upon reaching 1500 ' ( or whatever altitude is used in the previous segment ) at $ V _ { FS } $ you transition into your enroute climb . At this altitude you will begin to perform checklists for the engine failure you experienced between $ V_1 $ and liftoff and your after takeoff flows and checklists . Fig 10-36 FAA-H-8083-25 pp 10-30 A transport category airplane with an engine inoperative must be able to meet the climb gradients stipulated in the image above . The climb gradients vary by number of engines ,
In addition to repaints , aircraft are also periodically washed and treated to maintain the paint quality and reduce the build up of dust/grime/salt and other particulates . There are automated systems installed at some airports to clean airplanes as they taxi over these areas . Think of it as a drive through car wash , but for airplanes . The very first applications of these were actually for the US Navy because they have a requirement to wash aircraft due to their proximity to seawater . A company called tammermatic developed a system for the navy to clean airplanes directly on the field using a set of powerful jets . Images from the <URL> <URL> <URL> Then there is the <URL> ( PDF brochure ) , developed by PMW ( a company that makes concrete pumps ) to wash aircraft automatically . It was first used by Lufthansa in 1997 ( image cc : ARNE DEDERT / AFP ) : <URL>
Everyone collectively went " Oh god , not this one " because this same question has sparked some intense debates in the past . Aircraft rely on airflow over the airfoil ( wings/tail etc ) to produce lift - which is independent of the movement of the tires . This means that with enough air going over the wing , the aircraft will fly even if it is n't moving forward at all relative to the ground . This is why aircraft on ramps at airports need to be tethered to the ground . This is n't only to prevent them from rolling around , but from taking off should the air flow get fast enough over the wing . If you are interested in an entertaining segment , the MythBusters did a fairly scientific experiment of this . Although it is n't perfect , I think it does a good job of explaining the concepts .

From the title of your question ( taking off / landing planes ) , I assume you are asking about a tower controller . As you may know , most air traffic do n't work in a control tower , but are en-route controllers working in an ACC ( area control center ) . The number of planes a tower controller handles each day is of course highly dependent on the airport traffic conditions ( november , for example , is a quiet month ) . I work in an European single-runway airport , where the runway capacity is 40 flights / hour ( landings and departures included ) in optimal conditions . Controllers usually work around 5 effective hours per day , so the theoretical maximum number of planes would be 200 planes . In practice , it is very unlikely that a controller will actually control that number of aircraft , because the runway is used at maximum capacity only during peak hours ( early morning , late afternoon and beginning of the evening ) . Also , a tower controller does n't only work at the tower position , she will also be typically work a clearance delivery and an approach position .
In your situation : Oakland Center , Aircraft Identification , Altitude For example : Oakland Center , Cessna 123AB , Level four thousand fife hundred . See <URL> . b. ATC Frequency Change Procedures . 2 . The following phraseology should be utilized by pilots for establishing contact with the designated facility : ( a ) When operating in a radar environment : On initial contact , the pilot should inform the controller of the aircraft 's assigned altitude preceded by the words " level , " or " climbing to , " or " descending to , " as appropriate ; and the aircraft 's present vacating altitude , if applicable . EXAMPLE - 1 . ( Name ) CENTER , ( aircraft identification ) , LEVEL ( altitude or flight level ) . 2 . ( Name ) CENTER , ( aircraft identification ) , LEAVING ( exact altitude or flight level ) , CLIMBING TO OR DESCENDING TO ( altitude of flight level ) . NOTE - Exact altitude or flight level means to the nearest 100 foot increment . Exact altitude or flight level reports on initial contact provide ATC with information required prior to using Mode C altitude information for separation purposes . ( b ) When operating in a nonradar environment : ( 1 ) On initial contact , the pilot should inform the controller of the aircraft 's present position , altitude and time estimate for the next reporting point . EXAMPLE - ( Name ) CENTER , ( aircraft identification ) , ( position ) , ( altitude ) , ESTIMATING ( reporting point ) AT ( time ) . ( 2 ) After initial contact , when a position report will be made , the pilot should give the controller a complete position report . EXAMPLE - ( Name ) CENTER , ( aircraft identification ) , ( position ) , ( time ) , ( altitude ) , ( type of flight plan ) , ( ETA and name of next reporting point ) , ( the name of the next succeeding reporting point ) , AND ( remarks ) .

So I 'm assuming mail does not go in civilian aircraft . Like many thing in aviation it depends . For shipping it will depend on where you are shipping to and from , how big the item is and the chose method of shipment . Both <URL> and <URL> ( who are private shipping carriers ) operate large fleets of cargo airplanes . In many cases a shipment may end up on one of their own cargo planes . However their planes , like passenger planes run routes that may be pre-decided . As such passenger airlines sell the leftover cargo space to anyone willing to buy it . <URL> UPS/FedEx may pre-broker a deal to buy a certain amount of cargo space per year from an airline to obtain a better rate or they may buy it on demand as needed . Now Air Mail is a bit different as its <URL> postal service . Technically the USPS no longer offer airmail service as it was once called but does still offer domestic and foreign guaranteed time shipping . All of these items are moved in <URL> or by under contract by FedEx as the USPS no longer operates any aircraft . Am I right , and if so , what 's the reason for that ? It seems it would be extremely more efficient at least for small shipments . Like most things in aviation low cost will always beat out marginal efficiency . If FedEx can ship a package at a significantly reduced rate but in turn it will take an extra day or two to arrive than many customers will see a value add in that . In the same vein it would be very efficient to fly every passenger in a small plane to an airport closer to their final destination and have the plane depart when the passenger needs to , however the cost of that simply would never work out .
while I do n't think such a regulatory minimum would make sense , I 'm still curious about whether it exists . No , there is no such regulatory minimum . On average , it 's between 10 and 20 minutes from pushback to takeoff , although there are a couple of places I can think of ( very short taxi from gate to runway ) that I 've seen it done in under five minutes . That 's moving pretty fast , though -- almost nonstop checklists , other than during the time the engines are starting . But whatever you can do safely , is fine as far as regulations are concerned . If you 're ready to go , no regulation makes you wait . Depending on the aircraft , there may be an engine warmup requirement or recommendation . That 's typically much more restrictive for the first flight of the day , and that would be a limiting factor in the very short taxi cases .

Why not simplified fly by wire helicopter controls ?
Helicopter manufacturers seem to have been slow to adopt fly-by-wire systems . I used to work in the General Dynamics group which designed the fly-by-wire system for the F-16 . That was the first production aircraft which had full-authority fly-by-wire ( without mechanical backup systems ) . By the time I started working there , they were in process of updating the system to incorporate a digital flight control computer . The production required extensive coordination between multiple disciplines . As an electrical engineer , I regularly interacted with software engineers , control-law designers , test engineers , and " mechanization " engineers . It took many years for the company to develop such a culture , where each member is concerned with the efficiency and safety of the aircraft . I speculate the helicopter manufacturers did n't catch up for a couple of decades because funding was limited . Here is an article which describes the Army 's experience : <URL> Funding aside , helicopters are ideal candidates for fly-by-wire systems . The obvious goal is to take a marginally controllable aircraft and make it both stable and maneuverable . That would dramatically reduce pilot workload . Most helicopter fly-by-wire systems accomplish hands-free hover and decoupled control inputs ( i.e. sideways flight without needing rudder inputs ) . The first helicopter which demonstrated a great fly-by-wire system was the Sikorsky RAH-66 . It even achieved sideways flight at 60 knots and backward flight at 25 knots , using only cyclic stick inputs . Unfortunately , that program was cancelled in 2004 . The first production military fly-by-wire helicopter is the Airbus NH90 , which entered service in 2007 . Soon , there will be production of the first civilian fly-by-wire helicopter too : <URL> .
C-5 Galaxy was designed to military requirements that for cargo aircraft include : operating from unpaved runways ( I am not sure in case of C-5 , but probably yes ) operating from airfields without much support operating from short runways paradrop capability These basically imply a high-wing design so that engines are high ( to minimize risk of foreign object damage ) and the deck is lower for easier loading , front and rear cargo door with loading ramps so loading is possible without any ground infrastructure and some excess thrust for sufficient performance on short fields . However that design is less efficient . It has higher operating cost . The air force is willing to pay it , because it needs the capabilities it requested . But commercial operations do n't need those things , because it has enough well equipped airports to operate from . So the higher cost of operating an L-500 ( as civil version of C-5 would be called ) makes it uninteresting . B-747 only shares one design feature with C-5 , the raised cockpit that allows full-height cargo door in the nose , but otherwise it is optimized to minimize operating cost , making it great cargo plane for operations between airports . On a side note , there is some commercial demand for transporting heavy or large cargo to less equipped airports . These are currently covered by ex-soviet-military An-124 aircraft that look very similar to Galaxy , are a bit larger , are certainly able to land on unpaved runways and were simply available when Soviet Union collapsed .
<URL> . When a business goes bankrupt or bust , depending on jurisdiction , the assets of the company may not belong to the company anymore , they may belong to creditors . Monarch may not have even owned them in the first place , since some airlines use leases from other airlines or banks to get aircraft . Even if Monarch did own the aircraft , and they went belly-up meaning the aircraft were basically nobody 's , now you have to worry about insurance and liability . The aircraft need to be insured to fly , and there is an assumption of liability if something ( like a crash ) were to happen . There are logistics like maintenance , repairs , etc. . Somebody will have to go through all the aircraft and make sure that they are legal to fly ( review logs , maintenance records , etc ) . Then you have the crews : they are not employed , and the CAA is n't going to employ a bunch of pilots for a couple of weeks just to run ferry flights . The pilots may demand benefits , etc. . It would be difficult or impossible to contract them as private parties ( since most insurance companies would not let you do that ) . So the easiest option is to let somebody else take care of all that by using charter flights . They have the infrastructure ( pilots , planes , fuel contracts , insurance , etc ) to get these people out . The CAA just has to call them up and say " we need X number of people picked up from ABC on some-date " , and the charter company takes care of it . Of course it is a little more expensive than doing it yourself , but you are n't trying to basically build a short-term airline and then shut it down again .
is n't the cost directly proportional to speed ? No . Most fuel can be saved by flying higher because the lower air density reduces parasite drag . Provided the trip is long enough for the saving at altitude to offset the cost of getting there . Aircraft drag has two components . The parasite drag which increases with speed and the induced drag which decreases . So they have a point of minimum drag and for jet airliners it 's typically somewhere between 200 and 250 knots indicated . Flying any slower would increase the cost . At the altitude where jets normally fly , the true speed is significantly higher than indicated speed . For jet engines , the fuel burned is roughly proportional to thrust they generate and at higher thrust lower per unit of thrust . Since power is thrust times speed , this translate to much better efficiency at higher speed . So a jet wants to fly slightly faster than their lowest drag point . Even if the trip cost is higher , higher speed allows you to make more trips , so the fixed costs get split over more passengers . So it makes sense to fly slightly faster than the lowest fuel burn . Generally airliners are operated at the point of lowest cost . For long trips where it pays off to climb high , jets are most efficient . For short trips , turboprops are often used that ca n't climb that high , but are more efficient at lower altitudes and speeds .
TCAS gets fairly accurate altitude information from the same source as the transponder . Thus any extrapolation from this information can yield a fairly accurate prediction of whether two aircraft may collide , and provide more certainty that changes in altitude will avert any conflict . Range information is obtained by measuring the round trip time of the interrogation and response . This will also be fairly accurate . Direction information is obtained by using the TCAS antenna to detect the direction of responses from other aircraft . These values are then extrapolated to provide an expected path of other aircraft . Most airliners <URL> which only provides the vertical guidance . <URL> was envisioned to provide horizontal guidance as well , but : it was judged by the industry to be unfeasible due to limitations in the accuracy of the TCAS directional antennas . Even if TCAS can be accurate to <URL> in direction , this translates to over 300 feet of uncertainty at 1 nmi . TCAS IV was planned to use more accurate GPS information , but with ADS-B becoming more widely adopted , this development was stopped in favor of some future system that can use existing ADS-B technology . Another point is that airplanes are generally larger in the horizontal plane than the vertical , and thus would need to change course more horizontally to avoid collision than they would need to vertically . Especially as planes get larger , they also tend to be more maneuverable in pitch than in turns .
Because each jet engine only has one lever ; each piston engine has three . Jet engine 's throttle is pretty straight forward - move forward , more power . The computer automatically manages fuel flow to prevent surge , flameout and N1 overshoot . On a piston engine you have three - a mixture lever , a propeller lever and a throttle lever . Granted , I do n't think auto-mixture would be too hard to implement . Now , do I want a high-speed climb or high-power climb ? And remember , the prop and throttle must be managed together . You can not go beyond a certain power range with the props set for low rpm , otherwise you 'll damage the engine . It 's like a car 's automatic transmission , except it has one more dimension . Power affects pitch When you change power you must change the aircraft 's pitch altogether . Autopilots on modern airlines have quite a number of vertical modes : ALT , V/S , G/S , VNAV , FLCH , TO/GA , CLB etc. . None of those have the concept of gear ratio , which is required for propeller management . Can you design an autopilot system such that it functions on propeller engines ? Absolutely . But it is going to be complicated . Not only the usual operations , but the failure modes , have to be engineered and learnt by the pilots . How do you deal with an auto-mixture failure ? RPM mismatch ? Such training would add unnecessary cost to an otherwise simple aircraft operation . If your airplane does not have a variable pitch propeller , it is probably too simplistic for this kind of autopilot anyway . Jets have another property which makes auto throttle a logical choice - the faster you fly , the more powerful the engines . Thus , on a jet , you would have to make continuous throttle adjustment if you change your airspeed . So an auto throttle would be helpful . Pistons do not behave like that . Turboprops One of the main reasons for choosing piston aircraft is - it is simple . It just fly . No fancy stuff . No lengthy preflight checks . No computers . I just want to get flying . This thinking also extends to turboprops . It 's worthy to note that the ATR does not have auto throttle as well . The ATR 42 has power management ( but not speed management ) , where activating it will simply move a bug on the torque gauge ; the pilots have to manually move the levers to follow it . The ATR 72 has a notch for the pilots to place the throttle levers , but still , no motor to move the levers automatically . I ca n't think of any reason behind this design philosophy besides simplicity and cost .
I know you asked specifically about runway versus helipad departures , but I thought I would lay out all the options available to the heli pilot , and you can see what all the choices are . There are three different areas on an airport that a helicopter can operate from : Non-movement area -- this is the area of the airport that is not controlled by the ground or tower controller . It often consists of aircraft parking areas or an area leased by a tenant . It is separated from a movement area by this the marking below . Helipads may be found in non-movement areas , such as the Coast Guard helipads at SFO and JFK . <URL> Movement area -- this is the area of the airport controlled by a ground controller , and separated from the runway area by this marking : <URL> . Helipads can be found in movement areas . Runway area -- this is the area controlled by the tower controller , and contains the runways used for landing and departing traffic . This picture from KHWD shows the three areas : <URL> Regardless of which area is used , almost heli departures from towered airports are coordinated directly with the tower controller because the aircraft enters the controllers airspace . At non-towered airports , helis operate out of the flow of fixed-wing traffic , and need to self-announce like any other aircraft . Additionally , helicopters can make three different kinds of departures : max performance take off -- which begins with a near-vertical segment , and then transitions to a horizontal . This is typically used from a confined area , and looks something like this : <URL> normal takeoff -- this begins in an in-ground effect hover with a horizontal segment until translation lift is assured , then transitions into a climb : <URL> running takeoff -- when there is insufficient power to begin with an in-ground effect hover , then the helicopter may begin its departure by sliding ( skids ) or rolling ( wheels ) along the ground , until translational lift can be obtained , then transitioning into a normal takeoff : <URL> The choice of departure area and departure type are for the most part independent , but they are obviously linked based on performance and obstacles . The departure area is an operational decision . When the helicopter is operating from a remote part of an airport , the pilot will often make a departure from a non-movement area ( helipad or ramp ) so she does n't have to taxi to the runway . If the helicopter is a passenger flight , such as air-taxi , it will most likely operate from the runway or a helipad in the movement area . The departure type is a performance decision , based on obstacles , weather , weight , and available power . Hot &amp; high departures might require a running take-off . Lightly loaded twin-engine copters in normal weather can safely make high-performance departures over obstacles in the desired direction of flight .
If the plane crashes with high vertical speed , the decelerations involved are so insanely huge that there is absolutely no way to make it survivable . That is well explained in <URL> . However in many cases the aircraft is still , at least partially , controllable , so a crash-landing can be made . And that is the case where survivability can be improved by careful design , so that is the case they were testing . This is also relevant for accidents on landing where the aircraft simply does not have that much vertical speed . Together these scenarios cover more accident cases than the out of control scenario .
There is no general answer , but the closest one would be bad luck . In the DC-10-10 , the aircraft of <URL> , all three hydraulic lines went through one hole in the tail bulkhead which was damaged when the engine failed . This is no real redundancy , and it was bad luck that this particular spot had been hit . In the <URL> , the same accident would had damaged probably just one line . There , the three hydraulic lines are separated as much as possible in the tail section ( one on top , one on the left side and one of the right side of the fuselage ) . Lockheed has more experience with military design than Douglas , so the Lockheed engineers were more aware of redundancy issues . In the A300 involved in the <URL> , the same bad luck happened . Normally , each aileron is powered by two out of three hydraulic circuits , so one would remain if the other two are hit . Note that the green and yellow circuits were lost immediately , while the blue circuit failed only <URL> . But in this case the damage extended to the spoilers , so all three circuits were affected in the end . There is only so much damage you can protect against . Also for <URL> the damage was just too extensive to not involve all four hydraulic circuits . The rear pressure bulkhead burst and blew most of the vertical tail surface away . It can be argued that the real culprit , however , was the chief pilot 's refusal to don his oxygen mask . But the aircraft was only marginally stable and <URL> . Hydraulic fluid needs to be pumped continuously to heat it so its viscosity stays low . If you add shutoff valves , this pumping could be impeded . Note that the spoilers of the Bagdad A300 were not sucked open because non-return valves blocked the lines to the spoilers , helping in keeping the aircraft flyable . If you put shutoff valves along the hydraulic lines , you open up a new avenue for failures . The idea of hydraulics is that you use just one pump and can create the maximum force at any point , since rarely would you need to move several actuators at maximum load in parallel . Splitting up the circuitry to enable the pilot to isolate parts of the airplane will take away this advantage , resulting in a more complex , heavier hydraulic system . And who knows if those added parts would not malfunction or be mishandled , resulting in a new class of entirely avoidable accidents .
The control forces are there by design . All airliners have artificial force feel from springs , dampers etc. . A B747 flies through the skies a lot faster than a Cessna 172 and bad things could happen if it were easy to deflect the flying controls at M 0.85 . The B737 elevator is a good case in point . It has <URL> ( artificial feel ) provided by a spring device , and the spring gradients stiffen up as a function of airspeed . At higher speeds it is quite hard to deflect the column by pushing/pulling and much easier to use the trim button to control the pitch . For Level D simulator control forces we measured the forces necessary to deflect the column fully when trimmed in mid position , which turned out to be a serious body-building exercise : About 200 N at zero airspeed About 500 N at 400 knots 20,000 ft. ( Measurement taken on ground with a pressure hose attached to the pitot tube , and aircraft on jacks with the landing gear retracted ) . By contrast , helicopter flying controls are light because helicopters are inherently unstable and a lot of stick action is necessary , particularly in the hover . In most helicopters the feel forces can be switched off completely with the trim button , resulting in a very light stick , perfectly OK with the relatively docile response of the helicopter . But a 747 is a stable airframe . A fast aircraft with large control deflections results in high accelerations , which can result in Pilot Induced Oscillations or structural damage to the airframe . The two measurements of B737 control column , digitised from the original plots and on the same scale : column position on the x-axis , force on the y-axis . By design , force required to deflect the column fully from about mid position is about 40 lbf at zero knots , 100 lbf at 400 knots . This is from an artificial q-feel system and the feel is implemented by design . The vertical distance between the sides of the curve is caused by friction . <URL> At 0 knots : Notice that around mid the spring gradient is very steep : the breakout , to indicate neutral position . Then between 0 and 5 inch a spring gradient of 4 lbf/inch . Beyond 5 inch a relatively flat gradient , to make it not too hard to deflect the column fully . <URL> At 400 knots : it is made hard to fully deflect the column . 100 lbf pull from a seated position is nothing to sneeze at .
It was necessary for Concorde to fly much higher , and not a voluntary decision . A higher cruise altitude increases the demands on the airframe ( examples : <URL> , <URL> ) and is only accepted when it comes with sufficient benefits . An airplane needs a certain wing area for realistic take-off and landing distances . Also , details like the <URL> need to be observed , so the wing area must be large enough to create enough lift at low speed . Lift is proportional to the square of airspeed and air density . The faster a plane flies , the lower the density can be to create sufficient lift . By flying more than twice as fast as a Boeing 737 , the Concorde could fly at a fourth of the density by this reasoning . Air density ( symbolized by the Greek letter $ \ rho $ ) halves approximately with every 5500 m of altitude increase . However , the slender wing needed for low supersonic drag is not as efficient as the sub - / transsonic wing of a 737 , so a little more density was needed for the Concorde . The 737 is designed for cruise between 8000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.526 kg/m ³ ) and 12000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.312 kg/m ³ ) , and the Concorde flew between 16500 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.154 kg/m ³ ) and 18000 m ( $ \ rho $ = 0.121 kg/m ³ ) .
The vortex generators are used in commercial aircraft ( Boeing especially ) , for a number of reasons , which are usually not applicable to GA aircraft . For example , vortex generators are used for anything from stall alleviation to <URL> to noise reduction , some of which are not applicable for GA aircraft . Also , they are <URL> , which is much more expansive compared to the GA aircraft . That said , vortex generators are found in some aircraft , like the Piper Malibu Meridian , as shown below , <URL> . <URL> Image from www.nasa.gov Another point is the a <URL> for GA aircraft . A number of GA aircraft have been retrofitted with them . <URL> By Ahunt at English Wikipedia - I took this photo and release it to the public domain , Public Domain However , they are quite costly and require extensive tests for certification , with the result that they are not used much compared to commercial aircraft .
Oh , but they are all * correct ! First , we have to say that we are not talking about cause here . There is a flow around the wing and it has certain properties and neither is cause of the other ; they are both effects of the flow . What we are talking about here is explanations why every flow that produces lift also produces induced drag . And as far as explanations go , there can be more than one , because the physical theories have a lot of redundancy in them . You can usually arrive at the result by multiple ways . You can use the orientations of the normals ( the <URL> answer ) , you can use laws of conservation of energy and momentum ( <URL> answer ) or you can use the <URL> and that explanation will indeed involve the wake vortices . Because the potential flow theory is a mathematical apparatus for analysing fluid flow as a combination of vortices and from that angle of view , the energy is indeed carried away by the wake vortices . However , the wake vortex explanation has one problem : it is often associated with different misconception , the one that the vortices are caused by transverse flow around the tip and the resulting idea that it can be eliminated by doing something with the tips specifically . But that 's not what the potential flow theory says . According to the potential flow theory , there is a vortex originating from every point along the span and they combine to form the two tip vortices . So like the other explanations , it also clearly says the induced drag is related to any generation of lift . And if you understand that , it is correct . I still consider it unnecessarily more complicated . * All the three you listed that is . The ones that claim the wingtip vortex is caused by transverse flow around the tip are not , because it is n't . The wingtip vortex is just the vortex line of the overall wake ( and should preferably be called wake vortex ) .
You 're correct that a headwind will reduce the takeoff roll ( takeoff distance ) . As far as takeoff speed , the airspeed will remain same , but the ground speed will be reduced . In the simplest sense , an aircraft rotates for takeoff when it generates enough lift ( leaving aside other considerations ) . This is dependent on the airspeed as the lift generated is propotional to the square of airspeed ( provided the other factors like wing area and lift coeffecient are kept constant ) at a density altitude . As a result , it is the airspeed , not the groundspeed that matters . If you have some headwind , the effective groundspeed is reduced by the same amount - resulting in reduced takeoff distance . The effect of the wind on landing distance is similar to the takeoff distance . You can see this in the following figure . <URL> Image from <URL> As it can be seen , the presence of winds can have a significant effect on the takeoff disantances required ( note that the airspeed remains the same in all cases ) . Due to this , the direction of prevailing winds can have a significant effect on determining the runway headings . From <URL> : The weather patterns of an area , especially the prevailing winds , are a major factor in determining runway headings . Prevailing winds are defined as the direction from which the winds blow most frequently . Remember that airplanes take off and land into the wind . Let 's say that at a given airport the prevailing winds blow in from the west 65 % of the year , while 30 % of the year the wind blows in from the east , and the remaining 5 % coming from the northwest . It would be best then to orient the runway W ( 27 ) and E ( 9 ) . That would mean that approximately 95 % of the year airplanes would be landing and taking off into the wind .
FlightRadar and similar websites use <URL> for aircraft detection , most commonly they use <URL> . Not all General Aviation aircraft , to which helicopters would count normally , are equipped with transponders that are capable of emitting ADS-B data , so they would not show via regular means on FlightRadar . The primary technology that Flightradar24 use to receive flight information is called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast ( ADS-B ) . ADS-B is a relatively new technology under development which means that today it 's rarely used by Air Traffic Control ( ATC ) . Our estimations show that roughly 65 % of all commercial passenger aircraft ( 75 % in Europe , 35 % in the US ) are equipped with an ADS-B transponder . For general aviation this number is probably below 20 % . But this percentage is steadily increasing as ADS-B will become mandatory for most aircraft in most airspaces around the world , by year 2020 . When mandatory , ADS-B will replace primary radar as the primary surveillance method used by ATC . Flightradar24 has a network of more than 4,000 ADS-B receivers around the world that receives plane and flight information from aircraft with ADS-B transponders and sends this information to our servers . Due to the high frequency used ( 1090 MHz ) the coverage from each receiver is limited to about 250-400 km ( 150-250 miles ) in all directions depending on location . The farther away from the receiver an aircraft is flying , the higher it must fly to be covered by the receiver . The distance limit makes it very hard to get ADS-B coverage over oceans . About 99 % of Europe is covered with ADS-B receivers . There is also good ADS-B coverage in USA , Canada , Mexico , Caribbean , Brazil , Russia , Middle East , India , Japan , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , Australia and New Zealand . In other parts of the world the ADS-B coverage varies . The other option is to receive the regular Mode-S transponder signal by a technique called <URL> , however the FlightRadar website states that this is something that only works reliably at high altitude , at least 5 000 to 10 000 ft. In some regions with coverage from several FR24-receivers we also calculate positions of non-ADS-B equipped aircraft with the help of Multilateration ( MLAT ) , by using a method known as Time Difference of Arrival ( TDOA ) . By measuring the difference in time to receive the signal from aircraft with an older ModeS-transponder , it 's possible to calculate the position of these aircraft . Four FR24-receivers or more , receiving signals from the same aircraft , are needed to make MLAT work . That means that MLAT coverage can only be achieved above about 5,000-10 ,000 feet as the probability that signal can be received by four or more receivers increases with increased altitude . Most parts of Europe are today covered with MLAT above about 5,000-10 ,000 feet . There is also some MLAT coverage in North America , Mexico , Australia and Brazil . More areas will get MLAT coverage during 2014 and 2015 . For more information , check <URL> page .
You just fly your profile . Initially its with an instructor , but eventually you move on to training by yourself/copilot . You can practice full autos ( to a landing ) , but some airframes practice to a hover or in early stages . In the TH-57B ( Bell 206 ) , you can take it a full power-off landing during training since it is light enough . However , moving up to the TH-57C you do power-on recoveries , where you run the twistgrip back up to full open while you 're in the flare . You then initiate the recovery to arrive at a standard 5-foot hover . The C model has significantly more weight , which is the main reason . In the MH-60S its all power-on , recovery to a hover . Except we do not go to idle like in the 57s , we just rapidly lower the collective to get the needle split . Same process in practicing your scan , initiating the flare , and then pulling in power at the appropriate height once you 've leveled . Finish at 10 feet with some forward speed . ( Rumor is that Army does full practice autos in their 60s , but never confirmed that ) . Navy prohibits it in the MH-60S and almost certainly in the MH-60R as well . The explanation I received is that the airframe is meant to absorb the impact similar to your car during a full auto , and thus full practices can structurally compromise the bird .

The one that decided to ground the fleet was Qantas . Qantas was having a new airplane model and potentially made a trade-off between having a not known design flaw and keep flying and the risk . At that time the A380 entered in service three years before and around 20 aircraft were in service with a mix of engines . Today , there are 200 A/C in service for 10 years . The possibility of having a design flaw or an unknown problem is really low . It was not a airworthiness directive as the directive was created <URL> in January 2011 . Qantas starting to get back in service the airplanes on 27th November ( incident was on 4th Novemeber )
the scissor link ensures the upper swashplate rotates with the rotor blades ( and the lower with the body ) while ensuring enough movement for the plate to control the craft ( tilting and up and down ) . ( <URL> ) To keep the stationary swashplate from rotating with the rotor , a scissor mechanism is added . The scissor connects the swashplate to the fuselage . The scissor consists of 2 parts which are connected by a hinge . One end is connected to the helicopter using a hinge , while the other is connected using a ball joint . This means that the swashplate can move freely up and down , and can freely tilt in any direction , but ca n't rotate around the mast . <URL> this is needed because the control linkage is typically attached with balljoints which would otherwise allow for too much relative movement .
There are a few spots not covered by primary radar . Here are a few I can think off : Afghanistan , not really what you 'd expect from flying between Europe and South East Asia . I was told though by the pilots that the Americans were keeping an eye on us . I 'd imagine there are a few holes in the CIS countries as well . Multiple areas in Africa , but this is improving I believe . There 's a post on <URL> . Apparently known as the ' dark continent ' for spotty coverage and consistency . South Africa has good coverage , and I 'd guess the same for much of northern Africa as well . A few remote areas in South America , then again , improving . Oceans are not covered . Determining factors are population density , aircraft density and economic development . As more you Malaysia map , if there 's a radar at Kota Bharu [ KBR ] airport , here 's the map assuming a range of 200 Nm for the radar .

<URL> that are capable of <URL> , and some aircraft can use this system to <URL> . However , <URL> and still has its limits , and other reasons for not always using this system are <URL> . Further reasons for this technology not being more fully developed yet are probably similar to <URL> . A completely automated , unmanned landing on a carrier has been done , <URL> . Although a computerized system is theoretically more capable of performing precise carrier landings , the details are complex . A lot of sensing and control must be worked out . The team behind the X-47B was awarded the <URL> for the advances in aeronautics they achieved . The sensors and processing that the UAV uses to do this are probably not all standard equipment on naval aircraft . Adding them would create extra expense and weight . If the system requires addition to the carrier as well , there is more added expense . And in a combat situation , do you want to rely on systems that could be jammed or failed ? If you are going to land the plane without a pilot , you might as well not have the pilot at all , and this is the route that future unmanned systems are taking , but there is a lot more work to be done before they completely replace human pilots .

Why is it called " Dry Thrust " ?
Dry thrust usually means the non-augumented thrust i.e. thrust without the use of afterburners or liquid injection . The maximum thrust produced by jet engines w/o afterburner is sometimes called military thrust . The thrust of a jet eingine can be increased by using methods like water ( + methonol ) injection ( mostly in older turbojet engines ) or by using afterburners ( reheat ) . In such cases , the ( higher ) thrust produced is called wet thrust .
Most helicopter do n't carry radar ; there is no need for it . In civil helicopters radar is typically used for weather detection . In most use cases there is not real need for it because helicopters are usually operating under daytime Visual Flight Rules ( VFR ) and are staying away from clouds . For maritime helicopters that are used in search and rescue operations or off-shore operations on oil-rigs , weather is often installed . The typical location is in a radome in the nose of the helicopter . Examples are the <URL> or <URL> Military helicopters use radar for detecting objects . Depending on the nature of the mission the helicopter is designed for , the radar is underneath ( usually for navy operation , providing sea surface detection capabilities , see for example the navy version of the NH90 ) or on top of the rotor ( to look over obstacles such a hills / trees and provide fire control to their missiles ) . An example is the <URL> .
<URL> describes considerations for choosing sunglasses for pilots . Since the document concludes , that Polarized sunglasses are not recommended I presume there is no rule that would explicitly forbid it . However there is always the " operate aircraft careless and reckless manner " paragraph and if you badly screwed up while wearing such sunglasses and there was grounded belief that some of the disadvantages of such sunglasses contributed to the incident , you could be charged with that . The document quotes following reasons why they are not recommended : may reduce or eliminate visibility of instruments with polarization-based anti-glare filters , may reduce or eliminate visibility of LCD instruments ( LCDs emit polarized light by design ) , may interfere with visibility through an aircraft windscreen by enhancing striations in laminated materials , may mask the sparkle of light that reflects off shiny surfaces such as another aircraft 's wing or windscreen , which can reduce the time a pilot has to react in a " see-and-avoid " traffic situation . Even if your plane does not have any instruments with polarization filters and no issues with striations in laminated windshield , filtering reflections from other aircraft is definitely not what you want . Note that in most other situations , filtering reflections ( from water , cars , metal roofs etc. ) is desirable and is why polarized glasses exist , because reflections from close objects can be blinding . But in aircraft you are far from the sources of reflection , so the risk of blinding reflection is low , while the reflections can alert you to presence of other aircraft that might otherwise be hard to spot when looking towards the sun .
Engines must be at idle thrust to enter reverse thrust . This may not be 100 % true of the physical action of engine entering reverse thrust ( opening the buckets or translating the cowling ) , but it is required by the thrust levers . In all airplanes I 'm familiar with the thrust levers must be at idle to enter the reverse regime , In the EMB-145 the reversage was below idle ( i.e. you keep moving the levers aft ) through a gate . Even if the engine is capable of entering reverse thrust not at idle , there is no way to command it without first being at idle .
There are 4 classes of cargo compartments listed in <URL> for transport category airplanes . The main concern with in-flight access is in regards to fire safety . Class A : Crew will easily discover fire from their station ( and therefore be able to suppress it as well ) Class B : There is a fire/smoke detection system , and access for crewmember to use a hand fire extinguisher Class C : There is a fire/smoke detection system to alert the crew , and a fire extinguishing/suppressing system installed Class E : For cargo-only aircraft ( no passengers ) : There is a fire/smoke detector , and a way to shut off air flow to the compartment So basically , there has to be some way to both detect and address a cargo fire . Class A compartments are those such as in the cockpit where a detection system is not necessary . It sounds like the ATR example would be Class B , since they had a fire indication , and the crew had access to extinguish the fire themselves . In larger planes with cargo in the lower hold , the compartments are usually Class C , so they have a detection system and a suppression system , and in-flight access is not required . As <URL> notes , the compartment may be accessible , but that does n't mean that crew could effectively locate or fight a fire in those areas . Especially for large cargo holds , a fire suppression system installed througout the hold is much more effective than crew members gaining access at certain locations . This also provides the benefit of isolating the main cabin from the fire extinguishing agents . Besides fires , there are <URL> where cargo compartment access could be helpful . But even in that case , it was better for the plane to just come back and land to access the cargo compartment .
The difference between both values is the energy set free when the water created by the combustion process condenses . Use the lower heat value for jet engine calculations . The water in a jet engine leaves it as vapor , and the vaporisation heat is lost for propulsion .
Estimations We can at least estimate a reverse thrust case based on some numbers and some physics , a bit of a specific case of <URL> . The stopping distance equation : $ $ d_f = \ frac { v_i ^ 2 } { 2a } $ $ The information <URL> for the 727-200 gives stopping distances for different cases . If we look at a sea level pressure altitude case with 120,000 lb gross weight , the stopping distance is 2452 feet . The correction for a reversers only case is 2.57 , bringing the distance to 6302 . At a landing speed of <URL> , the plane will take 11500 lb of force to stop in that distance . Each engine on the 727-200 provides 14500 lb of thrust force maximum . Considering that part of the stopping force will be provided by drag and surface friction , the reverse thrust is about 25 % of the maximum forward thrust . The reversers will be more effective at higher air speeds , so the maximum will be higher than this . Figure 39.5 <URL> shows a graph of reverse thrust compared to forward thrust for different bypass ratios and reverse thrust types . This is a good check for a general case . The GEnx-1B64 has a bypass ratio of about 10 , and reverses the fan but not the primary exhaust , which gives a ratio of 30 % of maximum forward thrust . Summary The engine will not run at full power when in reverse mode , so accounting for this and the bypass ratio will leave you with about states that modern thrust reversers can convert up to <URL> of their forward thrust into reverse thrust .
Steer : No . Stop : Yes . Thrust reversers are either in or out . They can not be engaged proportionally to some control setting in the cockpit . Once they are unlocked , the airflow through them sucks them out completely . The only way to vary their braking effect would be to throttle the engine up or down , and airliner engines react rather sluggishly to control inputs . Their responsiveness will not suffice to steer the aircraft ; only rudder inputs ( and those only at higher speed ) , nose wheel steering and differential braking with the wheel brakes are suitable for directional control on the ground . Their braking effect is biggest at high speed and tapers off as the aircraft decelerates . For the first third of the landing run they will help noticeably in slowing the aircraft , but you will need a long runway when you want to land without wheel brakes . Details depend on landing weight , airfield elevation and wind speed .
They must leave a greater amount of time in between landings/take-offs as the size of the aircraft increases due to <URL> There were historically 3 classes of aircraft for the purpose of wake turbulance classification H ( Heavy ) aircraft types of 136 000 kg ( 300 000 lb ) or more ; M ( Medium ) aircraft types less than 136 000 kg ( 300 000 lb ) and more than 7 000 kg ( 15 500 lb ) ; and L ( Light ) aircraft types of 7 000 kg ( 15 500 lb ) or less . With the introduction of the A380-800 , where it is near MTOW , a fourth category has been added Super Heavy for Airbus A380-800 with a maximum take-off mass in the order of 560 000 kg How much time must be left ? Well that depends , for an A380 : Arriving Aircraft MEDIUM aircraft behind an A380-800 aircraft -- 3 minutes ; LIGHT aircraft behind an A380-800 aircraft -- 4 minutes . Departing Aircraft 3 minutes should be applied for a LIGHT or MEDIUM aircraft and 2 minutes for a non-A380-800 HEAVY aircraft taking off behind an A380-800 aircraft when the aircraft are using : the same runway ; parallel runways separated by less than 760 m ( 2 500 ft ) ; crossing runways if the projected flight path of the second aircraft will cross the projected flight path of the first aircraft at the same altitude or less than 300 m ( 1000 ft ) below ; parallel runways separated by 760 m ( 2 500 ft ) or more , if the projected flight path of the second aircraft will cross the projected flight path of the first aircraft at the same altitude or less than 300 m ( 1 000 ft ) below .

There are a few ways the aircraft engines can be mounted on the centerline , each with its advantages and disadvantages . <URL> Photo courtesy <URL> . One way is to mount them as in DC10 , with engine above the fuselage ; another one is to use a 'S ' shaped inlet and put the engine at the aft of the fuselage like <URL> . The main advantage of mounting the engine as in DC10 is that the inlet distortion is minimized and there is no need to cut a hole through the fuselage for putting engine . The main disadvantages are that it increases drag ( slightly ) and engine maintenance is a mess . Apparently , the DC10 engineers <URL> to put all three engines in the wing during design , but were not successful . Engines mounted in high thrust line like DC10 and <URL> are highly stabilizing as increase in engine thrust causes a pitch down motion as the thrust is increased . This is usually disconcerting to the pilots , who expect the aircraft to pitch up while engine power is increased . Finally they ended up adding <URL> to correct this in PA47 ( to make it pitch neutral ) . In DC10 , a combination of underwing and high thrust line engines would 've most probably caused no pitch changes at all . So I guess the main advantage is reducing inlet distortion . As MD11 was developed from DC10 , it simply inherited this design . Note : As for the pitch down moment being disconcerting to the pilots , it is better if someone corroborates it . It is simply that most aircraft do n't do this .

It 's a French company and one of the three major suppliers of reverse systems . In the 80 's Hispano-Suiza had to be innovative to capture a bigger market share . Their door type was the first ever on a high bypass engine . They believed investing in R&amp;D will help increase their sales ( it did ) . The petal reversers also double as airbrakes . <URL> Why not on the Boeing 737 ? Since the CFM56 on the 737 is close to the ground , the doors would scrape the pavement . And -- more importantly for other aircraft types -- Hispano-Suiza 's competitors are <URL> and Boeing . Boeing definitely would like to keep things in-house with their translating/cascading reversers . Nowadays with the jet engines of the smallest regional jets to the wide-bodies being as wide as the fuselages , the cascading type is the better choice . Sources : Flight , <URL> Flight , <URL>
I think the answer is no . If you think about V1 as primarily based on runway length , it is certainly possible for an aircraft to easily reach Vr long before reaching the " point of no return " as far as stopping distance is concerned . However , you must also consider the meaning of Vr . This is when the aircraft is going to rotate . After rotation and leaving the ground , the distance required to still stop on that same runway increases significantly . For this reason , maximum V1 is generally considered to be Vr ( see <URL> ) . In large aircraft , rejecting a takeoff after leaving the ground is generally discouraged , unless the pilot feels that the plane could be uncontrollable . It 's must safer to continue the takeoff and fly for a normal approach . However , <URL> . In smaller aircraft , it 's more reasonable for the aircraft to take off and then land safely ( I 'm thinking a C172 on one of the low density altitude runways you linked to ) .
With a pressure fueling system , rather than fueling through holes in the tops of the wings , a fuel truck or fuel hydrant is used to push fuel into the airplane through a fitting at about 50 psi . The fuel fitting is generally in the right wing . A fueling control panel allows the fueler to fill the tanks to the amount called out by the flight plan . These large aircraft still have an overwing fueling port for those times when the pressure fueling system is inoperative . There is nothing to prevent fuel vapors from escaping to atmosphere .
Greg covered this very well <URL> . The " miss by a surprising distance " bit is especially important here in the context of FAR 91.15 -- you would have to have a VERY large-scale paintball match for this to be viable , and some specific rules of engagement for the aircraft ( always firing " into " the arena area as you do n't want to miss and send a paintball into someone 's car or kitchen window as that would get some distinctly unfriendly attention from the FAA , and probably the local constabulary ) . Operationally , if we 're doing this with an airplane high-wing aircraft would obviously be the order of the day ( Cessna 152 ) , with a pilot ( whose sole job is to fly the airplane ) and a gunner/bombardier ( who is responsible for hitting targets on the ground ) . You really do n't want the pilot distracted by the game . Your weapons guy is going to have to be able to account for the aircraft 's speed and altitude in targeting ( which is pretty hard with an adjusted scope/bomb sight - doing it without one is going to be tough ) . As for shooting back at the plane , if we 're talking about a " regular " airplane ( something manned , like a Cessna 152 ) I would advise against allowing players to target the plane . At safe operating altitudes they 're unlikely to hit the plane , but if they do aircraft skin is very thin &amp; dent repair is very expensive : If someone is lucky enough to score a hit it could be a costly " death " . Now , as a paintball player myself I will tell you that I find the idea of death from above when I ca n't shoot back at the aircraft to be rather unsporting ! What I would suggest instead is to deploy <URL> . These can be had pretty cheaply and with some basic electronics skills they can be modified to carry/drop paint grenades ( think Squadbusters ) on your enemy . If you want to get really fancy add a GoPro or some other remote camera to help with targeting , or add a paintball gun to the thing <URL> . The FAA 's rules for " unmanned aerial systems " are still being written , but if you keep to the general rules for model aircraft ( below 400 feet , and not charging anyone money for the drone 's services ) I think you 'll be OK ( when the final rules come out you 'll have to review your drone for compliance ) . As a bonus if the drone is n't too large and you have an indoor arena with liberally-minded management you may even be able to use your drone during indoor games . ( Kill rules for the drone and its operator are left as an exercise for the players . )
<URL> are only a small part of smart materials . Once deformed , they will change back to their old shape when heated or subjected to strong magnetic fields . Of the many alloys with this characteristic , only a few like <URL> would be suitable for primary structures . They are extremely expensive to make and to process , so they have never been an economical alternative . Also , heating and cooling would be required to switch between shapes , which is very energy intensive when the outer structure of an aircraft is involved . Airflow will ensure intense convective heat transfer , and to maintain the needed temperature will be very uneconomical . Please consider that an aircraft with shape-memory alloys would need to carry extra fuel for heating or cooling over much of the flight time . Hinges and electric or hydraulic actuators will have a clear mass advantage when you consider the system mass , including energy sources . I guess you agree that creating strong magentical fields in parts of an aircraft is an exceedingly bad idea , so I will rule out <URL> . Shape-memory alloys will only switch between two shapes , and intermediate shapes are easier to realize with hinges and actuators . Sure , a smooth shape is aerodynamically better than one with a contour break at the hinge line , but the small aerodynamic advantage of shape-memory structures is quickly lost when you look at the whole picture . Another disadvantage is the accumulation of small cracks with every shape change . The low number of cycles will either require frequent replacement of the shape-memory parts or a very limited structural life of the aircraft . In the end , much of what can be said about <URL> also applies to shape-memory alloys . Their main function is to justify research grants and to keep the press occupied .
METAR is a Meteorological Aerodrome Report which is for a specific place , at a specific time . The first line is a report from Sao Paulo at 22:00 on the 17th . You can use a service such as <URL> to decode METAR reports . The rest of the lines are more reports for different time and days . The groups are :
The thrust variation with altitude would be highly engine specific , but the general trend is nicely depicted in the image below : <URL> this for further details .
What is turbulence ? Turbulence is random and stochastic Each realization of a turbulent flow is unique and fluctuations in velocity are very irregular in space and time . dissipative Turbulence can not maintain itself and will decay into laminar flow without energy input from the environment ( e.g. mean shear in the velocity field or buoyancy ) . Reducing viscosity in a flow does not remove dissipation , it just moves dissipation to ever decreasing scales . diffusive A time-averaged scalar transported in a turbulent flow will have larger plume than that of a laminar flow . For example , if you injected a dye into a smooth flowing river and one into a turbulent flowing river , the dye plume would cover a larger area in the turbulent flow . three dimensional 3D vortex dynamics play a very important role in turbulence and for most cases you can not represent a turbulent flow as a 2D problem . occuring on a wide range of scales This is perhaps the most important distinction . When I say scale , I am referring to a characteristic length and velocity of an eddy , or swirl . Turbulence is produced at larger scales and the transfers its energy to smaller and smaller scales . At some ( very small ) scale , dissipation starts happening and the turbulence decays . A feature of a turbulent flow is energy at all scales , which basically means there are whirls of all sizes and it is the interaction between all of these swirls that gives turbulence . How does it happen ? The main production of turbulence is through mechanical production and buoyant production . Turbulence happens because energy is being put into it via these production methods . Turbulence will decay on its own but will not stop until production ceases . Mechanical production can be envisioned as a shear flow , or air of two different speeds interfacing . This can also be wind against a wall , or around some object . The velocity gradient at the periphery of the jetstream is a shear flow , and the boundary layer that we live in is a sheared environment on most days . Buoyant production is through buoyancy . Relatively warm parcels rise and this is balanced by subsidence and if you follow these thermals and the descent between them and squint hard enough , you can envision eddies on the largest scales . Both of these methods put energy into turbulence at large scales . For boundary layer flows , this can be on the order of a kilometer or more , typically the height of the boundary layer . These big eddies will have perturbations of their own and these smaller perturbations are the next smaller scale . Energy is cascaded downward until the sizes of the eddies are small enough that viscosity dominates over inertial forces and the energy is then lost from the turbulence as heating . The superpositioning of these eddies at all scales resembles a jumbled bumpy mess , and this is precisely how we experience turbulence .
It 's entirely possible . Attitude control works the same way during autorotation as it does during normal powered flight . It 's a good thing , too ... during an autorotation you want to target your descent toward a suitable landing spot :-) To ( say ) roll right , moving the cyclic causes the swashplate to move in such a way that the rotor blade 's pitch ( angle of attack ) is greater during the left-side portion of the blade 's travel , and lower during the right-side portion . This produces more lift on the left side , which causes a right-rolling moment on the helicopter . The fact that the collective is all the way down and that the rotor 's RPM is being maintained by airflow through the rotor does not change the way the cyclic produces attitude changes . The anti-torque pedals still work too , although during an autorotation the pilot will promptly apply full right pedal , since lowering the collective will essentially eliminate torque from the rotor . Pedals can still be used for yaw though , as the tail rotor is still spinning ( it is linked to the main rotor ) . The " 180 ° turning autorotation " is a common maneuver taught in basic training , where the pilot must set up the autorotative descent and then complete a 180 ° turn toward a landing spot . For more information about autorotations in general , I recommend the FAA 's ( free online ) <URL> . See page 2-24 for a general description , and page 11-2 for procedures/technique . There are also lots of autorotation demonstration videos on <URL> that show maneuvering to a landing spot / 180 ° turns during the auto .
It 's the same thing , it changes only the point of view , see <URL> : for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction , i.e. to create thrust , the engine has to push air backwards . Pushing the air backwards means that the air is pushing you forward and this , in the reference system of the propeller blade , is lift .
end question
start question
Is it a mistake or standard procedure to lit the landing lights only on very short final ?
It is not an ICAO requirement to operate landing lights whenever you are below 10,000 FT. The mandatory aircraft lights you will see in regulations is strobe lights , nav lights and anti collision beacon lights . It is standard operating procedure at several airlines to only turn on the landing lights when a landing clearance is received by air traffic control . This is most likely what you have observed . The landing clearance is usually given at very short final , and so crews will turn on the landing lights on very short final ( unless you are in FAA territory , where multiple aircraft can be cleared to land on the same runway at the same time ... )
We all know the saying " From High to Low , Look out below " Some were taught that this only applied to pressure differences and thus were instructed to get a new altimeter setting every 100NM or so . This is a good recommendation . Temperature differences from standard also causes errors with the altimeter . The same saying above holds true with temperature variations . An altimeter setting is defined as : ( ref . Pilot/Controller Glossary ) The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for variations in existing atmospheric pressure or to the standard altimeter setting ( 29.92 ) . We also know there is a direct correlation between pressure and temperature and thus an altimeter setting is corrected for both pressure and temperature . This means one thing , the altimeter error is zero at the field elevation . As the aircraft gets climbs higher above the field , the altimeter error will increase . There is a table in the Aeronautical Information Manual ( 7-2-8 ) that lists altimeter error due to temperature as a function of altitude ( AGL ) and temperature . Here is the formula that will give you this table . The formula can be found in <URL> . The United States Air Force has a <URL> that discusses this topic . The FAA has recently come out with <URL> which requires pilots ( after 9/17/2015 ) who fly into " Cold Temperature Restricted Airports " to correct their altitudes for colder than standard temperatures . To determine if your airport is part of this program you must go to the <URL> and search for Cold Temperature Restricted Airports . There should be a link at the bottom of the page . Here is a graphic showing all the airports in the United States that were part of the program in February 2015 . Because Lnafziger wanted Alaska . Not only is the pilot required to correct for the segment but they are also required to inform ATC of the new altitudes they will fly . This is to ensure traffic separation with other airplanes who are not temperature correcting their altimeters . Pictures taken with permission from <URL> . All rights reserved .
Imagine you have a 60 knot headwind . You have to fly an indicated airspeed of 60 knots and you can hover over the ground . If you want you can try it out in flight sim , it makes lots of fun . That 's called a STOL .
There are a number of things to take into account : The distance between the runways ; can they be operated as independent runways ? This requires the centrelines to be more than 1035 meter apart . The traffic mix : is there constantly the same distance between landings or a large gap every now and then between a Heavy and a Medium that allows for one or two departures in between ? The runway entry and exit points . Can aircraft wait sufficiently short of the approach end to allow for a rapid departure when cleared for take-off ? Does the runway have high-speed exit taxi-ways at appropriate places for the landing traffic to vacate the runway quickly or is a slow 90 degree turn required ? In general , mixed mode operations can increase capacity significantly . For example the estimate for London Heathrow is that the traffic could increase from <URL> . But it is not a simple change . The requirements on ATC increase . For example , to monitor the parallel approaches , the update rate and accuracy of the surveillance system must meet higher standards than for single runway approaches . Also missed approach and emergency procedures need to be changed . And then there is an important noise issue ; in mixed mode operations , all four runway ends are continuously exposed to aircraft noise , while in dedicated operations the departure end of one runway and the arrival end of the other is not exposed . " Back of the envelope " estimation : For simplicity let 's assume traffic that is only Medium wake category with 3NM final approach separation at about 150 knots groundspeed . This would result in ~ 75 seconds intervals between aircraft passing the threshold for a pure landing runway , allowing for 48 landing per hour . In mixed mode , a line up and hold instruction would be given as soon as the landing aircraft is passed the numbers , so take-off will commence quickly after take-off clearance is given . The take-off clearance itself can be given as soon as the landing aircraft has vacated the runway , which should be about 60 seconds after it crossed the threshold . The take-off run itself is 30-40 seconds for B737 / A320 family aircraft . Let 's add about 20 seconds reaction and engine spool up time + margin . The next landing aircraft can cross the threshold after lift-off . The interval would be ~ 120 seconds between landing aircraft , resulting in 30 landings per hour . But this can be done on two runways at the same time , effectively increasing the throughput by about 25 % percent . The above schedule is very idealised with pure alternating take-off and landings and little margin for error . If put in practice it will probably result in too many go arounds due to late take-offs , but it gives good idea of the capacity increase that is possible .
I guess the keyword here is delineate . <URL> says : to mark the outline of , Example : lights delineating the narrow streets So I would take that to mean the runway edge lights , NOT the approach lighting systems .
I think the answer depends on what the birds are doing , but all options are basically " at the pilot 's risk " - the tower is just advising you there are some birds hanging around the airport , but nobody can say how they 're going to react to you trying to land there too . If the flock is airborne and flying across the final ( completely neglecting to coordinate their movements with tower , as birds are wont to do ) you can request an extended downwind until they 've moved on . This has happened to me twice , and in my experience birds tend to be far less interested in airports than pilots . They 're usually gone in a minute or two . If they 're sitting on the runway somewhere you can try a low pass over the field to scare them off , but my preference would be to ask the tower/unicom operator if they can chase them away for me with a ground vehicle ( so I 'm not near the flock in case they decide to disperse " upward " instead of " outward " ) . If they 're just pecking around in the grass near the approach end of the runway looking for lunch <URL> &amp; <URL> have the right idea with a go-around or low approach/overflight to scare them off . ( This is part of why a low pass over an unattended uncontrolled field is often advisable -- you 'll hopefully scare off any critters on the runway that you would n't want there when you actually land . ) If they 're " airport birds " you might want to just land . Some of the airports by me have resident flocks of birds that I 'm convinced just sit there and rate people 's landings - I swear I saw the same birds every day shooting touch-and-gos . These are the kind of birds that are n't going to scatter when you do a low pass unless you hit them with your landing gear , so just be aware of where they are ( in case they lose their minds and try to commit suicide by propeller ) but they probably wo n't bother you . I do n't think I 'd ask for a downwind landing because of birds ( unless we 're talking geese or hawks or something ) , but if it 's a calm-wind day , the pattern is empty , and you 're more comfortable with that idea go ahead and ask . The worst the tower can do is say " unable " .
Downward aileron travel must be restricted when flaps are deflected . Since flaps change the local incidence on the flapped part of the wing , the outer wing will experience an increase in its local angle of attack . The increased suction over the inner wing will accelerate not only the air flowing over the inner wing , but also that air which will flow over the outer wing as well . Left to itself , the outer wing would stall if powerful Fowler flaps are deployed on the inner wing . <URL> , and now the outer wing is back in business . However , if the aileron is deflected downwards , the stall angle of attack is reduced again . The outer wing could stall simply due to the aileron deflection ! I do not need to point out that an asymmetric stall on approach is extremely undesirable . Now roll control could still be achieved by only moving one aileron upwards . But this would decrease the induced drag at the wingtip at low speed . Remember , at low speed the induced drag is dominant ( it is proportional to the inverse of the flight speed squared ) , so the drag change due to an aileron deflection will cause an inverse yawing moment at a time when the pilot wants to keep the aircraft lined up with the runway . Using the spoilers instead will incur a higher lift loss for the same rolling moment , but will also increase local drag , which creates a helpful yawing moment into the opposite direction of the one created by upward aileron deflection . THAT 's why spoilers are preferred for roll control on approach . I am surprised , however , that you observed no aileron motion at all . Normally , the ailerons are still used , but with a much restricted travel range , as @DeltaLima mentions in his answer .
The safest approach to a normal landing is a <URL> , so it 's going to depend a lot on you , your aircraft , and the day 's conditions . If you 're operating in a confined area , then that changes things a lot , and I 'm not going to address that . It also depends on your definition of a normal pattern and approach . The FAA <URL> , which should keep you fairly close to the airport anyway , and <URL> . That said , a normal approach is going to be much safer . As you point out in your question , a short approach often requires extreme descent rates or slips ( or both ) , and results in a much shorter final ; neither of those situations improve safety . Approaching with a high descent rate just so that you can reduce it if necessary does n't strike me as a particularly good choice for normal operations , either .
In theory you might be able to make an estimate , but practically speaking it 's impossible and a lot easier to just look at a sectional chart . The FAA has a <URL> on obstacle lighting standards , which usually applies to structures over 200ft in height but there 's a lot of possible variation : Recommendations on marking and/or lighting structures can vary depending on terrain features , weather patterns , geographic location , and in the case of wind turbines , number of structures and overall layout of design . The actual number of lights and their placement depends on the type and size of the structure . Appendix 1 of the FAA guide has examples for water towers , radio masts , cooling stacks , bridges , chimneys etc. . The vertical light spacing seems to vary from 250-375ft , depending on the structure type , but I did n't go through it systematically . So if you have plenty of time you might be able to determine the approximate height of a structure by comparing its lighting layout to the guide and estimating based on that , but that 's very unlikely to give you an accurate number . For a pilot in flight or planning a flight , that is n't safe or practical and the simple solution is to just <URL> to get the height . For example , this tower is 1094ft high and the top is at 1994ft above sea level ( so the ground level is 900ft above sea level at that location ) :
TL ; DR : Do you change altitude after the heading change , before , or during ? When flying under Air Traffic Control , you are expected to execute instructions after you receive them , following the motto . When receiving a turn and climb instruction at the same time , you are expected to start both , e.g. What 's the proper procedure for changing altitude when you change headings ? You do not change altitude or flight level on your own when flying IFR . When flying VFR , you should adhere to the semi-circular rules when changing your direction and end up in one of the semi-circular areas . On turn techniques that allow direction change and altitude change at the same time , see <URL> . Is this made more complicated if you are flying Visual Flight Rules instead of Instrument Flight Rules ? Yes and No , because remember : You do not change altitude or flight level without being cleared or instructed to do so when flying IFR . Whether having to choose the correct altitude or flight level when flying VFR is more difficult than having ATC select one for you , is debatable . Additional Information : The rule you are talking about is the <URL> , which depending on the country , can either be applied West to East or North to South . Let 's assume the example you have already used and differentiate between westbound and eastbound flights . ( Image Source : <URL> ) The above picture shows that aircraft on a eastbound general track between and are bound to odd flight levels , such as FL210 , FL230 , FL250 , etc. . Opposite traffic on a general track between and is bound to even flightlevels , such as FL220 , FL240 , FL260 , etc. . This flight level you are bound to use is also the flight level you request in your flightplan , called the Requested Flight Level or RFL . Imagine you have a flight going westbound and you have requested FL280 as your cruise level . You would maintain this flight level until you are cleared to descend by ATC . Even if a portion of the descent or arrival route leads in the opposite direction of your orignal track , it will be ATC who is responsible to assign the correct desend flight level , but these do not have to be necessarily following the semi-ciruclar flight level rules . There is one scenarion where a pilot may want to initiate a flight level change due to changing jurisdiction and use of the semi-circular flight level rules , which is when crossing borders between countries that use west-east and north-south rules . If are on a westbound flight ( approx track : that requires even flightlevels , such as FL280 and cross the FIR border into a country with north-south rules that require an odd flight level , you would have a step climb or descent in your flightplan to accomodate this , e.g. : It would still be ATC who clears you to climb to FL290 at that fix , but this way your flightplan is in accordance to local semi-circular flight level rules . Remember that when flying IFR , you never change the altitude or flightlevel unless you have been instructed or cleared to do so . The same semi-circular flight level rules apply to VFR , just with the added 500ft to stay clear of the IFR flight levels . In most cases however , VFR does not entirely follow these rules , as the are VFR and their separation is based on visual identification and the see-and-avoid principle . I am not familiar with airspace class B procedures , but in class C airspace , you require permissions to enter the airspace and will thus be assigned restrictions , which can be either a single altitude or flight level , an upper or lower restriction or a level or altitude band . If you are assigned either of the two latter options , you could apply the semi-circular flight level rules . See below on an overview how other countries handle these semi-circular rules .

<URL> contains recommended crew member procedures and training for combating in-flight fires . It has information about causes , indications and procedures of in-flight fire fighting . According to the AC , Upon discovering a fire , the initial focus should be on aggressively extinguishing the fire with a readily available extinguisher ( which will likely be halon ) , but do not use water if it is believed the fire is of aircraft electrical system origin . Generally , you should consider using the first available extinguisher rather than delaying your firefighting efforts while you locate a particular extinguishing agent for a class A , B , or C fire . Airbus <URL> also says pretty much the same thing : Any fire , no matter how small , may rapidly become out of control , if not dealt with quickly.The first priority will always be to put it out . Coming to the Galaxy Note 7 issue , the AC says , h . What are the Recommended Procedures for Fighting a Lithium Battery Fire ? The following procedures are recommended for fighting a fire in a lithium-type-battery-powered PED . The procedures consist of two phases : extinguishing the fire , and cooling the remaining cells to stop thermal runaway . ( 1 ) Utilize a halon , halon replacement , or water extinguisher to extinguish the fire and prevent its spread to additional flammable materials . ( 2 ) After extinguishing the fire , douse the device with water , an aqueous-based extinguishing agent , or other nonalcoholic liquids to cool the device and prevent additional battery cells from reaching thermal runaway . Though the standard procedures in case of a fire has to be decided by the company , the FAA recommends some procedures to be followed , like : • Be aggressive ; if flames are visible , fight the fire immediately . • Someone must immediately notify the flight crew to describe the fire , smoke , smells , action being taken , etc. . • If flames are not visible , find the base or source of the smoke . • Pull circuit breakers , in applicable area . • Do not reset circuit breakers , unless instructed by flight crew . • Relocate passengers as necessary . • Locate hot spots using the back of your hand . • Don PBE ( not necessarily in this order ) . The flight crew ( who are supposed to don their oxygen masks on indication of smoke/fire ) are supposed to inform the ATC and plan for an emergency landing , if necessary .
The uses of the HP air of the pneumatic system are in the FCOM : air conditioning engine starting wing anti-icing ( <URL> ) water pressurization hydraulic reservoir pressurization The HP air sources are engine bleed , APU , and HP ground connection . The Bleed Monitoring Computers ( BMC ) do not recognize if the ground cart is connected or not . The BMC of the engines can detect overpressure and overheat and act accordingly ( check FCOM for logic schematic ) . However , the APU logic does not check for overpressure and overheat ( see below ) . Having APU and ground as dual HP sources can lead to overheat and/or overpressure of the pneumatic system .

I think one thing that does not get emphasized enough : Pilots do not land airplanes!In fact , we try to keep the airplane flying as long as possible ! We systematically rob the airplane of energy ( energy from engine power , energy from airspeed , energy from altitude ) until the plane can no longer fly , and settles gently on the runway . But even as the plane is landing , the pilot is still trying to coax it back into the air to remove as much energy as possible . A big student mistake is to point the airplane at the runway , and try to force it to land there . That leads to landings too fast , too high , big bounces , porpoising , and sometimes nose-in crashes . So do n't think about " how am I going to land this thing ? " Instead think about " How am I going to remove more energy from the equation to lose altitude and airspeed ? " A landing is a series of precise targets you are aiming to hit , each with less energy than the last one ( but each one still with enough energy to keep flying and be safe ) Each target consists of Position ( horizontal and altitude ) , airspeed , and descent rate . You hit each of these targets at 3 different points on a square ( abeam the numbers , downwind-to-base , and base-to-final ) Hitting a target that consists of a position + airspeed + descent rate is not easy ! But the more precisely you can hit each target , the easier the next part is . Although I hope I 'm repeating the same instructions you 've already heard , for the sake of the Site , let me re-iterate the standard instructions for a C-172 . Be level at TPA ( airport + 1000 feet ) , and at a cruise speed of approximately 100 kts . The runway should be approx 3/4 of the way up your strut . When you are abeam the numbers , Carb Heat ( if applicable ) , throttle back to approx 1,600 RPM , and pull-back as necessary to maintain altitude ( the consequence will be that you slow down ) . Watch your speed , altitude and position . Drop flaps 10 & deg ; when speed allows , and aim to hit a speed of 85 kts , an altitude loss of 250 feet , and have the numbers at 45 & deg ; behind you , all at the same time . Turn the corner to base , using approximately 30 & deg ; of bank angle . Continue to reduce speed ( by pulling back ) to hit 75 kts , and drop altitude another 250 ft. ( you 're now 500 ft above the runway ) . Add Flaps 20 when appropriate . Turn the corner to final . You can " oval " your turn if you are undershooting the centerline , but do NOT over-bank if you have overshot the centerline . Aim for the centerline , acquire a PAPI/VASI , keep an eye on your airspeed relative to approach speed ( 68 kts ) . Watch 3 and ONLY 3 things : Airspeed ( Slowing towards 68 kts ) Centerline ( left ? right ? on target ? ) Slope ( PAPI/VASI ? Light configuration ) . Keep repeating " Airspeed , Centerline , Slope " out loud , describe if you 're too far/too close on each one , and describe how you 're going to correct . For example : " Airspeed : 75 kts ; too fast ; pulling back to slow down " " Centerline : Left of center ; coming slightly right " " Slope : 3 red +1 white is too low ; adding power to slow descent " ( repeat ! ) When the runway is made , drop final flaps , engine to idle , and prepare to flare when you 're about 10-15 feet , and hopefully right at the numbers . Remember that your altitudes are 1000 , 750 , 500 , touchdown . And your airspeeds are 85 , 75 , 65 .
FLC mode maintains airspeed during a climb or descent , while VS mode maintains a specific vertical speed . Often air traffic controllers will request that you " maintain 250 knots in the descent " or something to that effect , which is much easier to achieve when using Flight Level Change . As another answer points out , by maintaining airspeed , climbs are made safer as the autopilot will not attempt to maintain a rate of climb regardless of whether or not the airspeed is safe . FLC mode is typically only available in advanced autopilots , and as far as I know they need to connect to an Air Data Computer to get the necessary information . How to use FLC would depend on the equipment available to you : aircraft with auto throttle will maintain speed and an appropriate rate of descent automatically . for aircraft without auto throttle you 'd set your target altitude , enable FLC , adjust your target speed if needed , and set your throttle for climb or descent to maintain the desired altitude change rate . I 'm referencing the Garmin GFC700 as it 's the only autopilot I 've used with FLC mode , but I imagine the same steps and rules would apply .
I 've heard about lots of bird strike incidents that occured during a takeoff roll or the early phase of takeoff climb but hardly heard of bird strikes on approach or landing . This is always a dangerous thing . Only because you hear more bird strikes that occur on takeoff , it does not mean there are more at takeoff . I found , for example , <URL> about bird strikes from the year 2000 . It says : [ ... ] 38 % of the bird strikes occurred during take-off and climb , and 56 % during approach [ ... ] That means there are more bird strikes during approach than on takeoff . I assume things have n't changed a lot since then . This question is even answered in the <URL> : Q : Do most bird strikes occur while in flight , at takeoff , or landing ? A : About 60 % of bird strikes with civil aircraft occur during landing phases of flight ( descent , approach and landing roll ) ; 37 % occur during take-off run and climb ; and the remainder occur during the en-route phase . A more specific statistic : <URL> <URL> Possible reason for subjective perception of bird-strikes happening more often during departure I thought a little about it and came to following possible reason : After a bird-strike on final , the pilots will continue landing . It would be unwise not to land immediately . For the passengers it will look like a normal landing . If the bird damages the engine , there is only a small change of sound , because the engines are running very low . However , when a bird-strike occurs while taking off , there is immediate action taken by the pilots . And because the engines are at or near full thrust , the sound of a dying engine can be perceived by the passengers . Last but not least , a departing aircraft has a much higher speed than a landing one , which means more damage . So , for newspapers , a bird-strike at take-off is more <URL> . More damage to the plane than a bird-strike on final Passengers not reaching their destination Dramatic passenger interviews about their " near-death-experience " A newspaper is not interested in a bird-strike on final , where everything went fine and no passenger noticed anything . To support my theorem , I googled " bird strike " and clicked on the " News " - tab . I looked through every article that had to do something with an bird-strike incident . 5 out of 6 articles were about a bird-strike on take-off . That 's over 80 % .
Then It used to matter , because aircraft would sometimes approach the carrier at a lower altitude than even the flight deck before pulling up briefly and practically stalling onto the deck , allowing for a lower speed landing . Similarly , the higher flight deck would give an extra couple of metres of acceleration if over-shooting the flight deck and having to go around . As such a high-decked carrier gave a little more margin for error . Now It makes virtually no difference - modern aircraft approach at the same angle and airspeed regardless of the height of the deck ( within reason ) . They also perform approaches significantly more accurately . If anything , the higher deck could be considered a ( very ) slight disadvantage , as it may display a higher rolling moment than a low deck carrier . This is unlikely to cause any issues , however .
To put it short : no . Unfortunately it might even take a while for anyone to notice both pilots are out . Most likely the first would be an air traffic controller since he/she could n't reach the pilots on radio . If the cabin attendants find both pilots incapacitated , they would most likely try to find a doctor or nurse to help recover a pilot try to find if any of the passengers was a pilot
The rule I was always taught is to cross any ' step ' - up or down - at an angle with the elevator full back : It minimizes the chance of a prop strike , which is much more expensive than a wingtip strike When going ' up ' , you avoid having both wheels up against the step at the same time , which usually means you need a burst of power to get over it , which could lead to sudden acceleration and sharp braking When going ' down ' you avoid the aircraft dropping down suddenly , with the same risks of strikes or an increase in speed Lifting the elevator reduces the chance of it striking There may be some differences for specific aircraft types , but I 've always followed that advice and never had a problem . I 've also never seen an aircraft get close to a wingtip strike doing this , but I suppose it could happen if the step is large enough . Although in that case you might want to just find another taxi route .
Some useful texts are <URL> by Cockrell , <URL> by Lingard , and the Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual by Knacke . The Lingard and Cockrell papers both have extensive references that are worth pursuing . The Knacke manual is , as far as I know , only available in hardcopy . It seems that the designers of modern sport ram-air parachutes and paragliders are more concerned with protecting trade secrets than they are in publishing research . The paragliding side of the aisle is a bit more willing to share . There is an online <URL> , and there are several open source paraglider CAD software packages available .
Almost always into the wind . The ground roll will be substantially decreased because you 've already got a certain amount of airflow over the wings . Taking off with a tailwind is pretty much never advisable unless it 's a one-way strip or runway , or the winds are below the tailwind limitations for that aircraft type .

Can an armed door be opened from outside an airliner ?
This depends on the aircraft : DC9 , MD80 , B727 , B737 On some ( especially older model ) aircraft doors such as the Boeing 737 for instance this is directly dangerous , since the slide is attached on the inside by hand with the means of a girt bar to the aircraft . There is hence no way to open the door without the slide going off should it be armed . There is a helpful notice in red on the outside to " stand clear " when the red banner is crosses the window , the indication that it is armed . Judging by the space required and force the doors have , this is still most probably very dangerous idea that should not be used unless absolutely necessary . <URL> Airbus , B757 , B767 , B777 , MD11 , E-Jets On more modern aircraft , this is safe : opening the door externally will push the arm handle to the disarmed position before proceeding to open it . This is for instance the case on all Airbus aircraft . <URL> provides a nice example .
Chances are you would not survive but lets explore this a bit more in depth for the sake of education . This <URL> explores the very issue . There is some research that has gone into the topic of hitting the ground but the research is rarely about cases from the height you are asking about ( ~ 30,000 ft ) . Some relevant info First off at that altitude you really ca n't breathe that effectively so hypoxia will be your first concern followed closely by extreme cold . Hitting water : Studies of bridge-jump survivors indicate that a feet-first , knife-like entry ( aka " the pencil " ) best optimizes your odds of resurfacing . Hitting the ground : The question of how to achieve ground contact remains , regrettably , given your predicament , a subject of debate . A 1942 study in the journal War Medicine noted " distribution and compensation of pressure play large parts in the defeat of injury . " Recommendation : wide-body impact . But a 1963 report by the Federal Aviation Agency argued that shifting into the classic sky diver 's landing stance -- feet together , heels up , flexed knees and hips -- best increases survivability . Your best bet for surviving the airplane break up is if you are stuck in a situation similar to that of <URL> who did survive the situation you describe . Unfortunately there is some debate as to what actually happened so take the info at face value . " Speed has never killed anyone . Suddenly becoming stationary , that 's what gets you .

Under <URL> , if Germany ' validates ' your Italian license then yes , you can fly the German aircraft in other countries : Use of flight crew licences on foreign-registered aircraft Any pilot who wishes to fly on an aircraft registered in a State other than the one that has issued the licence , needs to obtain an authorization from the State of Registry . This authorization is generally given by the State of Registry through a validation or a conversion of the foreign licence . In general , the validation process is used for short-term authorization while the conversion process is used for longer-term authorization . What ' validation ' means here is up to the country where the aircraft is registered . ICAO itself does n't define what they should do : When a State validates a foreign licence , it recognizes it as valid for use on aircraft on its own registry . The Convention on International Civil Aviation and its Annex 1 do not contain specific requirements for the validation of licences beyond establishing the principle and the fact that the validity of a validation , can not be extended beyond the validity of the supporting licence . In the US specifically , these ICAO rules are implemented in <URL> ( emphasis mine ) : ( b ) Required pilot certificate for operating a foreign-registered aircraft within the United States . No person may serve as a required pilot flight crewmember of a civil aircraft of foreign registry within the United States , unless -- ( 1 ) That person 's pilot certificate or document issued under § 61.29 ( e ) is in that person 's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft when exercising the privileges of that pilot certificate ; and ( 2 ) Has been issued in accordance with this part , or has been issued or validated by the country in which the aircraft is registered . Practically speaking , I would say that if you have some official piece of paper from the <URL> confirming that you are authorized to operate German aircraft - or at least this German aircraft - then you 're good to go . The piece of paper may even be unnecessary as far as Germany is concerned , but if you plan on flying internationally then I think the more pieces of official paper that you have , the better .
In general yes , but depending on how close the aircraft was to completion they have to live with a different cabin and cockpit layout than what they are used to or would had ordered themselves .
Do n't worry about it While snow can sometimes cause a delay , airports are really good at snow removal . ( Especially airports like Denver that are used to getting a lot of snow . ) According to <URL> DIA has 500 trained snow removal people and 270 pieces of equipment to clear 12.2 million square feet of runway , taxiways , etc. . To put that in perspective , a typical highway ( 2 lanes each way , with shoulders ) is around 38 feet wide each way , or 76 feet for both directions . If I 've done the math correctly , 12.2 million square feet is about 30 miles of road . <URL> . They use about 1500 drivers and 839 plows to handle 12,000 miles of road . To plow snow the way the Denver airport does it , they would need 200,000 drivers and 108,000 plows . Here 's <URL> that shows off some of Denver 's bigger snow removal tools . Chances are , if you can get to the airport you 'll be able to fly ( but perhaps not on time )
The main reason is that it 's simpler than having everyone wear supplemental oxygen masks . There is no specific requirement for pressurizing an airplane but there are requirements for supplemental oxygen as per FAR 91.211 ( a ) General . No person may operate a civil aircraft of U.S. registry -- ( 1 ) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,500 feet ( MSL ) up to and including 14,000 feet ( MSL ) unless the required minimum flight crew is provided with and uses supplemental oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration ; ( 2 ) At cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet ( MSL ) unless the required minimum flight crew is provided with and uses supplemental oxygen during the entire flight time at those altitudes ; and ( 3 ) At cabin pressure altitude above 15,000 feet ( MSL ) unless each occupant of > the aircraft is provided with supplemental oxygen . So by pressurizing the plane to under 15,000 ft you can fly over that altitude and not need to supply the passengers with supplemental oxygen for the duration of the flight . There are unpressurized piston planes that fly well into the flight levels but are required to carry supplemental oxygen and everyone aboard needs to use it , it 's a look some people in general aviation do n't mind , <URL> ( <URL> ) On a slight side note the engine does have an effect on this choice when it comes to light singles . Pressurization systems on turbo props/light jets pull their air from the compression stage of the turbine which is already compressing air so no extra compression hardware is needed . If you have chosen a piston engine for your design you need to drive some form of pressurization system which can add weight and complexity . There are a few pressurized piston planes out there like the <URL> , <URL> ( came in both pressurized and un pressurized ) and the <URL> ( the only one currently in production ) .
The 25 hours that are not required to be " instrument instruction " may be flown under the hood with a safety pilot . This is the usual way to accumulate some of the simulated instrument time . I believe this time may also be flown &amp; logged in actual IMC with an instrument rated pilot acting as PIC ( their name on the flight plan , etc. ) and the instrument student acting as sole manipulator of the controls , but you may prefer to conduct your actual IMC practice with an instructor .
As far as I 'm aware this has never been attempted ( and I doubt the Navy would let me try - though I 'm certainly game if they are ! ) , but : A <URL> stalls at 38mph ( 33kts ) . <URL> had a maximum speed of 38.7 mph ( 33.6 kts ) . So , given a lightly loaded cub and an Enterprise-class carrier at flank speed , it is at least theoretically possible to float that aircraft off the deck ( if it were lightly loaded , and thus had a lower stall speed ) . Achieving zero relative motion would require a little more effort - specifically you 'd have to seek out a headwind , and the Cub would have to be operating at an airspeed above stall , but still pretty close to it . For example , if the Enterprise were making 30 knots and steaming into a 10 knot headwind the relative wind on deck would be 40 knots . That 's enough to lift the Cub , but as soon as it was in the air it would need to pull itself along ( via its engine ) to maintain that speed . The Cub would have zero relative motion above the deck at an airspeed somewhere around 40 knots ) . As a ( slightly ridiculous ) bonus : <URL> has a stall speed of 28 mph ( 25kts ) . It would be theoretically possible to fly such a plane like a kite from an aircraft carrier . Its <URL> ( both ~ 500ft ) are also such that it could operate from a carrier deck without need for the catapult to launch or arresting wire to stop .
This is what I could find . I looked on the Civil Aviation Authority 's website and found this article . <URL> Families , children and infants The seating of children close by their parents or guardians should be the aim of airline seat allocation procedures for family groups and large parties of children . Young children and infants who are accompanied by adults , should ideally be seated in the same seat row as the adult . Children and accompanying adults should not be separated by more than one aisle . Where this is not possible , children should be separated by no more than one seat row from accompanying adults . This is because the speed of an emergency evacuation may be affected by adults trying to reach their children . Whenever a number of infants and children are travelling together the airline should make every effort to ensure that they can be readily supervised by the responsible accompanying adults . From what I read , it does n't look like there is a law set in stone , but instead it is recommended by the CAA to be put in regular practice by airlines . If there was a law then Ryanair would have been in serious trouble for charging people extra money to sit next to their kids . <URL>
Besides the sealing the aircraft would also need a vacuum pump that is able to pull air out of the cabin which means extra weight . <URL> is through a air cycle machine that pushes air into the aircraft and outflow valves . There is no facility to pull air out of the craft . Any pressure drop you may experience on the ground is probably because the pilot increases air pressure on the ground slightly to test the seals and then releases it before takeoff .
Retrofitting is ( as the comments to your post have already stated ) rather difficult and unusual . In addition , the quality of service from such an aircraft you could expect to get would most probably not be great . Analogy : Try changing your minibus for 9 people into minivan for freight and industrial work . It is also worth mentioning that the difference in operation is substantial between bombers and commercial jets . You would be better off using something that is not that complicated , like a Cessna Caravan for instance . I think that energy , time and money would be better spent on building more dedicated aircraft . Changing the commercial ones is also not trivial and will require engineered changes . It is however fully possible to design a military derivative of a commercial jet . The <URL> is an example of this , being based off the Boeing 737 with the necessary modifications . The armament is also fairly extensive : 5 internal and 6 external stations for AGM-84H / K SLAM-ER , AGM-84 Harpoon , Mark 54 torpedo , missiles , mines , torpedoes , bombs , and a High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon system [
The standard operating procedures state that before every flight , a thorough pre-flight inspection should be performed . Depending on the aircraft , minute and tiny details are not even omitted . Things do not normally and occasionally fall off from a flying airplane , the same way as different objects do not fall from a driving car , although the pre-drive inspection of a car is no where nearly as comprehensive as the pre-flight inspection . Yet , how many times we have seen a bumper , guard , muffler or rear-view mirrors falling off ? How dangerous it would be when it happens ? This depends on the part which has fallen . Some parts are not noticeable until landing or next inspection and some can cause disasters . <URL> reports <URL> : No deaths or injuries have been reported in such incidents , but the Federal Aviation Administration is not even 100 percent certain of that . The proper term for this incident is Things Falling Off Aircraft ( TFOA ) . The pilot must then submit a <URL> within 24 hours in case the material can cause further harm . <URL> has listed some TFOA incidents : In August 2000 , a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing when some engine pieces plummeted to the ground and landed on a crowded Los Angeles beach On March 10 , 2005 , a couple taking a stroll through woodlands near Gatwick airport had a lucky escape when a door from a passing British Airways jet , crashed to earth . A part of the 70-pound door from a Boeing 777 had become dislodged just after take off and missed the couple by only 20 feet ! On August 11 , 2006 , a door fell off from a TAM Fokker 100 from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro . It dropped off 18 minutes after departure but the plane was able to return to Sao Paulo without incident . Nobody was injured . An engine exploded on a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo with pieces of the engine falling on a neighborhood in Jakarta . The falling debris hurt no one but 16 homes were damaged . The right wheel of a Blue Panorama Airlines Boeing 737 fell off after it departed from an airport in Spain and was forced to make an unscheduled landing amid emergency in Rome . A similar incident happened near Los Angeles where an American Airlines Boeing 757 lost its right nose gear but managed to land safely with 105 passengers on board . A landing gear door fell off a Delta Airlines Boeing 727 shortly after the plane took off from Boston * s Logan International Airport . The 30-pound metal door crashed into an empty street in a quiet residential neighborhood .
The air moves around the fuselage , which causes a localized increase in velocity around the aircraft . This increase in velocity causes a slight decrease in the outside air pressure , which effectively sucks air out of the fuselage , making the cabin at a slightly higher pressure altitude . The effect is localized . While the reduction in pressure , and increase in pressure altitude inside the cabin is small , many GA aircraft display a 40 foot or so difference in pressure altitude between the alternate static port ( inside the aircraft ) and the pressure altitude with the factory static port .
The wings act as a structural dampener to disturbances such as turbulence , similar to the suspension on a car . As they flex , they absorb the sudden energy changes . The aerodynamic forces also take time to accelerate the large mass of the airplane . Because of these effects , most of turbulence will be too small to see from an outside observer 's point of view . However , in addition to the wing flexing , the aircraft will also roll , pitch , and yaw in response to the turbulence . The pilots or the autopilot , as well as the natural stability tendencies of the aircraft , will help the aircraft return to its previous state . <URL> recorded from the X-Plane flight simulator program of a 737 in turbulence . The wing flex and change in flight attitude can be seen .
In general , aircraft are handed over on frequency to the next controller via a simple instruction to change the frequency : R : " Lufthansa One Two Tree , contact Langen Radar 128.550 " A : " Contact 128.550 , Lufthansa One Two Tree " The simplified order of contacted stations for a commercial flight , depending on availability and airspace structure is : Delivery ( if available ) Apron/Ground ( if available ) Tower Departure ( if available , sometimes handled by Approach ) Enroute ACC/Center ( multiple stations along the route ) Arrival/Approach Director ( if available / in use ) Tower Ground ( if available ) The point and altitude or flightlevel where the handoff is initiated is agreed upon in Letters of Agreement between the different sectors or ACC/ARTCC stations . <URL> ( Source : SentryRaven - Own Work ) The above picture shows the airspace around Köln / Bonn ( EDDK ) Airport , with the Köln Arrival East ( KAE ) sector being actively displayed in black . The STAR entry / clearance limit fixes are GULKO and KOPAG , in the east . Most traffic not arriving via NOR VOR in the west will terminate at these two fixes , which also serve as the handoff fix between the center controller ( Paderborn High , Taunus and/or Rhein Radar Upper Control ) and the arrival controller responsible for Köln East Sector . The Letter of Agreement between those sectors states that traffic arriving to Köln / Bonn via GULKO and KOPAG is to be cleared to FL100 and cleared for the respective STAR out of GULKO or KOPAG . The handoff is initiated approaching FL100 and approaching the entry fix , before the sector boundary . The handoff is therefore based on airspace structure and sector boundaries , not on a preset distance from the airport . While arrivals from the east are handed off at FL100 over GULKO and KOPAG , arrivals from the west at NOR VOR are handed off at FL140-FL170 . Landing and Take-Off clearances are issued by the Tower controller , as the approach controller is not necessarily based at the same airport but in most cases in a remote facility together with other approach and center controllers . They have no visibility of the airport and can thus not issue these clearances . The handoff to Tower usually happens when the aircraft is established on the final approach segment of the published approach ( usually after passing the Final Approach Fix ( FAF ) ) or a visual approach to the runway . The phraseology is the same as above : R : " Germanwings Two Six Alpha , contact Tower 124.975 " A : " 124.975 , Germanwings Two Six Alpha "

There were a lot of other mitigating factors in the Colgan Air 3407 crash . Was that one recoverable ? It depends . It never should have got to the point of a stall in the first place . It was more preventable than recoverable . But in answer to your question , again , it depends . Every aircraft in the air can stall and be recovered , if responded to properly . But the plane may very well bend and break if the stall develops too far . Then it may not be recoverable . And most large airliners ( or aircraft bigger than a few thousand pounds with multiple engines ) are n't designed for the stresses of spins , so they never teach to a full stall . In those types of aircraft a full stall is much more dangerous , and they can be much more difficult to recover from , especially if you break something . Besides , in aircraft like that , you should receive plenty of direct warning long before you reach the point of a stall . When I was teaching , stalls and spins were one of my favorite subjects for early pilots . Especially in light trainers like the Cessna 150/152s . Those aircraft were always incredibly good at stalls/spins and incredibly forgiving . You can put a Cessna into a hands-off full stall if you trim it right , and it will stop rotating in a spin if you simply let go of it ( and have enough altitude ) . I always taught my students spin recovery from a full spin , even at the Private Pilot level . And usually shortly after teaching them full stalls . I would stall it , make it rotate at least 3 or 4 times , and have them recover the spin . Then have them do it themselves . I never had to worry about my students not knowing how to recover from an unintentional stall/spin . By the time my students were learning to fly multis , I was teaching them more stall recognition and avoidance than recovery . Recovery is essentially the same in all aircraft . You just have to be sure to not reach that point . There 's only one thing you really need with any aircraft in a stall/spin , and that 's altitude . Unfortunately , takeoffs and landings are the most likely places for you to get behind the aircraft and let it unintentionally stall/spin . That 's why you learn how to recognize them very early in your pilot training . You ca n't spin without a stall first , and just about any airplane will give you fair warning before you stall it . The trick is recognizing the situation before it becomes serious .
At cruising altitude there is between 4 and 8 tons of pressure acting on the inside of the door . There are n't too many passengers capable of exerting that much force on the handle ( and even fewer handles that wo n't just snap off ) . Latch type doors have interlocks or over-center latches that prevent operation with a pressurized cabin . It 's theoretically possible to open the over-wing exits at approach altitudes when there is no pressure differential . Other than being windy/noisy it would not affect the flight in any way . Cabin doors usually open forward , good luck pushing them open against the airflow . If the person who pulled the window plug wants out , it 's their ( and only their ) funeral . I 've sat in the open doors of light aircraft in flight hundreds of times , legs in the breeze , no seatbelt , while the plane makes fairly steep turns toward the open door side . It 's not a problem .
Here is the text extracted from Boeing 's 777 Flight Crew Operations Manual : In cabin altitude controller cruise mode , maximum cabin altitude is 8,000 feet . When the takeoff field elevation is higher than 8,000 feet , the cabin descends to the cabin cruise altitude while the airplane is climbing . When the destination airport elevation is greater than 8,000 feet , cabin altitude controller cruise mode maintains a cabin altitude of 8,000 feet . ( ... ) At touchdown , the outflow valves open to depressurize the cabin . Therefore , when the airplane is on the ground , its cabin altitude is always equal to the ambient altitude . When it is in the air , the maximum is 8000 feet . Whether the cabin altitude will climb to 8000 feet or descend to 8000 feet depends on field elevation . The reverse happens upon landing . If landing at an airport at 10,400 feet , the cabin altitude is < = 8000 feet until touchdown , then raises to 10,400 feet . This make sense - if the outside pressure is greater , how do you open the door ? ( well with enough force you can , but I will leave it to your imagination as to what happens the moment the door is opened ) .
There are many details to recognize , for example : The handle that locks the doors . <URL> <URL> Another way is to read the safety card , on them , you can read clearly if you are on a Boeing or Airbus , and on which type as well . The first picture is a typical Boeing 's door , and the second , an Airbus ' . ( source internet pictures from different types of handles ) On Airbus A32F , when the landing gear extends , the exit lights will turn on . The cabin interior differs from company to company , however the cockpit is unique , but nowadays , passengers are not allowed to visit the cockpit during the flights . If you seat on the seats , from where you can identify the winglet , they could give you some tips , most of the Airbus A32F have shark winglet , but it is changing , however , scimitar winglets are typical from New generation Boeings 737 .

How can a non-IFR rated pilot fly SVFR ?
In order to fly an SVFR clearance , the pilot and planned flight must meet several criteria . The <URL> as well as <URL> spell out the basic requirements : You must have at least a private pilot certificate to obtain an SVFR clearance during daylight hours as well as an instrument rating to obtain an SVFR clearance at night . Student pilots are not permitted to request an SVFR clearance . You must obtain an SVFR clearance to depart from Class E , D , C and B airspace if visibility is below VFR minimums . SVFR clearance may be prohibited in some Class D , C , and B airspace due to the volume of IFR traffic . Check the airspace NOTAMs for these areas prior to departure . You must have at least 1 statute mile visibility on both the ground and in the air as well as remain clear of clouds ( airplane ) or simply remain clear of clouds and have at least 1 statute mile visibility for operations in Class B , C , and D airspace ( rotorcraft helicopter ) . All an SVFR clearance allows is for a VFR pilot to enter , depart or operate in controlled airspace using day VFR minimums for Class G airspace . If it is done correctly by a competent private pilot and only in these conditions , it can be done safely as it provides the pilot with enough visual references to safely operate in VFR . It is also advisable to do a realistic assessment of one 's own abilities to control an airplane in marginal conditions and set conservative minimums for things like congested airspace or other weather in the area . It is not advisable to do this if weather briefings anticipate IMC after departure . Likewise if you have little experience operating in congested controlled airspace or if you struggle to stay ahead of the airplane under additional stressors , SVFR may not be advisable .
Normally , an airfoil is optimized for best lift/drag ( L/D ) efficiency for a certain flight profile ( usually a compromise ) . Since most of the time for most aircraft inverted flight is not an issue , you get an airfoil that is optimized for upright flight , and this is best achieved with asymmetric geometries . However , depending on the <URL> any airfoil can ( and will ) generate " negative " lift , only much less efficiently so , than for the optimized regime , resulting in increased drag . The desired angle of attack for conventional aerodynamically controlled aircraft is maintained by the elevator . For symmetric airfoils commonly used for aerobatic planes , the performance for upright and inverted flight is quite similar . For 99 % of all other airfoils inverted flight will work up to a certain point , depending on the available power , CG , the maximum lift and rudder forces availabe before stall . As a result , for some aircraft , a stable inverted flight can not be maintained , while for others it could be ( but with varying penalty to performance , stall speed etc ) . The aerodynamical possiblity of inverted flight is of course limited by structural and other considerations .
For tours , call the facility and say you 're interested in aviation , and would like a tour , same as pilots . Depending on the facility , business hour tours are preferred , though others will let you come any time they have available staffing to escort you around . As far as I know , there are no video feed of any ATC facilities .
The answer is : no , normal flights are not allowed under the canyon rim . If you look at the sectional chart , you see this notice : Searching through the CFR ( Title 14 , Part 91 ) brings up this <URL> - Special Flight Rules in the Vicinity of the Grand Canyon National Park , AZ. . Ther is also <URL> of Part 93 . The Subpart U regulations seem to be the most current applicable regulations ( please correct me if I am wrong ) . The rule applies to everything under 18,000 feet MSL within an area around the park ( like the chart says ) . Except in an emergency or if otherwise necessary for safety of flight , or unless otherwise authorized by the Flight Standards District Office for a purpose listed in 93.309 , no person may operate an aircraft in the Special Flight Rules Area within the following flight-free zones : It then describes the four zones : Desert View , Bright Angel , Toroweap/Shinumo , Sanup Flight-free Zone . You ca n't fly through these , but between them are " corridors " in which you are allowed to fly above a certain altitude . See <URL> for locations of the Flight-Free Zones and corridors . There are also minimum sector altitudes for different areas , including the corridors , which are going to be the main thing preventing you from flying very low . The altitudes are different for commercial air tours versus transient and general aviation . Also : no person may operate an aircraft within 500 feet of any terrain or structure located between the north and south rims of the Grand Canyon . There are also noise limits depending on the aircraft type . For some info on the background of these rules , see this <URL> .
FAA considers space shuttle either a military aircraft or spacecraft and hence its rules do n't apply on space shuttle . However , requirements to be a <URL> : ... at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-command time on jet aircraft It means that you need type rating to operate a heavy jet aircraft ( not light jet ) . <URL> is 172,000 lb ( 78,000 kg ) 1 . In addition , you need the additional requirements mentioned by NASA ( link above ) , which include education and health standards to meet . Operating empty weight of <URL> is 610,000 lbs .
Qualifier : I am a master parachute rigger and taught sport skydiving for 10 years . Standard jump altitude is 12,000 feet AGL - this is one turn of the standard parachutist 's altimeter . This height provides 1 minute of freefall , is within reach of a Cessna with a decent engine and does not require supplementary oxygen . For most places , this means an operating altitude between 12,000 and 15,000 feet MSL . Dropzones in high areas like Denver will reduce their jump altitude to 9,500 feet AGL mainly because the piston-powered planes take too long to climb higher and/or the upper part of the climb runs into the oxygen zone .
As with any flight , " It 's as safe as you make it " . The vast majority of the General Aviation fleet ( piston singles ) do n't even have an autopilot , and the ones that do may only be single-axis units ( wing levelers ) , so the pilot has to have some level of attention on flying the airplane . If we assume these are the folks flying around VFR we can also generally assume they should be looking out the window the vast majority of the time ( like Skip said , <URL> ) Adding to that , " See and avoid " is every pilot 's responsibility in VMC - whether operating under Visual Flight Rules or Instrument Flight Rules - if you can see , you are expected to avoid ( and if necessary deal with ATC freaking out about you deviating from a clearance later ) . A number of other steps have been taken to enhance safety in Class D and E airspace : In the US <URL> prescribes specific VFR cruising altitudes , and <URL> is the IFR equivalent . The cruising altitudes in these regulations result in an automatic 500-foot vertical separation of VFR and IFR traffic ( at least between 3,000 feet MSL and 18,000 feet MSL - which is where VFR and IFR traffic are likely to be mixing in cruise . ) . Additionally IFR traffic is usually receiving radar separation services ( there are some non-radar areas in the US , but not many ) . Nominally this separation is " IFR-to-IFR " in Class E airspace , but if a controller sees a VFR target squawking 1200 and behaving unpredictably they can vector IFR traffic around it . Similarly if a controller sees a " primary target only " ( something without a transponder , and not reporting altitude information ) they will often vector IFR traffic around it until they can establish what it is and what it 's doing . Within class D airspace the level of service you 'll get depends somewhat on the equipment the controllers have . A " purely visual " tower with no radar can only give traffic advisories for aircraft they can see by looking out their window , but if they see an conflict they 're going to say something . A tower with radar ( either local or slaved from a nearby airport ) may give give VFR-to-VFR or VFR-to-IFR separation advisories based on that data as well , sometimes including advisories to aircraft inbound who are outside their airspace .
I 'm not sure if you 're asking about general export regulations , in which case <URL> is useful , or the more specific licensing question . But regarding licensing it 's clear that you may not fly a US aircraft from the US to Brazil with only a Brazilian license . <URL> says : ( a ) Required pilot certificate for operating a civil aircraft of the United States . No person may serve as a required pilot flight crewmember of a civil aircraft of the United States , unless that person : ( 1 ) Has in the person 's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft when exercising the privileges of that pilot certificate or authorization -- ( i ) A pilot certificate issued under this part and in accordance with § 61.19 ; ( ii ) A special purpose pilot authorization issued under § 61.77 ; ( iii ) A temporary certificate issued under § 61.17 ; ( iv ) A document conveying temporary authority to exercise certificate privileges issued by the Airmen Certification Branch under § 61.29 ( e ) ; or ( v ) When operating an aircraft within a foreign country , a pilot license issued by that country may be used . In other words , you can use your Brazilian license to fly a US aircraft in Brazil ( see 61.3 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( v ) above ) but otherwise you need a US license or a special authorization ( <URL> covers leasing and commercial operations so it almost certainly wo n't apply to you ) . I know very little about this , but at least in theory it looks like your options are : Get a US license yourself , perhaps a foreign-based license based on your Brazilian one ( see <URL> ) Get some special permission from the FAA Pay a <URL> company to fly or transport the aircraft to Brazil Register the aircraft as Brazilian before it leaves the US ( this may not even be possible ) And those are only the FAA/aviation issues , you have to think about customs and general import/export regulations too , both in the US and Brazil . I would look for some specialized help with this .
I am going to assume that by " critical " , you mean survivable . I will also assume that the engine failure occurs at a height which will kill you . It 's not so much critical steps , it 's critical outcomes . The single most critical outcome is to preserve , or regain , rotor RPM . What steps are needed to do this will depend on what the aircraft is doing when the engine quits and , to a lesser extent , the type of the helicopter . I will generalise for an " average " helicopter in straight and level flight . The immediate action that is drilled into everyone from the very earliest hours as a student is to lower the collective . Doing this has three effects . It removes the positive pitch from the blades which removes most of the drag , it aligns the rotor thrust vector with the axis of rotor rotation therefore not using rotor energy for anything except lift and it causes a clutch to disengage the rotor from the engine allowing it to freewheel . From this point onwards , you are heading back towards earth . The second immediate action at the same time as lowering the collective ( assuming forward flight ) is to pull back on the cyclic to flare . This loads the disc which causes it to " cone " upwards which reduces the disc diameter . Therefore , the centre of gravity of the disc moves inwards and due to conservation of angular momentum , the rotor RPM increases . For quite complex reasons , the nose of the helicopter will also pitch down when the collective is lowered so pulling back counters that tendency . The third immediate action is to push in the pedal on the opposite side to the rotation of the blades . If the blades rotate counter clockwise ( to the left as the pilot sees it ) you push in right pedal to reduce the thrust which is produced by the tail rotor which is no longer countering the yaw caused by the drag from the powered rotor . This is less critical than the first two and although it can be dangerous and get you into an uncomfortable attitude , it is usually possible to recover from not pushing the pedal in immediately . If you 've got rotor RPM , then you can sort it out . Now you have successfully entered autorotation . From here , fly more or less normally to the next critical point which is about 50 ' off the ground . What you 've done is to ensure that the rotor has flying RPM and that you are managing energy by trading potential energy ( height ) for kinetic energy ( rotor RPM ) . The conversion is done by the airflow which now comes from under the disc and " drives " the rotor to maintain RPM . The pitch is neutral , or maybe even negative but , the relative airflow is now upwards through the disc and therefore , the blades have a positive angle of attack and generate some lift . This stops the helicopter from falling . There is some drag generated as a consequence of generating that lift , but it is easily overcome by the power which is now driving the rotor from that upward airflow . As long as you are descending , that conversion will happen and your RPM will be maintained . The controls are rigged such that with the collective fully down , RPM will remain in the normal range . Sometimes you have to tweak it a little with small amounts of collective , flares and turns but in general , you just fly towards your landing spot . The allowed RPM range is greater in autorotation . For example ( and from memory ) , the R22 has a range of 97-103 % in normal flight and 90-110 % in autorotation . You are now descending with a high rate of descent and usually , significant forward speed . You need to reduce both of those to get to a safe arrival . To do this , there are three more critical steps . Starting at about 50 feet ( depending on lots of factors but let 's stick with the average helicopter which entered autorotation from straight and level with significant altitude ) , you flare the aircraft by pulling back on the cyclic . This will immediately begin to slow the aircraft . It will also begin to increase RPM ( you are now converting speed into rotor kinetic energy ) . At the same time , you increase collective to reduce the rate of descent by increasing the lift generated . This will rapidly increase the drag , but now the energy needed to maintain the RPM is coming from the flare which is converting speed into RPM . You also need to put in pedal to stop the aircraft from yawing as the drag increases on the rotor . Providing you get the entry right and your flare reduces the speed and rate of descent to something survivable , then you will walk away . You might wreck the helicopter and break some bones , but arrive at 10 feet with only 20 knots and 150 feet per minute rate and you 'll get away with it . If you are well trained and in practice , then you will land safely and smoothly with no damage to machine or people . In summary , critical steps : Entry . Lever down , cyclic back , pedal in . Arrival . Cyclic back , lever up , pedal in .
There 's no " standard holding pattern " at any airport , towered or not . If the runway is occupied or temporarily closed for some reason , you might was well leave the traffic pattern and go putt around for a while someplace where there are fewer aircraft . At a towered airport , the controller will likely tell you what to do - but again , you can make both his life and yours easier by just leaving the pattern and going somewhere else until the situation is resolved .
Perhaps the most important rule for a VFR pilot is " see and avoid " -- be able to see any immediate dangers ( other aircraft , buildings , ground ) and avoid them . When flying above the clouds , you can certainly see other aircraft and avoid them ( as long as you 're maintaining required cloud clearances ) , and the same for buildings . You can not see the ground but on the presumption that your altitude is well above the ground and not significantly changing , this is not a factor . As long as you 're able to see the horizon , you 're unlikely to become disoriented to the point of not actually knowing that the aircraft is or is n't flying straight and level . ( Contrast that with flying in the clouds , where it 's easy to become spatially disoriented and not be aware that you 're starting to dive . ) Limitations are basic : it 's the PIC 's responsibility to follow the regulations . As to heading in the right direction and navigation in general , VFR flight does not mean one can not rely on radio aids to navigation . VOR and GPS certainly make navigation very possible while on top , but to get to your question of " can it be done safely ? " -- I suppose this comes down to a question of how reliable are your electronics and where are the weak spots ; is the pilot under flight following or otherwise in contact with ATC , etc. . If one were on top and were to lose the electrical system , there 's certainly an emergency to be declared . If already in contact with ATC , it 's an emergency that can likely be managed with the utmost of safety .
Yes . What allows you as a pilot to fly large aircraft ( legally under the FAA ) is a <URL> . As long as the two Captains hold proper type ratings for the aircraft they suffice for the required two crew members needed to fly the plane . However one of the two of them will be performing the duties of the first officer and that should be decided prior to the flight . First Officer and Captain are rankings given by the airline not any governing body . Both the FO and Captain cary the type cert required to fly the aircraft ( as far as I know ) . The limited ( and quickly dwindling ) exception to this is aircraft that require a crew of 3 where the third is a flight engineer . The <URL> does hold its own certification .
For the record , the asker changed the question after I answered , specifying that not declaring an emergency is a condition of the question , so I will address this at the top without modifying the original part : An attitude indicator is legally required for IFR flight . If equipment becomes inoperative during IFR , the pilot should inform ATC . I do not know that there is any specific legal text that addresses this particular situation you 're describing with an ILS approach coupled with an AI failure , but it would be generally accepted by pilots that losing an attitude indicator is an emergency as opposed to losing other required IFR equipment such as the clock . So , I 'm going to go with no , not without declaring an emergency . Original : In that situation depending on the circumstances , declaring a missed approach , an emergency informing ATC of the system failure , and requesting vectors to VMC conditions would be the best option . In an emergency , you can deviate from rules to meet the needs of the emergency at your discretion , so I do n't believe that technically you ca n't still shoot to minimums for the ILS , but it would be dangerous , especially if the pilot is n't highly proficient , and should be a last resort with no primary gyros . If an approach needed to be shot , and there was no VMC within range , a ' Precision Approach Radar ' approach would likely be the best option if one existed within range . This is can be a ' no-gyro ' approach upon request .
We all know the saying " From High to Low , Look out below " Some were taught that this only applied to pressure differences and thus were instructed to get a new altimeter setting every 100NM or so . This is a good recommendation . Temperature differences from standard also causes errors with the altimeter . The same saying above holds true with temperature variations . An altimeter setting is defined as : ( ref . Pilot/Controller Glossary ) The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for variations in existing atmospheric pressure or to the standard altimeter setting ( 29.92 ) . We also know there is a direct correlation between pressure and temperature and thus an altimeter setting is corrected for both pressure and temperature . This means one thing , the altimeter error is zero at the field elevation . As the aircraft gets climbs higher above the field , the altimeter error will increase . There is a table in the Aeronautical Information Manual ( 7-2-8 ) that lists altimeter error due to temperature as a function of altitude ( AGL ) and temperature . Here is the formula that will give you this table . The formula can be found in <URL> . The United States Air Force has a <URL> that discusses this topic . The FAA has recently come out with <URL> which requires pilots ( after 9/17/2015 ) who fly into " Cold Temperature Restricted Airports " to correct their altitudes for colder than standard temperatures . To determine if your airport is part of this program you must go to the <URL> and search for Cold Temperature Restricted Airports . There should be a link at the bottom of the page . Here is a graphic showing all the airports in the United States that were part of the program in February 2015 . Because Lnafziger wanted Alaska . Not only is the pilot required to correct for the segment but they are also required to inform ATC of the new altitudes they will fly . This is to ensure traffic separation with other airplanes who are not temperature correcting their altimeters . Pictures taken with permission from <URL> . All rights reserved .
As long as you remain VFR then the equipment requirements for the airplane and the flight are VFR . § 61.57 says " Within the 6 calendar months preceding the month of the flight , that person performed and logged at least the following tasks and iterations in an airplane , powered-lift , helicopter , or airship , as appropriate , for the instrument rating privileges to be maintained in actual weather conditions , or under simulated conditions using a view-limiting device ... " . It does n't say anything about having an IFR certified airplane or having a current pitot/static and altimeter check . If you are maintaining SEL IFR currency , then all you need is a SEL airplane . MEL IFR , then a multi-engine plane , etc. . And if you are missing some of the 6-pack instruments , all the better for practicing partial panel .
A Special VFR ( SVFR ) clearance may be issued to a pilot when : The weather is below VFR weather minimums , as reported at the intended airport The pilot is able to remain clear of clouds The pilot has at least one mile flight visibility ( other than helicopters ) at all times The pilot is operating ( or wants to operate ) within the lateral boundaries of the airport surface area The pilot specifically requests it . The airport is not among those listed in <URL> ( except helicopters ) If the weather is not reported at the airport , the pilot must tell ATC that they are " unable to maintain VFR " and request SVFR . Side note : The weather conditions that you describe above are technically " Marginal VFR " and not IFR . It would be a perfect situation to operate SVFR though .
Sure you can . This is from ICAO Doc 4444 : 4.4.2.2.1 A flight plan to be submitted during flight should normally be transmitted to the ATS unit in charge of the FIR , control area , advisory area or advisory route in or on which the aircraft is flying , or in or through which the aircraft wishes to fly or to the aeronautical telecommunication station serving the air traffic services unit concerned . When this is not practicable , it should be transmitted to another ATS unit or aeronautical telecommunication station for retransmission as required to the appropriate air traffic services unit . 4.4.2.2.2 Where relevant , such as in respect of ATC units serving high - or medium-density airspace , the appropriate ATS authority should prescribe conditions and/or limitations with respect to the submission of flight plans during flight to ATC units . And this is from SERA ( Standardized European Rules of the Air ) : SERA .4001 ( c ) A flight plan shall be submitted , before departure , to an air traffic services reporting office or , during flight , transmitted to the appropriate air traffic services unit or air-ground control radio station , unless arrangements have been made for submission of repetitive flight plans .
When it is slow , the two or three wheels should keep it from flipping over . Once it is fast enough to fly , the wing will provide what we engineers call roll damping : Any tendency to roll † will cause an opposing moment which will stop the motion quickly . The rest is done by a differential deflection of the ailerons , so the wing creates an equal and opposite rolling moment to that of the propeller . What is roll damping : Once the wing starts to roll , one side will go up while the other goes down . This will cause a change in local angle of attack and , consequently , local lift . The down-moving wing will see a higher angle of attack and a local lift increase , and the opposite happens on the other side . Total lift will remain unchanged , but now the change in the spanwise lift distribution will lift the down-moving wing back up and vice versa . The movement stops before it could pick up any speed . With powerful engines , engine torque is a real problem and needs to be canceled with a few tricks : Camber on the vertical tail : The vertical tail will create a side force and rolling moment which depends on the speed of the air flowing over the vertical . This helps to make the correction depend on the power setting of the engine . Just make sure that the vertical is in the slipstream of the propeller . With <URL> propellers you can cancel the rolling moment of each propeller with that of the other . This needs a more complex gearbox , however . In operation , apply power changes only slowly . With its narrow undercarriage , the <URL> would become uncontrollable if the pilot went from idle to full power on the ground too quickly . Watch the <URL> : In <URL> , the aircraft <URL> once the tail is lifted during the ground run or the pitch attitude is changed in flight . Also , yawing ( rotation around the vertical axis ) will create a pitch moment ( which acts around the spanwise axis ) . † Roll : Movement around the longitudinal axis .
Flight time is only considered compensation when the pilot is not paying all the costs associated with the flight . If the costs are to be shared the following advice is recommended . A private pilot can be compensated , up to a pro-rata share , of the cost of that specific flight . This would include rental fees , fuel , oil and such . It does not include items like insurance and annual inspection fees . The overall regulation is found in <URL> ( b ) A private pilot may , for compensation or hire , act as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if : ( 1 ) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment ; and ( 2 ) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire . ( c ) A private pilot may not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating expenses of a flight with passengers , provided the expenses involve only fuel , oil , airport expenditures , or rental fees . You should be able to see pretty quickly that you are allowed to transport yourself by private airplane to a business meeting . There is good reason to fly to ; depending on the distance , it could be quicker to fly a private airplane than it is to drive saving you time and money . However , the moment the company decides that you should fly to all of your meetings it is no longer incidental to that business and operations must cease . If you want to fly passengers , and also want them to pay their pro-rata share . There are three things that must be considered . There must be a bona-fide purpose for the PIC to make the flight . The reason can not be that the passenger has a business meeting at the destination and you want to get lunch . You , as the pilot , must have a reason to make the trip , whether or not the passenger ( s ) come along . The PIC must dictate where the flight is going to go . Again , you can not make a flight with passengers where you drop them off at one airport while you fly to a different airport . Why would you land at the first airport , if you have no need to land there ? You can not " hold out " or advertise that you are going somewhere and wait to see if other passengers are interested in going to the same location . There are <URL> that have been shut down by the FAA for doing just that . <URL> <URL> The Chero Interpretation December 26 , 1985 Thomas H. Chero Vice President - Legal AVEMCO Insurance Company Frederick Municipal Airport 411 Aviation Way Frederick , MD 21701 Dear Mr. Chero : Thank you for your letters to this office , dated September 9 , 1985 , and October 23 , 1985 , respectively , concerning the actions of the Pilots and Passengers Association ( PPA ) . You are correct in stating that Section 61.118 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ( FAR ) prohibits private pilots from participating in PPA 's operations . Section 61.118 provides that a private pilot can not act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers for compensation or hire unless the flight falls within one of the four listed exceptions in 61.118 ( a ) - ( d ) . Section 61.118 ( b ) allows a private pilot to share the operating expenses of a flight with his or her passengers . Additionally , the FAA has interpreted 61.118 ( b ) so that the only allowable share-the-costs operations are those which are bona fide , that is , joint ventures for a common purpose with the expenses being defrayed by all passengers and the pilot . Nor does Section 61.118 permit pilots who want to build up time toward their commercial pilot certificates to carry expense sharing passengers to a destination at which they have no particular business . ( emphasis added ) PPA pilots apparently would not share in the expenses of the flights they would undertake . It also appears that PPA pilots could be flying to destinations at which they had no particular business . The PPA system is not a casual one of an individual pilot wishing to take some friends or acquaintances with him on a trip . The PPA system would violate the letter , as well as the spirit , of Section 61.118 . Even if the pilot bears an equal share of the expenses with his or her passengers and indeed has his or her own need to fly to a particular destination , yet another problem arises . Since PPA 's passengers would be solicited for flights by PPA from a broad segment of the general public , we conclude that each pilot carrying paying passengers from PPA would probably be engaged in common carriage . This means that each pilot would become an air carrier subject to the certification and operating rules of Part 135 of the FAR . We appreciate your calling our attention to this matter . Sincerely , John H. Cassady Assistant Chief Counsel Regulations and Enforcement Division
What I assume you are talking about is the drivers license medical loop here in the US that allows you to fly LSA aircraft with only holding a Drivers License ( in lieu of a medical certificate ) . You can find the <URL> but there are a few things you should know . First off you need to see what your local state requires ( since drivers licenses are issued by states not a federal body like pilots licenses ) . If your state has color blind restrictions on drivers licenses you may have an issue ( i ) Comply with each restriction and limitation imposed by that person 's U.S. driver 's license and any judicial or administrative order applying to the operation of a motor vehicle ; If you are stepping down from larger planes into LSA planes you can not use the drivers license if you have ever lost a medical cert ( iii ) Not have had his or her most recently issued medical certificate ( if the person has held a medical certificate ) suspended or revoked or most recent Authorization for a Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate withdrawn ; and The catch all clause that may make the colorblind condition an issue is the last requirement in the FAR ( iv ) Not know or have reason to know of any medical condition that would make that person unable to operate a light-sport aircraft in a safe manner . There are lots of light signals used in aviation that a red/green color blind person would have issues with . According to <URL> color blind LSA pilots are restricted from flying into where color light signals may be used ( these signals include but are not limited to tower light signals and ground based warning lights like those in the DC area ) . If your state issues you a color blind restriction on your drivers license it holds here as well , Of course , any limitations placed on the driver 's license would also apply to flying , and a person must always be physically able to perform the flight safely . Furthermore it seems that according to <URL> you can have the restrictions lifted if you can pass a color blind test ( I assume this applies to both the LSA restrictions as well as the regular PPL restrictions )

Why is the end of the F-35 's jet nozzle ' spiky ' ?
Stealth . The F-35 's nozzle is designed in that manner to reduce the IR and radar emissions from the aircraft ( sometimes called Low Observable Axisymmetric Nozzle ( LOAN ) ) . From the <URL> which announced the test results : GE Aircraft Engines ' new LO Axi ( Low Observable Axisymmetric ) Exhaust System was successfully tested recently ... testing being conducted under the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) Technology Maturation Program ... According to GE , ... LO Axi Nozzle was installed by the South Dakota Air National Guard in an F-16C and ground-tested to verify installation compatibility with an operational aircraft system . Both infrared ( IR ) and radio frequency ( RF ) measurements were made by GE Aircraft Engines ( GEAE ) with the F110-GE-100 engine operating at power settings ranging from idle to maximum afterburner . The resulting test data verified that the LO Axi Nozzle achieves its installed signature goals during operation . In addition to geometrical shaping and special materials for signature control , the LO Axi Nozzle also incorporates an ejector that enhances nozzle cooling . The system was originally tested on a F-16 . The following image shows the nozzle while it was under testing <URL> Detailled rear view of a standard P&amp;W F-100-200 still installed in the LOAN aircraft and the LOAN nozzle in the foreground ( LMTAS photo ) ; image from <URL>
The F-14 manual describes the ejection system as : The aircraft is equipped with an automatic electronically sequenced command escape system incorporating two Navy aircrew common ejection seat ( SJU-17 ( V ) 3/A ( pilot ) and SJU-17 ( V ) 4/A ( RIO ) ) rocket-assisted ejection seats . That means the seats are an integral part of the system . According to <URL> , the weight is 228 pounds ( 103 kg ) and it has a " maximum thrust [ of ] 4,800 pounds for 0.25 seconds " . A cockpit seat on a Boeing 737 weighs around 40 kg if we are to trust this <URL> , so we can say the addition of the ejection elements adds 63 kg . Of course a 737 cockpit seat is much heavier than a WWII non-existent seat ( the pilots <URL> their own cushions ) . This might be useful however if you want to compare a B-52 with and without ejection seats . Below is an image for that ejection system , and as I gather , that 's a very common ( average ) model found on many US aircraft . <URL> ( Click for larger size . )
It 's been several years since I worked at United 's flight training center , but if my memory serves me , it is there in case the system is receiving input that the pilot wants to exclude . As was explained to me , an example of this would be the other pilot becoming incapacitated , with their body leaning against the sidestick . In this case , one would want to use the Priority Takeover button to eliminate the other pilot 's input . In Captain Sullenberger 's case , it is likely that he wanted to ensure that First Officer Skiles was n't providing any control inputs that would work against his control inputs . Now , it is also my understanding that such functionality is not useful in a " hostile takeover " event , since the other pilot can also attempt a priority takeover ( or use physical force , due to the close proximity of the two pilots ) .
VTOL aircraft can have more than one engine . It is just that the design process of the Harrier and F-35 led to a situation where only one engine was required . The main challenge in any VTOL aircraft is to have the engine produce thrust in two different phases of flight : during cruise and during takeoff/landing . This basically requires the powerplant on the aircraft to have two different characteristics at those two phases , because The direction of the thrust vector is different in TO/Landing and cruise Amount of thrust required is different ; for vertical TO , the thrust should be more than the weight while in cruise , the required thrust is ( comparatively ) pretty low . A number of approaches have been tried to solve this problem : Takeoff the aircraft vertically ( aka the tail sitter ) , like <URL> , and then transition to horizontal flight . However , one major problem is the pilot has severe disorientation problems during transition Put extra fans , like the <URL> . The problem was the large ( wing ) area taken up by the fan and weight penalties . Ironically , a similar concept has been used in F-35 Put extra engines specifically for vertical lift ( aka the ' Rolls Royce Concept ' ) , used in <URL> . Though this offered ( theoretically ) better safety , the weight penalty was too much . Optimise the main engine for cruise and deflect the thrust for takeoff and augment with ( small ) lift engines ( aka the tiltjet concept ) , like the German <URL> . This reduced the weight penalty and complexity , but reduced safety in the event of an engine failure . In order to avoid the weight penalty , the best approach is to have no extra engines at all , with the thrust deflected down at take off and landing . This was called ' vectored thrust ' ( a term attributed to Theodore Von Karman ) . This concept was tested in the <URL> , which had fixed eingines and thrust vectoring vanes that deflected the exhaust to achieve vertical lift . <URL> Source : history.nasa.gov In case of the Harrier , the engine , the <URL> was first developed ( as BE .53 ) and the Hawker aircraft decided to develop an aircraft around it . During the design proces , the aircraft was redesigned around the Hawker modified BE 53 which the rear jet was split into two , like the <URL> , which had a similar arrangement . This lead to the ' four poster ' thrust vectoring system in the Harrier . <URL> Source : www.aerospaceweb.org This is the reason , the Harrier had a single engine . The case of F-35 is different . The F-35 was designed to replace aircraft operated by a number of US services , and as such had conflicting design requirements . At one end , the USAF wanted a conventional fighter while the USMC wanted a VTOL aircraft . The USN requirements were somewhere in the middle . Lockheed designers decided that the best way to meet these requirements is to have a separate fan for lifting the aircraft in VTOL , which can simply be eliminated in the USAF and USN variants . This led to the lift fan arrangement ( eerily similar to the Vertifan arrangement ) . <URL> " <URL> " by Tosaka - Own work . Licensed under CC BY 3.0 via <URL> . So , in case of F-35 the use of a single engine was the best way to meet the requirements . The engine used , the <URL> is the most powerful fighter jet engine in service , which helps in making F-35 the first supersonic VTOL aircraft .
14.5 % given in the article is the ( maximum ) thickness to chord ratio , expressed in percentage . It is usually used to explain how thin ( or thick ) the airfoil is . Note that this is a characteristic of the airfoil . From the NASA page <URL> : <URL> Airfoil thickness to chord ratio , image from NASA page <URL> ... The straight line drawn from the leading to trailing edges of the airfoil is called the chord line . ... The maximum distance between the two lines is called the camber , which is a measure of the curvature of the airfoil ( high camber means high curvature ) . The maximum distance between the upper and lower surfaces is called the thickness . Often you will see these values divided by the chord length to produce a non-dimensional or " percent " type of number .
Yes , the yaw string on the canopy of a glider is there to show you whether or not you are coordinated , especially during turns . It indicates the relative wind , so will be straight unless the glider is slipping or skidding , in which case it will swing to the left or right . For those not familiar with them , here is an image that shows one : According to <URL> , they are also used on other aircraft ( even jet fighters and the U-2 ! ) although they are used in almost every glider . Now , the advantages that it has over an actual instrument installed in the panel are numerous : It is directly in your line of sight while looking outside , so you do n't have to look at the instrument panel to see if you are yawing . It is more sensitive It reacts faster to changes It is cheaper It is lighter It does n't require electricity ( or even an electrical system on the glider ) It costs far less to maintain It is easy to recognize when it fails ( it 's either there or not )
<URL> : McCall 's plane is a demilitarized Douglas A-26 Invader , a type used in WWII . Since the film was made in 1960 , I imagine there were plenty of them around . ( The A-26 was known a the B-26 from 1948 to 1965 , <URL> . The B-25 is easily distinguished because it has the twin tail . )
No , you can not . Carbon fibre composites always contain a matrix component which serves different functionalities , but ( in a micro nutshell ) bonds and keeps the fibres in place . What you get is a very complex material with lots of lightweight potential , but also very different property profiles compared to metals . Most matrix materials ( thermoset , thermoplastics ) will not work up to engine ( combustion chamber ) temperatures and either degrade/burn or melt/vaporize/burn long before reaching even a meagre few hundred Kelvin ( say , 500K ) . In fact , carbon fibres will not work as well in an oxygenated high-temperature environment , and degrade/burn up as well . One composite material that works and is used already in engines are ceramic matrix composites , like ( amongst others ) e.g. C/C-SiC structures , but those are very special animals ( and even there the carbon fibre parts are susceptible to burn ) . Especially in terms of mechanical properties , these can not compete with superalloys . But also for many other , ambient temperature parts , metals are much better suited . Think of example of a ball bearing - doing that completely in composite will not work really well ( if at all ) .
Short answer If a single range should be stated for ACAS II , it would be the reliable range of 14 NM , even if targets can displayed by current TCAS II up to 30/40 NM . Reliable means here : a track can be established with a probability of at least 90 per cent for aircraft within the surveillance range . The reliable range of 14 NM is achievable with a ground plane antenna a power of 250 W and a Mode S sensitivity of -- 74 dBm . Diversity of ranges There are different range values that can be considered : Overall pulse detection range is 30 NM . Reliable surveillance range is 14 NM . Recommended RA range is 12 NM . Guaranteed range is 4.5 NM . The range must be limited because it impacts the number of transponder addresses to be stored for a given transponder density as well as the number of interrogations within a volume , hence radio spectrum use and reliability . ACAS II recommendations by ICAO ACAS II ICAO recommendations are found in <URL> , Airborne Collision Avoidance System ( ACAS ) Manual : Interrogation pulse detection range is 14 NM for Mode A/C and 30 NM for Mode S . The equipment should have the capacity for surveillance of any mix of Mode A/C or Mode S targets up to at least 30 aircraft . Surveillance must be reliable within 14 NM , with an aircraft density of 0.3 aircraft per square NM within 5 NM ( and up to 142 aircraft within 30 NM ) . The equipment should assess as possible collision threats only those targets within a maximum range of 12 NM . No target outside this range should be eligible to generate an RA . As density increases , reliability decreases . If the overall target count ever exceeds the surveillance capacity at any range up to 14 NM , the long-range targets may be dropped . The system reliability is guaranteed within the minimum range of 4.5 NM . This radius is deemed adequate for providing protection for up to 500 kt encounter . TCAS version 7.1 TCAS II is the sole implementation of ACAS II which fully comply with ACAS II . The reference ( paying ) documents are : <URL> ( RTCA ) and <URL> ( EUROCAE ) . From the EASA document <URL> TCAS II can simultaneously track up to 30 aircraft , within a nominal range of 14 NM for Mode A/C targets and 30 NM for Mode S targets . In implementations that allow for the use of the Mode S extended squitter , the normal surveillance range may be increased beyond the nominal 14 NM . However , this information is not used for collision avoidance purposes . This is confirmed in FAA document <URL> TCAS has a requirement to provide reliable surveillance out to a range of 14 nmi and in traffic densities of up to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile . [ ... ] TCAS can simultaneously track up to 30 transponder-equipped aircraft within a nominal range of 30 nmi .
Yes , but you need <URL> . A rigid head does not have any hinges , instead , the blades flex up and down . Wings do n't know or care if they are upside down or right way up , indeed , <URL> . It only cares how much airflow there is and at what angle it hits it . Here 's an <URL> and a <URL> Perhaps the best around is <URL> Here , Dennis Kenyon shows <URL> He gets close to inverted but never actually flips over .
Well , the rubber hoses themselves were used instead of traditional electromag transducer headphones for two main reasons ; first , the hoses were much cheaper than a decent pair of traditional headphones at the time , and to an extent they 're washable , so airlines could provide a pair for everyone at a much lower pricepoint than traditional headphones . Second , the hoses were more or less useless without the driving system aboard the aircraft , largely removing the incentive for passengers to walk off with them , again reducing costs of providing the system to passengers . The system was phased out in favor of simple 1/8 " stereo jacks at each seat in the '80s and '90s as portable audio became mainstream , and as airlines looked to dramatically slash costs in the face of deregulation beginning in 1978 . Economies of scale meant that buying cheapo Walkman-style headphones in bulk became cheaper than maintaining the aging pneumatic systems , and the electric-based system was more reliable and had several advantages ( such as volume control for each passenger , and if standard 1/8 " jacks were used , the ability for a savvy flyer to bring their own , nicer pair for use on the flight ) . As an aside , this pneumatic audio system is still used today for a very different purpose ; newborn hearing screenings . A pair of flaps with a mild adhesive are stuck to baby 's ears , then hoses lead back to a finely-calibrated audio system coupled to an EEG . Audio is played and the EEG is monitored to detect the response to the sound in baby 's brain . The hose system is used because it allows the expensive , fine-tolerance part of the audio system to be reused from test to test , while the hoses themselves are disposable and ( as hospital equipment goes ) fairly inexpensive .
To certify any Commercial Jet Plane worthy of flying , a 2 engine plane must be able fly with just 1 engine running a 3 engine jet like the Lockheed L1011 or DC10 with just 1 a 4 engine jet with just 2 . Although not a requirement , the 747 , A380 could fly on one engine but are not be able to maintain the cruise altitude indefinitely and will eventually become long-range gliders so they must land immediately . The landing approach and procedures vary on how much the plane weighs prior to landing . Would the passengers be notified , asking to take the brace position during landing ? Brace Positions are only assumed on impact emergencies , like crash landings . Losing an engine does n't mean you are going to crash so no brace will be assumed . Would such event have an accident investigation report ? There will be an investigation but if the plane landed safely it wont be filed as an accident . The plane plus the engines passed its FAA , EASA , etc Certification so it may be a number of reasons why the engine malfunctioned , like bad maintenance , faulty parts etc. . This is an extract from wikepedia -- <URL> Shut downs that are not engine failures Most in-flight shutdowns are harmless and likely to go unnoticed by passengers . For example , it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing in the event of a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit . However , passengers may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge -- a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine 's inlet and tailpipe . A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine engine that can be caused by engine deterioration , a crosswind over the engine 's inlet , ingestion of foreign material , or an internal component failure such as a broken blade . While this situation can be alarming , the condition is momentary and not dangerous . Other events such as a fuel control fault can result in excess fuel in the engine 's combustor . This additional fuel can result in flames extending from the engine 's exhaust pipe . As alarming as this would appear , at no time is the engine itself actually on fire . Also , the failure of certain components in the engine may result in a release of oil into bleed air that can cause an odor or oily mist in the cabin . This is known as a fume event . The dangers of fume events are the subject of debate in both aviation and medicine . Would this report later be available for general public , as are the reports of various significant air disasters ? It depends , as you read above the flight deck crew may shut down an engine because of low oil pressure . Would that have significance of becoming public knowledge ? However as an example , if the problem of an engine failure escalates to the manufacturer then the airline may ground the fleet and that then becomes public knowledge and the reason why because the airliner would give media statements . It all depends on the severity of the problem . Like this one that got reported -- <URL> 20 August 2007 ; B-18616 , 737-800 , 30175/1182 , FF 11 Jul 02 , Okinawa , Japan : Engine # 1 caught fire shortly after docking destroying the aircraft . No fatalities . The cause was the detachment of a slat pylon bolt which fell off and pierced the fuel tank which leaked and ignited . According to the JTSB the washer that should have held the nut in place probably detached during maintenance 6 weeks before the incident . The design of the nut has since been changed to limit the likelihood of detachment .
It is actually not that simple to ensure the proper gas speed in a gas turbine . In the compressor you want to limit the flow speed over the compressor vanes to the high subsonic range , so the <URL> down to approx . Mach 0.4 - 0.5 . Less would mean less throughput and consequently less thrust . This speed , however , is far too high for ignition . The <URL> , and if flow speed is high , your combustion chamber becomes very long and the engine becomes heavier than necessary . Therefore , the cross section leading from the compressor to the combustion chamber is carefully widened to slow down the airflow without separation ( see the section below named " diffusor " ) . Around the fuel injectors you will find the lowest gas speed in the whole engine . Now the combustion heats the gas up , and makes it expand . The highest pressure in the whole engine is right at the last compressor stage - from there on pressure only drops the farther you progress . This ensures that no backflow into the compressor is possible . However , when the <URL> s ( this is quite like a wing stalling - the compressor vanes are little wings and have the same limitations ) , it can not maintain the high pressure and you get reverse flow . This is called a <URL> . The graph below shows typical values of flow speed , temperature and pressure in a jet engine . Getting these right is the task of the engine designer . Plot of engine flow parameters over the length of a turbojet ( picture taken from <URL> publication ) The rear part of the engine must block the flow of the expanding gas less than the forward part to make sure it continues to flow in the right direction . By keeping the cross section of the combustor constant , the engine designer ensures that the expanding gas will accelerate , converting thermal energy to kinetic energy , without losing its pressure ( the small pressure drop in the combustor is caused by friction ) . Now the accelerated flow hits the turbine , and the pressure of the gas drops in each of its stages , which again makes sure that no backflow occurs . The turbine has to take as much energy from the flow as needed to run the compressor and the attached pumps and generators without blocking the flow too much . The remaining pressure is again converted to speed <URL> . Now the gas is still much hotter than ambient air , and even though the flow at the end of the nozzle is still subsonic in modern airliner engines , the actual flow speed is much higher than the flight speed . The speed difference between flight speed and the exit speed of the gas in the nozzle is what produces <URL> . Fighter engines usually have supersonic flow at the end of the nozzle , which requires careful shaping and adjustment of the nozzle contour . Read all about it <URL> .
It 's required by law , at least in the US . <URL> , Cockpit control knob shape specifies these shapes for the flap and gear controls on smaller aircraft : <URL> For larger ( transport category ) aircraft , <URL> specifies the same thing : <URL> As for why those shapes are specified , it 's for at least two reasons : The shape resembles the thing it controls , so it 's an obvious memory aid The controls are all shaped differently , therefore you can distinguish them by touch alone , without needing to look at them As others <URL> , there have been accidents in the past caused by pilots using the wrong controls , and this is one reason why the FAA decided to do something to standardize them . Parts 23 and 25 also state where the controls should be placed , for the same reason . The FAA 's <URL> says : There have been many cases of the pilot mistakenly grasping the wrong handle and retracting the landing gear , instead of the flaps , due to improper division of attention while the airplane was moving . They recommend - and I was taught - leaving the flaps alone after landing until clear of the runway ( unless you have a good reason for retracting them earlier , like a short-field landing ) , then check and retract them with the statement " flaps identified and retracted " . " Identified " in this case simply means that you 're sure you have the right control in your hand . Some instructors even avoid touch-and-goes in complex aircraft ( i.e. with retractable gear ) because they feel the risk of retracting the gear rather than the flaps during the maneuver is too high ; they stop and go instead , even if that means taxiing back for takeoff .
ymb1 is right - stealth and not styling determine the looks of both the F-22 and the F-35 . But there is more to it . Watch Lockheed test pilot Tom Morgenfeld talk about them in <URL> : The juicy bits are at 37:15 ' and at 43:35 ' into the video . Concerning the F-22 he says : Northrop built the F-23 exactly to what the Air Force asked for , while Lockheed built what the Air Force secretly wanted . And that was another F-15 , with similar manoeuvrability . Concerning the F-35 he says Lockheed 's goal was to build an aircraft which is at least as good as an F-18 around the ship . This means manoeuvrability to land on a carrier even from off-nominal conditions ; very forgiving to fly . By using the F-22 baseline , this manoeuvrability could be ensured . Now look at all three of them : <URL> McDonnell-Douglas F-15 Eagle ( picture <URL> ) <URL> Lockheed-Martin F-22 Raptor ( picture <URL> ) <URL> Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II ( picture <URL> ) They look similar , do n't they ? Differences like a forward swept trailing edge and <URL> are due to stealth , as is <URL> .
The noise within the engine will make all flow turbulent . There is not much liberty for the engine designer to choose the type of boundary layer . Generally , a laminar boundary layer is preferable as long as the flow is accelerated , because viscous drag will be lower , and a turbulent one is better when it is decelerated , so <URL> . Outside of boundary layer phenomena , turbulence is helpful for keeping the <URL> going in the combustor and especially in the afterburner . Ahead of the combustor all engines have a diffusor to <URL> , so it has time to mix with the fuel and burn as much of it as possible . Note that the diffusor only slows down the axial movement of the air , so radial velocities will not be affected and be relatively larger relative to the axial flow at the entry of the combustion chamber . This makes the flow more turbulent , which is helpful for better fuel-air mixing . In the afterburner , flame holders are needed to produce pockets of slow-moving , hot gas which can ignite the fuel-air mixture . Again , they cause more turbulence . <URL> Flame holder ( 10 ) with annular selectors ( 9 ) of an afterburner ( picture <URL> ) At the nozzle , turbulent mixing of the hot core flow and the bypass flow reduces noise . Engine nozzles use a <URL> to speed up the mixing process .
Most accidents are referred to by flight number It depends who it is that is referring to the accident , and on who they are addressing . News media and the general public Newpapers and other media use flight numbers because that is the number known to friends and relatives of the individuals concerned and because most members of the public who have flown as passengers are very familiar with the concept of flight numbers but not really familiar with aircraft registration numbers . Investigators Investigating authorities have their own numbering schemes for accidents they investigate . Aircraft registration numbers change when an aircraft is sold to a purchaser based in another country . The only number that stays with an aircraft for its entire life is the manufacturer 's serial number . All these numbers can appear in official accident investigations reports . The registration number is usually prominent . <URL> <URL> <URL>
If some parts of the airfoil create lift and others a downforce , the center of pressure can be outside of the airfoil 's chord at low lift coefficients . This condition is fulfilled for cambered airfoils , airfoils with a deflected flap and especially for rear loading airfoils , which have low camber in the front and high camber in the rear part . Supercritical airfoils meet this last condition . In airfoil theory , an airfoil creates lift and a moment , because the lift is assumed to attack at the quarter chord point . This point is special because here the moment coefficient does not change with the angle of attack ( at least in the inviscid , linear potential theory , which is sufficiently close to reality at large Reynolds numbers to be useful ) . In reality , positive camber will cause the resulting lift force to act aft of the quarter chord point , and the pitching moment is negative . When lift becomes small and the pitching moment stays constant , the lever arm of that small lift needs to become large to achieve the same moment , and this is when the center of pressure can slip out of the airfoil 's chord . Below you see the result from XFRL5 V6 .0.5 . I plotted the local center of pressure as a green line . It 's elevation over the plane of the wing shows the amount of lift locally created , and the location in streamwise direction shows that it leaves the local chord when lift becomes low . Note that when moving out in spanwise direction the location jumps from far aft of the airfoil to far ahead when the local lift turns negative . At the point of no local lift you have a division by zero error , patched over here by a straight connection between the results from the single panels . <URL> Location of the local center of pressure on a swept wing ( own work ) . When angle of attack is increased , all additional lift has the Birnbaum distribution , so the local center of pressure moves towards the quarter-chord location .
First off , there are some light aircraft powered by diesel like the <URL> and the <URL> . It should be noted both come in a 100LL powered version as well . As it stands now the <URL> but has not yet decided/found one . There are also <URL> . But anyway , more to the point , you cant simply put diesel into a regular engine as the ignition system and compression requirements are different . Thus to convert a plane to diesel you need a different engine all together . With that in mind most certifying bodies dont just let you swap airplane engines to any engine you see fit . The engine would need to be certified for the air frame which is a costly proposition . Thus it is sensible and economical to keep the current engines running . There are some efforts like those made by piper and diamond to slowly make diesel aircraft available . As to why 100LL is used , this stems mostly from history . The vast majority of the general aviation fleet both physically and simply in design , stems from the dawn of the jet age . When the lines for the <URL> there was plenty of 100LL to go around , it was for lack of a better term , the logical choice .
This explanation is for a subsonic aircraft . If air flow is disturbed at the engine inlet , like it happens if the engine angle of attack is too high ( or the crab angle too high like in <URL> ) or air is disturbed by another mean like the wake of a preceding aircraft , a compressor stall can occur . The flow within the fan and compressor stages is no more homogeneous , and different mass flows exist in the compressor . These disparities are increased until the flow stops in low mass flow regions , the reason is : Compressor stages are made of blades and vanes delimiting small passages between them . If one passage is blocked by slow air , upstream air tries to use the next one . The next passage is reached under a higher angle of attack , so this tends to stall this passage too . <URL> This effect propagates rapidly and is called a rotating stall . This has been explained here : <URL> Effects Unsteady airflow As passages are blocked by detached air over stalled airfoils , pressure increases in the passages and upstream . Detached airflow being very turbulent with changing velocity ( including negative values ) , blade/vane vibrations can start . Vibrations are not good for an engine , buffeting can break a metal part if resonance occurs . Pressure decrease The compressor being now less efficient , pressure downstream the compressor decreases in addition of being variable . The pressure variation intensity is somehow limited by the plenum chamber effect of the compressor diffuser for an axial compressor and diffuser stator after the impeller for a centrifugal compressor . <URL> Location of the diffuser , <URL> Depending on whether a new balance can be found or not , combustion may continue while the rotating stall occurs . In that case it 'll be at reduced power due to the less efficient compressor , and a lower fuel flow is required . It may be necessary to shutdown the engine and restart it to get out of the compressor stall . Overheating If fuel flow is not reduced in a steady rotating stall , the mixture becomes too rich , combustion temperature increases , overheating occurs in the combustion chamber and downstream in the turbine . As the materials used for the combustion chamber and the turbine are already at their highest sustainable temperature , any increase can damage them . This can happen if the fuel control unit ( FCU ) does n't limit fuel flow correctly and attempts to maintain previous thrust / fuel flow . It is suspected this was the cause of <URL> . Surge The compressor diffuser ( or plenum in a centrifugal compressor ) is upstream of the combustion chamber . The latter is a very high pressure region at hot temperature . If the diffuser pressure is too low compared to turbine inlet pressure , hot gas can start flowing back into the diffuser and the compressor . This is a <URL> . The surge creates a loud bang and the pressure wave can damage the fan and the engine inlet . The surge can be associated with flames getting out of the engine by the exhaust pipe , or the engine inlet . There is also an asymmetrical additional thrust leading to a yaw force . Compressor elements are not designed to sustain hot gas from the combustion chamber , they may be damaged if exposition is repeated . Again the engine may recover itself from the surge , if there is no damage . The cycle can repeat but at some point damages are inevitable . Loss of control If the surge is important and the aircraft is in a critical phase ( e.g. rotating to take off ) , the yaw effect can lead to a loss of control . The yaw effect was actually interpreted as a collision with another aircraft on the runway in this <URL> .

How do big planes like 737 manage fresh air for passengers during flight ?
They <URL> hot compressed air from inside the jet engines , cool it down and pass it into the cabin . There are outlet valves in the fuselage that allow stale air out and which control cabin pressure and air-refresh rates . A few aircraft types , such as the 787 , now use a compressor to take in air from under the aircraft . They do this because it can be more fuel-efficient ( not for any other reason ) . It is arguable whether it creates an additional fire hazard . See also <URL> <URL> <URL>
Of course gear doors create drag when open . The question is " how much ? " As you suspect , door drag is not the critical factor here . As usual the answer to your question is aircraft-specific , and your question is pointing to a generalized " old wive 's tale " which is only true sometimes . OK , what is the story behind the story ? <URL> . Watch the main gear as it enters/exits the storage wells in the fuselage . The axles of the wheels are close to parallel to the direction of flight , which means the wheels are being dragged broadside in the slipstream . A very high drag scenario which will affect aircraft performance . The POH recommendation is ( from memory , now ) to climb over critical obstacles on takeoff with the gear down , and raise the gear only when the obstacle is cleared . The attached video shows why . This advice does not pertain to all planes . Know your plane , read the POH . Oh ... and ask questions here !
Dust does damage the blades but the effect is like sand blasting ; it takes some time to cause structural damage . The turbine engines of airliners can take some dust ( by design ) but also get extensive maintenance regularly . And if they do get caught in a dust storm they should get out ASAP and get the engines inspected . The biggest danger dust-wise is volcanic ash as that will adhere to the turbine blades behind the combustion chamber and potentially shut the engine down due to compressor stall . This happened with <URL> where all 4 engines failed . This is why a volcano can <URL> .
In addition to repaints , aircraft are also periodically washed and treated to maintain the paint quality and reduce the build up of dust/grime/salt and other particulates . There are automated systems installed at some airports to clean airplanes as they taxi over these areas . Think of it as a drive through car wash , but for airplanes . The very first applications of these were actually for the US Navy because they have a requirement to wash aircraft due to their proximity to seawater . A company called tammermatic developed a system for the navy to clean airplanes directly on the field using a set of powerful jets . Images from the <URL> <URL> <URL> Then there is the <URL> ( PDF brochure ) , developed by PMW ( a company that makes concrete pumps ) to wash aircraft automatically . It was first used by Lufthansa in 1997 ( image cc : ARNE DEDERT / AFP ) : <URL>
How the Swiss Air pilots got paid would , of course , depend on Swiss Air policy . I suspect pay policies vary greatly between airlines and countries , but for what it 's worth below are the pay policies for the four airlines I worked for in the 1980s and 1990s . At all four I would have been credited with only the time from push back until the parking brake was set on return insofar as flight time was concerned , but as you will see that would n't have made any significant difference in my pay . commuter # 1 no union -- a straight salary but with an hourly addition if your flight time went over a minimum , which it never did . commuter # 2 no union -- a straight salary regardless of the number of hours flown , but they never abused that . 747 freight carrier no union -- a straight salary plus an hourly addition if your flight time went over a minimum , which it occasionally did . 747 passenger carrier in-house union -- flight time hourly pay with a guaranteed minimum . You always went substantially over the minimum . They tried to get you as close as possible to the regulatory max of 1000 hours a year . Additionally , they had a policy that whenever your duty time ( as opposed to flight time ) went over 16 consecutive hours , you got paid for each hour over that at a rate of 1.5 times your regular hourly flight time rate . Also , you were paid half your regular hourly flight rate while deadheading . Then , if you had less than 8 hours ( I might not be remembering that number correctly ) between assignments , your duty time continued . My first assignment for this airline was a 32-hour duty day . I operated from JFK to AMS ( Amsterdam ) , so my duty time started at show time , 2 hours before departure . At Amsterdam 5 hours on the ground then commercialling ( riding in the back on another airline ) to SIN ( Singapore ) and then to CGK ( Jakarta ) positioning for a Hajj flight . Crew scheduling regularly abused pilots , but nobody complained because you were being so well paid when they did abuse you . The breakdown for hours at the flight time rate for that trip was approximately : 7.5 hours operating time JFK-AMS 8 hours deadheading pay AMS-SIN-CGK ( half of 16 hours riding in the back ) 24 hours extended duty pay ( 32 hours duty time minus 16 hour threshold times 1.5 ) So , 39.5 pay hours at the regular new first officer rate of 55 per hour = 2,172.50 , which looked pretty good to me since I had come from a carrier than paid me a straight 4500 per month salary as a 747 captain . I ca n't remember all the flight time/duty time details , but back then at least the international rules were much less restrictive than the domestic rules . Also , back then it was common practice to do things like scheduling a flight for , say , 11:59 for regulatory purposes , when everyone knew it would go slightly over the 12-hour international rule of the time . It may be worth noting here , that the mind-set of the crew , at least the cockpit crew , is totally different from that of passengers . The passenger wants to get from point A to point B , whereas the crew is simply ' at work ' regardless of whether they go anyplace or not . Consequently , at least in my experience and opinion , delays are n't nearly as frustrating to crew as they are to passengers .
Ideally it would not . With increasing Mach number the <URL> of the vertical tail goes up proportional to the Prandtl-Glauert factor $ \ frac { 1 } { \ sqrt { 1-Ma ^ 2 } } $ while the destabilising fuselage as a slender body is mainly unaffected by Mach effects . But that is only theory which assumes a perfectly rigid body . In reality , elasticity decreases the effectivity of the vertical tail . Higher loads lead to higher deformations which in turn decrease the loads and with them the stabilising moments . What happens in detail depends on the structure : A light aircraft will experience decreasing directional stability as dynamic pressure increases . At supersonic speed , fin effectivity is further reduced by the now again decreasing lift curve slope as Mach increases further . Now even the rigid aircraft experiences decreasing directional stability and elasticity will reduce stability further . <URL> Directional stability over Mach , from Ray Whitford 's Fundamentals of Fighter Design
The indicator must be calibrated to read zero when that tank is actually empty of all usable fuel ( in level flight ) . Bouncing is fine as long as they do not bounce when the tank is actually empty . See regs : <URL> <URL>
While I 'm not a pilot , I think it goes along these lines : Airlines typically assume a value for passengers depending on gender and age . This distribution in the cabin will typically be quite random and a little variation does not do any damage . Baggage however is weighed on the scales at check in . Each bag is normally scanned as it is passed onto the plane , so that they know where is bag is located . The values are then passed onto the pilots who are able to work out that the numbers are ok . Sometimes there are preferences to load up bags in a certain way for fuel issues , so this is very important to make sure this is still resonable . These values are then plugged into computers or worked out manually on a paper loadsheet to make sure they are good and within limits . In fact the weight systems you are referring to are quite unusual I think , see <URL> .
Many airlines do in fact have inflight camera feeds for Cabin surveillance so I do not think the question is relevant to most major airlines anymore . For a specific example , Emirates Airline employs the Cabin Video Monitoring Systems ( CVMS ) across its fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft . These Cabin cameras can be accessed by Cockpit crew through the System Display or the Cabin crew through the FAP ( Flight Attendant Panel ) and for any abnormal situation such as a hijacking/hostage situation on ground , the CVMS can be accessed on a laptop via the GSP ( Ground Service Panel ) . Additionally , as mentioned above , they have landscape cameras installed for an external video feed but that is more of a feature for passengers . The advantages of a CVMS in a hijacking/hostage situation such as positioning , identity , body language and weapons of the hijackers plus general operational advantages such as issues during boarding/offloading and other emergency situations such as an evacuation are great and not to be discounted .
The reason for not using full aircraft parachutes can be stitched together by looking at the many related questions . Let me do this for you : Parachutes will only help when something essential fails at <URL> . As paul said <URL> , most accidents happen at take-off and landing where a parachute can not be successfully deployed . Parachutes big enough to slow down a whole airliner will be very heavy , reducing payload and increasing the number of flights to transport the same number of passengers . The biggest parachutes designed so far were for the <URL> , and <URL> gave their mass a 3 x 990 kg plus 550 kg for the drogue chute . Wikipedia gives the mass of one SRB at 91,000 kg . Scale this for the zero-fuel mass of an <URL> of 62,500 kg , and the mass will be approx . 2,500 kg . That is equivalent to 25 passengers , or 16 % of the A-320 's capacity . Adding the parachute will translate into 16 % more flights , just to compensate for parachute mass . This is most likely underestimating the true impact because I did not add the mass for structural reinforcements . The opening shock at travel speed would destroy both airplane and chutes . If we want the parachute system to work in as many cases as possible , we need to make deployment possible at up to Mach 0.85 , and then the maximum g-load on aircraft and passengers must not exceed 6 g. ( See <URL> for <URL> which give time - and direction-dependent limits for the maximum deceleration a human being can survive ) . This is possible with staggered deployment of several chutes with increasing size , and by sewing parts of the canopy and the parachute 's strings together , so they can rip apart during opening , which slows the unfolding process . But I expect that this will add to the mass of the parachute system . It will certainly add to the mass of the aircraft 's structure , which is currently limited to <URL> g. By looking at point 2 above alone , it becomes clear that the addition of parachutes will most likely drive up air travel casualties . If we need 16 % more flights to make the cruise part less dangerous , and still <URL> ( which are now 16 % more numerous ) , we gain little . Crashes now involve less passengers , but their number goes up . Tickets will become 20 % more expensive at least ( more if the parachute system costs something , which is very likely ) , and we all know how the majority of passengers votes when faced with a choice of dearer , somewhat safer flights and 20 % cheaper flights at almost the same accident risk .
Essentially they plan on some fraction of the fleet undergoing some sort of maintenance check at any one time , so they build their flying schedule around the remaining fraction . And then there is some amount of flex due to things needing unscheduled maintenance or coming out of maintenance early . What makes the task easier is the fact that maintenance needs can be forecast fairly far in advance , and so the schedules can be built around a knowledge of how many aircraft are likely to be available . As an illustration ( not necessarily representative of any particular airline 's actual numbers ) , let 's say you have a fleet of 200 aircraft , and you know that on average each aircraft will be down for two 2-week heavy maintenance checks each year . That works out to essentially one month out of 12 , each aircraft is down , or a little under 10 % of the time . Add in a little time for shorter maintenance visits ( but still longer than an overnight ) , plus an allowance for the fact that some aircraft just need unscheduled work , and the maintenance planners may end up telling you to plan on 175 aircraft available each day . So that 's what you build your schedule around . Now let 's say that one aircraft takes a birdstrike &amp; an engine needs to be changed . That is now a hole in the schedule . It can be covered by cancelling a flight ( undesirable , but always an option ) . If an aircraft is finished with maintenance ahead of schedule ( say it was scheduled down all day for some work , but the work is actually done by noon ) , that aircraft may be able to be put into service . Perhaps it 's possible to delay some sort of minor maintenance a day ( not a heavy check , but something quicker ) and essentially create one aircraft-day of capacity , and push the check off to a weekend day when the schedule uses fewer aircraft . Or maybe the schedule was built with one or two aircraft available as spares that day . Depending on a variety of factors , spares may or may not be available , or even deliberately built into the schedule at all . Having an A-380 sitting around unused all day is an EXPENSIVE insurance policy against something unforeseen happening , but cancelling a flight on something that big is an expensive event when it happens ! If you operate all out of one giant hub and you know that your fleet of 500 aircraft ( flying 450 lines every day ) is likely to have 2-4 aircraft every day go to the hanger for unexpected maintenance , it 's probably a good financial decision to allocate two or three of those lines as dedicated spares . If your aircraft operate a point-to-point schedule , it 's harder ( or unfeasible ) to keep a spare aircraft at every airport you serve , " just in case " something happens to break there . There are complicated decisions that airlines will continuously evaluate to find what balance works best for their particular operation . In some cases , it may be possible to substitute an aircraft from a different fleet for a broken jet ... an MD80 goes to the hanger , and a 737 with a reserve crew flies the rest of the day that the MD80 would have flown . Or maybe a 757 broke , and the decision is to use the 737 to cover the flight , and re-accommodate the extra passengers that the 757 could hold that the 737 now ca n't . That 's a tactical decision that the airline 's operations center will make , considering the availability of both aircraft and crews , as well as the passenger loads . ( They also may pull a " healthy " 757 off of its less full schedule to fly in place of the broke 757 , use a 737 that was n't going to be very full to cover that 757 's route , put an RJ on the 737 's route that day , and cancel the RJ 's flights " due to maintenance . " And if that inconveniences 4 flights of 40-50 people who mostly just get delayed a few hours , that 's probably a better plan than stranding two flights of 200 people who 'd otherwise have no way to get where they 're going until tomorrow or later . )
There are a lot of things that go into determining the most efficient way to operate a jet , and minimizing fuel does not always make it cheaper to operate . Some general " rules " that are used are : There is an optimum speed to fly the airplane , which depends on several factors : Altitude Fuel savings by flying slower - vs - increased maintenance costs because you are taking longer to get there ( and putting more time on the airframe/engines ) . Temperature at cruising altitude Winds at cruising altitude There is also an optimum altitude to fly the airplane : Aircraft weight The higher that you can fly , the better - until you do n't have enough power to maintain your optimum speed at the optimum power setting for the engines . Temperature at cruising altitude Winds at cruising altitude Altitudes that are available from ATC The amount of fuel and time that it takes to climb - vs - the amount of time that you will have at the high speed cruise Anything that makes the airplane heavier makes it unable to climb as high ( and lowers the optimum altitude for the current conditions ) , and makes it burn more fuel . This includes the fuel itself . Assuming a constant speed and constant weather conditions , you will always be more fuel efficient later in the flight . As fuel gets burned off , the amount of thrust required to maintain the optimum speed goes down and the optimum altitude goes up . Basically , we keep reducing the power to maintain speed until the optimum altitude increases to an altitude that ATC can let us climb to . This is known as a step climb . The speed will be controlled manually by the pilot , or can be controlled automatically by auto throttles . Today 's sophisticated flight planning software takes all of this into account and gives the pilot a very good plan on how to operate the airplane to be the most efficient !
Excerpt from <URL> Early in the preliminary design effort , Boeing had taken a careful look at the in service performance and accident history of previous airplane designs . The conclusions were interesting : In flight troubleshooting sometimes led to more serious problems , occasionally jeopardizing the safety of the flight . The flight engineer 's intense focus on systems problems often distracted one or both of the pilots , sometimes resulting in no one " flying the airplane . " Jet engine reliability was much higher than piston engines and they required little or no in flight troubleshooting or adjustment . Certain high workload periods during departure and arrival left little time for outside watch nor much time for handling abnormal events . In support of industry work to establish rational external vision requirements for transport airplanes , Boeing developed a computer model that determined the relative collision threat value of the visual space around the aircraft . Because airplanes are in motion and at a positive angle of attack , the computer model showed that the collision threat is concentrated generally forward and below the longitudinal axis of the airplane . In response to these findings the design team took a different approach to the 737 flight deck : A concerted effort would be made to simplify systems designs to increase reliability and to eliminate or greatly reduce the need for in flight trouble shooting . A Flight Deck design group would participate in all flight deck design decisions and would have considerable authority in the design of controls , indicators , and operating concepts across all airplane systems . Workload assessment would be used as an integral element of design to adjust functionality and location of equipment and controls . Operating procedures would be simplified and shortened to reduce distractions and provide ample time for outside watch . The autopilot would be improved to better support operations in the terminal area not just in cruise . The pilot 's stations would be designed to maximize external vision in the primary collision threat zone . So it seems that a lot of the changes that facilitated the movement to a 2-crew flight deck were procedural ones rather than engineering challenges . Jet engines by that time did n't require constant attention and adjustments . It seems that this movement towards a reduced cockpit count was the result of " too many cooks in the kitchen " , and while not explicitly mentioned it seems like <URL> was a driving factor ( Edit : or at least they wanted to prevent something like that , turns out EA401 did n't happen until 1972 when the 737 was introduced in 1968 ) . I 'm guessing though that this wo n't completely answer what you are looking for , I 'm sure you 'd want to see the specific input that the " Flight Deck Design Group " offered for the placement of controls and indicators . I guess one way of figuring this out would be to compare the cockpit layout of the 727 and 737 , as far as I can find , those design decisions are n't published .
Short answer : Yes . But only for a moment . As you suggest , let 's focus on the 90 ° case , because many things will become simpler . Intermediate climb angles can be covered by a linear superposition of horizontal and vertical flight . Now we shoot up at 90 ° flight path angle ( engine thrust permitting ) and leave some angle of attack for the wing to create lift . Lift acts orthogonally to the local flow direction , so the lift will pull the aircraft sideways ( up in the aircraft 's frame of reference ) . Since there is no other force which will oppose this lift ( drag , weight and thrust all act at 90 ° to the lift , parallel to the flight path ) , the aircraft will accelerate sideways ( again , up in the aircraft 's frame of reference ) . The angle of attack will immediately decrease and lift creation will stop -- or the pilot forces the angle of attack to stay constant by pulling the elevator , and now the aircraft will further increase its flight path angle . That is a complicated way of saying that the pilot forces the airplane into a loop . If he wants to maintain this 90 ° flight path angle , he better avoid creating any lift .
Unfortunately , at least in the US , the regulations do n't stipulate that you do anything . Airline policy is a different matter , and one which I can not speak to , as it will be different in every case . I can provide some background and my own take on this , but it 's hard to have one exact answer ( what if you 're wrong ? ) . FAA regulations rely on pilots self-regulating . If a pilot drinks within an 8 hour ( or , as is often policy for airlines , 12 hour ) window prior to the flight , they are required to remove themselves from that flight . If they do not take this action , somebody else must . Often , this person is the First Officer , a junior pilot who has years of flying with pilots who might come to view them as untrustworthy . Perhaps this can help explain why it 's such a difficult action to take . This is a difficult topic , and one which regularly comes up during airline flight training . That said , the courses I took that discussed this scenario essentially landed on a couple of steps ( this was years ago , this is probably a bit rusty ) : Confront the pilot . Ask them if they 've been drinking in the last X hours . If they claim they have not been , or they push back : Attempt to explain to them the situation they 're putting their career ( and you ) in ; Try to get them to remove themselves from the flight and contact a union representative . Beyond that , I do n't want to make suggestions . Getting them to talk to the union they are a member of is probably a wise idea , as they can offer possible solutions or arrange treatment if the pilot has alcohol abuse problems ( which is not a huge stretch , if they 're showing up to work reeking of booze ) . <URL> has a blog post that discusses some similar scenarios .
No . The dihedral effect depends on a flow asymmetry between left and right wing . Coordinated flight means that both wings have the same flow conditions , and the only asymmetry between both is caused by control deflections . You do have a flow asymmetry during a turn ( coordinated or not ) from the speed difference between the inner and the outer wing which grows with the turn rate and wing span . This does indeed cause more lift on the outer wing , but due to the difference in dynamic pressure , not due to dihedral . Since dihedral causes a side force component of lift , you can argue that the outer wing creates more side force which pushes the plane into the turn . But the pilot will compensate the difference in dynamic pressure with the ailerons to stop any rolling motion once the desired turn rate is stabilized . This will also equal the lift on both wings . Another asymmetry is caused by the location of the vertical tail aft of the center of gravity . Essentially , the tail swings around during the turn , which causes a sideslip condition at the vertical tail . The result is a side force which grows with turn rate and tail lever arm , and due to the high location of most vertical tails also causes a small rolling moment . But again the wing 's dihedral has nothing to do with that . Dihedral only comes into play if you build up a sideslip , and then the turn is not coordinated any longer . @Zeus is right with his point that dihedral stabilizes the aircraft and makes it easier to keep the turn a coordinated one . Now we can split hairs all day if flying in turbulence makes a perfectly coordinated turn impossible . When it comes to dynamic stability , a <URL> is highly recommended .
A single engine plane can suffer from control problems due to torque . An early famous example was the <URL> As others have pointed out , torque effects have to be countered using the normal aerodynamic controls available to the pilot . Some aircraft had extra-large ailerons because of this issue . <URL>

Only the <URL> ( a <URL> <URL> ) could be used in a practical manner ( not publicly available in France nor likely in many other countries ) . Circadian rhythm What you are referring to has got the scientific name of circadian rhythm ( circa = around , diēs = day ) , which is the subject of an article at SkyBrary : <URL> . About the night flights : Night operations create a host of problems for flight crews . The primary problem is having to work efficiently and safely at a point in time when the work requirements are not in synchrony with circadian rhythms . Under worst-case conditions , crew members must perform demanding tasks during the early morning hours ( 2 am to 6 am ) when their biological functions and performance efficiency are at their lowest level . This problem can not be quickly solved by adaptation of the biological clock . Complete adjustment to night work requires at least 21 night shifts in a row with no days off . Adjustment of the biological clock does not even commence until about 10 days after a shift change . Fatigue Long article about <URL> , about zaleplon : This misalignment of the sleep/wake cycle and endogenous circadian rhythms could be the result of shift lag , jet lag , or attempting sleep at other than the habitual bedtime or at the second circadian dip in the afternoon . For such circumstances , the U.S. Air Force and Army have approved the limited use of temazepam , zolpidem , and zaleplon . These hypnotics can optimize the quality of crew rest in circumstances where sleep is possible , but difficult to obtain . Inflight rest As additional information about sleep management inflight : On a 8-hour flight , usually there will be 3 pilots , and each one will be able to sleep ( outside the flight deck ) .

All multi-engine airplanes , whether jet or prop driven have separate throttle controls for each engine . There are good reasons for this : If there is a problem with one engine you can separately control it for troubleshooting purposes If one engine is n't developing the right amount of power you can independently increase the other engine ( s ) to compensate If you have a control failure of some kind you can use differential thrust to steer the airplane , this has been done more than once , the example that comes immediately to mind is <URL>

What causes the average speed difference between the JFK to DEN flights and the JFK to LAX flights ?
There is certainly a difference , but most of it definitely has a good explanation . Most of it is overhead such as taxi time that applies to both flights ( almost ) equally . This has a relative big impact on short flights . The taxi out time for both flights will be about <URL> is not exactly known for its quiet taxiways . Both flights will add about 30 nautical mile for their departure route . Both flights will fly approximately great circle routes , probably less than 2 % extra distance during cruise . The LAX flight will typically do a straight in arrival , almost no extra distance there . The DEN flight will typically do a full arrival , 30 NM extra distance there . The taxi in at <URL> on average , and <URL> . Let 's assume that both aircraft fly 460 knot true airspeed with 20 knots headwind during cruise , so 440 knots ground speed . My estimates for the total flight times are then : JFK-LAX GC distance 2150 n.m Departure detour 30 n.m Arrival detour 0 n.m ( straight in ) Cruise detour 25 n.m Total distance 2205 n.m Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 2085 n.m. @ 440 kts = 4 hour 44 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 12 minutes Total time : 5h50 minutes Margin : 10 minutes JFK-DEN GC distance 1400 n.m.

Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 1355 n.m. @ 440 kts = 3 hour 05 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 9 minutes Total time : 4h07 minutes Margin : 33 minutes
The speed indicator in the cockpit shows indicated airspeed . Indicated airspeed is usually different than GPS speed , due to wind and aerodynamic effects . GPS speed is your speed with respect to the ground . If you are standing on terra firma it reads 0 . If it reads 100 knots you will be 100NM away from where you are now in one hour , so long as you keep flying in a straight line . Airspeed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding air . So if you are standing on terra firma with 20 knots wind blowing in your face , your airspeed will be 20 knots . If you travel at 100 knots airspeed against a 20 knots headwind wind , your ground speed is 80 knots . If you do 100 knots airspeed with 20 knots tailwind , your GPS speed reads 120 knots . But even in calm wind conditions the airspeed indicator will read differently than the GPS speed . This has to do with the way airspeed is measured . Airspeed is measured with a pitot tube . A pitot tube has two pressure measurement ports . One that measures the total pressure $ P_t $ . This port is facing the incoming airflow . The other measures the static pressure $ P$ and is placed perpendicular to the airflow . The difference between the two pressures is called impact pressure ( pressure rise do to the airflow impacting the pitot tube ) and is denoted $ q_c $ . The impact pressure is related to the speed of the airflow the pitot tube is exposed to . If the flow is considered incompressible ( which is an acceptable approximation for speeds up to 200 knots ) the impact pressure can be derived from Bernouilli 's equation . $ q_c = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ rho V ^ 2 $ $ q_c $ is the impact pressure in Pa $ \ rho $ is the density in kg/m3 $ V$ is the true airspeed in m/s The airspeed indicator is calibrated for standard sea level conditions , where $ \ rho $ is 1.225 kg/m3 . In reality the aircraft will fly at altitude and therefor the actual density of the air is lower . Therefor the indicated airspeed will be lower as well . For example if an aircraft flies 75 m/s ( about 146 knots ) at 6000 ft the density will be 1.02393 kg/m3 . $ q_c = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } 1.02393 \ cdot 75 ^ 2 = 2879.8 \ textrm { Pa } $ The equivalent airspeed at sea level for the same $ q_c $ is : $ V _ { EAS } = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 q_c } { \ rho_0 } } = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 \ cdot 2879.8 } { 1.225 } } = 68.6 \ textrm { m/s } $ Your airspeed indicator will read only 68.6 m/s ( 133 knots ) despite the fact that you are moving with 75 m/s ( 146 knots ) with respect to the air . Conversion of true airspeed to the equivalent airspeed can be done directly by : $ V _ { EAS } = V \ cdot \ sqrt { \ frac { \ rho } { \ rho_0 } } $ $ V _ { EAS } $ equivalent airspeed ( m/s ) $ V$ true airspeed ( m/s ) $ \ rho $ actual air density ( kg/m3 ) . $ \ rho_0 $ density at standard sea level conditions ( 1.225 kg/m3 ) The effects of the lower density on your aispeed indicator become more pronounced the higher you go . Once you go faster than about 100 m/s true airspeed the effects of compressibility can no longer be ignored and the above no longer applies . Airspeed indicators are corrected for effects of compressibility and therefore do n't use the equivalent airspeed but instead use calibrated airspeed for calibration . $ V _ { CAS } = a _ { 0 } \ sqrt { 5 \ left [ \ left ( \ frac { q_c } { P _ { 0 } } +1 \ right ) ^ \ frac { 2 } { 7 } -1 \ right ] } $ $ V _ { CAS } $ is calibrated airspeed $ a _ { 0 } $ is the speed of sound under standard sea level conditions ( 340.3 m/s ) $ P_0 $ is the static air pressure under standard sea level conditions ( 101325 Pa ) $ { q_c } $ is the impact pressure The impact pressure is also a bit more complex for compressible flow : $ \ ; q_c = P \ left [ \ left ( 1 +0.2 M ^ 2 \ right ) ^ \ tfrac { 7 } { 2 } -1 \ right ] $ $ P$ the static pressure $ M$ the Mach number Effectively , the higher and faster you get , the greater the difference between the indicated airspeed and the true airspeed . For example , Mach 0.8 at 40000 ft in no wind will result in a GPS speed of 489 knots , but a calibrated airspeed of only 242 knots , which is less than half . Therefore at high altitudes and speeds , the indicated airspeed will be lower than the ground speed / GPS speed , unless you have extreme headwind .
As you measure temperature moving at high velocities , your outside thermometer will measure a higher temp than what is actually outside ( what a non-moving thermometer would get ) . That 's because as the air rams into your thermometer it gets a little bit compressed , and that makes it heat up a little bit . Amazingly , some smart people have even calculated how much that " ram rise " is , and you can actually compensate ( well , in theory ) from the indicated temperature to calculate what the actual outside air temp is : $ $ Ram ~ Rise = SAT \ times0 .2 \ times { M } ^ 2 $ $ Where $ SAT$ is Static Air Temperature in Kelvin , $ M$ is Mach number Problem is , not all instruments will compress that air in the same way , and not all of them will pick up this Ram Rise entirely . So they will publish a $ K$ , a ram-rise-coefficient ( also called recovery factor ) meaning how much of from the theoretical Ram Rise they actually pick up . ( OAT/SAT ) Static Air Temperature = noted as $ T_S $ , actual temperature of the air outside , the same your thermometer will pick up if you were not moving ( say , in a balloon ? ) ( RAT ) Ram Air Temperature = noted as $ T_M $ , actual measured temperature by your instrument . $ $ RAT = SAT + k \ times { Ram ~ Rise } $ $ ( TAT ) Total Air Temperature = noted as $ T_T $ , total temperature as measured by an instrument with $ K$ - coefficient of $ 1 $ . $ $ TAT = SAT+R am ~ Rise $ $

A quick check of a site like Flightradar24 will show that the area is not overly avoided . The triangle between the southern tip of Florida , Bermuda , and Puerto Rico has quite a bit of traffic . The southern part is a busy route from Florida to Puerto Rico and other areas in the Caribbean . The rest is also part of routes from the east coast to the Caribbean and South America . While the idea of an area causing mysterious disappearances is understandably popular , <URL> that the area has not been significantly more dangerous than other areas in the world . As noted , it 's an important route between Florida and the Caribbean , and one would expect lots of traffic in this area , and therefore lots of incidents . While navigation issues were once a not-infrequent cause of air incidents , modern technology has made this sort of thing much more rare . Airline flights are monitored by ATC . Anomalies in either magnetic bearings or radio aids such as VOR or GPS are routinely surveyed and listed on navigation charts . I took a quick look and nothing seemed to stand out here . Weather forecasting has also become much more helpful with the usage of long range weather radar and weather satellites . A look at <URL> shows most incidents were in the 1960s or earlier . The few recent air incidents seem to be nothing out of the ordinary . General aviation accidents are fairly common ( flying into a level 6 thunderstorm also not advised ) , and airliners divert due to technical issues <URL> . While some people may have apprehensions about the area , this concern does n't seem to be supported by a higher than normal rate of incidents and the area is routinely traveled by both ships and aircraft . <URL> From <URL> Do n't worry about that question mark , I 'm sure it 's totally routine , nothing to see here
Reversible is when there is a direct linkage from controls to control surfaces . For example the cable linkages in a light aircraft up to an MD-80 . Irreversible is when there is a hydraulic power control unit in the way , it can be mechanical or fly-by-wire . And such controls would sometimes need an artificial feel system to relay how much force is being applied . It is found in airplanes that can not be steered by just muscles . A good way to picture it , is what happens if you move an aileron by hand , would the yoke turn as a result or no . Superman might be needed for a 747 's rudder , but still , the rudder pedals wo n't budge . More information <URL> and <URL> . <URL> Source : <URL> Photo shows an unpowered rudder that was swung by the wind , in the cockpit the rudder pedals would show the neutral position , hence irreversible .
Flaps are at the back of the wing , slats are at the front . Easy ! :) If you want it more technical : They both help to generate more lift . See these diagrams with angle of attack and lift coefficient : <URL> <URL> As the lift coefficient is inversely proportional to the minimum airspeed , a higher CL will allow a lower Vmin .
Aeroscraft is their brand name . It does not mean anything generally . The general terms are : " Aircraft " ( but not " aerocraft " ) means any machine capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere . " <URL> " is a lighter-then-air aircraft . That is it has large shell filled with gas with lower density than air and uses buoyant force on that for lift . This includes balloons , hot-air or gas filled , tethered balloons and airships . " <URL> " , or " dirigible " is an aerostat equipped with propulsion that allows it to move on it 's own ( as opposed to balloons that are tethered or carried by wind ) .
The context of your question is a bit unclear , but assuming that you 're asking about navigation waypoints in the US then you 're probably referring to these terms as <URL> in the FAA 's Pilot/Controller Glossary : FLY-BY WAYPOINT - A fly-by waypoint requires the use of turn anticipation to avoid overshoot of the next flight segment . FLY-OVER WAYPOINT - A fly-over waypoint precludes any turn until the waypoint is overflown and is followed by an intercept maneuver of the next flight segment . As per the comments , I have never heard of a " short turn " waypoint and it is n't in the P/CG .
Yes , it is , at least for small pitch angles and low thrust . Here is how : $ $ L = m \ cdot g \ cdot n_z \ cdot \ cos \ gamma $ $ If thrust or pitch attitude become significant , you need to modify $ m \ cdot g $ by the vertical thrust component . Then the answer must be no , because the thrust information is missing : $ $ L = \ left ( m \ cdot g - T \ cdot \ sin ( \ Theta + \ sigma ) \ right ) \ cdot n_z \ cdot \ cos \ gamma $ $ $ L \ :\ :\ : $ lift $ m \ :\ : $ mass $ g \ :\ :\ : $ gravitational acceleration $ n_z \ :\ : $ load factor ( = 1 in horizontal , unaccelerated flight ) $ \ gamma \ :\ :\ : $ flight path angle , with $ \ gamma = asin \ left ( \ frac { v_z } { v } \ right ) $ $ v_z \ :\ : $ vertical speed $ v \ :\ :\ : $ flight speed ( TAS ) $ T \ :\ : $ Thrust $ \ Theta \ :\ : $ pitch angle ( up is positive ) $ \ sigma \ :\ : $ thrust angle relative to airframe 's x axis Note that the altitude is only needed if you use the <URL> .

The difference is in the minimum control speeds ( $ V _ { mcg } $ and $ V _ { mca } $ ) . In Assumed Temperature takeoff thrust , the pilots are allowed to advance the thrust levers to full rated takeoff thrust . However , in Derated takeoff thrust , the levers should not be increased beyond the fixed decate limit , otherwise a engine failure may result in loss of directional control . From Boeing 737 FCTM ( my emphasis ) : The fixed derate is considered a limitation for takeoff . Takeoff speeds consider ground and in-air minimum control speeds ( VMCG and VMCA ) at the fixed derate level of thrust . Thrust levers should not be advanced beyond the fixed derate limit unless conditions are encountered during the takeoff where additional thrust is needed on both engines , such as windshear . A thrust increase , following an engine failure could result in loss of directional control . The minimum control speeds are calculated based on the full rated takeoff thrust . The rated thrust is lowered in Derated takeoff but not in Assumed Temperature takeoff . Therefore , by calculating the minimum speeds based on a lower engine rating , the pilots can be ensured that sufficient directional control can be maintained on a slippery runway , whereas there is no such guarantee for Assumed Temperature takeoff . On a dry and long runway , there is no operational difference between Assumed Temperature and Derated takeoff . From the Boeing 777 FCTM ( my emphasis ) : Reduced takeoff thrust ( ATM ) may be used for takeoff on a wet runway if approved takeoff performance data for a wet runway is used . However , reduced takeoff thrust ( ATM ) is not permitted for takeoff on a runway contaminated with standing water , slush , snow , or ice . And : Derated takeoff thrust ( fixed derate ) may be used for takeoff on a wet runway and on a runway contaminated with standing water , slush , snow , or ice . The Boeing 737 FCTM has a nearly identical description . The A330/A340 FCTM explains that the slower $ V _ { mcg } $ / $ V_1 $ can also allow increased MTOW on short runways : When taking off from short or contaminated runways where ASDA [ Accelerate-Stop Distance Available ] is the limiting factor , a reduction in the minimum control speeds may generate a take-off performance benefit and a higher MTOW .
Thanks to mins 's link , the <URL> explains everything in detail . To summarise the particular part I was asking about : FG on its own means fog ( visibility < 1000 m ) covers more than half of the horizon PRFG and BCFG are fog covering less than half of the horizon PRFG ( fog bank ) is more extensive than BCFG ( fog patches ) Another way of looking at it is like cloud cover descriptors . FG is like BKN or OVC : more than half the horizon is covered . PRFG is SCT , and then BCFG is FEW . All the above are used when the temperature is above freezing point and the fog reaches more than 2 metres above ground . If the fog is only below 2 metres agl , it 's shallow fog MIFG instead . If the temperature is below freezing , so the fog consists of supercooled water droplets , it 's freezing fog FZFG .
Any body moving in a fluid experiences pressure forces over its surface . The concepts of center of pressure , aerodynamics center and neutral point are useful in understanding the effects of these forces . Let 's take an airfoil moving in air with subsonic flow attached to the body . Center of Pressure The center of pressure is the point where the total sum of a pressure field acts on a body . In aerospace , this is the point on the airfoil ( or wing ) where the resultant vector ( of lift and drag ) acts . <URL> Source : avstop.com As the airfoil angle of attack changes , the pressure field changes . Due to this , the center of pressure changes with variation in the angle of attack . In the airplane 's normal range of flight attitudes , if the angle of attack is increased , the center of pressure moves forward ; and if decreased , it moves rearward . <URL> Source : www.flightlearnings.com As the center of gravity ( the point where the weight of the body acts ) is fixed , this movement of center of pressure affects the stability of the aircraft . Aerodynamic Center The resultant ( or the pressure forces ) also cause a moment on the airfoil . As the angle of attack increases , the pitching moment at a point ( for example , the center of gravity ) also changes . However , the pitching moment remains constant at a particular point , which is called the aerodynamic center . <URL> Source : www.theairlinepilots.com For symmetric airfoils in subsonic flight the aerodynamic center is located approximately 25 % of the chord from the leading edge of the airfoil . This point is described as the quarter-chord point . Thus the aerodynamic center does not change with variation in angle of attack . Due to this , the aerodynamic center , rather than the center of pressure is used in the analysis of longitudinal stability . Neutral Point Consider the whole aircraft . The lift of the wing acting through the center of pressure is in front of the center of gravity of the aircraft . This causes a destabilizing motion ( increase in lift to increase in angle of attack causes a nose up moment , further increasing angle of attack ) . This is counteracted by the moment produced by the lift of the horizontal stabilizer ( which is a small wing ) , acting behind the center of gravity . <URL> " <URL> " by User_A1 - SVG derivative of Public Domain work by G J Vigurs . Licensed under GFDL via <URL> . As the center of gravity is moved forward , the stability of the aircraft increases ( as the main wing lift arm is reduced ) and the aircraft is statically stable . <URL> Source : quest.arc.nasa.gov As the center of gravity is moved aft , the main wing lift moment arm increases and the aircraft stability decreases . The aircraft is said to be statically unstable . <URL> Source : quest.arc.nasa.gov As the aircraft is stable when center of gravity is in the nose and unstable when center of gravity is in the tail , there is a position in the middle where the aircraft is neither stable nor unstable i.e the stability is neutral . This point is called the neutral point . The neutral point is fixed for a particular aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft . <URL> Source : quest.arc.nasa.gov Thus , Center of pressure of an aircraft is the point where the Lift acts . Aerodynamic center is the point in the wing where the pitching moments are constant . Neutral point it the location of center of gravity where the aircraft is neutrally stable
A shortcut is a deviation from the filed flightplan given to an aircraft by ATC during the flight , if traffic and other factors permit . A flight crew can not expect to get any shortcuts , so they can not plan for it . Routes in the RAD are flightplannable routes . If a direct route is available in the RAD , it can be used when filing the flightplan , prior to the flight . This allows airlines to plan for the shorter route , thus allowing them to bring less fuel and advertise a shorter flight time .
Another Airbus <URL> mentions ( on page 188 , section 5-2-1 ) full load of A380 as and rate of loading and unloading as From this calculation best case is they can finish unloading and loading within just above 30 minutes . However this is not possible since there will be some delay due to the fact that there are other things to be done during turn around that may disrupt exchange of cargo . Also other services such as cleaning need to be done during turn around time . Airbus provides 2 scenarios for turn around time - 90 minutes if both decks are serviced at the same time . - 140 minutes if both decks are serviced only from the main deck .
Both engines use a turbine for power . This is where the " turbo " part of the name comes from . In a turbine engine , air is compressed and then fuel is ignited in this compressed air . The energy produced by the ignition turns the turbine . The turbine is then able to drive both the compressor at the front of the engine and also some useful load . In airplanes , it produces thrust . The first jet engine was a turbojet . This is a simple turbine engine that produces all of its thrust from the exhaust from the turbine section . However , because all of the air is passing through the whole turbine , all of it must burn fuel . This means it is inefficient , and the solution is the turbofan . In a turbofan , the turbine primarily drives a fan at the front of the engine . Most engines drive the fan directly from the turbine . There are usually at least two separate shafts to allow the fan to spin slower than the inner core of the engine . The fan is surrounded by a cowl which guides the air to and from the fan . Part of the air enters the turbine section of the engine , and the rest is bypassed around the engine . In high-bypass engines , most of the air only goes through the fan and bypasses the rest of the engine and providing most of the thrust . In a turboprop , the turbine primarily drives a propeller at the front of the engine . There is no cowl around the prop . Some air enters the turbine , the rest does not . The propeller is geared to allow it to spin slower than the turbine . Although this diagram shows only a single shaft , many turboprops have two , with a high pressure shaft driving the compressor and a low pressure shaft driving the propeller . Some engines such as the popular <URL> also reverse the flow direction multiple times . Turboprops are more efficient at lower speeds since the prop can move much more air with a smaller turbine than the fan on a turbofan engine . The cowl around the turbofan 's large fan allows it to perform better than an open propeller at high speeds , but limits the practical size of the fan . At supersonic speeds , turbojets have more of a performance benefit . They develop all of their thrust from the high velocity turbine exhaust , while turbofans supplement that with the lower velocity air from the fan . Since the air from the fan is also not compressed nearly as much as the core turbine flow , it is also harder to prevent the flow from going supersonic and causing losses . The Concorde used turbojets because it was designed to cruise for long periods at supersonic speeds . Modern fighter jet engines are turbofans , which provide a compromise between efficiency and speed . There are other benefits and drawbacks between turbojets , turbofans , and turboprops , but I think they are beyond the scope of this question . Work has been done on creating a " propfan " engine , in an attempt to get the efficiency of a turboprop and the speed of a turbofan . They have yet to come up with a viable design . Elsewhere in aviation , turbine engines are used in helicopters , as a <URL> driving the rotors instead of a propeller , and with a freewheeling clutch to enable autorotations <URL> s in jet aircraft and large turboprop aircraft Turbines also find use outside of aviation in power plants ( to generate electricity ) , and even vehicles ( like the Abrams tank ) . Turbocharged piston engines use a turbine much differently from the examples above . Instead of being the primary power source , the turbine only assists the piston engine . A turbocharger uses a turbine to compress air sent to the engine intake . The increased compression helps the engine generate more power . The turbine of a turbocharger is driven by engine exhaust gasses , and a supercharger is similar but is directly powered by the engine . See the <URL> for more detail .
If you know the pressure coefficient of the flow , the rest is easy . The equation for the pressure coefficient $ c_p $ is : $ $ c_p = \ frac { p - p _ { \ infty } } { q _ { \ infty } } = 1 - \ left ( \ frac { v } { v _ { \ infty } } \ right ) ^ 2 $ $ $ q _ { \ infty } $ is the dynamic pressure and contains air density $ \ rho $ and the flight speed $ v _ { \ infty } $ : $ $ q _ { \ infty } = \ frac { \ rho } { 2 } \ cdot v _ { \ infty } ^ 2 $ $ The equation for the local speed , relative to flight speed , is : $ $ \ frac { v } { v _ { \ infty } } = \ sqrt { 1 - \ frac { p - p _ { \ infty } } { q _ { \ infty } } } = \ sqrt { 1 - c_p } $ $ Now you need to know the pressure coefficient . At Mach 0.85 the local Mach number of the 747 wing , which has a wing sweep of 37.5 ° , is 0.674 . Since I do not have the airfoil of the 747-400 , I used one from the same family ( BACJ ) , found <URL> . If you are interested , many more can be found in Michael Selig 's <URL> . The plot is from a <URL> calculation of the 2D flow around BACJ at Mach 0.8 , so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt . Note that it shows a stagnation point , and , therefore , Mach = 0 at the leading edge . The leading edge of the 747 wing is swept by 45 ° , so it will only slow the orthogonal speed component to zero . Consequently , the 747 wing has a stagnation line where the lowest speed will still be Mach 0.6 . On the suction side , the airfoil reaches Mach = 1.2 quickly and even Mach 1.3 near the trailing edge . Modern , so called <URL> s can tolerate mildly supersonic speeds on their suction side , and the Boeing 747-400 makes use of them . However , since the wing sweep reduces Mach effects , the top speed will be Mach 1.2 or slightly lower , and the TSFOIL calculation shown here is not exactly correct for flight at Mach 0.85 , but gives a general idea what happens on the wing . To answer the many questions you posted directly : The shape of the airfoil is immensely important . Thicker airfoils need to displace more air , and higher flow speeds are created on both sides . Camber will increase the pressure ( and speed ) difference between both sides . Changing the angle of attack will add a roughly triangular difference , which is highest at the leading edge , to the difference between both sides . Lower side pressure is increased slightly , and upper side suction goes up by a lot at the nose . Good wing designs have a triangular lift distribution over wing span , with the highest lift at the root . Since the displacement effect of the fuselage is added to the flow effects , the highest speeds will be encountered at the wing root . Just look at the pretty pictures ...
An exploding tire while the plane is rolling will propel debris in various directions . This happened with the <URL> on takeoff . A chunk of the tire hit the tanks and caused a punctured in it . This then lead to the fire and loss of power .
RFL is Requested Flight Level , ECL is the En-Route Cruise Level . RFL the cruising flight level that has been requested by the flight plan or by the pilots , ECL is the level which has been actually assigned by the controller . The two may be the same or they may be different . From the <URL> , page 33 2.3.2 Enroute Cruising Level ( ECL ) ( 3.3.2 ) Domain Knowledge : The ECL is a notional level that , in the absence of constraints , equates to the RFL . In the case where a flight is not permitted to cruise at its RFL for any or a part of its route , due to the presence of a strategic constraint ( level limit ) which applies to flights between the aerodromes of departure and destination , the ECL will be limited to the level defined by the constraint . The ECL may also be changed by instruction from ATC where the flight is to maintain a different cruising level , typically due to the proximity of a flight at the RFL on the same route . As with the RFL , the ECL can be changed for different segments of the route and , if different in the cruise phase , is changed to the XFL on passing the sector boundary . The notion of ECL ceases to exist after the final TOD from cruising level . This is a complicated way of saying the requested flight level is usually assigned unless there 's a good reason for the controller not to ( to avoid potential conflicts for example ) , and the pilots can request a different flight level en route .
Modern Air Combat Maneuvering takes place between about 350 to 600 KIAS ; There is no specific speed but each aircraft has a specific optimal cornering velocity which gives it the greatest rate of turn in order to maximize its maneuverability . Pilots will seek to maintain this speed when entering a merge as it can give them the greatest maneuvering advantage in order to turn inside on opponent or for jinking to evade a cannon or a missile shot . As an example , the Lockheed Martin Block 50/52 F-16C has a cornering velocity of 420 KIAS . Traditionally air combat has been about energy management . Fighter pilots have something in common with economists in that they are engaged in the art of managing the flow of currency ; in the case of the pilot that currency is energy and not money . The total energy state of a fighter is : current energy state = energy in - energy out . The current energy state is the sum of the kinetic energy , proportional to the square of the velocity of the jet and the potential energy of the jet , which is proportional to its height above the ground . Energy leaves the system in the form of parasite and induced drag acting over a distance as well as loss of altitude , which is proportional to the flat plate area of the jet , load factor , AoA , etc. . Energy enters the system at a rate proportional to the amount of jet fuel burned ; this supply is limited to the fuel onboard which again affects the mass of the jet , the induced drag , etc. . So keeping this in mind , a good fighter pilot will seek a way in which he/she can maneuver through space , gaining the best speed and turning performance for the least amount of energy consumed , in order to land in an advantageous position to employ the weapons against an enemy jet . These kinds of speeds vary between if the jet is on the offensive or defensive in relation to a threat . So a pilot maintaining that optimal energy state is in the best position to attack , or defend against an attack , and a pilot in a very low energy state is very vulnerable - " low and slow , you 're outta dough " - and could be quickly killed in a multi-jet furball . The cornering velocity is preferred for this reason if maneuvering is anticipated ( a given if the jet is about to enter a merge ) . With the advent of terminal homing , beyond visual range missiles allowing pilots to stand off from the fight and shoot a threat before it could get close enough to turn with them , higher speed cruise , along with a capability to maneuver well at those higher speeds has become an advantage . It allows a pilot to more quickly close with an enemy aircraft into the missile 's ' no escape ' zone , fire , and then turn and dash from the threat , minimizing their presence in an enemy 's ' no escape ' zone whereby enemy missiles simple do n't have the available energy to catch you . This was the basis for supercruise - supersonic cruise without the use of afterbruners - on the ATF / F-22 program . Combined with good frontal stealth to minimize the detection range by enemy fighters , supercruise could give a Raptor jock a major advantage in the BVR areana - near invincibility in BVR engagements against non stealthy fighters , if the published results of the Red Flag and other military exercises are to be believed .

Are the aircraft used for the A380 display ready to be delivered to airlines ?
In all cases the answer is yes , those aircraft were all outfitted with seats , and at least very close to being ready for delivery to the customer . Installing interiors and seats is a regular part of the production process , and it 's unlikely that the plane would be pulled from the line before seats are installed , and worked back in later . From looking at <URL> , these aircraft all had about 7 months between rollout and delivery , with the air show appearance happening within a month of delivery . Also , the aircraft are used as static displays while not flying , allowing people to walk through and see the interior . In 2011 , the Korean Air A380 <URL> . It was delivered in the middle of July . In 2012 , the Malaysian A380 <URL> . It was delivered at the end of July . In 2013 , the British Airways A380 probably had seats installed . I ca n't find any pictures of the inside , but it was delivered shortly after <URL> . Airbus also tends to bring a flight test A380 like MSN001 ( first to fly , registered F-WWOW ) for display , and has a <URL> . The Korean Air A380 was used for the display in 2011 after the flight test plane MSN004 had a <URL> .
The published Maximum Operating Mach number ( MMO ) for the B747 is Mach 0.92 but it can sometimes be exceeded accidentally due to aircraft upset . It has been reported that Mach 0.99 was attained during a Boeing test flight in a slight nose down attitude . The A380 has a slower MMO of Mach 0.89 The actual true airspeed of a Mach number will depend on the temperature and altitude but at 35,000 feet Mach 0.92 would be about 530 Knots . ( 610 mph )
Why are n't cell phones allowed ? / What problems to cell phones cause ? Most of these cases apparently originate from a series of <URL> in the 90s which were believe to be caused by electronic gadgets , hence the ban . This was when cell phones appeared , and there was an aggressive ban as a result . NASA has a <URL> which includes some of these and makes for an interesting read . Now however an increasing list of airlines is allowing them again , depending on jurisdiction . FAA is <URL> from a regulatory standpoint . Bear in mind that phones were probably much more powerful back when these rules were introduced . Mythbuster ( episode 6 , 2006 ) did a test on this by sticking in a powerful transmitter into a business jet . Their <URL> gives a slightly different version : It was the FCC , not the FAA , who led the way for this regulation : Explanation : Never mind what the chatterbox in the seat next to you says about cell phones messing with plane navigation -- those metallic birds are built airtight against foreign signals and operate on entirely different frequencies than cell phones . So why all the fuss about phones ? When you make a call at 10,000 feet , the signal bounces off multiple available cell towers , rather than one at a time . That means too many phone-happy jetsetters might clog up the networks on the ground , which is why the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) -- not the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) -- banned cell use on planes . How is using a cell phone in the air different than using it from the ground ? Is it sensible to allow them on aircraft ? To quote one of the above sources : although the FAA recommends that you still switch to airplane mode because you 're not going to get a signal 30,000 feet in the air -- the only hit you 'll take is a dead battery when you land . So it 's probably not a huge loss if you 're flying commercial aircraft at 10,000 meters . In any case , you ca n't expect a service like you do on the ground , unless like Lnafziger says that the aircraft is equipped with a cellular basestation called a <URL> , illustrated below :
If a door is put into armed mode , it will trigger the <URL> when the door is opened . Prior to departure ( usually before engine startup ) , all the aircraft doors are placed into the armed ( or automatic ) mode by the cabin crew . Methods of arming vary from aircraft to aircraft , but ultimately the girt bar ( a metal bar attached to the door end of the slide ) is physically attached to brackets either in or adjacent to the door sill . [ ... ] If a rapid evacuation is required and the doors are opened while " armed " , the opening of the door pulls the slide pack out of the bustle ( because the girt bar is physically attached to the aircraft floor ) This is also the reason for the famous <URL> : DOORS TO ARRIVAL AND CROSSCHECK " Flight attendants , doors to arrival and crosscheck . " Meaning : Occasionally heard as " disarm your doors and crosscheck , " and announced by the lead flight attendant or purser as a plane approaches the gate . The intent is to verify disarming of the emergency escape slides attached to the doors . When armed , a slide will automatically deploy the instant its door is opened . Disarmed , it needs to be deployed manually . On departure the slides are armed to facilitate an emergency evacuation . ( You might hear this as " doors to automatic . " ) Upon docking , they 're disarmed to keep them from billowing into the boarding tunnel or onto the apron during servicing . The orange or yellow tape is a visual indicator for ground workers or ramp agents that the doors are armed or not armed . The visual indicator can vary , it can also be built into the door lock mechanism , triggering a visual indicator externally if the door is locked and armed . In the following picture , the orange tape is not strapped over the window , which should indicate an unarmed door . In the video that this image is taken from , the flight attendant has just locked and possibly armed the door , the other flight attendant would place the orange tape over the door window during " cross-check " .

With the caveat that this is based on experience mostly in the US : Most people take 60-80 hours to get their private pilot license : <URL> The harder you work , and the more often you fly , the fewer hours you 'll need . The average hours are inflated somewhat by the many pilots who run out of time or money partway through , have to stop , and must then relearn what they forgot when they start back up again . If you have the time , money , and dedication to fly two or three times a week , you 'll get your license in fewer hours ( not to mention fewer days ! ) . Do n't worry too much about the safety of it though . Your instructor wo n't let you take the exam , and your examiner wo n't pass you , if you 're not ready . As far as flying out of a major airport , my opinion is that it does n't much affect the time or amount of experience required . In the US , it 's usually more expensive because costs are higher at large airports , but you may not have the option . For most pilots , the hardest part of flying into a large airport is getting lost on the taxiways - but it will not take long to learn your way around your home airport . If anything , it will make you a better pilot . Today much of flying is dealing with controllers and airspace rules , and if you learn at a major airport , you 'll have plenty of practice with that .
For VFR Day Flights , you can use " A TOMATO FLAMES " : A - Altimeter T - Tachometer for each engine . O - Oil temp indicator for each engine M - Manifold pressure gauge for each altitude engine A - Airspeed indicator T - Temperature gauge for each liquid cooled engine O - Oil Pressure gauge for each engine F - Fuel quantity gauge for each tank L - Landing gear position lights ( if retractable gear ) A - Anti-collision lights ( aircraft certificated after March 11 , 1996 ) M - Magnetic direction indicator E - ELT , if required by § 91.207 S - Safety belts / Shoulder harnesses For VFR Night Flights , you can use " FLAPS " . This will be in addition to all the equipment required for a VFR Flight in Daylight . F - Fuses ( spare set ) L - Landing light ( if for hire ) A - Anti-collision light P - Position lights ( navigation lights ) S - Source of power ( such as battery ) Additionally , as @wbeard52 pointed out below , you can use " GRABCARD " as a mnemonic device to memorise the equipment required for IFR Flight . Again , these would be in addition to all the equipment required for VFR Day and Night Flight . G - Generator/alternator R - Radios ( two way and navigational equipment appropriate for the ground facilities to be used ) A - Altimeter ( sensitive ) adjustable for barometric pressure B - Ball ( slip-skid indicator , which is part of your turn coordinator ) C - Clock ( shows hours minutes and seconds and installed as part of aircraft equipment ) A - Attitude indicator R - Rate of turn indicator D - Directional gyro ( Heading indicator )

For many medium and large sized jets the maximum gross takeoff weight is higher than the maximum landing weight . If the airplane has an emergency that requires an air return or other landing in the early part of flight , it is very likely overweight for landing . The plane has 3 options at this point : Land overweight Dump fuel ( if able ) Fly around at low altitude and high power to burn fuel For some airplanes , option 2 is not available . This includes airplanes that are not equipped to dump fuel ( not all airplanes have this capability or have the capability under MEL ) or are not approved to dump fuel at their current location and altitude . For these airplanes , only option 1 and 3 are available . The choice between option 1 and 2/3 comes down to what kind of emergency it is . If you have to be on the ground now , you wo n't care about being overweight , and will just put it down . If you have time and landing now is n't a priority , then you would choose to dump or burn fuel . If an airplane chooses to dump , they will generally choose one of two values of remaining fuel : fuel such that they land at the maximum landing weight absolute minimum safe fuel to land This choice comes down to how likely the landing will end in an accident . If you are sure the landing will be a non-event ( e.g. air return for anti-ice failure ) then you 'll likely just dump until landing wont be overweight . Conversely , if you have a control issue or something that may end badly , you want minimum fuel to lessen the potential for fire . In these cases the ARFF crew will spray the runway with foam to assist in reducing the fire potential .
Sweden currently has a surplus of controllers , so you are unlikely to find open positions . However , since you are a qualified controller and speak Swedish , you should be qualified to apply for any position that might come up . I suggest you have a look at LFV , which is the largest Swedish ANSP : www.lfv.se/en
Let 's say you have two aircraft that will reach the same point in space at the same time , and your job is to keep them three miles apart . One way to do it is to calculate how many knots the second aircraft should reduce their speed so that at the time the first aircraft reaches the point , the second aircraft will have fallen three miles in trail . Unfortunately for you , this means that you have to work a time-speed-distance-wind problem for every single aircraft that you , as a controller , handle . Alternatively , you pick a point three miles away and tell the second aircraft to fly there . Air traffic controllers are human , and humans are better at angles than we are at numbers . The simplest thing for controllers is usually the best thing - they 've got lots on their mind already without making them do math too ! This might change in the NEXTGEN air traffic network ( where everyone has a GPS position and speed readout right there on the screen ) but for now , easy is better than hard .
There are no language recommendations or requirements , other than what is sensible given the verification requirements in the various standards ( e.g. , DO-178B / C ) . For the highest design assurance levels , the generated code must be inspected down at the op-code level to ensure no known processor gotchas are invoked . You also end up having to test every part of every conditional , both the true and the false sides , and ensure that no jump instructions will take you someplace where you did n't expect it to go . For these reasons , the big three languages in use in embedded avionics today are : C++ ( as a better C . The OO nature is often used only sparingly . Things like polymorphism are just too expensive to verify ) Ada ( You may not like it , but a TON of current avionics are written in Ada , and are currently being maintained and updated with new features ) C - As close to the hardware as you want to get and still be highly productive ( not intending to offend anyone who is productive in something else ) Assembler is frequently used for specific needs , but it would not be used to a greater degree than one of the above-mentioned languages . What makes these languages ideal for avionics is that they are relatively close to the hardware and memory structure , not too abstract . Their tools are mature and well-known . People have years of experience certifying software written in them . And there are lots of programmers who can get up to speed in them quickly ( Yes , even Ada ) . Non-safety critical software , both on and off the aircraft , will be written in any of the big languages of the day : Java , C# , VB , C , C++ , Python , Perl , Ruby , etc. . iPads are becoming useful inside the cockpit and are approved in limited situations . iOS apps are written in Objective-C , C , C++ , and increasingly , Swift ( Apple 's new language ) .
No , because the responsibilities are n't any different . And , with a safety pilot on board , the capabilities really should n't be either .
Radio frequencies in the USA are assigned by the <URL> , not the FAA . There 's no ' private ' air-to-ground frequency mentioned in the AIM but <URL> does say that the FCC has assigned 122.900 as a MULTICOM frequency for : Activities of a temporary , seasonal , emergency nature or search and rescue , as well as , airports with no tower , FSS , or UNICOM Arguably your fly-by is " temporary activity " , however the definition of MULTICOM is : A mobile service not open to public correspondence used to provide communications essential to conduct the activities being performed by or directed from private aircraft So if your fly-by is " essential " ( and safe ! ) then I guess you could use 122.9 . There are <URL> for requesting temporary air-to-ground frequencies for air shows , but that 's obviously a special case . As for legality , it seems that <URL> to use an aviation handheld radio on the ground : You may only use your hand-held aircraft VHF radio in your aircraft under the terms of your aircraft license . You are required to have a separate Ground Station license to operate your radio on the ground . But because this is more about FCC regulations than FAA ones , I suggest that you ask on <URL> ; they 'll probably know a lot more about how it all works .
In <URL> and I assume in a similar way in the United States , fireworks are treated like any other obstacle such as a communication tower , building , or crane . The location and elevation of the firework activity is assessed for impacts to any instrument procedures , airways , minimum altitude areas , etc. and NOTAM to temporarily amend affected procedures will be issued prior to the activity to advertise the changes and their effective periods . Having said that , this does n't address the VFR side of things . Operating near fireworks is essentially the same see and be seen idea . NOTAM get issued here all the time for the fireworks activity themselves and they would include a radius from the centre point . Simply avoiding the area is usually sufficient .
The different airspeeds : IAS is indicated airpseed CAS is calibrated airspeed EAS is equivalent airspeed TAS is true airspeed CAS is IAS corrected for instrumentation and position errors . The errors are most pronounced in slow and high angle-of-attack flight . IAS figures in aircraft manuals are actually converted from CAS . For ease of use . <URL> ( Wikipedia link ) . <URL> However , a modern plane with an <URL> ( ADC ) actually displays CAS , despite being labelled as IAS . Below 200 knots and 10,000 feet , for all purposes , CAS equals EAS . As the plane goes faster and higher and compresses the air , the air changes density , an effect known as compressibility that affects the CAS reading . <URL> EAS is computed by the ADC on a modern fast plane , and together with the density altitude , the TAS is then known . Ground speed and track ( from GPS , navaids , and/or INS ) together with the TAS allows the <URL> to calculate and display the wind speed/direction . Before ADC 's , pilots used charts like those in the answer . Summary : In a modern plane , what the pilot actually uses is CAS , despite being labelled IAS . And EAS is used in computing the TAS by the ADC . For engineers , TAS ( actual velocity through the air ) is used in lift equations , EAS is used in calculating dynamic pressures on the plane ( TAS corrected for air density ) .

Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft have what is called envelope protection which is to prevent pilot inputs from exceeding structural limits as well as keep them from getting the aircraft into an upset flight regime ( stall , overbank , etc. ) . The philosophy behind it is that , if the pilots need to perform an extreme maneuver they can be as aggressive with the controls as they want , confident that they wo n't break the plane . Boeing generally disagrees with this approach saying that , in an emergency , the pilot needs to have all possible force at his disposal , even if it breaks the plane . See the <URL> Federico linked to in comments for more on this . Of course , the Airbus system can only provide these protections when systems are all functioning properly . If part of the system is not working the protections are removed . Examples : <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , As far as AA587 , the A-300 is not a fly-by-wire aircraft and does n't have envelope protections . It 's debatable , though , if envelope protection would have helped in that situation . None of the rudder inputs by itself was outside of the structural limitations of the aircraft so the computer would probably not have prevented them . The failure was due to the inputs being made in quick succession which quickly fatigued the composite material of the rudder . The computer can be programmed to know , for instance , how much g-force the structure can take . But it would be difficult to determine what complex combinations of inputs might exceed the strength of the design .
14.5 % given in the article is the ( maximum ) thickness to chord ratio , expressed in percentage . It is usually used to explain how thin ( or thick ) the airfoil is . Note that this is a characteristic of the airfoil . From the NASA page <URL> : <URL> Airfoil thickness to chord ratio , image from NASA page <URL> ... The straight line drawn from the leading to trailing edges of the airfoil is called the chord line . ... The maximum distance between the two lines is called the camber , which is a measure of the curvature of the airfoil ( high camber means high curvature ) . The maximum distance between the upper and lower surfaces is called the thickness . Often you will see these values divided by the chord length to produce a non-dimensional or " percent " type of number .
While I 'm not a pilot , I think it goes along these lines : Airlines typically assume a value for passengers depending on gender and age . This distribution in the cabin will typically be quite random and a little variation does not do any damage . Baggage however is weighed on the scales at check in . Each bag is normally scanned as it is passed onto the plane , so that they know where is bag is located . The values are then passed onto the pilots who are able to work out that the numbers are ok . Sometimes there are preferences to load up bags in a certain way for fuel issues , so this is very important to make sure this is still resonable . These values are then plugged into computers or worked out manually on a paper loadsheet to make sure they are good and within limits . In fact the weight systems you are referring to are quite unusual I think , see <URL> .
The practice of naming aircraft probably comes from the days of the flying boat , and the naval tradition of naming ships - <URL> had many named aircraft , and <URL> . Other airlines of the period had similar naming practices ( I 'm not sure who started it , but Pan Am 's fleet was well known for it ) . As a marketing tool telling folks they 're flying on " Clipper Emerald Isle from New York to Dublin " may have been more attractive to passengers than " Pan Am Flight 12345 " or N880PA . Particularly before the commoditization of air travel , when flying was still a new and novel form of transportation , having a connection back to familiar " sailing " metaphors may have helped get passengers on board and could help differentiate your service from another airline . Modern airlines do n't seem to push their aircraft naming as much as historic carriers did , but <URL> - in fact Lufthansa paints their plane names onto the fuselage , though I 'm not sure if they announce them to passengers . A skilled marketing department could build a brand around ship names , but I 'm not aware of any airline doing so today .

Is there a standard text for parachute design ?
Some useful texts are <URL> by Cockrell , <URL> by Lingard , and the Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual by Knacke . The Lingard and Cockrell papers both have extensive references that are worth pursuing . The Knacke manual is , as far as I know , only available in hardcopy . It seems that the designers of modern sport ram-air parachutes and paragliders are more concerned with protecting trade secrets than they are in publishing research . The paragliding side of the aisle is a bit more willing to share . There is an online <URL> , and there are several open source paraglider CAD software packages available .
We all know the saying " From High to Low , Look out below " Some were taught that this only applied to pressure differences and thus were instructed to get a new altimeter setting every 100NM or so . This is a good recommendation . Temperature differences from standard also causes errors with the altimeter . The same saying above holds true with temperature variations . An altimeter setting is defined as : ( ref . Pilot/Controller Glossary ) The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for variations in existing atmospheric pressure or to the standard altimeter setting ( 29.92 ) . We also know there is a direct correlation between pressure and temperature and thus an altimeter setting is corrected for both pressure and temperature . This means one thing , the altimeter error is zero at the field elevation . As the aircraft gets climbs higher above the field , the altimeter error will increase . There is a table in the Aeronautical Information Manual ( 7-2-8 ) that lists altimeter error due to temperature as a function of altitude ( AGL ) and temperature . Here is the formula that will give you this table . The formula can be found in <URL> . The United States Air Force has a <URL> that discusses this topic . The FAA has recently come out with <URL> which requires pilots ( after 9/17/2015 ) who fly into " Cold Temperature Restricted Airports " to correct their altitudes for colder than standard temperatures . To determine if your airport is part of this program you must go to the <URL> and search for Cold Temperature Restricted Airports . There should be a link at the bottom of the page . Here is a graphic showing all the airports in the United States that were part of the program in February 2015 . Because Lnafziger wanted Alaska . Not only is the pilot required to correct for the segment but they are also required to inform ATC of the new altitudes they will fly . This is to ensure traffic separation with other airplanes who are not temperature correcting their altimeters . Pictures taken with permission from <URL> . All rights reserved .
Unfortunately , countries tend to want to decide themselves how stuff is supposed to work once you 're within their borders . That 's why we have different rules and laws , and when you go somewhere else in the world , you might need to know some of the differences . In England they drive on the wrong side of the road , imagine that ! :) Anyways , in order to have things run smoothly in something so utterly international as aviation , there 's this organization called <URL> ( International Civil Aviation Organization ) where I believe most countries of the world are members , where the rules are that the ICAO drafts recommendations ( I believe they are called ) which the member states should incorporate into their respective laws and regulations . If they choose not to , they need to inform the ICAO of such deviation , do n't know exactly what happens then , but I believe the idea is to at least let everybody know there 's a discrepancy . Anyway , the ICAO Annex 5 specifies units to use , including units for altitude and actually specifying meters as the primary unit , with feet being accepted as non-SI alternative . Why on earth you 'd want to go against the majority on this I do n't know , perhaps due to the fact that it 's an SI unit and they want to be as much SI as they can . So it 's basically up to each country how they want to play it . Most countries stuck with feet .
Critical speed or Mach number is the speed at which the speed of sound is locally reached somewhere along the flow around an airfoil . A supercritical airfoil can tolerate operating speeds slightly above the critical speed ( hence the name ) , which means that a pocket of supersonic flow will show up , most likely on the upper surface . What qualifies an airfoil as supercritical is that the recompression does not need a <URL> , but can be done shock-free for a small lift coefficient range by clever shaping . See <URL> for more . Calculation of a supercritical airfoil is best done with a computer program which models the flow conditions around Mach 1 faithfully . Once such program would be <URL> . The picture below shows one result for the BACJ airfoil at Mach 0.8 , and you can see that the speed on the upper surface reaches Mach 1.3 .
I 've downvoted the answer from Habu because it ignores a major difference in engine design . For small GA planes , the Lycoming engines have the carburetor bolted to the bottom of the crankcase where it gets some heat from the hot oil . Fuel/air exits the top of the carb where it is routed through pipes inside the crankcase where the hot oil further increases its temperature . This makes the Lyc generally resistant to induction icing . In Continentals , the updraft carburetor is not mounted on the hot crankcase but on part of the manifold assembly , insulating the carb itself from the heat of the crankcase , and the fuel/air mixture is routed directly to the intake manifold and not through the engine crankcase which holds the hot oil . The result is that the TCM O-300 engine has earned the reputation of being an icemaker . The difference in the POH instructions as to how to fly each engine is directly attributable to engine design and it has absolutely nothing to do with the weather in Vero Beach versus Wichita . I 'm going to post line drawing images of the two engines to illustrate the point . First : Lycoming . Second : Continental What the original poster is missing is that for most of its history , the Cessna design used Continental engines . Now that it has switched to Lycoming engines , the difference in the engines is probably zero , but they have not abandoned the former POH instructions as that might be confusing to the pilots that fly these planes . After all , using carb heat more often as a default procedure for the Lyc powered Cessnas is a safe procedure .
For the aircrew , at least in the aircraft that I 've flown , there is no defined checklist . You scan and then deal with anything that occurs ( inoperative equipment , pressurization issues , whatever you get ) with whatever checklists apply : if the lightning knocked out a hydraulic pump , run the checklist for the inop pump , etc. . Once you 're on the ground , maintenance has a HUGE checklist to work through , essentially checking every surface of the aircraft for damage and verifying that every piece of equipment still works . The more that the crew can tell them ( i.e. radios &amp; instruments unaffected , no equipment stopped working , pressurization normal , etc ) , the more of it they can sign off from the crew observation . But even then , it 's still pretty lengthy .
Severe convection will have anvil tops at the tropopause and overshooting tops can penetrate much higher ( severe thunderstorm warnings often use a value of 60,000 ft for threats to aircraft ) . How high the overshooting tops can get is a balance of the positive buoyancy during parcel ascent against the negative buoyancy once it gets into the warming stratospheric air . A U2 could overfly these storms , but most aircraft are not designed for stratospheric flight ( due to the temperature increasing with height in the stratosphere ) and any commercial aircraft will be unable to go over these storms .
<URL> has done some research that chronobiologically-adapted LED lighting can enhance passengers well being and they can sleep better during a flight . <URL> details about this research : Adaptive solid-state lighting ( SSL ) scenarios in which the color and brightness of lighting is varied during long-distance overnight flights results in passengers that sleep better and are more alert upon arrival . ... at the start of an overnight flight that warm-white light helps to stimulate melatonin production and increases passenger relaxation ... blue-rich cold light in the morning increased alertness There have been studies showing benefits of <URL> .
You question is a question of rules of engagement . Shooting down a downed pilot in a dogfight is not only not OK , but also illegal . According to <URL> , No person parachuting from an aircraft in distress shall be made the object of attack during his descent . Of course , war is war and this kind of attacks <URL> by pilots of almost all air forces , though it should be noted that in most cases , this practice was specifically prohibited by their high commands .
It is called a <URL> and I do n't think that any of the present generation large commercial aircraft use them . That said , a number of older commercial aircraft have used them , a good example being the Sud Caravelle . <URL> Image from eu.airliners.net There are some issues with using drogue chutes in a commercial airliner , which would limit their effectiveness . Most commercial airliners have thrust reversers already . For it to be effective , the parachute has to be quite huge . For example , the Handley Page Victor , which had MTOW in the range of A320 , had a drogue chute 48 ' ( or 14.6 m ) in diameter . The chute would occupy volume and increase weight . If drogue chutes are used , they have to be packed before every flight , which will increase turnaround times . Another option is to replace them at the end of every deployment , which would increase costs . Deployment failure/partial deployment/Uncommanded deployment will affect the safety of the flight . The need to use a drogue chute can limit the crosswind landing of the airliner significantly . Aircraft dragging a huge chute during taxiing back to the ramp is not a good idea from FoD point of view .
Blades of wind turbines , airplanes and helicopters are essentially the same . They are all wings , roughly to do the same job . However , each one is designed or enhanced to do their special job . The differences can be : Number of revolutions Wing span Rate of flow Tip speed Density of medium Material Load Turbine blades are designed to move in large volumes of rather slow moving air ( usually 10-30 mph ) and not create turbulence that fouls the next blade . Aircraft propellers are designed to move high velocity air and avoid the turbulence by moving out of the way . Wind turbines use blade pitch to adjust the rotation speed and the generated power . Wind turbine 's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes . In aircraft , blade pitch is usually described as " coarse " for a coarser angle , and " fine " for a finer .
The wingtips are a unique part of the aircraft in that they really have one job ; minimize drag . Their design is easy to see , and they are a fairly recent addition to transport aircraft . Developments continue to be made in the study of aerodynamics , with modern computing power and methods allowing much better modeling of flow patterns to evaluate designs , and improvements in materials allowing more complex designs to be built . The key is that the winglet must be properly designed . As wing designs change , the flow over the wings changes , and new winglet designs are invented . Since it is heavily dependent on the specific application , it 's more relevant to look at the evolution of the designs on different aircraft . The design chosen is dependent on the technology available at the time , both for evaluating the design and building it , the design of the wing , intended use of the aircraft , and the previous experience of the manufacturer . The 737 is an old design that has evolved over time : Original/Classic : none , NG : winglet , P-8 : raked tip , MAX : split scimitar The A330 is a fairly new design : Current : small winglet , neo : winglet The 747 has also evolved over time , and the latest version shares technology with the 787 : Original : none , -400 : small winglet , -8 : raked tip The A320 has also evolved over time : Original : none , Current : tip fence , neo : winglet The A380 is a new design : tip fence The A350 is a new design : winglet The 787 is a new design : raked tip The 777 is a fairly new design : Basic : none , -200 LR and -300 ER : raked tips You will notice a trend from smaller designs to larger ones . On larger aircraft though , the weight of a large winglet and the loads it produces can get too large . New designs like the 777 , A380 , 787 , and 747-8 all use either raked tips or small winglets . As for other parts of aircraft , engines are changing more than you think . The jet engines on the early jet transports look very different from modern high-bypass turbofans . The GEnx engines on the 787 and 747-8 have chevrons at the back to reduce noise . All you see on the outside is the nacelle that minimizes drag ; most of the changes go on inside . Also , if you look closely at the front , fan blades on newer engines have curves in them instead of having straight edges . Most other parts of the aircraft have more complex jobs , not primarily external . A fuselage should be efficient at carrying things inside but also keep drag low . If you look closely you will notice that new planes like the 787 and A350 have a lot in common with previous fuselages , but they are shaped differently as well . It 's harder to see the other drastic changes like the use of composites in place of traditional aluminum , electric systems instead of hydraulic or bleed air , fly by wire , etc. . Control surfaces must provide sufficient control while minimizing drag . The size and shape has also changed over time , though the general design has remained .
Almost every major airport ( Class B ) would have what 's called a <URL> , a Standard Terminal Arrival Route . Busy Class B traffic does n't necessarily follow a TPA ( Traffic Pattern Altitude ) . For runway 09 , the STAR does n't show a speed limit . Some STARs have speed limits . But that 's not to say the speed is at the pilot 's discretion , as the airplane approaches an airport it 's standard for the crew to slow down and prepare the plane for landing . The air traffic control ( ATC ) can also issue speed restrictions to properly space the arriving traffic , they have the bigger picture . For the downwind leg you can expect something like 200 knots indicated , which can translate to a bit over or under 200 knots of ground speed , depending on the wind . That 's 230 mph or 370 km/h . As the planes join the final approach segment , the altitude would indeed be level in most cases , and further descent would commence as you said , on final approach . <URL> No published speed limit on downwind . The line with an arrow pointing to IFSOX . For altitude it 's 4000 feet , the * 3000 is the minimum to clear any obstructions . 2400 ' for the base leg . <URL> Above is a chart legend . <URL> Final approach descent begins about 10 nautical miles to touch down , as illustrated from 2100 feet for this particular approach to runway 09 . Numbers in this answer are for one particular approach to one runway , figures vary . <URL> Source : <URL> Class B around KSAN is a bit complicated in shape , but the base/floor is mostly 2800 ' for the southern published downwind area ( if you overlay the STAR on a VFR chart ) . Airline/IFR pilots do n't need to worry about that chart as they 'll be following the aforementioned STAR or guided/vectored by ATC . <URL> I misread the question , from the north it 's 6000 feet and 210 knots , the BAYVU ( pronounced bay-view ) FOUR ARRIVAL ( STAR ) . That should be downwind for runway 27 . The same principles apply , different figures . See where you live ( coordinates ) , <URL> all the STAR charts , and you 'll have a better picture of your night sky . Note : some STAR charts are not-to-scale .
The best term to describe it would be the ' final approach segment ' , which is <URL> : This is the segment in which alignment and descent for landing are made . Final approach may be made to a runway for a straight-in landing , or to an aerodrome for a visual manoeuvre . The <URL> : The FAS begins at the PFAF and ends at the landing threshold point ( LTP ) . The FAS is typically aligned with the runway centerline extended . The segment OEA is divided into the FAS OCS and the visual segment obstacle identification surface ( OIS ) . Note : Both <URL> ( which refers to the ICAO document ) and <URL> define it only for instrument approaches .
<URL> means data read on the basic instruments . Not-raw data means enhanced information built from raw data and/or flight management system . <URL> bars are not raw data , but a computation from basic air data , desired airspeed , roll angle limit , etc. . At the next higher level , the <URL> can use the FD data to fly the aircraft . Similarly desired speed can be determined automatically and thrust can be managed by the <URL> . Taking off and climbing with FD , auto-throttle and autopilot <URL> Takeoff with FD and AP , just after liftoff ( A320 simulator ) . Source : <URL> The green bars of the FD shows what should be the attitude of the aircraft , SRS ( <URL> ) guidance law has been used to determine the desired 165 kt speed . The pilot may fly the aircraft manually using these non-raw data . In the present case the pilot has also activated another layer of assistance : Autopilot and auto-throttle . The AP follows the FD indications , and the thrust is managed by the auto-throttle so that the desired speed is achieved safely as soon as possible . The indication in the <URL> means autopilot , flight director and auto-throttle are currently selected / active . T/O with raw data Flying with raw data implies not using the FD or the SRS mode , nor the AP other modes or the auto-throttle . The crew must determine the attitude to be used after the T/O rotation , and during the climb . They also need to manage the thrust required . For example , the roll angle has to be determined manually , depending on all factors discussed above and the desired horizontal track . <URL> Takeoff without FD ( A320 ) . Source : <URL> Benefits Not using computer assistance helps maintaining and developing pilot skills and prevents dependency on automation that can always <URL> . The correct attitude , speed and thrust depend on many limits -- some are displayed in the <URL> band and the <URL> when they have video displays -- that the pilots must have in mind .

The frequency of such permanent training may be influenced by the <URL> ( standard operating procedures , SOP ) which can either encourage or discourage crews to use the airplane automatic features at certain phases of the flight . On modern aircraft there are some mechanisms ca n't be inactivated as the direct transmission between controls and corresponding actuators have been replaced , partially or totally , by <URL> . The conversion between actual pilot movements and electrical command signals is subject to some level of filtering provided by the fly-by-wire system . Other raw data operations <URL> .

With current technology the L/D might go up to 70 or 75 , and going higher would require an almost impractically large wing span . Gliders need to fly in tight circles to use updrafts , and the larger the wingspan becomes , the bigger the speed difference between inner and outer wing will be . Also , landing such a wide wing without dropping a wingtip will be very hard . Smaller wings with a high aspect ratio will have a low chord length , leading to smaller <URL> s , which translates into a steep increase of friction drag if the aspect ratio is increased without increasing wing area . Therefore , only adding wing span will help , and this runs into a soft wall beyond the 30 m of designs like the <URL> . In addition , the current <URL> will make bigger aircraft unattractive for competition pilots . The <URL> is claimed to have an L/D approaching 75 , but I have learned over the years to see theoretical predictions as invariably optimistic , and realistic performance , with bugs on the wing and all , will never quite measure up to the hoped-for ideal . <URL> to reduce friction drag and proposed glider designs with L/D ratios in excess of 100 . Turbines at the wingtips would drive the suction pumps , so these would still be unpowered aircraft . But so far nobody has dared to turn his visions into reality . While laminarisation avoids the increase in friction drag of a turbulent boundary layer , a moving wall would eliminate viscous losses altogether . Now the friction generation is between the moving wall ( this could be a taut foil running between two cylinders at the forward and aft end of the wing ) and the fixed structure . With current materials there is no hope of reducing drag this way , but who knows what tricks will be possible in the future . A glide ratio of 100 or more looks rather unlikely in the next 50 years .
The procedure used would depend on which information is conflicting/unreliable ( and of course the aircraft type ) . With one or more unreliable airspeed indications ( which is one of the more critical ones ) , the initial action is NOT to start troubleshooting/figuring out which indicator is " the correct one " , but to ensure safe speed/flight path by other means . The initial actions on Boeing aircraft is to disconnect automatics ( auto throttle , autopilot , flight director ) and control the aircraft given memorized combinations of pitch and thrust . With the aircraft under control , and when directed by the checklist , you start analyzing the situation , to see if you can rectify/isolate the faulty source . If a reliable source can not be determined , the aircraft continues to be flown by pitch/thrust settings given in the manual ( based on altitude , if known , weight , flaps/gear , desired vertical profile etc ) . In the case of unreliable altitude , in case you ca n't determine a reliable source , you can typically use radio altitude below 2 ' 500 ft. A big caveat is that if the transponder is set to use an unreliable static pressure source , the altitude that ATC sees on secondary radar will also be unreliable . An example of this was seen in the Aeroperú 603 accident , where the aircraft took off , with the static ports taped over , and ATC was asked to assist with altitude and speed information : <URL> - <URL> Erroneous airspeed/altitude indications often imply each other , as an unreliable static pressure source will affect both .
There is some link between the type of control and the design maneuverability of the aircraft . Consider a yoke . Imagine twisting it to bank . You are moving it with a twisting motion of one or both arms and in general , aircraft fitted with such yokes are capable of low to moderate roll rates . Big displacements are uncommon but small , rapid , alternating changes are common . Watch a wide body PF making control movements during a landing with any kind of xwind or turbulence . They are less sensitive and give more visual feedback as to the control positions . Now consider a stick , central to the pilot flying . This is moved with a movement of the arm , generally only one , and can be rapidly displaced easily . This is normally associated with aircraft with high rates of roll , especially in an aircraft designed to rapidly null out or reverse the roll . It is also physically easier to move a stick than a yoke under high-G as the arm movement gives a longer lever . A great example of this was the Vulcan which , despite it 's size , enormous wing area and large fin , was so rollable that it could out-maneuver the interceptors of it 's day . It has a control column rather than a yoke and the PF would throw it around at altitude as if it were a fighter . This would not be easy to do with a yoke . I 'm a bit long in the tooth and have n't flown fixed wing for many years . I am not familiar with the rationale behind side sticks which are fitted to both low and high performance aircraft . I am guessing they are fitted more for reasons of ergonomics than for performance .
I do n't know much about this , but it looks like a TSO Authorization is for domestic ( US ) manufacturers , and a letter of TSO design approval is for foreign manufacturers who want to import their products into the US . See <URL> : § 21.621 Issue of letters of TSO design approval : Import articles . ( a ) The FAA may issue a letter of TSO design approval for an article -- ( 1 ) Designed and manufactured in a foreign country or jurisdiction subject to the export provisions of an agreement with the United States for the acceptance of these articles for import ; and ( 2 ) For import into the United States if -- [ ... ] And <URL> on it says : What is a letter of design approval ? An FAA design approval for an article manufactured outside the United States that meets a specific TSO . I have no idea about other aviation authorities , but I assume there are similar regulations in other countries because the same general issue exists everywhere : how do you ensure that both manufactured and imported aviation components meet all required standards ?
If a pilot is already speaking to ATC ( or monitoring a frequency ) they should continue to use that frequency for any emergency or abnormal situation . If they are not currently receiving ATC services or on an ATC frequency , attempt to use 121.5 . Many ATC providers and enroute airliners monitor this frequency and can relay or provide assistance . The FAA 's <URL> describes emergency use of 121.5 in the United States : h. Although the frequency in use or other frequencies assigned by ATC are preferable , the following emergency frequencies can be used for distress or urgency communications , if necessary or desirable : 1 . 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz . Both have a range generally limited to line of sight . 121.5 MHz is guarded by direction finding stations and some military and civil aircraft . 243.0 MHz is guarded by military aircraft . Both 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz are guarded by military towers , most civil towers , FSSs , and radar facilities . Normally ARTCC emergency frequency capability does not extend to radar coverage limits . [ emphasis mine ] If an ARTCC does not respond when called on 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz , call the nearest tower or FSS .

Why do we complete wing bending tests ?
It ensures that the theoretical assumptions are correct in practice . Therefore it save our lives .
By the time the government had pulled the plug on the program . Even that hop got Hughes into trouble because they had been expressly forbidden from taking off ( he got off on a technicality , claiming it 'd been unintentional , unexpected behaviour from an experimental machine , etc. ) . If it had been anyone except Hughes I 'm pretty sure the H4 would have been destroyed rather than preserved as a museum piece , the US government was that intent on killing the project there and then . They had a lot of air bases with long runways to find a purpose for , and long range air travel was an excellent purpose . They also wanted to find customers for the thousands of surplus transport aircraft ( and bombers to be converted to that role ) . So getting rid of the traditional way to fly intercontinental , the flying boat , was important . Were people curious ? No doubt . But they also were budget conscious , the H4 had no more military application so there was no money coming out of the Pentagon . It had no civilian application , as for large payload ships are cheaper and for small , fast payloads it was too large . So even if there had not been active hostility towards the flying boat concept at the time from people with the power to release or deny budgets , there would have been little point in implementing an expensive flight test program ( which usually requires multiple vehicles ... ) for an aircraft for which it was highly unlikely there would ever be any peacetime orders . Of course 50 years later the idea was kinda revived with a short period of interest in Wing In Ground effect vehicles to fly troops and supplies over the feared Soviet submarine fleet in the Atlantic . But that did n't start up until near the demise of that threat in the 1990s and nothing ever made it past concept drawings ( except paradoxically a few Soviet craft in the Caspian and Black Sea regions , the Ekranoplans ) . I 've little doubt the H4 would have worked as advertised , seeing it it looks sound in design , basically a scaled up B314 . But there was just no market for it . It was an example of too big , too late .
Most important factor affecting drag is frontal area . Almost all frontal area of the engine pod is the intake and it has to have the size it does to collect the air the engine needs . So there is not so much drag to be saved . Beside that , embedding the engine in wing roots like <URL> did has many disadvantages , most of which also apply to the central engine of three-engined jets ( B727 , DC-10 ) : The wing root carries the weight of the aircraft , so weakening it by embedding the engine is design and construction complication . Access for maintenance is difficult . Engines need a lot of maintenance and sometimes need to be replaced . Uncontained failure is more dangerous ( see <URL> ) . There is not much structure to damp vibration , so it is awfully noisy . And last but not least , modern high-bypass turbofans are huge . They would not fit in the wing anyway . And reasons for not attaching the engines directly to the fuselage or wing are already mentined in <URL> . Mainly , the inlet needs : Free space around it from which it can draw air at slow speed . Free space around it to which it can spill the excess air at high speed . And the engines mounted forward of wing actually improve the distribution of cross-sectional area according to the <URL> .
Are they really ? In a high wing aircraft the center of lift is above the center of gravity . This will not increase stability when the aircraft banks , however , as you rightly say , will help once the aircraft is in a sideslip . In order to keep the fuselage at an angle to the airflow , the wing has now to create a sideways lift component , which it does by flying at an angle to the horizontal . This roll angle of the aircraft will shift the center of gravity sideways , so it is not exactly below the center of lift , but offset laterally . This lateral offset seems to produce a rolling moment which works against the roll angle . Below I sketched the major forces in a sideslip . Note that the aircraft has a sideways speed component which creates a side force on fuselage and tail ( green ) which needs to be counteracted by the sideways component of lift ( blue ) . <URL> Short Sandringham in sideslip ( based on <URL> ) But still the weight ( black ) is attacking at the center of gravity , so it will not roll the aircraft , and the lift is in the vertical plane of symmetry , so it , too , will not create a rolling moment . Ergo , we have no stabilizing effect due to the high wing location ! In a sideslip of a high-wing aircraft the <URL> . This would indeed create a rolling moment because it will shift the center of lift sideways , out of the plane of symmetry . In a static sideslip the pilot will deflect the ailerons to maintain the roll angle as well as the rudder to maintain the sideslip , shifting the lift vector back into the vertical plane of symmetry . Now any stabilizing effect of the lift asymmetry is on purpose cancelled by the pilot ! However , this is achieved in a low wing airplane by adding dihedral . Therefore , a low wing aircraft can easily be made as stable as a high wing aircraft in a sideslip . You will notice that the lateral aerodynamic force ( green ) acts above the center of gravity and <URL> . This is dictated by the location of the vertical tail , which contributes little to the location of the center of gravity , but produces a considerable share of the lateral force ( reduced in the sideslip case by rudder deflection , however ) . This rolling moment , though , is almost independent of wing location . In a low wing , the center of gravity will be lower in total , especially when the engines are mounted on the wing , so the rolling moment contribution of the vertical tail is somewhat higher . The effect is small in a sideslip since the rudder deflection means that the fuselage contributes the majority of the side force . And this is not the pendulum effect which you asked about and which does not exist . In airships , <URL> , however : Since buoyancy always acts against gravity , a lateral offset of the heavy gondola will create an uprighting moment , just as it does in a pendulum . When turning , the heavy gondola will be pulled sideways by centrifugal forces , and the airship will roll . Since the turn is commanded with rudder , the rotation will give the rudder a small nose-down moment , which must be compensated by a nose-up elevator command . The pendulum effect will ensure that the gondola is at the lowest point in straight flight . P.S. : Thanks to the hint of @kepler22b I have now discovered the <URL> on Wikipedia . It also mentions the pendulum effect and calls both the fuselage contribution to the dihedral effect . Man , if there is ever a competition for the most misleading name of an effect , this would be the winning entry . A pendulum is a mass mounted below the hinge point , so it will stabilize in the down position . A flying aircraft is not hinged , so all motion is around the center of gravity . There simply is no pendulum effect in aircraft .
Induced drag is caused by the backward inclination of the lift vector . Lift is defined as the aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction , and since lift is created by <URL> , the resulting force is slightly inclined backwards . The formula for the deflection angle ( called <URL> ) $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ To arrive at the drag , you now need to multiply the local lift with this angle . For small $ \ alpha_w $ s the arcus tangens can be neglected , and we get this familiar looking equation for the backwards-pointing component of the aerodynamic force : $ $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ cdot AR } = \ frac { \ alpha_w ^ 2 \ cdot \ pi \ cdot AR } { 4 } $ $ Now consider a wing which will do this unevenly over the wingspan . Some parts create a lot of lift and , therefore , a lot of downward deflection . Others produce less lift and less deflection . Due to the quadratic dependency of induced drag with downwash angle , the sum of all parts will always be higher when there are variations in the local downwash angle over span . Only the wing with a <URL> will have the minimum induced drag for a given lift . This is not necessarily an elliptic wing . By selecting the right twist ( incidence variation over wingspan ) , any planform can be made to produce a constant downwash angle , albeit at only one angle of attack . Only the elliptic wing will combine the constant downwash angle over span with a constant lift coefficient over span such that variations in angle of attack still result in a constant downwash angle . This is strictly true only in inviscid flow and when elastic deformation and the weight of the wing ( which contributes to the need for lift and hence induced drag ) are not considered . Also , an elliptic wing will produce nasty stall characteristics . Adding handling , friction and structural weight will shift the optimum to wings which produce more lift near the center . The exact optimum also will depend on the absolute size of the wing because the structural mass fraction goes up with size due to <URL> .

There is no reason to limit the number of anti-shock bodies to 3 or 4 . In most modern aircraft , the anti-shock bodies are the flap track fairings which usually house the flap mechanisms . As such , their number is determined by among other things , the wingspan , the size of control surfaces and the number of actuators required for their actuation etc. . This usually limits their number to around 4 due to weight and other considerations . However , there is no reason there should only be 3 or 4 of them . For example , the <URL> has a whole lot of them . <URL> Source : www.avioners.net
The verb , " to taxi , " as it relates to a moving airplane on the ground , dates to about 1911 . The verb appears to be derived from the noun , " taxi , " referring to a nearly flightless training aircraft that dates to about 1909 . The word may allude to driving around like a taxicab , as others surmise , or it may relate to the fact that flight instructors gave rides to new students in the " taxi " airplane . Eventually , they started calling getting around on the ground ( or water ) " taxiing . " The expression started at Henri Farman 's flight school outside Paris , and was later picked up by pilots at flight schools in England . A " taxi " had shorter wings and a heavier body , so that it could not really take off and fly away at the hands of a new pilot , but a new pilot could get the feel of handling the aircraft and learn to take off and fly short distances , especially downhill along a slope . See : <URL>
It helps to know the objective of both ICAO and IATA to understand when which code is used . <URL> ( International Civil Aviation Organization ) is a UN-body which focusses on international harmonization of civil aviation regulations . ICAO codes are used for " official " purposes such as Air Traffic Control ; E.g. flight plans use ICAO codes for airports and airline flight identification . <URL> ( International Air Transport Association ) is a trade association that focusses on making air traffic businesses safe , secure , reliable and efficient . IATA codes are mainly used for ticketing . E.g. travel itineraries use IATA codes for airports and IATA flight numbers .
pilots need to be able to do work during turbulence . passengers do n't really like to be fully restrained .
Amber X 's mean the FADEC is not yet energized . Once the X 's disappear it means the FADEC is ready and can provide monitoring ( even passive monitoring in a manual start ) . Without FADEC there is no means to start the engine , as the valves are also FADEC controlled . <URL> ( A320 FADEC schematic . ) <URL> FADEC is needed even for manual start .
Because the quarter chord point is the most meaningful point : the wing or surface lift vector can be found here . Like taking the CoG as reference point for gravity forces . Theoretical and practical analysis have shown that if the moment and force reference point is taken at 25 % of Mean Aerodynamic Cord ( MAC ) , the magnitude of the aerodynamic moment remains nearly constant when the angle of attack changes . This location is called the wing 's Aerodynamic Centre ( AC ) . The lift and moment system can be transferred to any convenient point , but that is the point of the quarter chord point :)
RTCA documents are not FAA documents , although the FAA is usually a member of the Special Committee that creates the documents . If an example is to be added , it is the decision of the SC , not of the FAA . The reason that no examples are given is that the recommendation is clear by itself . A good V&amp;V engineer will read this recommendation and use his skill , experience and creativity to find an other acceptable means to validate the software requirements that can not be validated in a realistic environment . This alternative means is then documented in the SVP . Giving an example is not helpful at all , since the solution will depend completely on the software under test and the nature of the requirements . If the hardware is not available , an emulator may be the solution . In other cases artificial test inputs have to be generated , because failing a test in a realistic environment may prove to be catastrophic .
The pilots also need to use oxygen in case of smoke , fumes , or fire in the aircraft . Thus , they need enough oxygen to be able to get down and land in a fire scenario , which is much more than a decompression ! Fire procedures have the crew on 100 % oxygen at positive pressure to prevent them from breathing in smoke and fumes , while in a decompression , their masks mix oxygen with cabin air , in much the same way the cabin masks do . This is also why the cabin masks are not used in smoke/fumes scenarios .
Engine placement was a tricky question when jets were introduced , and much has been learned since then . The initial idea was to mount them inside the fuselage or wing root . When they grew too big , they were closely mounted to the wing ( " underslung " position , like in the <URL> , the <URL> or the early <URL> ) . However , the underslung position has two disadvantages : More of the leading and trailing edges is obstructed , blocking space that would otherwise be used for slats and flaps . Consequently , an underslung position reduces maximum lift . The center of gravity of the engine is too far back . Moving it more forward helps to place the center of gravity of the wing ahead of its elastic line . Bending will now create an opposing inertial moment , which is very helpful to dampen flutter . Starting to move the engine downwards away from the wing initially increases drag , because now a narrow slot opens between both with a tendency to separated flow . Only when the engine is moved downwards enough , the drag of the wing-engine arrangement reaches its minimum . This placement was chosen in the next generation of jets like the <URL> or the <URL> . Moving it still further down makes the pylon longer and thus increases the total drag again . The big diameters of modern high-bypass ratio engines make it impractical to move it down enough to reach the drag minimum , but by moving it forward , the engine can again be lifted up , so a shorter landing gear becomes possible . Vortex generators are added if that pesky separation between engine and nacelle can not be avoided .
Yes it can , albeit at the cost of some added weight . By using reinforced bulkheads , the bending loads can be transferred into the bulkheads which leaves the center section free of structure . That is how large engines and their intake ducts can be placed where normally the spar would go . A classical example is the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter . <URL> Lockheed F-104 Starfighter cut-away drawing ( picture <URL> ) . Using bracing like on the Mini-MAX reduces stresses in the carry-through , but does not remove the need for something to keep the wings apart . In other words , the compression member of the wing spar is still required to transverse the fuselage where the wings are attached . Also , at high angle of attack the wing produces substantial nose thrust which could fold the wings forward were it not for a second compression strut at the wing nose . <URL> Mini-MAX 1100 ( picture <URL> ) In case of the Cri-Cri , which is a low wing design , the pilot sits on top of the spar . Moving the wing up to a mid position would create a much heavier aircraft and would require a wider fuselage , too . <URL> Colomban Cri-Cri ( picture <URL> )
There are two main geometrical characteristics that affect the airflow in the situation mentioned . From one side you have a cylinder with wheels at the end ; on the other side during the transition you have an open cavity . Let 's talk about the first one . You actually have a cylinder flying perpendicular to the air speed . This is kind of canonical problem in fluid dynamics , there is a lot of literature about this problem , but to explain the effect I would like to take a simple example that I took from the website , the infinite 2D cylinder . For that , I include this picture of flow over a cylinder : Note for fluid dynamics experts : This is not relevant if Reynolds Number ( Re ) is around 10,000 , but for understanding the concept is good enough . So , imagine that we are cutting landing gear perpendicular to its length and we visualize the flow . What do we see ? Two main things ... Looking at the flow lines , they are almost not affected at 3-4 diameters of distance from the cylinder perpendicular to the flow direction there is a very local influence of the existence of the landing gear . However we see that down the flow there is a big influence with the creation of chaotic structures . That is creating a big increase in drag downstream of the landing gear and any surface behind . Basically ... low influence on the red direction and significant influence on blue . Answering your question , influences the wing in a local area . The influence anyhow is negative on the lift , as the flow is accelerated locally , reducing the static pressure below the wing , having a lift reduction , but is a local effect . This also have an influence on the wing lift distribution and a small effect on drag ... lower than the one directly produced by the landing gear itself . Now ... the cavities , they have a bigger influence , firstly because they have bigger extension parallel to the airplane surface ( the landing gear goes perpendicular to the airplane the cavity goes along the surface ) . Secondly , their flow behaviour is different , goes in and outside the cavity . I found this <URL> very good on this , but basically the flow behaviour is like these image : I found several flows similar to the second one , but depends on the airplane . You can see that flow will enter and go outside and will have a big influence . Finally , the biggest influence is found when the airplane is deploying or retracting the landing gears when you have changing conditions , difficult to predict and affecting the airplane dynamics . Usually you can notice it when landing or taking off , when landing gear is deployed you fell significant vibration on the airplane . Concerning your questions : How does the landing gear affect aerodynamics when deployed and when deploying ? There is a significant drag increase , slightly the lift , but also creates some unsteady behaviour affecting overall airplane mechanics creating vibrations ( anyhow , nothing not already taken into account ) . Is it different for aircraft whose landing gear do not retract into the wing ? I understand that you refer to airplane with non retractable landing gear . The effect is similar but usually the configuration tries to avoid having the landing gear close to the wing , as finally they do n't need to retract them back . Does this modify performance critical when taking off or landing such as stall speed , optimal climb speed ? Well , stall speed is usually defined by wing lift curve , and not so much affected by the landing gear . Usually the limitation is on the upper side due to separation . Climb speed is basically engine thrust minus drag , the drag increases the climb speed is lower . That 's why airplanes retract the landing gear as soon as possible .
They are designed to not stall at the tips first . Such a stall behavior would be highly problematic because it causes a pitch-up moment which exacerbates the stall . See the <URL> how nasty stalls with swept wings can become . <URL> describes the required stall characteristics : ( a ) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll and yaw by unreversed use of the aileron and rudder controls , up to the time the airplane is stalled . No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur . The longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the stall . In addition , it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls . Such a behavior is easiest to achieve when separation does not start at the wing tip . <URL> sometimes had trouble to achieve docile stall characteristics which led to the introduction of stick shakers . Today , changing the airfoil shape over span ( aerodynamic washout ) and wing twist ( geometric washout ) are combined to ensure that stall starts at the wing root . Regarding washout : With high-lift devices employed , the <URL> of the ailerons on the outer wing results in a strong effective washout . Here it is important to extend the slats over the outer wing to enable it to function well above the local angle of attack . The picture of an A300-600 below should illustrate the point . <URL> A300-600 in landing configuration ( picture <URL> ) But even in clean configuration some washout remains and allows the outer wing to fly at a lower lift coefficient which ensures a decent stall margin . A photo of an airliner wing on the ground might be misleading : The lift forces in flight will twist the swept-back wing such that washout is increased .
In an aircraft the brake pedals control the respective side brakes . This allows for the pilot to turn the aircraft not only with the pivoting nose wheel ( if it has one ) but also with the brakes . This allows for a very tight turning radius . <URL> ( <URL> ) If each pedals controls different sets of wheels eg the left wheels and the right wheels of the main gear , is that not a safety flaw rather than measure given that at any point in time , It is by design to allow for the tight turning . Some smaller aircraft also do not have a steerable nose wheel so differential braking is the only option . it is impossible for the pilot to apply an equal amount of pressure to the brakes ? Pushing equally on each toe pedal will result in equal brake operation . Is n't ABS enough to the point that only one pedal is enough . The pedals allow for brake steering which a single pedal would prevent . <URL> but that simply prevents the tires from skidding . Finally do both captain and pilot step on the brakes at landing . IF not then why have two pedals ? Im not sure , when I fly with an instructor or co-pilot in smaller planes only one person operates the brakes .
They do in fact exist , though they often use smaller helicopters . A Google search on the term " heli taxi " yields thousands of results , and while a lot are probably irrelevant , the first few pages give hundreds of operators around the world , ranging from companies ferrying passengers between airports and major cities to companies servicing oil platforms at sea , islands too small to have airfields , etc. .
Helicopters can fly the same standard IAPS . The visibility minimum is the greater of We use Category A 's MDA/DH . See the <URL> for more information . Also there are Copter IAPs ( example <URL> ) , and the viz/altitude minimums are stated on those plates .

Why is one of two parallel runways sometimes closed in foggy weather ?
While ILS is precise enough to guide the aircraft precisely onto the runway , it is only so precise in the immediate vicinity of the runway . The instrument measures angular divergence from the runway axis . So while the one dot offset is just a few metres over threshold , it is much more at the point where the aircraft normally intercept the localizer , which is usually at least 10 miles out for large aircraft . At KSFO the runways are so close to each other that while the localizer could perhaps ensure separation in the final phase of landing , it ca n't ensure it in the earlier part .
Best I can find , within the US , is KDFW with 80,403 ' of total length . Second seems to be KDEN with 76,000 ' . Glanced at KORD , and with mental math it comes up to about 71,000 ' . Most other major airports are well behind all of these , mainly because they do n't have as many long runways as DFW and DEN . Somebody else can consider Russian , Chinese , and Middle Eastern airports -- I do n't have the chart sets handy for those . May be worth converting this to a community wiki answer if any of those places give interesting results .
Imagine you have a 60 knot headwind . You have to fly an indicated airspeed of 60 knots and you can hover over the ground . If you want you can try it out in flight sim , it makes lots of fun . That 's called a STOL .
For the GA fleet , there is some historical precedent operating here . Years ago , engines were much less reliable than they are today . Dragging it in generally means that you can not glide it in if you have a complete power failure . This translates to saying in the event of an engine failure , you are landing off airport with limited selection of landing sites ( your altitude is low as you are now below pattern altitude ) . So if you are flying behind an old Curtis OX-5 in your Jenny , a gliding approach to landing was recommended back in the day . Engines are much more reliable today . After an analysis of landing accidents , the FAA determined that a stabilized approach to landing is less likely to result in an accident , and they changed their guidance accordingly . Stabilized approaches are partial power-on landings . Some old timers and some old time CFIs reject the FAA 's statistical analysis and still teach/fly glide-it-in landings . Properly executed , both approaches to landing are safe . It is just that the FAA thinks that stabilized approaches are safer given engines commonly in use today . It is also true that virtually all airlines require stabilized approaches in their operating specs , and that a go around is mandatory if the approach is not stabilized . With this in mind , flight schools that aspire to send their graduates to the majors will all teach stabilized approaches .
In observing the configuration of the current aircraft used for weather study , it 's important to also note that those planes were originally built for different missions that allowed modifications for such a special purpose . The P-3 was built as a maritime patrol plane , which is a role not all that different from weather observation . It requires good range and endurance to allow the plane to fly out to sea and remain there long enough to accomplish its mission . The primary mission is using sensors , either onboard or deployed from the aircraft . The plane must also be able to withstand more time spent at lower altitudes and in more turbulence than typical aircraft . The C-130 was built as a transport plane . This requires good range and payload capacity , both in weight and volume . These attributes have allowed it to serve in many roles , such as <URL> , <URL> , and <URL> . As both aircraft were originally built for the military , they are built to withstand higher loading than typical civilian aircraft , which is useful when flying to bad weather . 4 engines are <URL> but provide redundancy - Both aircraft have 4 engines , as this is a good compromise between size of engine and propeller for this size of aircraft , at the time at which they were designed ( around 1960 ) . <URL> . The plane is required to be able to fly with one engine failed , and controllable with two on the same wing failed . Turboprops are efficient at moderate speed - Both aircraft are also powered by turboprops . The primary roles for the aircraft do not require high speeds or altitudes , which is where turbofans have an advantage . Turboprops provide good power and efficiency at moderate speeds and altitudes , which is acceptable for shorter cargo missions and maritime patrols as well as weather observation . It 's worth noting that the US Navy is replacing the P-3 with the P-8 , which is a twin engine jet aircraft . A large part of this is likely due to the availability of an existing aircraft design , not being worth the cost of designing an entirely new plane . Although two engines provide less redundancy , they can still provide a similar level of reliability . <URL> Although turbofans may require more fuel , they do allow higher speeds which allows the aircraft to reach its station faster . Low wing may be a more versatile configuration - The high wing of the C-130 is mainly to allow easy loading and unloading of cargo by keeping the fuselage closer to the ground . This is less important for a weather observation role , though it does allow better downward visibility from the cabin . The P-3 sits higher above the ground , which allowed for a radar to be mounted underneath . Mounting sensors on top is <URL> but may require <URL> to retain stability . One might conclude that a low wing offers more versatility in this regard . Moderate aspect ratio with sweep to match speed - The <URL> will depend on the speeds for which the aircraft is designed . Low aspect ratios and high sweep or delta wings are good for reducing drag at higher speeds . There is no need for very high speeds in a weather observation aircraft , so these would seem to be poor choices . High aspect ratio and low sweep are good for reducing drag at lower speeds , which can maximize endurance . Though endurance is important for weather observation , these designs also have higher wing bending and generally lower top speeds . Both the C-130 and P-8 have moderate aspect ratios and low sweep , which offers a good compromise for strength and efficiency . Jet aircraft fly faster and generally use moderate sweep and aspect ratio . Conventional tails can be more robust - T-tails have some issues with <URL> , and this prevents them from being used in most cases . The T-tail is mainly useful when the normal position of the horizontal stabilizer is taken up by engines or cargo doors , or would place it too close to wash the engines , or if efficiency is a high priority . Control and stability are particularly important when flying in adverse weather conditions , so if there is no other reason for having a T-tail , a conventional tail works better . All of the aircraft mentioned above have conventional tails .
Airport Capacity At major airports the capacity of the system of runways is the most restricting element . While it is usually possible to increase capacity of the other airport elements or adding a new runway ( plus associated taxiways ) is very expensive and takes a very long time to complete . The runway capacity is the principal cause of most extreme instances of delays that lead to widespread schedule disruptions , flight cancellations and missed flight connections . The runway capacity varies greatly from day to day and changes are difficult to predict ( even a few hours in advance ) . Factors : The capacity of the runway system depends on several factors , the most important ones : Mix of aircraft classes using the airport : the aircraft mix indicates composition of aircraft fleet that is using any particular runway ( e.g. 25 % S , 60 % L and 15 % H ) . Separation requirements imposed by the ATM system : due to wind tip vortices , leading aircraft and trailing aircraft must be separated by a determined distance ( Heavy aircraft are the ones that produce more wake turbulence ) . Type and location of exits from the runway : trailing aircraft of any pair can not touch down on the runway before leading aircraft is clear of the runway . High-speed runway exits ( also well placed runway exits ) reduce runway occupancy times for arriving aircraft . Mix of movements on each runway and the sequencing of the movements : specified for all combinations of consecutive operations ( arrival-departure ) . There 's an important trade-off between maximum arrival and departure rates that an airport can achieve . Lateral separation : ( especially in bad weather ) between aircraft approaching the same airport on parallel runways . Sequencing and separation of departing and landing aircraft on runways that intersect . Sequencing of aircraft approaching airports located in close proximity to one another , where one aircraft must cross the path of another aircraft landing at a nearby airport . Direction and strength of winds . Noise-related and other environmental considerations and constraints . Conclusion : It is difficult to predict the capacity of the runway system of an airport , so it is difficult to compare two airports with similar runway characteristics , since the factors depending on the airport capacity involve different design and operational parameters . Furthermore , everything is subject to the important probabilistic factor , the weather , which makes the prediction and comparison of airport capacity even more difficult .
I lived and flew in North Dakota for about three years . While I was there , people talked about ( and I experienced ) the delightful mixture of snow and dirt called snirt . It can be the result of plowing sanded roads , and also can be caused by the high winds that come out of Canada blowing dirt from fields onto areas still covered in snow . <URL> . I have a feeling that 's what was described by your friend . It appears in Wikipedia 's <URL> , but as far as I am aware it is not an FAA or NOAA term .
Generally , it is more efficient to have one large than two small devices . The twin fan solution not only needs a gearbox and driveshafts that a single fan solution does without , it also has more intake and nozzle surface area per cross section than the single fan . This will cause more viscous losses and lower efficiency . The only advantage would be if size limitations make a single fan impossible , but in that case it would be more straightforward to have each fan driven by its own core engine . Famous examples of aircraft which used a <URL> would start with the <URL> models , all of which had a single engine drive two propellers via bicycle chains . But the list is short . The list of opposite designs where <URL> would drive a <URL> or fan would probably be longer , and my favourite from this list is the <URL> .
<URL> Frankfurt Airport ; a mosaic of concrete and asphalt The runways at Frankfurt Airport are asphalt ( old satellite imagery shows that they were concrete before ) , and the airport handles plenty of Superjumbos , the Airbus A380 , so it 's not a matter of handling heavy planes . All runways in big airports , even those covered in asphalt , have reinforced concrete foundations that vary in depth . They 're deepest where the touchdown zones are located , shallower elsewhere . That 's why runway extensions usually just add extra takeoff distance , but the landing zones remain the same , creating a <URL> . <URL> Displaced threshold ; can exist for other reasons <URL> Zoom in You 'll see almost all the parking spots and holding areas for the runways are concrete , as well as the runway exits . This is where a plane is expected to be stationary . Concrete handles such stationary loads pretty well , while on a warm day the asphalt would deform . Asphalt is called a flexible surface ; concrete is called a rigid surface . <URL> ( PCN ) is a standard used in combination with the <URL> ( ACN ) to indicate the strength of a runway , taxiway , or apron ( ramp ) . Exposed concrete is notorious for cracking when exposed to extreme high and low temperatures . It 's also more expensive to install and repair . But overall can be cheaper to install if you 're already laying down concrete elsewhere , like most new airports , they just go for concrete everywhere , but it depends on where that new airport is located -- <URL> Hot Dubai ; asphalt almost everywhere except parking areas and hold short areas <URL> LAX ; good climate and budget ; concrete almost everywhere a plane touches The variables come down to climate , use , load , budget , job creation , maintenance , etc. . <URL> A single runway ( like at <URL> ) can also have both surfaces <URL> <URL> showing the PCN for all runways ; Flexible and Rigid <URL> ( <URL> ) Another point in favor of an asphalt runway , is that it 's more gentle on the tires during touchdown ( since it 's flexible ) . You can find runway data at <URL> for US airports , elsewhere you 'll need to check the airport 's <URL> , like <URL> for Amsterdam ; check the section 2.12 RUNWAY PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS . Or try searching for a nonofficial runway data repository , there could be one .
Yes , paint imposes a significant weight penalty on larger aircraft . On commercial airliners , that weight translates to a reduction in cargo , passenger and fuel carrying capacity , and that means less money to be made on every flight . That is why some airlines have chosen to remove most of the paint and opt for the bare-metal look . However , there are tradeoffs to be considered , such as the fact that bare metal is much more susceptible to corrosion . These days removing paint from an aircraft is a relatively straightforward proposition if you know what you are doing . There are a number of environmentally-friendly paint stripping chemicals available that when applied to the aircraft surface , cause the paint to bubble and lift off the underlying airframe . The paint can then be scraped off with plastic tools or removed with a pressure washer , and the stripping chemical is washed off . Other products are then used to clean remaining residue , treat the metal for corrosion protection , prime and paint . This explanation is intentionally simplistic , but it covers the basics to answer your question . If you want to see the process in action , you might check the many YouTube videos that show time-lapse recordings of aircraft being painted . Personally . I think they are fun to watch . :)
Practically speaking , the ' heavy ' designator ( ' super ' for A380 and An225 ) is to help enforce separation requirements due to wake turbulence . In case of AF1 , it is not as if other aircraft are going to be allowed near it , so the designator is redundant . Regulation wise , FAA <URL> , specifically states that the ' heavy ' designator should not be used : When in radio communications with " Air Force One " or " Air Force Two , " do not add the heavy designator to the call sign . State only the call sign " Air Force One/Two " regardless of the type aircraft .
The flying boom method uses a rigid boom which is " flown " by an operator in coordination with the pilot in order to make a connection with a receptacle on the second aircraft . The boom is retracted when not in use . Though <URL> if it comes in contact with an aircraft , <URL> . The probe and drogue method uses a trailing hose with a basket on the end . Pilots will guide a probe on their aircraft into the basket to connect with the hose . The hoses are retracted when not in use . Though the crew has less control of the drogue , which <URL> , there is less danger to the aircraft than from a boom , and it could allow the aircraft to stay further away from the tanker . The boom method was developed early on in the Cold War , when <URL> . They needed a method that would transfer fuel as fast as possible in order to reduce the time it took to transfer the large amounts of fuel needed . Because the boom is rigid , it is capable of a higher transfer rate . The importance of bombers meant that SAC got their way , and the KC-135 fleet was equipped with booms . Today , almost all US Air Force planes capable of aerial refueling use the boom system . The US Navy on the other hand , along with most aircraft in other countries , uses the drogue system . Though this method is not capable of the high transfer rates of a boom , it is much more flexible . A refueling aircraft may only be fitted with one boom , and this requires extra design work and integration with the fuselage . The drogue system , on the other hand , is more simple , and does not need a dedicated operator . This means that it can be more easily fitted to the refueling aircraft , even <URL> , and larger aircraft can have multiple drogues . Another point is that smaller aircraft such as fighters are not capable of receiving fuel at the full rate the boom provides , so they have less benefit from the system . Although a boom can have a <URL> , this still commits the tanker to one aircraft at a time and one type of system per flight . Also , aircraft such as helicopters <URL> . When the Air Force was looking at a replacement for its tanker fleet in the early 2000s , a <URL> to determine what standard the new tanker should support . The report suggests some options for the best combination of methods . In the end , the Air Force selected the <URL> for the contract , which will include both the boom and the drogue options for refueling . This will provide better support to aircraft from other branches or countries , while maintaining support of the existing aircraft that use a boom .
Because there is no need for more engines . Though one can argue that losing one engine in a twin results in loss of half the thrust , the question is how often does that happen . Engine reliability has improved significantly through the years and engine failures are quite rare today . I 'm not sure how ground clearance is an advantage for quads . For quad engined aircraft using today 's high bypass turbofans , the inboard engines would have to be mounted higher for suffecient ground clearance - this is actually a disadvantage as it results in a longer landing gear . In aircraft , more engines means more ( cost and ) maintenance and in a way , more things to fail , as there are more subsystems . In effect , there is no great reliability advantage of quads over twins . One main reason for having more than two engines , ETOPS certification , is no longer relevant . In fact most of the longest routes in the world are flown by the 777 , a twin . The best way is to look at the market - there are no quad engined aircraft under development and most of the aircraft in order are twins ( A380 and 747-8s are struggling to get orders ) . This clearly shows that the customers prefer twin engines over quads .
The optimization problem is unchanged from the all engines operative ( AEO ) cruise optimization . You should still : Climb as high as practical ( <URL> , thinner air is better for range ) Set the lift coefficient such that drag is minimized for propeller aircraft ( $ c _ { Di } = c _ { D0 } $ ) . For turbojets , minimize energy per flight time ( $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ cdot c _ { D0 } $ ) . For turbofans , pick a value between those two extremes . For the computation of the theoretical optimum polar point please see <URL> for a complete derivation including wind , or <URL> for a shorter explanation . Your flight altitude will certainly be lower , because you need to generate more thrust on the remaining engine ( requiring higher density ) , which in turn will result in a lower TAS ( true air speed ) . The CAS ( calibrated airspeed ) should stay about the same , however . The configuration ( flaps , gear ) should stay unchanged , only rudder deflection will be added for <URL> compensation . The resulting sideslip will increase the zero-lift drag of the airplane a little , so a slightly lower speed than in the AEO case would result . In the unlikely case that the required density will result in an altitude below ground level , you will need to slow down and need to set flaps to stay airborne , and now the new optimum with flaps will result in a markedly higher lift coefficient because deploying flaps will increase the zero-lift drag quite a bit . If you have the flaps-down polar , the optimum is easy to find .
The FAA publishes the <URL> database . This is an official , authoritative data set that covers all airports , airways , routes and navigation aids under FAA jurisdiction . The data files are not human-readable though and require special software to display . Other civil aviation authorities in other countries have similar products . Some are available for free , some are not . Many countries claim intellectual property rights on their data and it can be quite difficult to get at/use it . Some companies like <URL> do this collection for you : they have agreements with aviation authorities , obtain each authority 's data sets ( like the FAA 's NASR linked above ) , and compile all of them into a single large database . This database is then reprocessed in forms usable by avionics like GPS receivers or Flight Management Systems ( FMS ) . These countries charge a significant fee for this service , and there are licensing terms that limit your use of the data . The fee is substantial depending on the format you get the data in ( up to thousands of dollars or more for FMS systems for large transport aircraft ) and puts the dataset out of reach of a casual user . The U.S. Department of Defense publishes the <URL> which is a similar compilation of worldwide data . This database used to be available publicly for free , but is now restricted to Department of Defense personnel ( it is not classified but it is not available to the public ) . There are many websites based on one or more of the datasets above , but as noted in comments , these websites are not official or authoritative . They also generally have their own license terms that limit the way you can use the information and that prevent you from downloading the database in bulk . This all stems from the intellectual property claims made by many civil aviation authorities . It costs countries a lot of money to maintain the data and they want to be able to generate some revenue from it . So the bottom line is that for some regions like the United States , official data is readily and freely available ; for other regions , not so much . ( And among developed countries , the U.S. is the exception ; most do not offer their data freely . ) To get data for these other regions , or to create a global dataset , would involve a lot of effort and money ( beyond the reach of a normal individual ) . Companies that do this work for you charge hefty fees to provide the data to you .
Runways are usually numbered according to their direction , more precisely called runway magnetic bearing or QFU ( <URL> ) . Consider a plane flying toward the runway on final approach in a day without any wind . Divide its magnetic heading by 10 , round it to the nearest whole number and you 'll usually get the runway number . For example , if the magnetic heading is 345 ° then 345/10 = 34,5 , so the runway number will be 35 which will be a runway used for landings ( and takeoffs ) to the north . Opposite ends of the same runway have different numbers , 18 ( which represents 180 degrees ) apart . A runway with 35 for landings to the north will have runway 17 for landings to the south . Even though these are the same strip of concrete , they are treated as separate runways by pilots and controllers . If there are two airports near one another with runways at the same angle , sometimes one of the airports will add or subtract one from the runway number to help planes differentiate between the airports . Occasionally a runway number will change when the magnetic declination angle changes in such amount , making the runway magnetic bearing divided by 10 and rounded to the nearest whole number increase or decrease . Some runways in areas of large magnetic declination use true instead of magnetic headings for the runway numbers . This is not unusual in northern Canada and Greenland . When there is more than one parallel runway at an airport , L , R , or C may be appended to the runway number for Left , Right , or Center . These are based on the approach direction , so , for example , the runway 35L would be called 17R from the opposite direction .
This depends on how the systems are plumbed , and while this is likely an exception , for some airplanes like the EMB-145 , the answer is yes . The EMB-145 has 2 hydraulic systems . System # 1 serviced the outboard brakes and system # 2 serviced the inboard brakes and the parking brake . The parking brake actuated all of the brakes and this let you transfer fluid between the systems through the outboard brakes . This is n't a normal procedure , but one maintenance would walk you through if you had low fluid in one system and more than you needed in the other to balance the systems if you were out somewhere without the ability to service the hydraulic fluid . The procedure was either Depress and hold toe brakes Set parking brake Release toe brakes Release parking brake or the opposite , depending on which way you wanted to transfer fluid . This works in flight or on the ground ( <URL> )
They need the throughput . Got to use what you have . They utilize their crossing runways to the full under any conditions that allow it . Major commercial airports try to have as many parallel runways as possible , as crossing runways are a hassle . ( See DFW , ATL , LAX , many other examples of new or remodelled major airports using almost exclusively parallel runways ) . But sometimes ( for any number of reasons , a main one at LGA being space ) parallel runways have n't been built , so they ca n't be used .
Several reasons : A380s are really expensive . Unit cost for an A380 , depending on interior appointments , is about \ $ 375 million . The 747-8 is about \ $ 357 million . The 777-300ER is about \ $ 320 million , the last variants of the A340 about \ $ 275 million , and the 787 about \ $ 200 million . The 380 might be the biggest airliner ever to fly , but it 's also the most expensive . Keep in mind these jets ca n't fly every day , requiring you to buy a couple more than the schedule requires and rotate them in as maintenance is required on each airframe . That means A380 operators have at least one three hundred and eighty million dollar airframe sitting on the tarmac not making money on any given day ( in fact , up to 55 days at a time for the 6-year " D check " maintenance , not counting lower-level maintenance performed more often as well as any unscheduled maintenance ) . Airbus could not/cannot build them fast enough to meet initial orders in a timely manner . Airbus received 189 initial A380 orders prior to the airframe 's scheduled start of production in 2007 , plus 27 A380F variant orders , and has received 128 since production began ( though the freighter orders were cancelled ) . To date , it 's only delivered about half due to a combination of issues found during full-scale production that delayed ramp-up , and currently its pace is about 30 planes a year , giving it about a 3 year backlog of remaining orders ( some of which have been sitting in the build queue for 10 years ) . It initially prioritized passenger variants for Emirates , which put in the largest single order ( almost half of total orders ) to handle that airline 's primarily long-haul schedule . As a result , everyone else got pushed off until many ( including FedEx and UPS which were waiting for freight versions ) cancelled their orders and went to Boeing for 747-8Fs or 777-ERFs . Jumbos represent a serious cost-revenue risk that most airlines are no longer willing to gamble on . You use a jumbo jet when you need to move a lot of people at one time . That typically means a high-demand , long-distance route that calls for nonstop service , but that you do n't want to have to fly any more times than you have to . 747s used to be used for high-volume domestic connectors in the US during and immediately after the regulation era , between major cities like New York , Chicago , LA , Houston , Miami etc. . They were also used for major intercontinental flights , primarily because regulations required more than two engines for trips extending a certain distance beyond the nearest divert field . However , the 747 is a 50-year-old design with only incremental improvements made in efficiency . Four engine jets in the modern air transport market require you to fill the plane every time , and with ETOPS-rated two-engine widebodies now making many of the same flights that previously required three or more engines , the A380 , even with the most efficient engines ever put on a commercial airliner , is at least three decades late to the jumbo party , and is entering the market at a time when the 747 is being phased out of most fleets in favor of more economical widebodies . The A380 was designed for an air travel market that has n't materialized . Airbus was betting big ( NPI ) on airport congestion and increased passenger counts during the 80s and 90s requiring a shift to fewer flights on larger-capacity planes to reduce pattern and gate congestion . Except for a few major metropolitan areas that simply can not grow their airports anymore ( O'Hare , LaGuardia/JFK , Heathrow etc ) that has n't really been the case . 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis have seen passenger counts plummet from post-regulation highs , which has reduced total flights and allowed smaller planes which are more efficiently scheduled . In addition , Denver opened up the largest airport by land area in the world ( so it has plenty of room to grow ) , while Atlanta , Dallas , Charles de Galle and others are busy primarily because they 're massive complexes with efficient layouts that can support a major airline 's hub operations . The use of jumbos in general is therefore very risky , and many airlines , in addition to passing on the A380 , are phasing out the venerable 747 that was previously unchallenged in this class , in favor of something a little more economical in the next smaller widebody class , like the 777 , 787 , A340 or A350 . That was Boeing 's bet , that smaller , high-efficiency jets would be the wave of the future over pure size , and it seems to be paying off as Boeing , despite higher production capacities , has more 787 orders than it has capacity for the foreseeable future , while Airbus 's competing A350 is more or less getting the overflow ( and it ca n't even meet that demand ; 700 orders , 5 produced ) . The A380 really does n't solve the problem it was created for , and in fact causes more problems for airports than it solves . A super-heavy like the A380 creates monumental wake turbulence that poses a danger to other planes , which requires ATC to space following traf
Dogfight is about energy management . You care less about climbing than about being able to turn your nose and weapons into the right direction as quickly as possible without falling out of the sky . Maximum climb would be required in those scenarios : Fly as efficiently as possible . Flying higher means flying faster and in colder air , so the engines are <URL> . Note that todays airliners climb as fast or faster than fighter aircraft in WW II . Evade ground threats . After delivering its ordnance , an attack aircraft would desire to get away from hostile fire as quickly as possible . Sometimes this is achieved by flying with the <URL> , though . Break off combat : If you know you can climb faster than your opponent , you can choose whether you fight or get away , a luxury the other guy does not have . Intercept : If you were ordered to intercept an unknown aircraft flying high above , maximum climb speed is helpful . If you need to be fast as well , your optimum climb profile is that of <URL> , though . I interpret minimum rate of climb as maximum descent rate . Typical scenarios are : Pressure loss in an airliner , when higher density air should be reached in order to <URL> . Dropping parachutists : If the aircraft lands ahead of the skydivers , it can fly more often and earn more revenue . Extreme case : Dive bombing . Actually , most dive bombers employed air brakes to limit the speed in a dive .

How minimum runway length is calculated for PAC P-750 XSTOL ?
You ca n't , at least not on the basis of the POH you linked . Taking off with 0 ° flaps for that aircraft is outside the POH limitations chapter . 2.20 Flap Limitations : Approved flap ranges . TAKEOFF FLAP : 20 ° LANDING FLAP : 40 ° 4.27 Amplified Procedures - Normal Takeoff ) : A wing flap setting of 20 ° is recommended for all takeoffs . 20 ° flap will provide the best takeoff performance . The Normal Takeoff technique is to be used for Short Field operations and is the technique used to derive the performance data in Section 5 .
Takeoff Field Length The " FAR " Takeoff Field Length determined from the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual ( AFM ) considers the most limiting of each of the following three criteria : 1 ) All-Engine Go Distance : 115 % of the actual distance required to accelerate , liftoff and reach a point 35 feet above the runway with all engines operating : 2 ) Engine-Out Accelerate-Go Distance : The distance required to accelerate with all engines operating , have one engine fail at $ V _ { EF } $ at least one second before $ V_1 $ , continue the takeoff , liftoff and reach a point 35 feet above the runway surface at $ V_2 $ speed : 3 ) Accelerate-Stop Distance : The distance required to accelerate with all engines operating , have an engine failure or some other event at $ V _ { EVENT } $ at least one second before $ V_1 $ , recognize the event , reconfigure for stopping and bring the airplane to a stop using maximum wheel braking with the speed brakes extended . $ V_1 $ Speed $ V_1 $ is the speed chosen by the manufacturer as " the pilot 's initiation of the first action to stop the airplane during the accelerate-stop tests . " Note that this is particularly important in that it is not a takeoff decision speed as some pilots like to think of it . The decision must have been made prior to $ V_1 $ so that there is time to react by $ V_1 $ . This speed is chosen by the manufacturer and must be between the engine failure speed1 and rotation speed . Within this range , they could choose any speed , but typically they choose the speed which gives a balanced field length ( see next section ) . There are also other factors to consider such as the maximum brake energy limit ( $ V _ { MBE } $ ) which will prevent $ V_1 $ from being too high . Balanced Field Length If we takeoff from a fixed length runway ( like , say one that matches the Takeoff Field Length from above ) , changing the $ V_1 $ speed will affect the weight that we can successfully continue the takeoff or abort within the available runway . At a particular weight , a lower $ V_1 $ will enable us to stop sooner if we abort but will take more distance to continue the takeoff . A higher $ V_1 $ will require more distance to stop but will take less distance to continue . If we graph these values , there will be a point where the $ V_1 $ speeds for the abort/continue lines meet , and this is known as the balanced field length . It is the value typically given in the AFM : This is nice because it gives the pilot one important number to remember instead of different stop/continue $ V_1 $ 's . If they were to choose an extremely low $ V_1 $ as in your question , then it would require considerably more runway in order to continue the takeoff than if it were higher , and it would not be balanced . Some AFM 's do include separate charts for accelerate-go and accelerate-stop though so you could figure out exactly how much runway that you would need if the engine failed at a lower airspeed . Rotation Speed $ V_R $ is determined independently from $ V_1 $ , and if it is ever less than $ V_1 $ then it must be raised to be equal to $ V_1 $ . References The regulatory information for takeoff performance on transport category aircraft is listed in <URL> , 25.101 - 25.113 . Of particular interest for this question would be <URL> and <URL> An easier to read document is the FAA 's <URL> which covers this and a lot more . Much of my answer was taken directly from this document , and I would highly recommend anyone that is flying a multi-engine aircraft to read the entire thing . 1 $ V _ { EF } $ itself must be above the minimum controllable airspeed on the ground plus acceleration while the pilot reacts to the engine failure .
I suspect that you 're thinking of <URL> that took effect from June 30th , 2010 . Before the change , a taxi clearance could indeed allow you to cross multiple runways , but now you can only be cleared to cross one runway at a time : This change establishes the requirement that an explicit runway crossing clearance be issued for each runway ( active/inactive or closed ) crossing and requires an aircraft/vehicle to have crossed the previous runway before another runway crossing clearance may be issued . At airports where the taxi route between runway centerlines is less than 1,000 feet apart , multiple runway crossings may be issued after receiving approval by the Terminal Services Director of Operations . It was a big change at the time ( according to what I 've read ) and it was widely publicized by the FAA and other organizations . The relevant ATC instructions are in the <URL> 3-7-2 : Aircraft/vehicles must receive a clearance for each runway their route crosses . An aircraft/vehicle must have crossed a previous runway before another runway crossing clearance may be issued . The orders have several examples and the corresponding phraseology .
When nearing their destination , pilots will be checking weather and <URL> . This will let them know which runways are being used for landings and what type of approaches are being used . ATC will also tell each aircraft what runway and approach they can expect in advance , as in your example , " Expect ILS approach runway 24 left " . Once the pilots know the runway and approach , they can reference the corresponding chart ( like the ones in <URL> ) . Pilots are required to have these charts available , traditionally paper copies but more recently being replaced by <URL> . This will give them all of the information about the procedure , including the localizer frequency . Besides programming the frequency , the crew will also review the other important requirements of the approach and landing . ATC does have access to this information as well , and can provide it if they feel they need to confirm the pilot has the right frequency , or if the pilot asks .
FAA <URL> talks a little about this ( you want Appendix 2 , " Wind Analysis " ) . Basically you start by figuring out what kind of aircraft you want to operate at the airport , and establishing some basic wind limits ( specifically , the maximum crosswind and tailwind components you want to deal with ) . Then you call up NOAA 's " National Climate Data Center " , tell them where you 're looking to build your airport , and see if they can have wind data for the location you 're looking to build on . If NOAA does n't have data you have a couple of other options -- another nearby airport 's wind analysis can be used ( if the topography does n't vary that much and the wind analysis is " recent " ) , or you may have to perform a wind survey which basically means placing a <URL> on the site to record the wind speed and direction for a year . Armed with collected wind data you tally up the number of observations in given wind speed ranges and mark them down on a " wind rose " . You then place your runway ( s ) on the wind rose so that they 're aligned with the prevailing winds and determine your " wind coverage " - the amount of time the winds at your site are within your crosswind and tailwind limits . The advisory circular I linked to shows you how to do this by hand , but there 's also software to do this which is how most folks do it . <URL> which will generate the wind rose and runway/crosswind limit bars for you . Note that this is just the wind part . As you 've alluded to there are a number of other considerations , like terrain : If the prevailing winds favor runway 36 , but runway 36 points right at a mountain a mile from the field you might have to align the runway 33 or 03 and sacrifice a perfect headwind for not having pilots fly into the mountain . Also as ratchet mentioned the airspace around your proposed site may influence your runway layout and types of operations . <URL> and a process to go through to ensure that your airport is not deemed <URL> . Also as you alluded to in your question there are other considerations like density altitude ( local temperature and humidity trends ) which will influence design factors like runway length - there 's another advisory circular ( <URL> ) that talks about runway design criteria , including length considerations . For even more than you ever wanted to know about airport design you can check out <URL> , which all deal with airports in some way ( there are ACs on design , construction , markings , lighting , ARFF , and even how to qualify for and obtain federal aid ) .
No , there is no legal minimum turnaround time . There are several technical reasons why an aircraft needs to stay on the ground for a while . Some of the ( already mentioned ) time consuming tasks are : Passenger ( de ) boarding , crew change , refueling , brake cooling , obtaining ATC clearance , visual inspection of the plane etc. .
When you have the thrust levers of , say , a 747 all the way back to idle , the airplane still has enough power to move . In fact , you will have to use the brakes to keep it from taxiing too fast . If you did n't use the brakes , it would finally accelerate to somewhere around 45 knots or so , far too fast for taxiing , but much too slow to take off . At the idle power setting , relatively little noise is produced by the engines . To take off , if the 747 were at max gross , you would have to accelerate to around 180 knots . That would require a power setting approaching the maximum , depending on the length of the runway . The noise produced by the engines is relative to the amount of power they 're producing . Hence , taxiing at idle produces little noise relatively speaking , on the runway taking off a whole lot of noise .
As you pointed out in your question , no book is a substitute for actual instruction in an aircraft with a flight instructor . That being said , doing your homework and knowing what your instructor is going to expect goes a long way toward completing your training in a timely manner . The books here are all great reference texts to be combined with a flight instruction curriculum . FAA Publications / Books for initial training A surprising number of new student pilots are not aware of the wealth of information the FAA has compiled and published to help people learn to fly . There is a whole series of <URL> that you can take advantage of which are available from the FAA as well as from a variety of publishers like <URL> . While all of the regulatory information is geared toward US/FAA regulations much of the technique information , signs &amp; markings , etc. will be universal , in conformance with ICAO rules . I list a whole bunch of them here , but you can find a wealth of information by googling what you want to do and the words " FAA Handbook " . Books on Flying the aircraft - maneuvers , etc. . Quite simply if it flies the FAA probably has a book about how you should fly it . These books cover basic flying technique and the maneuvers the FAA expects pilots to be able to demonstrate . The popular ones include : <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-3A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-21A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-13A ) <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-11A ) Books on " essential aviation knowledge " - Airport signs &amp; markings , " rules of the air " , etc. . <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-25A ) is the starting point here . <URL> is another key resource ( you will often find this as a combined " FAR/AIM " printed publication ) . Books for the more advanced stuff - Instrument ratings and beyond <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-15B ) and <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-16 ) are excellent references for pilots pursuing an instrument rating .
The standard way of marking a runway as " CLOSED " is to put a big giant on it - for fields which operate at night that needs to be lighted . The specifications for the runway closure marker are outlined in an <URL> The purpose of the marker is to indicate that the runway is temporarily closed ( either administratively , as is the case at DCA , or for construction/repair/maintenance ) . It is redundant with air traffic control measures ( such as NOTAMs ) indicating that the runway is out of service , in case some pilots did n't check NOTAMs or somehow managed to stumble into the airspace and happen upon the airport while it 's closed . ( Obviously in the case of DCA they would have other problems were they to wander blindly into the area without talking to anyone , but believe it or not it happens far more often than any of us would like . ) The big flashing does n't " stop " you from landing on the runway - it just tells you you really , really should n't be landing there . <URL> . The is also quite a bit bigger than you think it is to ensure it 's visible from the air ( the arms are 14 feet long ) : ( I was looking for a good aerial photo of one at night , but unfortunately could n't locate one . The intent is for the to be about the same size as runway numbers so there 's no good reason for a pilot to not see it . )
Yes , there are several systems . The simplest are REALLY BIG WINDOWS ( and binoculars ) : <URL> When the entire wall in front of you is an big expanse of glass looking out over the runway there 's a good chance you 'll notice something trying to roll onto the runway . Many runway incursions are detected visually . Really big windows do n't work as well when you have multiple runways and larger airport complexes though , so we have some technological solutions too . The most common is Automated Surface Detection Equipment ( ASDE ) , the one being deployed today is <URL> . This is basically " radar on the ground " which interrogates aircraft transponders and shows the controllers which aircraft are where on the airport surface : <URL> There are also systems on the ground designed to prevent incursions , but those are mainly for use by pilots . These include <URL> , <URL> ( which include " stop bars " that light up on hold-short lines ) , and " runway guard lights " ( which may be mounted either in the pavement or <URL> ) . Many of these systems can be controlled from the tower , either by automatic systems or manually by the controllers .
I do n't know if it is official , but across Europe , Middle East , Asia , and north Africa I hear using " turnpad " , and many ATC in these regions provide directions like " bactrack via turnpad and continue taxi via taxiway A " , that means go ahead to turnpad bactrack and vacate runway via taxiway A.
There is no set legal limit ( ultimately it is up to the PIC to decide ) but condition reports are available to pilots at many airports to assist in assessing takeoff and landing performance . The FAA has recently created a standardized way of reporting runway conditions through their TALPA ( takeoff and landing performance assessment ) initiative . TALPA is an improved way of assessing runway conditions , based on contaminant type and depth , which provides an aircraft operator effective means to anticipate airplane braking performance . The RCAM ( shown below ) is the tool airport operators use to report a runway surface assessment when contaminants such as water , ice , snow , slush , and others are present on runways , taxiways , and aprons . To find an updated RCAM look in Chapter 5 of Advisory Circular 150/5200 -30 , Airport Field Condition Assessments and Winter Operation Safety . The RwyCC is the runway condition code -- as you can see a code of 0 yields minimal to non-existant braking and/or directional control . <URL>
Balanced field length calculations by definition are the greater of three factors . As Lnafziger noted in his answer to the linked questions above these three factors are : 115 % All engine takeoff distance Accelerate-stop distance Accelerate-go distance The manufacturer will choose a $ V _ { 1 } $ speed that will all the accelerate-stop and accelerate-go distances to be as close as possible . This reduced the takeoff distance to the lowest possible since the takeoff distance is the greater of those three factors . This means that our takeoff distance must be less than certain declared distances . See the linked questions for a discussion on declared distances . The TORA value may or may not equal the runway length but it will never be greater than that length . The TODA is the TORA plus a clearway . The ASDA is the TORA plus a stopway ( it can be lower than the TORA value ) . Using common sense , our accelerate-go distance can not be greater than the TODA value and our accelerate-stop distance can not be greater than the ASDA value . If we take this one step further , since we have one number for takeoff and we do n't know if that number is limited by the accelerate-stop or accelerate-go performance we can not use the TODA value for the accelerate-go distance . We must use the TORA value . Hence , for multi-engine airplanes with balanced field length calculations we are limited to the lower of the TORA or ASDA values for our takeoff distance . As Aeroalias and Lnafziger pointed out , for unbalanced field length calculations we can indeed use the TODA value for the accelerate-go distance and the ASDA value for the accelerate-stop distance .

Yes , the <URL> is to provide a buffer zone for aircraft that leave the runway for whatever reason , including rejecting a take-off late or by overshooting on landing . It 's not specifically for an " emergency landing " : sometimes the emergency might only arise during the course of the landing , for example tyres bursting or pilot error . If it were only for emergency landings , then parallel runways probably would n't need to all have a RSA , because the distress aircraft could be offered the one runway that has one . But in fact every runway needs an RSA , because any landing might suffer a runway excursion .
A good engineer will first check existing designs : How much power is installed in comparable designs ? Use airplanes of similar speed and built quality , such as the <URL> which needs 50 to 60 hp . Cruise speed is 90 knots and the MTOW is 450 kg . Next , try to estimate the minimum wing area . Starting from the <URL> ( = 18 m/s ) , and assuming a maximum lift coefficient with flaps down of 1.6 , the area to support 340 kg at sea level is $ $ S = \ frac { 2 \ cdot m \ cdot g } { \ rho \ cdot c_L \ cdot v ^ 2 } = \ frac { 2 \ cdot 340 \ cdot 9.81 } { 1.225 \ cdot 1.6 \ cdot 18 ^ 2 } = 10.5 m ^ 2 $ $ Now calculate the drag coefficient in cruise , using the <URL> . First , establish the <URL> : $ $ c _ { L _ { opt } } = \ sqrt { c _ { D0 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ epsilon \ cdot AR } $ $ The total drag coefficient at this point is simply twice the zero-lift drag coefficient $ c _ { D0 } $ , so a low drag design is important . Still , with a fixed gear your zero-lift drag coefficient will hardly be lower than 0.035 , so your cruise lift coefficient is 0.938 ( assuming an aspect ratio $ AR$ of 10 and an Oswald factor $ \ epsilon $ of 0.8 ) , resulting in a flight speed of just 23.51 m/s = 45.7 kts . Total drag at this point is $ $ D _ { min } = 2 \ cdot c _ { D0 } \ cdot S \ cdot \ rho \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } = 249 N$ $ To sustain flight at this point only requires $ P = v \ cdot D$ = 5.85 kW , and assuming a prop efficiency of 0.75 , the installed power should be 7.8 kW . But you want to fly faster , so we need the drag at 100 kts ( = 51.4 m/s ) : $ $ D = \ left ( c _ { D0 } + \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ cdot \ epsilon \ cdot AR } \ right ) \ cdot S \ cdot \ rho \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } $ $ There , your lift coefficient is only 0.196 but the dynamic pressure rises to 1,621 N/mm ² . Since the Reynolds number is higher , your zero-lift drag could drop to 0.031 , resulting in a drag force of 550 N . At that speed , the required power is 28.3 kW . Under the heroic assumption that your prop will still be 75 % efficient at that speed , the installed power needs to be 37.8 kW or 50.65 hp . If you " only " want to achieve a TAS of 100 kt at altitude , here is what you need to do in the case of cruise at 10,000 ft ( = 3048 m ) . First you need the density at that altitude , which is <URL> . This means that the dynamic pressure is 1,191 N/mm ² and the lift coefficient 0.267 , resulting in a drag force of 419 N . This needs a continuous power of 21.56 kW to overcome . Now I assume the 75 % efficient propeller again and that you run the engine at 75 % of max . power , so the installed power in 10,000 ft should be at least 38.3 kW or 51.4 hp . Assuming a normally aspirated engine , this would translate to a rated power of 70 hp at sea level . Considering that similar designs require similar power , this looks about right . Normally , you now need to compute the climb speed with the excess power of 35.15 kW to check how usable this design is , but at 10.5 m/s I doubt this will be not enough . If you manage to include a retractable gear with your limited mass budget , the zero-lift drag might be as low as 0.024 . Now the drag force in cruise at 10,000 ft will be only 324.4 N and the installed rated power at sea level only 40.4 kw or 54 hp . With piston aircraft , your power needs increase with the cube of airspeed . I leave it as an exercise to you to calculate how much more power the last 10 knots require : Repeat the calculation with only 90 kt cruise and your rated engine power can be as low as 51 hp with a fixed gear .
When an aircraft has been given a clearance to land on a runway , that runway is exclusively reserved for the landing aircraft . ( Except for LAHSO and " land after " operations , where only part of the runway is reserved for the landing aircraft ) . That means that no other aircraft or vehicle should be on that runway . In this case , clearly something went unplanned . Either the crossing aircraft was not given permission to cross , the landing aircraft no clearance to land , or ATC mistakenly cleared both the landing aircraft and the crossing aircraft to access the runway . Pilots should always check if the runway they are accessing is safe , and in this case the crew of the landing aircraft did apparently observe the incursion and aborted their landing . The crew of the crossing aircraft noticed the landing aircraft a bit late , but you hear their engines spool up as well as they cross . The sound of the go-around thrust arrives second later due to the difference in distance . The crossing aircraft seems to be taxiing toward the rising sun so they may have been blinded and missed the fact that they were crossing a runway .
There is quite a lot written on the topic , especially as part of " ground effect " vehicles research . For example , <URL> cite two different types of lift coefficient . The first one ( simpler and given here ) is based on flat plate airfoils and is a modification to the well-known $ \ frac { dC_l } { d \ alpha } = 2 \ pi $ : $ $ C_L = 2 \ pi \ alpha ( 1 + \ delta ^ 2 ) ( 1-2 \ zeta ) $ $ with $ $ \ zeta = \ frac { \ sin \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ and $ $ \ delta = \ frac { \ cos \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ In the above expressions , $ h $ is the height of the wing above the surface ( ground , water , etc. ) , $ c $ is the chord and $ \ alpha $ is the angle of attack . I strongly recommend you check out " ground effect " / " Ekranoplan " literature - should be useful .
LIPE - OMDB is only around 4,500 KM ( 2,800 NM ) according to <URL> , which is nowhere close to the 773ER max range of 14,500 KM ( 7,830 NM ) , so one can make an educated guess that the aircraft was n't at MTOW .
The answer will differ a bit from airfield to airfield but here is a <URL> ( EGNX ) . The inspection is carried out first thing in the morning and last thing at night , then at 2 hour intervals throughout the day . It is carried out by a vehicle in co-ordination with ATC who might shut the runway down for a few minutes . The vehicle must get permission from ATC to enter the runway and must report on leaving . Approach will co-ordinate the arrivals , by extending them slightly , so that no-one has to hold or go around ( hopefully ) . It is also possible to do half the runway as a departing aircraft lines up , leave the runway at a turn off , wait for the departing aircraft , then complete the inspection before the next departure . There are several ways to do it without causing disruption . The vehicle enters the runway and drives the complete length visually checking the items on the inspection list . The document gives you a complete list of items to check but essentially it is : Clear of FOD . Markings and signs in good condition and visible . Lighting working and undamaged . Runway surface not damaged . Oil and fuel spills .
I believe the answer , at least in the US is 20 hours of flight time , plus however long a checkride takes . A sport pilot can carry a single passenger and the minimum requirements are outlined in <URL> : If you are applying for a sport pilot certificate with [ ... ] Airplane category and single-engine land or sea class privileges , Then you must log at least [ ... ] 20 hours of flight time , including at least 15 hours of flight training from an authorized instructor in a single-engine airplane and at least 5 hours of solo flight training in the areas of operation listed in § 61.311 , If a sport pilot applicant logged exactly 20 hours , got signed off , and then passed their checkride on the first attempt ... they would be able to fly passengers as soon as they completed the checkride . That means , realistically , probably 21 to 21.5 hours .

What is the chord of a wing ?
the <URL> is the line stretching from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge parallel to the centerline . <URL> There are different variations to describe the chord of the whole wing . The Standard Mean Chord Defined as $ \ frac S b $ with $ S$ the surface area and $ b $ the span of the wing . This is not used in aerodynamics . The Mean Aerodynamic Chord Defined as $ \ frac2 S \ int_0 ^ { \ frac b 2 } c ( y ) ^ 2 dy $ with $ y $ the coordinate along the wing and $ c ( y ) $ the chord at $ y $ . For swept or delta wings this gives the equivalent chord for a rectangular wing , and is important for placing the Center of Gravity for stability .
Note : I am focusing on model of height-to-pressure relation in atmosphere , altimeter tries to follow and its limits of the model . There are , of course , limits of each particular instrument too , see answer by @ymb1 . [ EDIT : I have added more details on various uses of altitude and some more details what could be the limit for measuring absolute altitude ( it is not how thin air becomes , in fact ) , hope it answers your question better . ] Uses for altimeter reading Height displayed by common mechanical altimeter should be pressure converted according to the <URL> . This model makes few simplifications ( see the linked document for ex . ) , so it actually never gives exact height , except by chance . But as you are saying , it is anyway quite good approximation . When you are flying , there is few different reasons why you would need to look on altimeter . Obstacle avoidance , landing and maybe calculating final glide in glider . In this case it is really absolute height over terrain you need to know . To get this value you have to start with obtaining QNH , so already now altimeter itself is not enough ( in any altitude ) without external data . For greater precision you have to add more external data . You start with local temperature , but even then precision would be limited . The magnitude of error does not depend on your absolute altitude though , but ( in first approximation ) on height difference between airplane and station/place your QNH comes from . So you are lucky if you want to land . Given QNH comes from that particular airfield , your altimeter should read exact value just on touchdown . If you need to avoid obstacles at similar altitude , error will be likely acceptable for practical use . Again , it is not absolute altitude but relative difference what is causing this error . If you set QNH ( or runway altitude ) on airfield located 4000 ' above sea level and fly down to the see ( let 's say it is possible without traveling far away , so spatial change of air pressure is not an issue here ) , expected error of your altimeter will be similar as if you would fly 4000 feet up . It is because QNH ( pressure at the sea level ) is calculated based on the same model your altimeter is using , so model imperfections cancels out just at the altitude of this reference station . ATC , mid air collisions etc. . Absolute altitude is not important . Instead , you need to be sure that two pilots who see distinct values on their respective altimeters can expect not being at same altitude . For this purpose simplest model with minimum of external parameters works best . As it is of foremost importance that all altimeters involved converts pressure to height in the same way . ( Then , you need to expect pressure does not increase with altitude , but this is quite certain , as there will be always less air mass above you pressing down when you go upwards ) . Absolute altitude is completely unimportant here , or , for flying closer to terrain simple QNH-based offset will do . ( Otherwise STD pressure setting is used . ) Even simple altimeter ( in range of its physical limits of measurable pressure ) would work quite well for this purpose in any practical height . Aircraft performance and aerodynamics . That is service ceiling , choosing optimal cruise etc. . These parameters are usually denoted in altitude in a POH , but only for convenience . It is air density what matters for anything aerodynamic related . And air density is air pressure corrected to temperature . So " altitude " provided by pressure-based altimeter is " just right " for this purpose , you can correct it based on local temperature and you have the best possible value . Again , this will work in any height ( as long as POH and altimeter use same conversion between pressure and height ) . Note that for later two uses value provided by altimeter is actually better than , say , GPS-based height . Absolute altitude OK , what if you really want to know your absolute altitude in stratosphere or even higher . Is it possible to use your altimeter then ? If the altimeter converts pressure to height based on ISA ( true in most cases ) , the displayed value should be given by equation $ $ h = \ left ( 153.85 \ , { \ rm m \ cdot K ^ { -1 } } \ right ) \ cdot T_0 \ cdot \ left ( 1 - \ left ( p \ over p_0 \ right ) ^ { 0.19026 } \ right ) $ $ ( see the reference above ) , where $ T_0 $ is specified to be 288.15 K ( 15 ° C ) and $ p_0 $ is pressure you set in altimeter window . So , if you take such altimeter to space ( $ p = 0 $ ) it wo n't display more than 44 km ( or 145,000 feet ) , given it wo n't reach it 's physical/mechanical limits before . But , of course , the value becomes far from reality much earlier . Probably above the tropopause ( 10 -- 12 km ) , where assumption of constant temperature decrease with height used in this ISA model becomes completely invalid . You could improve the model , but it probably wo n't work too well without more external data . Nevertheless , problem is not that the air is thin . You can , in a way , measure air pressure even at low earth orbit few hundreds kilometer above ground

Please do not worry about the loss in lift . It is real , but so small that it can be neglected . A poor flap or aileron seal will cost you more in L/D than the dihedral ever will . The loss is proportional to the difference of the cosine of the dihedral angle to unity . With 5 ° ( which is on the upper end of typical values for low wing aircraft ) this is just 0.38 % . The exact amount of dihedral depends a lot on details of the configuration : Aspect ratio of the wing Fuselage size relative to wing root chord <URL> Directional stability In general , you need a <URL> between $ c _ { l \ beta } $ ( dihedral effect ) and $ c _ { n \ beta } $ ( weathervane effect ) .
I may have more news on that next week from Sun 'n Fun 2017 . Pipistrel will be an exhibitor at the show and may have a Panthera prototype on display . Currently the Panthera is planned to be released as an experimental kit and may be type certified at some point in the future . I know the program has suffered some setbacks , including an increase of empty weight by some 200 lbs . New aircraft development is never fast nor without complications . The Panthera does look intriguing - 200 KIAS on 10 GPH with good , stable flight characteristics and modern avionics , BRS parachute , etc. . I want to take it for a demo flight when production examples become available .
You are right , the horizontal tail of a conventional airplane appears to have a higher incidence , but the actual angle of attack is smaller than that of the wing . The wing , flying ahead of the tail , produces downwash , so the flow at the tail location has a distinct downward component . The downwash angle can be calculated from the lift coefficient and the geometry of the aircraft : To simplify things , let 's assume the wing is just acting on the air with the density $ \ rho $ flowing with the speed $ v $ through a circle with a diameter equal to the span $ b $ of the wing . If we just look at this stream tube , the mass flow is $ $ \ frac { dm } { dt } = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v $ $ Lift $ L$ is then the impulse change which is caused by the wing and equal to weight . With the downward air speed $ v_z $ imparted by the wing , lift is : $ $ L = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v \ cdot v_z = S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho $ $ $ S$ is the wing area and $ c_L $ the overall lift coefficient . If we now solve for the vertical air speed , we get $ $ v_z = \ frac { S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho } { \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v } = \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L \ cdot v } { \ pi \ cdot AR } $ $ with $ AR = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { S } $ the aspect ratio of the wing . Now we can divide the vertical speed by the air speed to calculate the angle by which the air has been deflected by the wing . Let 's call it $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { v_z } { v } \ right ) = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ A typical airliner cruise lift coefficient is 0.4 , and a typical aspect ratio is around 8 : This results in a downwash angle of nearly 2 ° if the lift distribution over span is elliptical . In reality , it is more triangular-shaped , so the downwash angle is larger near the center of the aircraft . Note that the engine nacelles of the <URL> are tilted 3 ° up to align them with the local flow . The resulting angle of attack is lower by those 3 ° , and if the angle of attack difference between wing and tail is less than that , the tail surface will appear angled upward . To achieve static stability , the tail will have to fly at a slightly <URL> .
Flaps change both the camber of a wing as well as its chord line and angle of attack . All the <URL> . You can see the camber line here in a retracted scenario <URL> And here in an extended scenario <URL> As for the why , flaps are generally used to allow you to slow an aircraft down at a give pitch angle . This allows the pilot to pitch the aircraft down without an increase in speed . Generally a pitch down ( given no other things are changed ) will result in an increase in speed . Flaps also change the <URL> of the wing as well as the <URL> <URL> <URL> All of this is a bit of an over generalization as there are <URL> and its worth looking into the different types and how they operate .
Bugs simply make instruments easier to read with a very quick glance . If I need to steer exactly 162 degrees , which is easier ? To read where the needle is pointing or just see if the needle is pointing to the bug which I manually set to 162 degrees ? The bugs are set by rotating knobs on the gauges . Here , the heading bug knob is in the lower right corner . <URL> The way I often use it is to turn onto the next heading required according to my plan , then set the bug to that heading so that I can simply glance at the needle ( still pointing to the bug , good ) to keep me on course . Other uses : If ATC gives you a " next heading " , you will read back the instruction , then you can set the bug to that next heading so that a ) , you do n't forget it and need to call back and b ) can simply turn onto the bug when it 's time to turn . Set it to the departure runway heading on take off . To " fly runway heading " , just keep the bug at the top of the gauge . On arrival , set it to the landing runway heading . As a " gross error " check . You would not believe how many inexperienced pilots set off in entirely the wrong direction . As well as setting the heading bug to " first leg of the plan " , you check this along with " and the road should be on my left with the river on my right " . On some simple autopilot systems , the autopilot follows the altitude and heading bugs rather than having controls for these settings on the autopilot itself .
The tanks are generally sealed with some kind of putty/resin/epoxy like material . Keep in mind that only the joints between exterior panels need to be sealed . On many aircraft this is done through inspection panels . The material is , in a manner of speaking painted/applied . Here is an example from a <URL> , which are <URL> <URL> ( <URL> ) Tanks on larger aircraft are not all that different , much like this one off a 747 <URL> ( <URL> ) its worth noting that tanks do n't need to be continuously open , they can have structures with in them as long as the fuel is free to flow around . Large and small tanks alike may very well have structural elements inside with flow holes drilled to allow fuel to move around . These elements also help reduce the effects of large quantities of fuel sloshing around as the aircraft changes attitude .
I think most people would say the answer is no . Consider the <URL> as it relates to Aeronautics : 9 . Aeronautics . a. one of a pair of airfoils attached transversely to the fuselage of an aircraft and providing lift . b. both airfoils , taken collectively . The wings are the big airfoils which are responsible for generating most of the vertical lift . A colloquial test of this definition would be to grab a CFI and ask him/her to " point out the wings on this airplane to me . " They wo n't point out the propeller . ( Not a scientific experiment ) However , both wings and propellers are airfoils ( and so are the other wing-like surfaces such as the vertical and horizontal stabilizers ) . You might get some disagreement about whether those other surfaces are wings , but I believe the answer is still no . There is nothing to be gained by calling them wings , and only leads to ambiguity . We already have a word which describes lifting surfaces in-general , and again , it 's airfoil .
It depends on what you mean by " optimal " . For a dogfight , the optimal age is probably 30 . At this age a person has lots of experience , but still maintains their full mental agility , ability to calculate and energy . In a dogfight your ability to think fast and calculate your next move is the critical factor . For combat missions , however , 40-45 may be more optimal , because experience , judgement and knowledge becomes more important . Knowing when to attack , how to attack , how to make your approach , how to do your mission setup , and many other things become the product of long experience . For complicated missions in enemy territory , it is better to have someone with long experience , rather than a young hotshot . Once a person hits about 60-65 years in age , their mental ability to calculate declines significantly . Nevertheless , experience can make up for it in some instances . For example , at age 63 <URL> was a candidate for the world chess championship , an amazing accomplishment for a person of that age . Emanuel Lasker took 3rd place at Moscow 1935 , a premier chess tournament , at the age of 66 , which was practically a miracle . These are exceptions , however . In general , once a person gets into their 60s , their mental ability deteriorates . Therefore , the age 50-55 can be considered the maximum age at which experience and judgement can be used effectively in high speed combat situations . Complex Mission Role To investigate my basic assertion that optimal age for a combat mission ( not air supremacy ) pilot is 40-45 I investigated pilot astronauts . Since astronauts are selected from large numbers of candidates and have short careers typically , it is a safe assumption that their average age is what NASA considers to be ideal . According to <URL> the mean age for all selected pilot candidates is 39.90 years old . If we assume a pilot has a 5-year career , then my guess for optimal age matches perfectly with NASA 's selection choices . This may be considered strong evidence that for a pilot executing complex missions , the optimal age range is , indeed , 40 to 45 years . Air Supremacy Role ( " dog fighting " ) To determine the optimal age for air supremacy ( " dog fighting " ) , if we had access to the USAF 's ( or other country 's ) exercise data over time , we might get an idea since we could calculate an ELO rating for each combatant and identify to the top exercise fighters of all time . Unfortunately this kind of data is not released as far as I know , probably because the armed services do like naming or identifying particular soldiers . I do strongly suspect , though , that if such a study was done it would show the " best in the world " air supremacy pilots would be clustered around the age of 30 . To check this , I tried summarizing statistics from WW2 German fighter pilots . Using birth data on 470 German aces I generated the following plot : In this chart , the bar chart is the total number of aces grouped by date of birth . The blue dots are the average number of victories for that birth year group . What this chart seems to show is that performance is remarkably consistent between the ages of 18 and 32 , with a slight advantage to the younger pilots , but then declines significantly . The 1922 group was significantly skewed by <URL> . If we eliminate him as an outlier , the top group is the class of 1920 which would have been between the ages of 19 and 25 during the war . This seems to show my original guess was wrong , and that dogfighting is dependent more on quick reflexes and fast thinking than on experience , which hands the edge to the young .
My experience transitioning from airplanes to helicopters and then to gliders is that I never forget what I 'm flying . I know that sounds obvious , but its no different than the difference between driving a car with automatic transmission and manual , riding a motorcycle which has all the controls in a different place than a car and <URL> , and flying an airplane . I do n't reach for the throttle when I want to slow down in a car , and I do n't turn the wheel in the direction of the turn when I 'm riding a motorcycle . Similarly , when taking off in an airplane , I know I have to add power and pull back a bit to get it off the ground , and in a helicopter I inch the nose forward to gain <URL> . The reason I do n't act/react improperly when flying different aircraft is that it 's all been trained into my muscle memory to do the right thing depending on the circumstances . I do n't think of the horn in a helicopter as a stall horn , just like the buzzer in my alarm clock and smoke alarm are not stall horns . The horn in the heli is a low-rpm horn , and I ease the stick back not forward . Another complication is instrument flight . Although I am an instrument rated airplane pilot , I have a little hood time in a helicopter . I 'm so used to flying pitch and power against the AI that all my instincts under the hood in the heli were completely wrong . Nevertheless , I do n't think I 'll ultimately have any trouble flying instruments well in a heli .
The squawk code is assigned by Air Traffic Control to the aircraft and is used for radar identification purposes . It is a 4 digit octal number ( each digit has a value in the range [ 0-7 ] ) . The flight crew enters the assigned squawk code into the transponder control panel and the radar extracts the code using a Mode-A interrogation ( or UF5 / UF21 interrogation in case of a Mode S radar / transponder ) . The extracted squawk code can then be used to correlate the radar reply with an aircraft 's flight plan . A number of squawk codes are reserved for generic purposes and emergencies . These codes are used in emergency , or when no flight plan correlation is needed . Some generic codes are : 1000 - Conspicuity code signalling the Flight Data Processing system to use Mode-S Aircraft ID for flight plan correlation . ( Primarily in Europe ) 1200 - Visual Flight Rules standard squawk code ( USA &amp; Canada ) 2000 - Used when entering a Secondary Surveillance Area and no code has yet been assigned . 7000 - Visual Flight Rules standard squawk code ( ICAO , USA &amp; Canada use 1200 instead ) 7500 - Unlawful interference / hijack ( ICAO , worldwide ) 7600 - Radio communication lost ( ICAO , worldwide ) 7700 - General emergency ( ICAO , worldwide )
All wings warp . The extent of warping is one restriction which limits the fast side of the <URL> . Once aircraft designers realized that thick wings have less drag , they tried to build their wings as stiff as possible . Stiff wings allow to use airfoils with rear loading , will have <URL> and keep their shape even when operating at high dynamic pressure . Since the center of pressure moves chordwise on cambered airfoils depending on the angle of attack , any cambered wing will suffer from pitching moments around its axis of elasticity . This moment will <URL> and change the incidence of the outer wing sections . A stiff wing will suffer less twisting and stay closer to its ideal aerodynamic shape . Add an aileron , and another twisting moment is added on top . Now the wing twists opposite to the aileron deflection ! This can become so bad that most of the aileron 's effectiveness is lost as the wing is warped in a way which counteracts the lift change of the aileron . The <URL> uses this effect with an array of leading and trailing edge devices to actively warp the wing in the desired direction . Using computer-controlled deflections of small but very effective control surfaces , it creates a desired deformation of the wing for roll control . This can be compared to the effect a <URL> has on an aileron . The Flettner tab is a small control surface at the trailing edge of a larger control surface and is deflected by the pilot such that it moves the big control surface in opposite direction . It slightly reduces the effectiveness of the big control surface , but needs only a fraction of the stick force , thus helping to manually control big aircraft . Since the active wing warping of the X-53 depends on the proper functioning of the FCS and an array of movable devices , each with its own failure mode , I would hesitate to see this as a clear advantage . It allows , however , to control the aircraft at high dynamic pressure with minimal drag penalties .
Short answer : They only need to develop , build and maintain one type of wing . And there 's no reason not to do it . That , however , leads to the question : How does it affect performance ? From the formula for aerodynamic lift we see there are generally 4 ways to increase a wing 's lift : Increase the angle of attack Increase the wing area Increase speed Increase air density Angle of attack The angle of attack is what defines our aircraft 's state , like stall , best cruise , etc. . So we can take it as fixed for a given situation . Wing area As you suggested , we could increase the wing 's span or depth . Speed Lift goes with speed squared . To cope with the additional weight of the larger aircraft , we need to increase airspeed for a given situation by the square root of the load factor . Let 's say the larger aircraft is 1.5 times as heavy , all speeds scale with sqrt ( 1.5 ) = 1.22 . So all characteristic speeds like stall speed , best climb speed , best cruise speed , etc. 1.22-fold . Air density Well , we ca n't change air density . We can , however , fly in denser air , i.e. lower . To put it the other way round , the heavier aircraft suffers from a lower service ceiling . Conclusion Given the same wing , the heavier aircraft performs worse in terms of service ceiling , short take of and landing , but better when it comes to cruising fast .
As you have intimated in the question , how hard you hit the ground is very dependent on a number of factors . When I did my training to jump using a classical tethered round chute we practiced landing from a platform of about 5 feet , so six is perhaps a hard landing . That 's , roughly , hitting the ground at 12mph . Folks like the Red Devils typically use an parafoil chute . Basically a self inflating wing . These can be steered and pitched upward to bring the trooper to a stall or even go up if they have enough forward velocity . So yes , you will often see them stop in mid-air and step down . This means this type of parachute has NO equivalent jump height . In fact if flown incorrectly you can crash into the ground at serious speeds . <URL> Regular " military style " parachutes provide no control over lift and only minor control over direction . With these your descent rate is totally dependent on size , weight and air quality . <URL> Interestingly , with a regular chute , what makes landings " harder " is not so much the effective height but the amount of horizontal velocity . You are trained to drop and roll when you hit the ground to absorb the impact . <URL> This works great if you have any horizontal velocity to help you initiate the roll . If however you are coming straight down it 's not so easy . . and your knees end up in your chest ... as I found out the one and only time I jumped out of an aging Cessna . Too much horizontal velocity and that roll gets rather violent .
These weights are all based on the maximum an aircraft will ever see . The maximum allowed weight of passengers ( + luggage ) and cargo ( called payload weight ) is the difference between the Operational empty weight ( about 270,000 kg ) and the Zero fuel weight ( 361,000 kg ) . This means the payload weight is about 91,000 kg . The passenger and crew weight can be estimated by the following numbers : 175 lbs per pax + 30 lbs of baggage for short medium range distance ( or 40 lbs for long range ) 175 lbs per crew member + 30 lbs of baggage $ ^ 1 $ So let 's say that ( for easier calculations ) the average passenger + luggage weight is 100 kg . When we assume 530 passengers and 25 crew , then the weight would be $ 555 \ times100 = 55,000 kg $ . That leaves 36,000 kg for cargo . All the weights listed are , of course , maximum weights . That means that an aircraft in general does not meet these values . The maximum fuel weight is the difference between maximum ramp weight and zero fuel weight ( which is $ 562,000-361 ,000 = 201,000 kg $ ) . About 2,000 kg is taken for the time the engines are running while the aircraft did not yet take of ( for taxiing etc ) . This is the difference between maximum ramp weight and MTOW . The amount of fuel varies so much per flight that I really ca n't say anything about it . It depends on the air pressure in the flight path ( aircraft choose their routes depending on that , for a faster flight ) , weather along the route , and much more . For quite a good overview I suggest for you to read <URL> . I hope I answered your question sufficiently . $ ^ 1 $ Source : Jan Roskam , Airplane design , Part I : Preliminary Sizing of Airplanes ( 1985 )
The oblique wing and the swing wing aim to reduce the drag over a wide range of speeds by changing the wing sweep . While the swing wing rotates a part of the wing to achieve this , the oblique wing rotates the whole wing . The first production aircraft with variable sweep wings was the <URL> , while the most famous one is the <URL> . <URL> " <URL> " by U.S. Navy - U.S. Navy National Museum of Naval Aviation photo No. 2011.003.301.027 . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . However , the only full sized aircraft to be produced with an oblique or pivot wing was the <URL> , which was strictly an experimental aircraft . <URL> " <URL> " by NASA - <URL> . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . A comparison between the two can be made like this : Aerodynamics : The oblique wing is much more refined aerodynamically compared to the swing wing and had lesser drag . In fact the AD-1 was designed to be as close to the optimal for all the flight regimes . Also , the aircraft was designed to have an elliptical lift distribution to reduce induced drag . on the other hand , the variable geometry aircraft did not offer any significant advantages over fixed wing baseline aircraft . However , the asymmetric stall of the oblique wing aircraft would cause problems as one side of the wing is swept forwards and the other side is swept towards the rear . Structure : The hinge was arguably the most critical structural part in variable sweep wing aircraft . The hinge should not only have a very high reliability , but also have the capacity to bear the high aerodynamic loads . <URL> " <URL> " by Sovxx - Own work . Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via <URL> . In this case , the swing wing aircraft are better off compared to the oblique wing aircraft as the amount of load on the hinge is significantly lower . For example , the oblique wing hinge has to take not only the weight of the entire aircraft wing ( the swing wing aircraft typically rotate only a part of the wing ) , but also the entire fuel load ( the amount of fuel carried in the variable part of the wing is significantly small ) . Also , the hinge should take the load of the control system too . Handling and Controls : The handling of the swing wing aircraft have been brought closer to the fixed wing aircraft over time . However , the handling qualities of AD-1 was found to be poor , with unusual trim requirements and inertial coupling affecting the <URL> . For instance , the AD-1 required about 10 ° of bank in order to trim the aircraft with no sideslip at 60 ° wing sweep.The aircraft also experienced pitch-roll coupling and the associated aeroelastic effects made for unpleasant handling qualities above 45 degrees sweep . One advantage of the oblique wing aircraft is that the center of lift and mass does n't move as the wings are swept . This happens in the swing wing aircraft and the control system is complicated Engine and payload In case of swing wing aircraft , the engines can be mounted in the fuselage ( like F-14 ) or in the ( fixed part of ) wing itself ( like B-1 ) . In case of the oblique wing aircraft , locating the engines anywhere except the fuselage is effectively ruled out . In case of military aircraft , use of hardpoints in the variable point of the wing is limited ( for one thing , this will increase the load on the hinge ) . This is a much more serious problem for oblique wing aircraft as this limits the payload that could be carried . However , the main reason for the lack of further development of oblique wing aircraft is their unusual and unpleasant control qualities .
It describes what the velocity vector of the aircraft centre of gravity is in relation to the surface of the earth . Ground speed is the 2-D projection of your speed on the ground , climb speed is the vertical component . Both ground speed and climb speed are very useful parameters as such : ground speed to figure out when the aircraft arrives , climb speed to adjust engine settings etc for reaching cruise altitude with a minimum amount of fuel used . The 3-D vector sum of the two has little practical use , that is probably why it has no separate name as far as I know . The integrated signal is of more use : what is the position in 3D of the centre of gravity of the aircraft relative to earth ? Pretty useful for navigation .
The mean aerodynamic chord is only identical to the mean chord for rectangular wings . For tapered wings it is slightly longer . Why ? Because the mean aerodynamic chord is the mean chord of a rectangular wing that has the same pitch characteristics as the " real " wing . Pitch characteristics need to include pitch damping , and pitch damping grows with the square of the local chord . That is why the formula for the mean aerodynamic chord divides the square of the local chord by the wing area : $ $ \ text { MAC } = \ int _ { y = - \ frac { b } { 2 } } ^ { y = \ frac { b } { 2 } } { \ frac { c ^ 2 } { S } } dy $ $ Here $ b $ denotes wing span , $ y $ the spanwise coordinate and $ S$ the wing area . Since the chord is squared , deeper sections of the wing are overrepresented in the result . The resulting rectangular wing will have a larger area than the original , tapered wing but the same pitch damping ! In case of a delta wing , MAC will grow to be 2/3 of the root chord , and for an elliptical wing it will be 90.5 % of the root chord . The MAC has been invented to convert arbitrary wing planforms into much easier to calculate rectangular wings . By doing all calculations on the correctly sized rectangular version , the more complicated calculations on the real one could be avoided . However , this works only up to a point : if you want to calculate lift , you need a wing of equal area . if you want to calculate induced drag , you need a wing of equal span . if you wand to calculate pitch motion , you need a wing of the correct MAC . This rectangular wing can either have the same area or the same span as the real wing , but not both together , unless the real wing is rectangular , too . You are right , the two definitions you quote are not compatible . The rectangular wing can not have the same span than the real one , or its area and all associated forces and moments would be higher .

Why are fuel tanks in the wings filled first , and why are they used last ?
It 's for <URL> ( for <URL> ) . As the generated lift bends the wings upward , the weight of the fuel will counter that . As the plane loses weight in-flight due to burning fuel , so does the need for wing bending relief ( less weight → less lift ) , that 's why the wing tanks are the last to be used . For context , a Boeing 777-200ER can hold 29 tonnes of fuel in each wing , and each wing measures ~ 27 metres and is self-supported . Example : Let 's say in our airliner each wing tank holds 100 units ( 200 total for both tanks ) , and the center tank holds 200 units , and you have a flight that needs 200 units of fuel . Correct scenario : By filling only the wing tanks , the weight of fuel in the wings will counter the bending of the lift . Incorrect scenario : By filling only the center tank , the wings will bend a great deal ( maybe even beyond their design limit ) . This is not good , and even if it is within the design limits , the repeating [ avoidable ] stresses will shorten the <URL> . Example for order of use ( schedule ) : Our flight needs 300 units , based on the above , we will fill the wing tanks , and fill half the center tank . Correct order : By emptying the center first , we have extended the duration of the wing bending relief . Incorrect order : By emptying the wings first , we lose the wing bending relief , while the plane is still heavy . Related : <URL>
For ( modern ) gliders with highly optimized laminar flow <URL> , bugs ( or dirt ) are a non-negligible factor , especially in competition gliding . There are some older laminar airfoils that are notoriously allergic to bugs ( and rain ) , but all are to a certain degree . This is also the reason why any glider pilot worth his or her salt will painstakingly clean their ship each afternoon and before each competition flight . Sufficient bugs will degrade your performance by a noticeable amount - most gliding computers even have a special " bug " factor to include that into glide path calculation ( even though the measuring and correllation of that is quite subjective ) . I ´ ve had a few flights in somewhat biblically bug-infested conditions ( summer , hot , low thermals ) that more or less painted the leading edge black ( like in this picture from an <URL> ) . Bug wipers are quite common on high-end and competition gliders and can be found e.g. at <URL> . Or try to google for " Mückenputzer " . Of course bug wipers are not without drawbacks ( concerning cost , installation , ease of use , drag etc. ) . A friend of mine once stuck a banana peel on his wing and tried to remove that with the wiper , resulting in banana and wiper being stuck in the middle of the wing . It took some creative maneuvers to clear that mess , by which time probably a lifetime aerodynamic benefit of cleaning had been spent . As for the comparison with cars , their <URL> differ in a lot of ways . In comparison to a wing there is no laminar flow to talk of at higher speeds ( most of it is turbulent ) , which drastically reduces the influence of the surface smoothness on the drag produced .
It is n't ( much ) . Ships are the most similar thing to aircraft that existed before them , so it made sense that aviation took over many terms and conventions from seafaring ( the pilot in command is called captain , the <URL> is the flight deck , distances and speeds are given in nautical miles and knots etc. ) However since there is no physical port in an aircraft to serve as reference ( most aircraft have doors on both sides ) , everybody has to learn to give the sides relative to the direction of flight and then it does not make sense to teach them new words when they already know " left " and " right " . So " port " and " starboard " are only used where there is a naval tradition . I know British military aviation ( RAF ) used it ( in wartime stories and documents it is common , but according to Simon 's comment it is not common any more ) and the US Navy uses it with ships , but I do n't know to what extent they apply it to aircraft . However , it remains popular in simulator games , presumably because it is catchy and unusual and using jargon makes people feel special .
It 's not so much that thrust reversers ( TRs ) are more unreliable than other components of the plane . However , they have a very important impact on the airplane 's performance . Hydraulics , flaps , and even engines fail regularly . But <URL> and <URL> can be backed up by redundant systems , and an airplane can still <URL> . But engineers learned from <URL> that an airplane may not be controllable if the TRs deploy in flight . So in the interest of safety , the TRs have additional precautions . The reasons for not aborting a landing after they are deployed are discussed in your first linked question . Reliability is also not the only reason for having no TRs on the A380 outboard engines , as discussed in the second linked question . So to answer your question , there is indeed a technical challenge in making the TRs reliable : they absolutely must not deploy in flight . This means many safeguards are put in place , and they are designed to fail by not deploying if there is any doubt about whether it is safe . A TR that wo n't deploy is more desirable than a TR that deploys when you do n't want it to .
<URL> seem to offer some products in that space however it seems many of them are of the remote control variant ( not fully automated ) . Crop dusting is a pretty routine task and you could easily program a drone to cover a specific field at a given time and let it do its thing . The main issue you will face in the current market is simply useful load . Ignoring the military drones out there most of the commercially available unmanned vehicles are on the smaller side and simply do n't have the useful load of something like a Piper Pawnee that is used for current crop dusting . It does seem that the <URL> some <URL> for this use but that was recently so Im sure it will be a little while before we see them . Although it seems Japan has been using them for this purpose for some time . So yes tank carrying drones do exist ( but I cant find the volume of the tanks , they do however appear pretty small ) . <URL> FWIW any small drone could be modified to carry a tank and spraying device provided it could lift it . All things considered people have built some <URL> RC planes
ICAO Class F airspace is a bit of an odd duck ( and the US FAA is apparently not the only agency that thinks so - from a quick check on <URL> it seems more jurisdictions ignore class F than implement it . They only mention Class F as being in use in Germany and the UK ) . From a functional/regulatory standpoint Class F is a sort of hybrid between " Class E " controlled airspace and " Class G " ( fully ) uncontrolled airspace : Class F airspace is designated as " uncontrolled " , but you can get ATC clearances in Class F airspace just like in controlled airspace . The catch is they 're " advisory only " ( so you do n't have to comply with them , and all the weight is on the pilot 's shoulders ) . Similarly ATC will provide separation services to IFR flights in Class F airspace , but they do so " where possible " , which means they might tell you they ca n't provide that service and you 're on your own with see-and-avoid . The general use case for Class F airspace seems to be allowing IFR flights to operate in " uncontrolled airspace " . As a US pilot ( and thus having no experience with Class F Airspace ) , it sounds like the services provided in Class F airspace are effectively the equivalent of <URL> : Controllers can give you advisories and make suggestions , but all responsibility is ultimately still on the pilot 's shoulders , and you can politely tell the controller to get stuffed if you do n't like their suggestions ( without needing to declare an emergency to vest yourself with that authority ) . In the US we already have the Flight Following system and culture set up for VFR folks ( and generally speaking it 's available nationwide , irrespective of airspace class , as long as the controller can get you on radar and is n't overworked ) . We also have a pretty robust Class E airspace nationwide . Because of this the FAA probably sees no need to designate specific " Class F " regions where IFR flights can get the equivalent of " Flight Following " : If you 're VFR you can usually get flight following if you want it , and if you 're IFR you should have no trouble staying in controlled airspace ( Class A , B , C , D , or E ) for your entire route of flight .
It is an historical name . The first polars were drawn by Otto Lilienthal in polar coordinates . <URL> ( sorry , German link ) we find an example :
Inertial Reference System is a solid state set of <URL> which navigate using <URL> . The system measures accelerations in and rotation around each of the 3 axis so can calculate where it is by adding how much it has moved to the initial position . A simple example : The aircraft is stationary pointing North . Over a 10 minute period , it measures the accelerations in the X and Y axis and calculates that is has moved +100 kms in the X axis ( i.e. North ) and +100 kms in the Y axis ( i.e. West ) . By simple trigonometry , we can calculate that the aircraft is approximately 141.4 kms on a bearing of 45 degrees from it 's initial position . The gyros must be aligned with the aircraft frame of reference when it is stationary . This is the " alignment " process and generally must be completed before the aircraft moves . It may also take inputs of the current position from a manual keyboard or from some other system , e.g. GPS . More modern IRS fits can align when the aircraft is moving , taking an updated position from GPS . There are 2 systems on the 737 , simply for redundancy . <URL>
With larger wings comes more drag . True , because the drag is a function of the wing area A : $ $ D = C_D \ cdot \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ rho \ cdot V ^ 2 \ cdot A $ $ You need a certain wing area to support the weight of the aircraft . Now the question is : over how many wings will we distribute this wing area ? For over 80 years , the answer has been : one wing ( the two wing halves make up one wing ) . The classical biplane is a thing of the past , however there have been incredibly clever aircraft builders who have looked at the long coupled canard configuration . This one really makes a lot of sense : <URL> Image <URL> So to answer your question : there are aircraft with two wings . It 's just that people do n't buy them , and go for boring old Cessna 's instead .
ICAO is headquartered in Montreal because that was the <URL> by the founding members ( PICAO is Provisional ICAO ) : Why was Montreal selected ? While insisting on the excellent hospitality offered since of the beginnings of PICAO by the federal , provincial and municipal authorities , the delegates described Montreal like a roundabout of the international means of communication and a strategic centre with a formidable economic , scientific , technical and aeronautical expansion being felt for a few years . One insisted on the vast spaces of the Canadian territory , offering unlimited possibilities for the scientific and practical experiments in the field of aviation . Moreover , PICAO was to be established as close as possible to the central head office of the United Nations . And IATA is in Montreal because its founding statutes said that <URL> : Article II of the IATA 1945 Statutes states that " The Head Office of this Association shall be maintained in the city in which the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization is located . " ; this article was later amended to leave an opening for a possible other place as determined by the General Meeting
The main reason for having variable incidence wing in the F-8 was that it allowed the production of increased lift due to a greater angle of attack without reducing pilot visibility as the fuselage stayed level . For aircraft with high angle of attack TO/landings ( like delta winged aircraft ) , pilot visibility is a problem in low speed landings , as the nose will obstruct the runway ( or carrier , for that matter ) in extreme cases . There are two ways to solve this problem : Droop the nose , like the Concorde or Make the wings variable incidence , like the F-8 . The first option is usually preferred ( same thing was done in Tu-144 ) as the weight penalty is ( significantly ) less . However , this was n't possible in the F-8 as the engine air intake was in the nose ; so the incidence of wings was changed . The variable incidence wing had the added advantage of reducing the length of landing gear required and improved the low speed characteristics . In case of Martin XB-51 , the variable incidence wings were used to reduce take off distance as it was expected to be operated from forward airfields .
Simplicity . Yes , a servo tab is helpful , but most control surfaces should include a trim tab , so this can double as a servo tab . Total part count should still be lower than that for a stabilizer-elevator combination . But there are other advantages : Easier adjustment of stick forces and little loss of stability with free-floating controls . By hinging the stabilator ( or full-flying tail ) near the quarter point , its control forces can be kept small and tailored with the servo tab . Also , this helps to keep the hinge moment coefficient derivative over angle of attack $ c _ { r _ \ alpha } $ low . The ratio between it and the derivative over deflection angle $ \ eta $ determines the angle to which the control surface will float , and a small $ c _ { r _ \ alpha } $ means that the stability with a floating control surface will be close to the stability with a fixed surface . Also , balancing masses are easier to place when the full surface moves .
The most important characteristic for a jet engine compressor is high mass flow rate with light weight and if possible small size . For the same size , the flow rate can be increased by operating the compressor at higher rpm . But sliding components do n't allow that . Only the axial and centrifugal compressors can achieve sufficient flow rates , so they are used . Centrifugal compressors achieve higher pressure ratio for weight , but are larger , so they were used in many early designs and now remain in small turboprops while larger engines use axial compressors for their compactness .
Just toe brakes . Typically the instruction between line-up-and-wait and clearing for takeoff is very short , maybe ten seconds . In simpler aircraft , the parking brake just " pinches " or closes off the brake fluid line to keep the wheel brakes held , but in the fly-by-wire airliners , the parking brake just clamps the normal wheel brakes as if the toe brakes were held .
Besides the main points you mentioned , I can think of a couple things , the first is sort of related to your point # 1 . Airplanes are designed to be easy to service . Cars are less so . Cars only have a few very expensive parts , mainly the drivetrain ( engine and transmission ) . If either of those needs to be replaced in an older car , it can easily cost more than the car is worth . Airplanes are much more complex , and have a larger number of expensive components . The engines of most airliners are designed to be removed relatively quickly . Although the engines tend to be the most expensive part , replacing an engine is nowhere near the total cost of the airplane , and there is generally a good pool of engines out there for parts and replacement ( just look at how many JT8D engines are still in service ) . In GA aircraft , it is easier for a repair to cost more than the airplane is worth . However , the more comprehensive maintenance required on aircraft means that this kind of repair is less likely to be needed . Also , while its usually easy to go out and replace a broken car with a comparable new or used one , the aircraft market is n't as large . New aircraft tend to be much more expensive , and the used market is more limited . Another reason is that airplanes can have more unique qualities than cars . For example , there are original 737s flying in Canada because they are able to operate from gravel runways . There are just more combinations of sizes and capabilities in airplanes than with cars . Many times , it is only economical to replace those aircraft ( both for the builder and the buyer ) in very long cycles .
" <URL> " is a pretty vague term that encompasses a lot of various situations that can cause <URL> , so it 's hard to have one definitive answer . That said , you can expect to accumulate some degree of ice when flying through moisture ( clouds , rain , etc ) when outside air temperatures ( OAT ) are near or below 36 ° F / 2 ° C. Also as a rule , an aircraft 's tail will likely accumulate ice faster than the wing in all conditions . Flying through very cold temperatures ( -15 ° C - > -40 ° C ) When flying in clouds and rain at the very low end of the icing spectrum , the most likely form of accumulation is <URL> . This primarily forms on the leading edges of wings and tail surfaces , starting ( in most cases ) with the tail , and looks ( initially , at least ) a lot like frost . It can create pretty bizarre structures and is pretty easy to spot . Rime ice is ( as far as I have seen or read ) not going to accumulate anywhere but on leading edges ( wings , nose , engine nacelles , tail ) as those are the only parts of the structure impacting the relative wind . Either way , it is highly detrimental to your wing 's aerodynamic health . Rime ice can sometimes form ' horns ' that start to grow in a V shape forward off the wing , but only in what I imagine are considered severe conditions . The FAA states that rime " typically occurs with temperatures between -15 ° C. and -20 ° C " . Flying in relatively warm temperatures ( 2 ° C - > -15 ° C ) At warmer temps , the most likely form is <URL> , which is basically like having solid water ice form around the leading edges - again , wings , tail surfaces , nose , engines . It pretty much follows the shape of the leading edge of surface it freezes onto , but it 's heavy and still messes with your aerodynamics . Again , like rime , it 's freezing more or less on impact ( but with larger droplets ) wherever the relative wind strikes the airframe . In some unusual conditions , aircraft can encounter precip known as <URL> ( SLD ) ; these are cold enough to freeze but not on impact , causing a form of icing known as <URL> . In FAA tests , " ice shape simulations were found to cause substantial penalties to the aerodynamic performance " of multiple NACA airfoils . Runback ice can accumulate pretty far back along a wing , making it difficult or impossible to dislodge using heat or boots ( supposedly TKS fluid protection can mitigate this ) . It 's scary stuff . The FAA states that " Clear ice typically forms when temperatures are around 2 ° C to -10 ° C [ but ] more hazardous clear ice shapes [ ... ] tend to form at temperatures closer to 0 ° C " . Flying in medium temperatures ( -10 ° C - > -15 ° C ) When flying in the middle of the temperature range , aircraft wind up accumulating <URL> , a combination of rime and clear . According to the FAA , " Mixed ice is most likely to form at temperatures between -10 ° C to -15 ° C " . It is basically as terrible for aerodynamics as rime ice , and pretty much just as heavy as clear ice . No fun . Resources : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>
Let 's say you have two aircraft that will reach the same point in space at the same time , and your job is to keep them three miles apart . One way to do it is to calculate how many knots the second aircraft should reduce their speed so that at the time the first aircraft reaches the point , the second aircraft will have fallen three miles in trail . Unfortunately for you , this means that you have to work a time-speed-distance-wind problem for every single aircraft that you , as a controller , handle . Alternatively , you pick a point three miles away and tell the second aircraft to fly there . Air traffic controllers are human , and humans are better at angles than we are at numbers . The simplest thing for controllers is usually the best thing - they 've got lots on their mind already without making them do math too ! This might change in the NEXTGEN air traffic network ( where everyone has a GPS position and speed readout right there on the screen ) but for now , easy is better than hard .
It is a mixture of factors . All else being the same : a contrail at a higher altitude will last longer ( the lower temperature slows the sublimation of the ice cristals ) a contrail formed in air with higher humidity will be bigger and last longer ( more water is being turned into ice ) If there is not enough ( relative ) humidity , the contrail will not form at all . See for example this image : Image from <URL> The contrails start forming on the east , near the clouds where you have a higher humidity , and do not form on the west , where no cloud is present and you have higher temperature/lower humidity . I 've often noticed that planes flying on more or less the same track , headed in the same direction leaves different contrails . What you observe might be airplanes flying at different altitudes and thus encountering different humidity/temperature combinations , giving birth to contrails with different histories .
I do n't have any definitive information on why the oval shape was chosen . However , it seems to me to be the most practical shape given the navigational equipment available when holding patterns first became necessary . VOR , DME , and GPS technology did not exist . Holding patterns were flown , often by single pilots hand flying , with reference to an ADF needle , maybe with a little marker beacon help . I do n't know if a square-like pattern was considered , but if it was I think it would have been rejected for at least the following ; a rectangular pattern would involve 4 turns , better to keep it simple with only 2 turns . flying any kind of a leg perpendicular to the holding radial would mean getting farther away from the radial than necessary with no advantage to be gained , and it might involve more terrain clearance problems . Flying a circular pattern makes it more difficult to keep track of where you are in your head ( no glass cockpits , indeed no HSIs even , not even rotating ADF cards at first ) , than an oval . Worse , though , is what could occur in some wind conditions . For example , let 's say you 're supposed to hold north of a fix on the 360 radial ( inbound course 180 ) . Further , lets say there 's a significant north wind . You 're approaching the fix on a course of 180 . You cross the fix and then fly a circle with respect to the air you 're in . In a no-wind condition , you 'll come back to the fix . However , with a north wind , you 'll come back to the course south of the fix , and will have thus violated where you were supposed to hold . With today 's navigational technology , we can of course easily fly any kind of shape we want , but the disadvantages previously mentioned would still apply .
You 're confusing the airspace height with airspace altitude . The <URL> ( in the US ) is 3-2-4 ( a ) Generally , that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation ( charted in MSL ) If you look at chart for the Class C for Colorado Springs ( elevation 6,187 ) , the surface area of the airspace goes up to 10,200 ft MSL , approximately 4,000 ft above the airport elevation of 6187 .

Will control surfaces on a plane be less efficient at a higher altitude ?
Please let me assume that you wonder about control surface effectiveness rather than their efficiency . Both are closely related , but I prefer to address their effectiveness - doing what the pilot demands them to do . The aerodynamic forces are proportional to the dynamic pressure $ q $ of the flow , which is density times velocity squared , as in $ $ q = \ frac { \ rho } { 2 } \ cdot v ^ 2 $ $ To create the same amount of lift at a higher altitude , the airplane has to fly faster , so in effect the forces can stay the same . Only the true air speed will be different , which helps to get where you want faster . The control surface effectivity remains unchanged . If we dig a little deeper , the atmosphere cools down with increasing altitude until you reach the <URL> . This cooling makes the engines <URL> but also <URL> of the flow around the aircraft . A lower Reynolds number translates into a thicker boundary layer , which will reduce the effectiveness of control surfaces a tiny bit and will reduce the range of their best effectivity . But this effect is so small that it has no practical consequence . Airliners fly at transsonic speeds at altitude , so now sonic effects become more pronounced . For the control surfaces this means that they will <URL> . For small corrections all is very similar to low level , slow flight , but if you need full deflections the control surfaces are indeed less effective at altitude . Another effect will be rather more pronounced , and this is aerodynamic damping . Damping is the tendency of a system to create additional forces from movements which run against this movement . Take a wing : If the aircraft rolls , the wingtips will move up on one side and down on the other . Both movements will add a small angle of attack , lowering the total angle of attack on the up moving tip and increasing it on the down moving tip . Both tips will see a change in lift which will counteract the rolling motion . If the rolling speed is $ \ omega_x $ , the resulting change in angle of attack $ \ alpha $ at a wing station $ y $ is $ $ \ Delta \ alpha = arctan \ left ( \ frac { \ omega_x \ cdot y } { v } \ right ) $ $ As you can see , the flight speed is in the denominator , so a higher flight speed will create a smaller angle change for the same roll rate . The same holds true for the other axes of movement , and in consequence the <URL> or an artificial damper . I guess it is the lower damping which made you think that the control surfaces are less effective . They are n't .
I do n't think many airline crew actually bother to log the day/night breakdown . At my airline we have different pay rates for day and night flying , so we do care , but the company " Electronic Logbook " tracks the day/night breakdown for us . The system is not 100 % accurate and we sometimes get paid more or less day or night then we actually fly in , but it tends to average out over the year . In the summer , polar routes can be as much as 15 hour flights of daylight , while the same route in the winter can be 15 hours of night flying . On some flights we will see the sun set , and then rise , and set again , as we chase the sun and our route changes from northwest bound to southwest bound . <URL> Here are some samples of summer/winter , day/night Toronto to Hong Kong flying in my eLog : <URL> <URL>
It depends . As always . If thrust is high enough , why not ? <URL> is a regular part of aerobatic performances , and the fuselage is producing almost * all the needed lift . This requires Enough speed , A low ratio of aircraft mass to fuselage side area , and Enough rudder deflection to trim the aircraft in a sufficiently high sidelip angle . For horizontal flight your installed thrust must be sufficient to compensate for the high drag in this attitude . This should be no problem with powerful propeller aircraft if their fuel system keeps them supplied at this attitude . Jets must make sure that the sideslip angle can be tolerated by the intake . The smoke from the exhaust indicates that this biplane flies horizontally . Yes , it is a large model airplane ( not man-carrying , but almost big enough for that ) . But the laws of physics do n't change with scale . For an example of a full-size aircraft doing a knife edge , see <URL> . Thanks go to @romkyns for pointing this out to me ! Note the rudder deflection to keep it at this angle of sideslip . Direction is controlled with the elevator . At this rate of sideslip the propeller thrust contributes to overall lift as well , however , the vertical adds a substantial downforce in order to trim the aircraft and the fuselage has to supply the remaining lift . * Almost means that the propeller will carry some of the weight , but the large downforce on the vertical needs to be compensated , too . In sum , the lift contributed by the fuselage is very close to the weight of the plane .
For statically stable aircraft , the canard is a spoiler in disguise . It will create a strong downwash right behind itself , coupled with an upwash outward of $ \ pi $ / 4 of its semispan . With changing angle of attack and lift coefficient , the vertical position and the strength of both up - and downwash will change , so the wing incidence variation over wingspan can be made right for just one angle of attack . Pros The force to effect flight path changes works the right way , so pitch response times of canards are slightly better than those of a conventional configuration . The wing can be further aft , so in short business jets the cabin might not interfere with the wing spar . Cons The induced drag at off-design points is higher than that of a comparable conventional configuration . The bigger lifting surface must keep some stall margin , so the total lift coefficient will be smaller than that of a comparable conventional configuration . In the end , a canard will need more wing area . Control surface deflections will add to the already high lift coefficient of the canard plane , increasing lift demands on the surface with the smallest margins . The highest lift coefficient is needed at the surface with the smaller <URL> . Normally , the reverse would be better . If the engines are mounted below and ahead of the wing , they will be hit by the wake of the canard , reducing intake efficiency and <URL> margins . To make sure that the control surface will be the last thing on the plane to run into compressibility problems , it should have less lift coefficient and more sweep than the wing . In the end , a statically stable canard will have a lower cruise Mach number than a comparable conventional configuration . The landing gear must be made to retract into the fuselage , because the wing is too far behind the center of gravity to allow the gear to retract into the wing . I could go on , but I guess you see by now where this is heading ...
When aviation literature mentions " the standard traffic pattern " , it 's usually a left-hand counterclockwise pattern ; regardless of wind direction , the runway will always be to your left side and you make left turns to follow the pattern through crosswind , downwind and base legs . This is the default pattern direction when there are no overriding signals . However , this is only the default , and airports are free to change the procedure as needed to comply with local terrain or development . An airfield near a neighborhood to its east , for instance , may require that traffic circle around the west side of the airport ; therefore this airfield 's 17/35 runway will require a left-hand pattern when using runway 35 , but a right-hand pattern when using runway 17 . When an airfield establishes a non-default traffic pattern , they must provide this information to pilots in a readily-visible manner . The standard recommended ( though not required ) set of runway and pattern indicators is known as the segmented circle , so called because its most visible identifying feature from a distance is a 75-foot circle of dashed lines : <URL> In the center of the circle as pictured is the runway direction indicator aka the tetrahedron ; this will indicate which strip of asphalt to use and which direction to take off and land on it ( the narrow end points in the direction that planes should take off and land ) . Off to one side is the windsock , which is the only piece of equipment that is required at any airfield ; it indicates approximate wind speed and direction . FAA guidelines for the sock say it should reliably turn to the wind direction at 3 knots , begin to inflate at 5 knots and be fully extended at 15 . The windsock can replace the tetrahedron in the center of the circle ; in that configuration you would simply approach the airfield using the runway closest to the direction in which the tip of the windsock is pointing ( if winds are calm and/or the airfield has multiple runways , the tetrahedron is preferable ) . On the ground just outside the segmented circle are L shapes ; these are the pattern indicators , and point in the direction of the base leg when approaching the runway from that end ( so if you 're following the pattern , the end of the L should be pointing at you before your turn to final ) . So , the circle in the above picture tells aviators several critical things without any human ( or computer ) having to relay the information vocally : The approach direction is from the upper right to the lower left of this picture . The wind is roughly in line with the runway , so no crosswind landing procedure is required . Winds are very strong ( the windsock is fully extended which indicates wind speeds in excess of 15 knots ) so ground speed will be much lower than IAS at takeoff and landing . Most relevant to your question , airfield traffic should be on a right-hand pattern at this time ; if the winds and thus the runway in use were opposite , traffic would use a left-hand approach .
Since you are trying to understand how the crew is aware of law reconfiguration , it 's important to look at this event in its context , why it does happen and what are the consequences for the control of the aircraft . You may skip this overview and go to the direct answer to your question which is in the last section of this post . Flight control system and computers The crew and the FMGS ( autopilot ) send commands to redundant computers : 2x ELAC ( elevator aileron computer ) for elevators/THS and ailerons , 3x SEC ( spoilers elevator computer ) for elevators/THS and spoilers , 2x FAC ( flight augmentation computer ) for rudder , and computers send commands to actuators . <URL> <URL> . When the system is fully functional , all computers work using a normal law and it provides protection against : excessive pitch and roll attitude , high-angle-of-attack , high-speed and low energy , excessive load factor . This can be done by receiving aircraft dynamic data from multiple sensors visible in the diagram . If a flight control computer fails ( or stop receiving required data ) , the crew receives an indication on the overhead panel : <URL> <URL> <URL> . When one or several of those computers fails , the role of the remaining ones are redistributed . Reconfiguration of the computers The failure of an element of the flight control system needs that other available elements compensate for the missing computer or peripheral . This reconfiguration allows available computers to control an additional axis using other laws . However departing from the normal law for an axis means losing one or more of the protections available under the normal law . Degraded laws are : alternate law ( two levels : With and without reduced protections ) , direct law ( no protection ) , mechanical ( mechanical linkage between controls and control surfaces ) . The mechanical mode is a backup mode to control the tail surfaces from the pedals and the pitch trim wheels in case something prevent actuators to work ( e.g. loss of all electric power sources before the RAT is deployed ) . <URL> Source : <URL> Alternate and direct control laws modify the relation between the stick movement and the flight control movement ( linearity and amplitude ) . Effect of pitch axis alternate law in different phases of flight After the flight control system has transitioned to an alternate law , some protection may be available , but law may also transition again according to events representative of the different phases of the flight . Here is what happens around alternate law on pitch axis , which a change to direct law as the landing gear is extended : <URL> Source : <URL> A very degraded flight control system : Direct law While alternate law on a given axis still maintains ( under some conditions ) some level of flight envelope protection , this protection is lost when degrading to direct law . According to the axis , the direct law impacts are : Pitch : The stick commands linearly elevators movement , automatic pitch trim is unavailable , all pitch protections are lost as well as alpha-floor . Roll : The stick commands linearly surface movement , but overall amplitude is different according to slats/flaps status , only ailerons and spoilers 4/5 are used ( all spoilers if ailerons fail ) . Yaw : Mechanical control using the pedals , yaw dumping and turn coordination unavailable . Permanent indications on PFD Green $ \ sf \ scriptstyle \ color { green } { \ text { = } } $ indicate active protections : Bank angle ± 67 ° , pitch angle at 15 ° nose down and 30 ° nose up . On the speed scale , speed limits for alpha protection . Loss of protections after the degradation from normal law is indicated by amber $ \ sf \ color { orange } { \ text { x } } $ . <URL> Source : <URL> When the direct law is in effect for pitch the amber warning $ \ sf \ scriptstyle \ color { orange } { \ text { USE MAN PITCH TRIM } } $ is displayed below the lines of the flight mode annunciator . In addition if the law transitions to mechanical backup ( which is supposed to be a transitory state ) , a red $ \ sf \ scriptstyle \ color { red } { \ text { MAN PITCH TRIM ONLY } } $ replaces the amber indication . General alerts Audio chimes are triggered at the time of a component failure , when the mode changes . Alerts also activate either of the overall alerting lights ( master warning and/or master caution ) . ECAM messages Failures and law activation trigger messages on the ECAM , with suggestions for crew actions . <URL> <URL> . However , and this was noted by investigators on AF447 accident , ECAM messages can be shown or hidden in the scrollable list according to messages priorities , due to the high number of messages that may appear in a short period of time during such sequences of events : <URL> <URL> .
There is a weight sensor which senses if the plane is on the ground . This sensor prevents gear retraction while the plane is still on the ground . Failure of this sensor would prevent gear retraction after takeoff . If you note closely , the landing gears ( even the non-retractable ones ) are not connected using a simple metal pole ; rather , there is <URL> which is compressed by the weight of the aircraft . Besides airborne / ground detection , the struts absorb the vertical energy during touchdown . <URL> I recall some decades ago engineers experimented obtaining the plane 's gross weight by installing weight scales to each landing gear ( as opposed to just an air/ground detection ) . The readings were found to be inaccurate and they soon abandoned the idea . Landing gear stories can not be complete without mentioning this incident in 1990 : A training captain of a <URL> was betting with his students that the weight-on-gear mechanism would prevent gear retraction while on the ground . On the accident airplane type , the mechanism would lock the gear handle , but the lock can be overridden if the pilot manually pull out and move the handle . The instructor confidently pulled out the handle and to his surprise , the hydraulics started to move and the gears were retracted while the plane was still on the ground . <URL> ( <URL> ) The aircraft was written off . This incompetent instructor pilot was killed 11 years later in <URL> .
As DeltaLima said , it is kind of hard answering your question . After looking at the <URL> you might have found the answer already . Let me try to answer your specific question though : Assuming an airliner , let 's say the A320 , for some reason got into a spin , can it be recovered ? The general answer would be yes ! Here are some things to consider though : The FAA requires all single-engine normal category aircraft to demonstrate spin recovery in <URL> . It depends a lot on the center of gravity of the airplane whether it is recoverable from a spin or not . If the center of gravity is too far aft , it will not be recoverable from a spin . Gliders , being light , have an easy shiftable CG , and there is some that do n't enter spins at all or need extra weights in the back in order to make them spinnable ! Airliners are not required to do so as they are not as likely to get into a spin in the first place ! The structure of an airliner is designed for air flowing over it , not for being in a spin ! Centrifugal forces will be applied to the structure due to angular acceleration . Also , spins by airliner would be a lot faster then by little aircraft and more forces would be applied to the frame . If the recovery from the spin is made too fast or abrupt , it can overstress the airplane as well ! All Airbus I know are fly-by-wire , and Airbus is well known for its computer based controls . Most airliners have a lot of systems , which prevent them from even getting into a stall . There a incidents where these systems failed and it went back to the pilot doing the right thing . As a spin always always always requires a stall first , and pilots are trained to avoid stalls in the first place , it is very unlikely for an airliner to enter a spin , having the pilot and various systems working against entering a stall !
There 's no legal limit of how high you 're allowed to fly by law : there 's no law that says It is illegal to fly above X ,000 ft In some juristictions there are more specific laws , eg It is illegal to operate an unpressurised aircraft above 25,000 ft However , each aircraft has a service ceiling when it is certified , and it would be generally illegal to operate the aircraft above this altitude ( because it 's unsafe ) . I 'm fairly confident that you were n't at 55,000 ft. No commercial airliner I know of has a service ceiling higher than 45,000 ft ( the newer version of the 747 ) and they almost never operate above 41,000 ft. A few private jets can go a little higher , up to around 50,000 ft , but I know of no non-military/experimental aircraft which is currently capable of going much above 50,000 ft , even if you were daft enough to try .
Static stability is the tendency of a system to return to its initial state after a disturbance . Typical disturbances in case of airplanes are : Flying into a vertical or horizontal gust A jerk on the stick The classic explanation is with a ball sitting in a pit . Whenever its position is changed by a disturbance , it will roll back towards the center . This does not mean that it will stop there - in an ideal world free of friction it will keep moving back and forth like a pendulum . This is static stability . Broadly speaking , static stability is achieved by placing the center of gravity ahead of the neutral point , the point in which all additional forces due to a change in angle of attack can be summarized . There are two neutral points , one for longitudinal stability and one for directional stability . In both cases the change in angle of attack or sideslip will create a correcting moment around the center of gravity , pulling the aircraft back on its old path . Even altitude stability can be achieved , but here we take advantage of the fact that air becomes less dense the higher you climb . If the aircraft is trimmed for horizontal flight at a certain altitude , an altitude change will mean that the power setting does no longer match drag at this new altitude . The aircraft will either climb or sink , depending on the altitude change , until the old altitude has been reached again . In all cases you will experience overshoots and oscillations around the trim point . It can even happen that these overshoots become worse the longer the oscillation lasts ( the <URL> in a glider is a good example ) . To stop the oscillations , you need to add Dynamic stability which describes the behavior of the aircraft over time . In most cases , friction will ensure that motions die down , and sometimes aircraft need little helpers like <URL> to get those under control . You mention stalls and dives : They can indeed occur in a statically stable airplane . Low drag means low damping , therefore many high performance gliders have a dynamically unstable <URL> motion . I know , Wikipedia spells this wrongly , but the explanation is OK , so I linked it nonetheless . If you wait long enough after an initial upset , the oscillations will become so severe that the aircraft stalls at the upmost point of the cycle . If you keep enough altitude and have no traffic nearby , this is fun to try . Spiral dive Note that I omitted to say something about roll stability so far . The glider ( and your Cessna 172 ) will also start to roll , and in many cases the roll motion will increase more quickly than the phygoid , so you might need to try several times before you get a phygoid-induced stall . Most aircraft have a weak tendency to increase roll angle and to eventually fall into a <URL> . There is no aerodynamic mechanism to right the aircraft up after a roll disturbance . Sorry , @kevin , but dihedral wo n't help - it only works in case of sideslip .
We found the problem . The control stops are under the seat and are made of plywood . It looks like at some point in the past someone had added a small layer of plywood to reduce the control deflections but that over time the glue had deteriorated or the wood had swollen , so that there was now too much stop . Removing the extra ply and sanding the glue back to the wood fixed the problem .
I find that virtually all the passengers I 've let fly for the first time were already so scared of the controls that no " safety briefing " of that sort was necessary . Do n't fight me on the controls . If I say let go , let go immediately . If you suspect there 's even a remote chance of either of these problems , maybe you should n't be letting this person fly your plane . Do n't move any of the controls very rapidly . Do n't move any of the controls to their limits . In most small airplanes without hydraulics , it takes quite a bit of force to deflect any of the controls rapidly to their limits . And as soon as your first-time passenger starts to push on the controls , they 're going to feel increasingly strong g-forces as the plane responds . For first-timers , this is usually a pretty intimidating feel . If someone is pushing too hard , they 're going to feel it , and almost certainly back off or let go entirely . " Positive transfer of control " using 3-step acknowledgment such as " You have the controls " / " I have the controls " / " You have the controls " is a good idea for flight training , or for flights with 2 pilots taking turns at the controls ; but in my opinion it 's not necessary for a joyride with a friend . As the PIC , and the only licensed pilot in the cockpit , you need to be monitoring the situation at all times anyway . If you decide the situation requires you to reassert control , you can simply ask them to release the controls . If you ca n't trust the person to do this promptly , you probably should n't be letting them fly your plane anyway ; a preflight safety briefing is n't going to solve that . To be as safe as possible , you can take the following steps before allowing your passenger to fly ( some of these you already stated ) : Select a location away from controlled airspace , busy airway/routes , or other special-use areas like drop zones . ( Optionally , if you do n't mind the extra radio chatter ) Tune a nearby ATC radar facility ( approach/center ) and request radar advisories . Tell them you 'll be maneuvering in a certain area . Climb to a sufficient altitude to allow good clearance from all terrain and obstacles ( antennas , etc. ) , and to allow enough altitude for recovery if your passenger should somehow manage to stall or enter a steep dive or something . Trim for straight &amp; level flight at $ V_A $ for your current weight ( lower than the gross-weight $ V_A $ you get out of the book ) . Make a set of clearing turns and scan for any traffic in the area . Give your systems a once-over and verify you have sufficient fuel . Hand over the controls ! You did n't specifically ask about this , but I 've flown with a lot of first-time passengers , people who have never been in an airplane . Both children and adults . Many of them are understandably quite nervous . Here are some things I try to do to make it as easy , fun , relaxed and stress-free as possible for them : Give them a simplified , plain English description of the flight . Tell them exactly what you plan to do and what order things will happen in . E.g. First we 're going to start the engine . I 'll get on the radio and get clearance from the control tower . Then we 'll taxi out to the runway and stop for a few minutes while I go through some checks to make sure the plane 's in good shape . Then we 'll take off and head out to the east to do some sightseeing . While we 're up there , if you 're comfortable and would like to try your hand at the controls , we can do that . When we 're done with that we 'll turn around and head back to the airport , land , and taxi back in . Do n't use fancy words or terms that a non-pilot would n't understand . Help them enter the airplane . Show them how to open and shut the door . Show them how to buckle and unbuckle their seat belt . Ask them if they have any questions . Do your normal preflight safety briefing , again using simplified English and avoiding pilot terms . Limit it to points that are relevant to a passenger ( avoiding the controls , staying quiet if asked , opening the door ) . They do NOT need to hear about what you 're going to do if you have an engine failure on climbout . If this is a normal part of your preflight / before takeoff briefing ( as it should be ) , say it to yourself mentally , not out loud . During the flight : Talk your way through everything you 're doing . When you 're ready to do your run-up , tell them : I 'm about to run the engine up to power to make sure everything 's running smoothly . I 'm holding the brakes so we 're not going to go anywhere , but the engine will get pretty loud for a minute . When you 're doing your magneto / prop governor checks : Now I 'm going to do some things to the engine to make sure it 's running right . It 's going to make some pretty funny noises , but it 's perfectly normal . Talking through everything accomplishes a few goals : Avoids startling the passenger with something unexpected . A prop governor check sounds really bad to somebody who knows about engines but nothing about planes . A
The short answer : It depends . Either 10 , 20 or 30 hours of simulator/FTD/ATD time may be used , but all of it must be with an approved instructor . None of it may be solo . None of the requirements you posted are related to simulator time . 50 hours of Pilot in Command cross country This can be done solo , as you are a rated pilot and thus PIC . This need not be solo XC and can be done with a passenger or CFI . 40 hours of simulated or actual instrument time In this quote , simulated instrument time refers to time spent in the airplane during flight in visual meteorological conditions ( VMC ) that you are wearing a view-limiting device to simulate IMC . While wearing a view-limiting device you must be accompanied by another pilot who acts as your safety pilot . Thus , none of this time may be accomplished solo . You will always need another pilot either in simulated or actual instrument conditions . 15 hours of flight instruction towards Instrument Rating This time may overlap with the above ( actually , must overlap ) , the regulation reads ( <URL> ( d ) ( 2 ) ) : ( 2 ) Forty hours of actual or simulated instrument time in the areas of operation listed in paragraph ( c ) of this section , of which 15 hours must have been received from an authorized instructor who holds an instrument-airplane rating ... Now back to your question , what about simulator time ? For this we look further down to <URL> ( h ) and ( i ) ( h ) Use of flight simulators or flight training devices . If the instrument time was provided by an authorized instructor in a flight simulator or flight training device -- ( 1 ) A maximum of 30 hours may be performed in that flight simulator or flight training device if the instrument time was completed in accordance with <URL> of this chapter ; or ( 2 ) A maximum of 20 hours may be performed in that flight simulator or flight training device if the instrument time was not completed in accordance with <URL> of this chapter . and ( i ) Use of an aviation training device . A maximum of 10 hours of instrument time received in an aviation training device may be credited for the instrument time requirements of this section if -- ( 1 ) The device is approved and authorized by the FAA ; ( 2 ) An authorized instructor provides the instrument time in the device ; ( 3 ) No more than 10 hours of instrument time in a flight simulator or flight training device was credited for the instrument time requirements of this section ; ( 4 ) A view-limiting device was worn by the applicant when logging instrument time in the device ; and ( 5 ) The FAA approved the instrument training and instrument tasks performed in the device . The use of simulators and flight training devices is covered by ( h ) above , and the limit of 20 or 30 hours depends on how the training is conducted . In either case , note that time must be " provided by an authorized instructor " . Section ( i ) deals with lesser training devices that are limited to 10 hours but is also required to be conducted by an authorized instructor . Reprising the short answer , any time spent in a simulator , flight training device or aviation training device where you are solo or without an authorized instructor does not count toward anything . Sim time is only valid when conducted by an authorized instructor .
Concorde went supersonic during its climb phase to the cruising altitude . The altitude at which the Concorde can go supersonic was limited by the regulations . For example , the aircraft was only allowed to go at 400 knots during the climb phase between 6,000 and 32,000 ft ; also , the aircraft was allowed to go supersonic only after it has crossed the coastline . As the air gets thinner during climb , the Mach number increases for same IAS , reaching around 0.93 at 25,000 ft and 0.95 at 28,000 ft. After this , the afterburners are engaged and autopilot is set to the cruising altitude ( ~ 60,000 ft ) . During this climb phase to the cruising altitude , the aircraft goes supersonic , settling at around Mach 2 at over 50,000 ft. The flight envelope limitations of Concorde ( at one configuration ) is shown in this image : <URL> Source : pprune.org The altitude affected the thrust requirements , as more thrust is required for the same speed at lower altitudes due to density . This is one of the reasons for Concorde flying at altitude far above that of subsonic airliners .
Yes . I assume that you do not have a good understanding of aerodynamics . I apologise if that is not the case . The way to think about these sort of questions is to ask " does the aircraft know that it 's moving in relation to the Earth " . The answer to this is " no " . The only thing that matters , and the only thing that the aircraft cares about is airflow ( wind ) over the wings . Ignore all sorts of little side effects and imagine an aircraft needs 70 kph of wind over the wings to generate lift and stay afloat , straight and level . Now , imagine the aircraft is flying along and you could somehow make the Earth disappear but leave behind gravity and the atmosphere . What would happen to the plane ? Nothing ! It still has 70 kph of wind over the wings and it keeps flying . Now put the Earth back . It still keeps flying . If the pilot reduces the power to 69 kph ( " thrust X " ) , the force generated by lift pushing the aircraft up is a little less than that generated by gravity pulling the aircraft down and the craft will start to descend . Eventually , it will land ( assuming that you remembered to put the Earth back ! ) . So two scenarios . First , one where the air is perfectly still and the thrust from the engine ( " thrust Y " ) is pushing the aircraft forward at 70 kph . Second , where the wind is blowing at 70 kph and thrust Y is such that the <URL> . Again , the aircraft does not know , or care , that it is stationary with respect to the Earth , just that it has 70 kph of wind over the wings . Modify the second scenario slightly so that the wind is now 69 kph . The aircraft moves forward at 1 kph . Again , the aircraft does not know , or care , that it is going fowards with respect to the Earth . The wind over the wings is still 70 kph ( speed of wind , 69 , plus speed of aircraft 1 ) . Reduce the thrust to X again and the aircraft will start to descend , and also become stationary . Eventually , it will land with no forward or backward speed . In reality , this would be almost impossible since the wind is never of a constant speed from a constant direction so little movements would always be taking place . I have seen a video , which I can no longer find , of a bi-plane which took off into a strong wind , flew backwards down the runway and landed on a spot before the one it took off from . <URL> . With just a little more wind , a vertical landing would have been possible .
The current 737 NG has only one engine choice , the CFM-56 . Although this means less choice for the customer , it allows the manufacturer to focus on supporting only one type of engine . The comparable A320 has options for the CFM-56 and the V2500 . The A320neo effectively replaced the CFM-56 with the LEAP-1 and the V2500 with the PW1000G . The 737 MAX will replace the CFM-56 with the LEAP-1 , and continue to provide only one engine choice . Note that on the A320neo both engines offer comparable performance overall , and orders are basically split between the two . Although the 737 MAX is behind the A320neo in sales , it 's unlikely that adding another engine choice would make much difference for the considerable expense it would require . The cheapest option is to use the PW1000G , and that still requires a lot of work for the manufacturer to integrate it into the airplane , and then test and certify the 737 with that engine . As with the LEAP-1 and CFM-56 , Boeing would prefer to have their own minor version of the engine certified , which adds more expense . There 's just no incentive to add another engine option at this point . A future version of the 737 could possibly use a geared turbofan , but it 's too early to tell if such a version will even be built . It certainly remains an option for future designs as engine manufacturers develop the technology further .
Other folks have already addressed why we want to lock the flight controls when we leave the aircraft - " to prevent damage from gusts of wind " , and " to keep the plane from doing interesting things in a strong breeze " . To the question of the " best " position to lock controls in , for light aircraft the general consensus is that the rudder and ailerons should be locked in the neutral position - In this position any wind blowing over the wings will cause them to lift uniformly , putting tension on the tiedown ropes holding the aircraft to the ground . ( If the ailerons are locked at an angle one wing will generate more lift than the other , allowing one of the tiedown ropes to go slack . ) Elevators are a subject of a little more nuance and debate : It 's generally considered best to lock the elevator in the " nose down " position ( because any gusts of wind over the tail will push the nose down , rather than encouraging the nose to lift , this also means that those gusts will apply tension to a tie-down rope located at the tail rather than causing it to go slack ) . On some aircraft locking the elevator in the nose-down ( or nose-up ) position opens up spaces that birds may try to nest in ( <URL> ) - some pilots prefer to lock the elevator of these aircraft in the neutral position to discourage avian visitors . Generally it 's better to lock the controls than leave them unlocked to bang around in the wind , so on some light aircraft not equipped with control locks pilots use the seatbelt to hold the controls in place . This often results in a " sub-optimal " control position ( elevator fully nose-up , ailerons full-deflection left or right ) , but because the wind speed at which control surfaces may bang against their stops is usually lower than the speed at which the aerodynamically unfavorable control positions will substantially affect the aircraft this is a " lesser of two evils " approach .
Qualifier : I am a master parachute rigger and taught sport skydiving for 10 years . Standard jump altitude is 12,000 feet AGL - this is one turn of the standard parachutist 's altimeter . This height provides 1 minute of freefall , is within reach of a Cessna with a decent engine and does not require supplementary oxygen . For most places , this means an operating altitude between 12,000 and 15,000 feet MSL . Dropzones in high areas like Denver will reduce their jump altitude to 9,500 feet AGL mainly because the piston-powered planes take too long to climb higher and/or the upper part of the climb runs into the oxygen zone .
There are at least 3 possible cases and unfortunately your question does n't tell which one you would consider valid . The maneuverability ( the maximum rate of rotation ? ) can be measured by the moment of the force exerted by the surface at the CG . Let 's consider the area of the control surface is smaller , and ... All other parameters are unchanged , in particular surface airfoil , center of pressure , and angle of attack : As the currently selected answer tells , the maximum lift available from the control surface is lower , hence the maximum moment is lower , and the maneuverability is reduced . As the airfoil and the angle of attack are unchanged , the stall characteristics are unaffected . This theoretical case is unlikely to be seen as the designer would certainly compensate the reduction of the area by some other change . The surface is moved to a location further from the CG to maintain the moment with the smaller lift force : Neither maneuverability nor stall characteristics are affected . The angle of attack is increased to generate more lift and compensate for the smaller area : Maneuverability is decreased as the maximum lift obtained with the maximum angle of attack is decreased . Stall is easier to trigger as the angle of attack ( for an equal moment ) is closer to the stall angle .
Just <URL> , it depends on the specifications . The manual for this <URL> vacuum attitude indicator says up to 40,000 feet . <URL> ( <URL> ) In an aircraft , the vacuum source is often used to power gyroscopes in the various flight instruments . To prevent the complete loss of instrumentation in the event of an electrical failure , the instrument panel is deliberately designed with certain instruments powered by electricity and other instruments powered by the vacuum source . -- <URL> In a piston engine airplane the vacuum pump is geared to the engine . Historically electric motors were n't reliable , that has changed now of course . At 80,000 feet the air density is only 14 % compared to 40,000 feet . I highly doubt it would be feasible ( size , weight , RPM ) to create such a pump . And I 'm pretty sure it 's of no use to jets .

Why does Boeing 737 use 2 Inertial Reference Systems ( IRS ) and GPS ?
Could somebody explain a little bit why they need 2 separate GPS and 2 separate IRS ? So that if one fails , the other can still be used to complete the flight . Airbus even have 3 . What is meant by " alignment " ? Initialization of the system and solving the " heading problem " through a magnetometer . But this is a different question .
None of the avionics systems I 've worked on have used Linux or any consumer-type operating system . There are a few main issues . First is the practical . Most safety-critical avionics involve a control loop and thus have a real-time requirement . That means it 's not just important to run a process and get an answer , you need to get the answer within a tightly-controlled time constraint . Every critical software process on an aircraft is scheduled to ensure that you have a stable control loop . To do that , you need a real-time OS and Linux is n't one . Second is the need for certification . Software used on an aircraft has to be developed to meet the appropriate development assurance level ( DAL ) for the associated hazard level . Safety critical systems are required to meet DAL level " A " . Any OS you use has to meet the same DAL as the function running on it . These requirements are defined in RTCA <URL> . Linux was n't developed to this standard . There are only a few OS/software development platforms that are capable of being certified . Green Hills , Wind River , and LynxOS are the few systems I 'm familiar with that meet the requirements . There is also one other constraint in that certification requires very stringent version control . Avionics will exist in the field for many years and any changes to it have to be certified as well . Generally , there 's no valid reason to update the OS on an old unit , and in many cases you could n't without upgrading hardware ( which is a bigger expense no one wants ) . So in updating an old unit I have to build the ' new ' software to run on the whatever version of OS currently exists in the product . That could be a 15 or 20 years old ( or older ) platform . A rapidly evolving OS such as Linux would have a negative impact on long term product support .
According to the Payload/range diagrams from the <URL> ( page 95 ) , the fuel capacity is 32 539 kg ( 71 737 lb ) <URL>
From " Smart Cockpit " <URL> ( PDF ! ) <URL> AFDS Status Annunciation The following AFDS status annunciations are displayed just above the PFD attitude display : • FLT DIR ( the flight director is ON and the autopilots are not engaged ) • A/P ( the autopilots are engaged ) • LAND 3 ( three autopilots are engaged and operating normally for an automatic landing ) • LAND 2 ( AFDS redundancy is reduced ; in some cases , only two autopilots are available ) • NO AUTOLAND ( the AFDS is unable to make an automatic landing ) . With a LAND 3 indication , the autopilot system level of redundancy is such that a single fault can not prevent the autopilot system from making an automatic landing ( fail operational ) . With a LAND 2 indication , the level of redundancy is such that a single fault can not cause a significant deviation from the flight path ( fail passive ) . An EICAS message is displayed for any fault which limits the capability of the automatic landing system . Aural alerts for EICAS messages not affecting safety of flight are inhibited until after touchdown . Changes in autoland status below 200 feet , other than a transition to NO AUTOLAND status , are inhibited . From Chapter 9 , pages 22-23
The fundamental benefit is that the operator does n't have to make a lot of adjustments on " legacy " airplanes , they can " simply " install the arm on the existing aircraft that they already have in service . And this is the main selling point for such a device , they are not marketing it to operators that still have to buy or lease an airliner , but to those that already have one and might want to reduce the number of pilots they have to employ . Gürkan Çetin notes in the comments that this device is not certified ( yet ) . That 's partially the point of such demonstrations , to convince authorities that it can be certified , and to incentivate operators to lobby for their approval .
Because it was something of a <URL> trademark since his early days . His first designs , the VariViggen and VariEze , had such a wing already , and apparently he saw no reason to optimize the wing of the Starship . <URL> Rutan VariEze in flight ( picture <URL> ) The only true innovation was a variable geometry canard , which he even <URL> . Being only 85 % scale , the performance of the Starship prototype was formidable , but once the real production aircraft had been designed with full compliance to airworthiness regulations , the Beech Starship turned out to be less impressive . The additional wetted surface produced more friction drag . Piaggio 's design is clearly superior . By the way , the idea behind the variable geometry canard was sound : In the landing configuration it would balance the additional lift from the fowler flaps on the wing . But the whole mechanism cost more in weight than the reduction in drag during cruise could save . <URL> Drawing from US Patent 4641800 .
The EICAS will have the engine instruments and the crew alerting system in one display . It is a vital instrument because it displays engine parameters , fuel , the crew alert system and other systems information depending on the specific airplane . The CAS ( crew alerting ) functionality of the EICAS replaces the illuminated fault buttons in older airplanes . <URL> <URL> CC-BY-SA 3.0 The electronic CAS that is part of an EICAS display is a superset of these old panels and can display a much bigger set of alerts . The specific alerts that can be shown will cover most error and failure modes the airplane systems can reasonably encounter . Cautions are yellow in color and will illuminate the master caution and sound an audible chime . Warnings are red in color and will illuminate the master warning and sound the triple chime ( and the fire bell for certain conditions ) . There may also be advisory messages displayed in another color , e.g. cyan , on the EICAS . <URL> EMB-145 EICAS . The CAS is the upper right portion of the display The messages themselves are terse and not detailed , though detail can be inferred from the pre-defined message text . Warnings and cautions that are displayed can be addressed with memory immediate action items ( memorized checklists ) and/or the QRH ( quick reference handbook ) which defines the procedures for dealing with problems in a verbose checklist flowchart . The QRH will be indexed by the messages on the CAS so they can be easily found and referenced .
TesterMen Tester provided some very good information , which I think requires a bit of explanation . The older version of the regulation seems to require fuel dump if MTOW is more than 105 percent of MLW . <URL> have weight limits meeting that requirement , so based on that regulation , it seems like fuel dump would be required . But as the Boeing info shows , none of the 737 versions have fuel dump capability . <URL> to allow a plane to not have a fuel dump system as long as it can meet certain performance requirements . The <URL> includes this as well . However , this does not explain why the 737-100/200 , which were certified before that amendment , do n't have fuel dump capability , when the MTOW listed by the Boeing info above are 108 % and 112 % of the MLW . <URL> is that the original versions of the aircraft had lower MTOW , which met the 105 % rule . Newer engines allowed the MTOW to be increased , but as rbp mentioned , MLW is based on landing gear and structural limits , so it did not change . The FAA amended the regulation with the required performance option to allow the higher MTOW without requiring fuel dump capability . Also , as explained in answers to <URL> , planes can land over MLW , there just may be required inspections . Note that the similar-sized A320 family <URL> .
Yes . Fighter aircraft have air conditioning systems . In general , they are called as Environmental Conditioning Systems ( ECS ) . Their primary functions ( as far as cockpit goes ) include , Cockpit Pressurization Heating/Cooling/air-conditioning Windshield anti-fog/anti-ice The systems usually use conditioned engine bleed air or this purpose . The cockpit air conditioning is usually managed by the pilot . For example , in case of F-15 , the <URL> : <URL> Image from f-15e . info with the available controls listed as , TEMP switch : A three-way switch to manage cockpit temperature . When AUTO , cockpit temperature is automatically maintained at the temperature selected on the TEMP knob . When MANUAL , cockpit temperature may be changed with the knob , but not maitained automatically . When OFF , it shuts down off ECS air . TEMP knob : A rotary knob to set the cockpit temperature . FLOW switch : A three-way switch to select air flow . MIN , MAX and NORM settings are available for minimum/maximum/normal air flow , respectively . FLOW knob : A four-position knob to set the air source . When BOTH , bleed air is supplied from both engines . When L ENG or R ENG , bleed air is supplied from the left/right engine only . When OFF , no bleed air is supplied . The following image shows the other controls associated with ECS . <URL> Image from f-15e . info
There is no uplink in ADS-B . The aircraft is broadcasting information which is received by parties unknown to the ADS-B transmitter . There is no reply and there is no uplink like there is in Mode-S . The receiving parties listen on 1090MHz for ADS-B broadcast . A technology related to ADS-B is TIS-B ( Traffic Information Service - Broadcast ) . This is used in the USA to transmit positions of aircraft that are not equipped with 1090ES ADS-B but are detected by FAA radar or UAT ADS-B in an ADS-B like format on 1090MHz . This allows parties listening on 1090MHz for ADS-B traffic to identify non 1090ES equipped aircraft with the same receiver . TIS-B could be seen as form of uplink , but uses the 1090MHz frequency nevertheless as it allows the same ADS-B receiver to be used .
The chines help when the nacelle is very close to the wing . When the engine of Boeing 's 737 was changed from the slim JT-8D to the higher bypass ratio CFM-56 on the 737-300 and later , the chines were essential to avoid large flow separation . Generally , aircraft with higher landing gear can afford to have more space between nacelle and wing and do not need fixes like chines . But when a new engine has been fitted to an existing design , chances are that some vortex generators are needed to fix the new flow conditions . For the nitpickers : The 737-100 and 200 had underslung nacelles which left no space between wing and nacelle , but that is aerodynamically similar to a nacelle at a larger distance , because no narrow flow paths are created which produce steep pressure gradients . Only a closely mounted , but still separate nacelle will have these flow conditions which need to be remedied by energizing the boundary layer .
They need the throughput . Got to use what you have . They utilize their crossing runways to the full under any conditions that allow it . Major commercial airports try to have as many parallel runways as possible , as crossing runways are a hassle . ( See DFW , ATL , LAX , many other examples of new or remodelled major airports using almost exclusively parallel runways ) . But sometimes ( for any number of reasons , a main one at LGA being space ) parallel runways have n't been built , so they ca n't be used .
For the first half century of manned flight , landing gears overwhelmingly had only a single , large wheel per leg . This was the cheapest and simplest way to ensure ground mobility , but ran into trouble when aircraft grew in size . When the XB-36 prototype started testing in 1946 , <URL> were able to tolerate the 156 psi pressure of its single main wheels . For operating from unprepared surfaces , tracked gears were the straightforward transfer from tank experience to landing gear design . <URL> Tracked main gear on the XB-36 prototype ( picture <URL> ) However , another route which was tried at about the same time was to increase the number of wheels the aircraft rests upon . With hindsight , the multi-wheel way was the better solution and has prevailed . When used with large , <URL> it does <URL> than a tracked gear . Some early and rather extreme examples for the multi-wheel route include the <URL> four-engine tactical transport aircraft . Only 20 were produced , however . <URL> Arado 232 from up close . No prize for guessing why it had the nickname " Tausendfüssler " ( millipede ) ( picture <URL> ) . When it comes to designing large aircraft for soft field operations , the Ukrainian design bureau Antonov has unsurpassed experience . This comes to bear in the landing gear of the <URL> , shown below ( <URL> ) . When you have 24 wheels to spread the load out , even 400 tons might not be too heavy , especially when the tire pressure can be adjusted from the cockpit . <URL> An-124 in a botched landing . No worry , the gear will tolerate this kind of abuse , too . Therefore , the research on tracked gears has come to an end shortly after it begun , and even the B-36 ended its days on a four-wheel bogie . Today , every large airplane has at least two wheels per leg for redundancy and <URL> .
If such a pair of states does exist it ought to be straddling a Mach boundary ( I think ) <URL> e.g. . A subsonic &amp; B trans-sonic . Or A trans-sonic &amp; B supersonic etc. . Reasoning : To get from any point A to B in parameter space should usually be a state function i.e. path independent . i.e. . You can give many tiny increments or one large increment . In our context a parameter space means mostly a pair . To go from to you need a certain thrust profile . The required thrust profile is not unique . Now the above path independance statement is true in general , except when a dissipative force exists . Now you no longer have a state function . Since drag , a dissipative force , is indeed a strong function of speed it will help to not linger in the high drag region i.e. transsonic region with wave drag . In this zone the drag coefficient increases rapidly and you will have a total drag much higher than at both sub-sonic and super-sonic speeds . And that would give a high thrust afterburner the advantage needed over a dry engine : On afterburner you can zoom through the transsonic region rapidly than trudge through it incrementally on dry thrust . Thereby saving on drag losses . You are still consuming more fuel per unit time but the time spent is reduced so much that it makes the higher specific consumption worthwhile . Caveat : This is just an qualitative argument . A more mathematical argument is needed to add rigor to the analysis . Edit : Maybe these schematic plots help clarify my argument . <URL>
Audible Warning On light aircraft there is a reed ( much like used on a musical wind instrument ) mounted on one wing root , which is angled such that at the Angle of Attack which would cause a stall , the reed " plays " which can be heard in the cockpit . Here is a view of where this system is mounted on a Cessna <URL> On some aircraft , it is a similar principal , however instead of a reed , it uses a fin which at critical AoA pushes a micro-switch which activates a buzzer/horn inside the cockpit . Here is the assembly on a Beech 18 <URL> So , if you ever see anyone doing this : They are not kissing their aircraft for good luck , merely testing the stall warn as part of pre-flight checks ! Tactile Warning In addition to an audible reed/buzz/horn , most aircraft also provide tactile feedback to the pilot of an impending stall . In purely mechanical aircraft the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot when approaching a stall . In hydraulic or fly-by-wire aircraft , this is provided by a mechanical " stick shaker " linked to the same system as sounding the audible alarm .
Speed of a plane is actually measured in a number of different ways , and relative to different things . Here is a summary of the different types : Indicated Airspeed ( IAS ) . This is the number shown on the instrument that measures airspeed , and is n't really relative to anything . Rectified Airspeed ( RAS ) or Calibrated Air Speed ( CAS ) This is IAS corrected for known errors in the instrument and the measurement system . True Air Speed This is the speed relative to the air around the aircraft ; usually found by correcting the RAS for pressure and some other errors . Ground Speed This is the speed relative to the ground , or a fixed point on the earth ( ' imaginary grid ) . Its the vector addition of the True Airspeed ( and direction ) plus the wind speed ( and direction ) . In olden days this was estimated from the Airspeed and the wind velocity , or through dead reckoning navigation , but now it is trivially found from GPS or other navigation aids . Planes use different ones of these for different purposes . Measurements relative to the fixed stars are not generally useful until you are in the realm of space travel .
The reason is twofold : The materials used and the high aspect ratio . The 747-8 primarily uses advance aluminum alloys , while the 787 uses carbon composites . The carbon composites flex more compared to the aluminum alloys . This can be achieved because the carbon fibers are anisotropic and their properties can be tailored in each direction . The yield strain of the aluminum alloys used in aerospace is ~ 1 % , while that of the <URL> is about 50 % higher , ~ 1.5 % . These material characteristics mean that the carbon spar can flex more compared to the aluminum one . This effect is magnified by the high aspect ratio of the Boeing 787 . The aspect ratio of the 787 is about <URL> while that of the 747-8 is about <URL> . This means that the wings are more slender and flex more for the same load . The 787 wings are able to take this flexing in part because of the excellent fatigue properties of the Carbon composites used . See <URL> for a very good discussion on the causes and effects of wing flexing in 787 .
How Boeing 747 is called Jumbo Jet ? The <URL> is the world 's first wide-body aircraft . For a long time , it was the world 's largest passenger aircraft1 . When Boeing was designing the 747 in mid-1960s , it expected that in the near future <URL> would become the norm . Hence , there would not be a need for the passenger version of 747 . Because of this , 747s were designed in a way that they can be easily converted into freighters . <URL> , being one of the first customers of 747 , wanted to fit two rows of cargo containers2 , instead of one . This meant that the fuselage had to be at least 16 feet wide , wider than any airliner at that time . This would have worked fine for cargo , but it would make loading and unloading passengers very time-consuming . To accommodate this , Boeing engineers designed two aisles , which ran parallel through the length of the aircraft , hence the term <URL> was coined . When the press noticed the huge size , they described it with the catchy term Jumbo Jet . It is also known as Queen of the Skies but that is not common . Do other airplanes have nicknames ? Airbus A380 dubbed as superjumbo by media . The only A380 sold as a business jet is called <URL> . Although there are n't official nicknames of airplanes , almost all airplanes earned <URL> . <URL> contains nicknames for mostly military aircraft . 1 <URL> as world 's largest passenger airplane in 2007 . 2 At that time , cargo containers were cubes that measured 8 feet ( 2.44 m ) per side .

Inertial Reference System is a solid state set of <URL> which navigate using <URL> . The system measures accelerations in and rotation around each of the 3 axis so can calculate where it is by adding how much it has moved to the initial position . A simple example : The aircraft is stationary pointing North . Over a 10 minute period , it measures the accelerations in the X and Y axis and calculates that is has moved +100 kms in the X axis ( i.e. North ) and +100 kms in the Y axis ( i.e. West ) . By simple trigonometry , we can calculate that the aircraft is approximately 141.4 kms on a bearing of 45 degrees from it 's initial position . The gyros must be aligned with the aircraft frame of reference when it is stationary . This is the " alignment " process and generally must be completed before the aircraft moves . It may also take inputs of the current position from a manual keyboard or from some other system , e.g. GPS . More modern IRS fits can align when the aircraft is moving , taking an updated position from GPS . There are 2 systems on the 737 , simply for redundancy . <URL>

Why do n't airliners carry radar jamming technology or missile counter measures ?
<URL> ( and other Israeli ) aircraft are equipped with <URL> since fire at Arkira B757 in Mombasa in 2002 . Infra-red counter-measures are relatively simple ( it has a small radar to detect missiles and if one is detected , dispenses burning decoys ) , so it can be mounted on almost any aircraft . The system however poses additional fire risk ( the flares have to burn very hot and the system has to be able to ignite them ) , so it is only used in areas where risk of terrorist attack is high . Switzerland ( and possibly other countries ) even prohibit it on their territory . Apparently laser-based system is in development to resolve the fire issue , but it will still only work against IR-guided missiles . But for radar guided missiles like the <URL> system probably involved in this incident there only seem to be three defences : Hit the tracking radar with your own missile ( like <URL> ) before they hit you . Fighter aircraft is obviously needed to carry it , though most fighter types could be used as they only need radar detector and suitable hardpoints . Generate sufficiently intense microwave signal that it overdrives the detector in the missile head and effectively blinds it . This is heavy , expensive and requires power ( not outside the range of common aircraft generators , but the increased fuel burn would probably be noticeable ) , so even most fighters do n't have it . Instead the system ( like <URL> ) is mounted on special-purpose aircraft like <URL> that gets included in attack group trying to penetrate enemy territory with heavy air defences . Minimizing radar cross-section , ie . stealth . That requires completely different designs that are aerodynamically less efficient , because the funny shapes are necessary part of being stealth and that are not trackable by ATC surveillance radars . Obviously the first is out of question for airliners - carrying any weapons or munitions of war on civil airliners is prohibited by <URL> article 35 . While the second would be technically possible ( <URL> , an airborne command centre , and <URL> , the Air Force One , are modified Boeing 747s and both have counter-measures against both IR-guided and radar-guided missiles ) , those modifications would be a heavy , expensive and complex protection against something that <URL> . And the third would have too many disadvantages . It would hide the aircraft from ATC surveillance radars that have averted many more accidents than were caused by missiles and it would require new , less efficient designs that would be massively expensive . Just few month ago we wanted MH-370 to be seen by radars . We ca n't have both . Staying away from the war zones is a safer option anyway and is normally possible . In this case likely explanation why MH-17 did n't is that the Ukrainian authorities were not aware that the rebels have this air defence system , assumed they only have a lighter-weight one ( those are often usable to about 20000 ' ; the military aircraft shot down on previous days were lower ) and only closed the airspace up to FL320 rather than completely .
You are asking two very different , but related , questions : How is separation provided in procedural airspace ? ( that is , airspace where no surveillance exists ) What are the emergency procedures when a surveillance system fails ? I will address them in that order . There are three main types of separation : vertical separation , horizontal separation and separation in the vicinity of the aerodrome . I am going to assume you are not asking about separation in the vicinity of an aerodrome . We can divide horizontal separation further into three parts : lateral separation , longitudinal separation and radar separation . Obviously , radar separation does not apply in procedural airspace . Common for all separation types , when used in procedural airspace , is that they are based on position reports made by the pilots . When we do not have transponders to broadcast the position and level of flights , the pilots have to manually tell us where they are . Vertical separation is pretty straight forward . It is very easy to apply , and we often prefer vertical separation ( even in radar airspace ) , simply because it is so easy . Vertical separation is obtained by requiring aircraft to operate at different levels expressed in terms of flight levels or altitudes . In most areas today , 1000 feet is the minimum vertical separation . 2000 feet is still used as minimum in some places . For more details , you should research Reduced Vertical Separation Minima ( RVSM ) . Lateral Separation is obtained by requiring aircraft to fly on different routes or in different geographical locations , as determined by visual observations , use of navaids or RNAV equipment . The idea is , if two aircraft are flying in two different places , then they wo n't collide . One example of application of lateral separation is two aircraft flying on two different radials of the same VOR ( radio beacon ) . If the aircraft are established on radials diverging by at least 15 degrees and at least one aircraft is 15 NM or more from the VOR , they are separated - per definition , regardless of the actual distance between them . Another common example is approach procedures and different holding patterns . Certain procedures are designed in a way that ensures sufficient separation . For example , an NDB approach procedure might be separated from a nearby holding pattern . Again , we do not care about the actual distance between the aircraft - the two procedures are separated , by definition , if that is how they are designed . Longitudinal Separation is used for aircraft at the same level , flying on the same , reciprocal or crossing tracks . Longitudinal separation is based on time or distance . For example , two aircraft following the same route are separated if there is 15 minutes between them . That is , if aircraft A reports overhead point XYZ at 09:12 and aircraft B reports overhead point XYZ at 09:30 , they are separated . Now , 15 minutes is a long time , and it can be reduced in certain circumstances , but these are the kind of rules we have to follow in procedural airspace ( when vertical separation can not be used ) . There might be a hundred miles between two aircraft with 14 minutes between , but they are not separated . You can also base longitudinal separation on distance , if two aircraft are operating directly to or from the same DME ( distance measuring equipment ) . In this case , the minimum separation is 20 NM ( and can be reduced in some cases ) . In addition to the two above rules ( 15 minutes or 20 NM ) , there are many , many rules regarding crossing tracks , reciprocal tracks , separation during level changes , separation between aircraft with different speeds , and so on . Common for all of them is that the pilots will have to report their position , and then the controller has to apply separation in accordance with the rules . That sums up the separation methods and minima in procedural airspace . Now for your second question : what if radar airspace suddenly becomes procedural airspace as a result of a system failure ? Needless to say , this is extremely rare . Systems are very reliable , and there are backups , and backups of backups . That aside : The first thing to realise is that this would most likely be considered an emergency situation , which means that normal rules and regulations do not apply . Many pilots do n't realise this , but the word " mayday " is not actually reserved for pilot use only . You will likely hear a transmission from the ATC unit that sounds something like " Mayday , mayday , mayday , all stations , radar service terminated due to equipment failure , stop transmitting , standby for further instructions " . At this point , you should make sure the volume of your TCAS is turned up ... However , it is important to remember that controllers are trained to handle situations like this . Local procedures are different , but the controllers will either attempt to establish procedural separation , or transfer traffic to adjacent units , if they have radar available . Even when the system fails , the controller
Proper trim control technique involves exerting control pressure to attain the desired attitude then using the trim to alleviate the requirement of holding that pressure . There can be a temptation for pilots to make small adjustments using trim alone . Resist the temptation and use the proper procedure . We use the proper technique because it 's the most precise way to use trim . If adjustments are made with the trim directly we 'll end up over-controlling and chasing the correct trim position . Trim is n't just a convenience . Especially for pilots flying in instrument conditions , alleviating the load of holding control pressure and ensuring that if the pilot lets go of the controls the airplane maintains its attitude are a matter of safety . The <URL> explains Trim Control starting on 3-6 . It lists the proper technique in greater detail and provides a complete rationale . There 's also the matter of doing things the same way every time . Once we 've established the right procedure , we should always use it to enforce the habit . This also benefits the pilot when things get busy . Proficient instrument pilots are experts in using trim effectively . Predefined trim positions are impractical because they vary based on weight , CG , airspeed and other factors . These factors change the amount of downforce required on the elevator and therefore the trim position . Situations like " level at 8000 " or " gliding descent " wo n't always result in the same trim position . For other control surfaces there are similar factors . We do have predefined trim positions for takeoff , but loading often makes those undesirable and trimming is required immediately . During flight training , good trimming technique becomes especially important during instrument training . There 's a lot of good information about trim and its importance in the <URL> .

The <URL> you are referring to explains how radar is used to fly through a <URL> whilst avoiding the most turbulent areas . Conventional weather radar can not detect wind speed or turbulence directly , it only detects solid and liquid objects above a threshold size . The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice . This precipitation reflects radar waves very well so the most turbulent areas have the strongest reflections and shows up as red / purple on the scope . The area downwind of the core is usually very turbulent as well . So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water . It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence . <URL> ( CAT ) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar . There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft . As @reirab noted in a comment , a Doppler radar can be used to detect the relative speed of the particles from an aircraft . This is not used to reliably detect wind speed , but when there are large variations in wind speed ( a.k.a. turbulence ) the Doppler shift in the reflections from the particles causes a spectrum spread . This is an indication for turbulence . The traditional S-band airborne weather radars do not have this capability but the newer X-band radar ( e.g. this <URL> ) can detect wet turbulence to distance of up to 40-60 nautical miles using this technique . LIDAR ( a portmanteau of Light and RADAR ) is a technology that uses light instead of radio waves . LIDAR can measure position and relative velocity of aerosols and therefore it can be used to detect turbulence . It has been used successfully to detect wind shears and map wake vortices on final approach from the ground ( <URL> ) . <URL> ( <URL> , <URL> ) is going on into airborne use of LIDAR to detect CAT . One of the difficulty is to detect vertical components of the turbulence . This causes very little Doppler shift but at the same time have the most effect on the aircraft ( since the vertical component of turbulence causes changes in angle of attack ) . As far as I know there are currently no commercial applications of LIDAR for airborne turbulence detection .
Because there is no need for more engines . Though one can argue that losing one engine in a twin results in loss of half the thrust , the question is how often does that happen . Engine reliability has improved significantly through the years and engine failures are quite rare today . I 'm not sure how ground clearance is an advantage for quads . For quad engined aircraft using today 's high bypass turbofans , the inboard engines would have to be mounted higher for suffecient ground clearance - this is actually a disadvantage as it results in a longer landing gear . In aircraft , more engines means more ( cost and ) maintenance and in a way , more things to fail , as there are more subsystems . In effect , there is no great reliability advantage of quads over twins . One main reason for having more than two engines , ETOPS certification , is no longer relevant . In fact most of the longest routes in the world are flown by the 777 , a twin . The best way is to look at the market - there are no quad engined aircraft under development and most of the aircraft in order are twins ( A380 and 747-8s are struggling to get orders ) . This clearly shows that the customers prefer twin engines over quads .
Flight tests of new aircraft are covered under Part 21 Subpart B -- Type Certificates <URL> . There is no provision for the carrying of ' passengers ' during any test flights , but then , there is no limit on the number of ' flight crew ' either . FAA regulations does not explicitly prohibit the carrying of any passengers as such ; however , it places onus on the applicant for ensuring the safety of anyone abroad during test flights : ( d ) Each applicant must show for each flight test ( except in a glider or a manned free balloon ) that adequate provision is made for the flight test crew for emergency egress and the use of parachutes . This places severe restriction on carrying of anyone during test flights . However , before certification , the manufacturer can carry passengers as long as it is not for commercial purposes . Actually , Airbus did this during the <URL> : Another important aspect of A380 and A350 XWB testing was the Early Long Flights ( ELF ) programmes , which went above and beyond certification requirements . For these evaluations , a cabin-equipped flight-test aircraft was operated on simulated commercial services with real " passengers " -- comprised of Airbus employees -- and actual airline flight crews to evaluate cabin systems in typical operating conditions . Unless the flight testing is at an advanced stage or the manufacturer is extremely confident of the design , I do n't see any non-essential flight crew being allowed in test flights , for obvious reasons . In case of test flights after maintenance or alteration , <URL> - Operation after maintenance , preventive maintenance , rebuilding , or alteration says almost the same thing : ( b ) No person may carry any person ( other than crewmembers ) in an aircraft that has been maintained , rebuilt , or altered in a manner that may have appreciably changed its flight characteristics or substantially affected its operation in flight until an appropriately rated pilot with at least a private pilot certificate flies the aircraft , makes an operational check of the maintenance performed or alteration made , and logs the flight in the aircraft records .
Shutting off the computer is difficult from a technical implementation standpoint . You 're handing over a lot of power to the computers and sensors letting it shut down an engine , where these usually do not have access and control . This is certainly not always a good idea . Pulling the fire handle is a pretty aggressive move : It will typically disable hydraulics , electrical power , and bleed air coming from that engine . If you 're not prepared for it , it can end badly . The engine will often be partially functional , depending on the type of failure . If you get dual engine fire indications , you 'd probably wait with shutting them down , if doing that at all . This sort of behaviour would have to be coded into the flight computers . I do n't think there are any catastrophic consequences of not switching the engine within 8 seconds rather than maybe 2 seconds . It does not make a great difference . To set off the detectors , it must already have spread a little . I do n't think you could do it much faster with the pilot staying updated on what 's going on . Needless to say , computers sometimes get things wrong . There is a human level to check what 's going on before proceeding . There are times when you do n't want the computer doing it 's own thing . <URL> : If an engine fire occurs during takeoff or go-around , the Pilot Flying shall first establish and stabilise the aircraft on a safe climb path and then proceed with the ENG FIRE procedure . Footnote : It could certainly be done , but with the pilot-computer relationship on current flightdecks it 's not a good idea .
The transponders that have the problem of inadvertently selecting/transmitting " incorrect " ( or emergency ) codes are old-tech designs . Much like the old-tech radio designs there was no concept of " standby frequency " or " code being entered " - whatever was on the face of the instrument is what it 's doing . Radios of the same vintage have the same interface ( e.g. the KX-170b ) : <URL> The usual solution for the old-tech transponders is to think before you spin the knob . If you were squawking and told to squawk VFR ( 1200 in the US or 7000 in most of Europe ) you would n't turn the right-digit until you 'd adjusted one of the other two so you would n't inadvertently squawk one of the emergency/alert codes . ( The radar system could still see you squawking the " wrong " code for one or two passes in this situation , but that 's a self-resolving problem and it generally does n't set off any alarms for ATC . ) Modern ( push-button entry ) transponders do have an " inactive " squawk code in that then new code is n't transmitted until after you 're done entering it . Most also have a clear or one-touch VFR button in case you make an error entering the new code , so if ATC assigned you code and you inadvertently punched in turbulence you do n't need to keep entering a " wrong " code - just hit clear or VFR and try again .
Aircraft , fixed-wing or rotorcraft , have limited capability to produce a sideways force , so they simply ca n't throw you out . It is a matter of physics . Inertial forces ( gravity and centrifugal force ) act on you and the aircraft the same , so they wo n't make you move relative to the aircraft . The only force between you and the seat is caused by the aerodynamic forces . And the wing or rotor can only produce significant force vertically , and some torque with help of control surfaces . But for lateral force there is only drag of the fuselage and the vertical stabilizer and , in most helicopters , anti-torque rotor , which do n't produce that much force unless there is really bad turbulence or in some cases if the handling is really bad . When aircraft turns , it banks to be able to produce the necessary side force , so the resulting force is still mostly straight to the floor . Of course the other reason is that all aircraft and helicopters have seat-belts and the people sitting by open door usually have them on -- except for skydivers , who have the parachute on already , and rescue divers who are tied to the winch instead .
For services like FlightRadar24 they typically get data in two ways : via volunteers hosting ADS-B receiver stations on the ground , and directly from the ATC radar system in places where that data is readily available . For the ADS-B equipped aircraft these services would need volunteers in the area of Ivato Airport ( FMMI ) to host ADS-B receivers . <URL> , and they even offer free " premium " services ( and occasionally free receivers ) to people who help provide data . If it 's legal in your area , and you are willing to run a receiver station you may want to look into it , and this will get you aircraft which are broadcasting ADS-B data ( Mode S+ES with GPS position information ) . For the aircraft which are not broadcasting ADS-B information ( because they lack an appropriate transponder or GPS system ) the problem is a little more complicated - the organization that runs ATC in Madagascar would need to set up radar sites ( which presumably exist ) , and make that information publicly available ( which may or may not be the case ) . A system would then need to be developed to allow the online radar services to process that data and make the flight tracks available ( subject to whatever delays may be imposed in that process ) . As I do n't know much ( anything really ) about the ATC system in Madagascar , so I 'm not sure how robust the radar infrastructure is or how open they might be with their data , so I ca n't really comment on that half of the system .
Yes . From the PoV of stealth aircraft , the podded engine has significant disadvantages : The engine pod has a high Radar Cross Section ; In fact , stealth aircraft bury the engine inside their fuselages to minimize radar cross section . For example , the B2 Spirit engines were located inside the fuselage , as shown in the schematic below . <URL> The exposed compressor blades in the podded engine reflects radar waves , which is not good . For example , in Boeing X-32 , the location of the engine meant that the compressor blades will be exposed to the Radar and baffles were ( proposed to be ) added to reduce the Radar cross section . On the other hand , it can be seen that it is practically impossible to see the F-22 compressor blades from any angle of the inlet . <URL> Source : f-16 . net In case of podded engine , it is difficult to shield the exhaust thermal signature . Compare the infrared signature of the typical airliner in the following picture with that of the B-2 Spirit in the next picture . <URL> Source : laserfocusworld.com <URL> Source : bestfighter4canada.blogspot.in Of course , contemporary combat aircraft do n't use podded engines at all ( with the exception of the A-10 , which is a ground attack aircraft ) .
Horizontal stabilizers do n't generate as much pressure difference as the wings . Generally the stab deflections are very small in flight , and there 's so much other drag during landing -- when the stab gets the most use -- that wing vortices from the tail are probably the least of your problems . Stabilizer winglets on their own , when there 's no pressure difference , would simply result in drag , whereas the main wing winglets are constantly effective while flying . Furthermore , the weight and trouble of adding little winglets to the horizontal stabilizers with larger actuators and hinges , for example , would probably outweigh the very slight aerodynamic benefit . I could also imagine that since the airflow over latter part of the wing is complex and varied , find a good design solution would be difficult . As @Federico points out , the DA42 has them , but that 's a composite airframe rather than the metal construction you see in most Cessnas , for instance , where you have to be more conservative in construction .
In addition to <URL> , I am contributing some more details . Airbus 380 has room ( <URL> ) for potable water tanks which can be added to existing on-board water capacity for showers etc. . As we know , the showers are n't available for everyone but only for first class , which is probably less than 5 % of the total number of passengers , so the water usage is not tremendously huge . Waster consumption and shower duration is also controlled . <URL> makes the showers for Emirates and states : Low water consumption of less than 5 litres per minute When <URL> shower duration is consumed , it shuts down and you have to turn it on again for the remaining 75 seconds . Here is a <URL> ( including video ) of a passenger enjoying the spa .
I agree , Malaysian MH132 was a Non-Event . If the pilots had any concerns over the slight variation in their routing , they should have mentioned it before they loaded it into the Flight Management System ( FMS ) . I currently fly long haul B777 for a major airline . I ca n't speak for others , but at the airline I work for we do many " gross error checks " . Some are done in flight planning , some during the loading of the FMC , and some are done during the flight . While still in the flight planing area , the Captain and First Officer will look at the total routing in regards to wind , temperature , turbulence , volcanic activity , etc. . Often a call is made to the dispatcher who generated the Operational Flight Plan ( OFP ) to discuss the routing , expected levels of turbulence , and fuel reserves . About 20 % of the time the Captain will request a slight change to the routing or additional fuel be added . A new OFP is then generated and it will be designated " Release 2 " . Both the flight plan route and ICAO flight plan route are printed on the OFP and we compare the two . I have never found an error in the 17 years I have been doing it , but we still do it every time . Once the Captain , FO and augment pilots ALL agree , the OFP is officially accepted and we head to the aircraft . ( up to 4 pilots on Ultra Long Haul flights ) When we get to the aircraft we run though the basic preflight checks , and then the flight plan is downloaded to the FMS using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) digital datalink system . The departure runway and SID is also loaded at this time . Before we " activate " and " execute " the routing , the Pilot Monitoring ( PM ) reads the entire FMC routing and the Pilot Flying ( PF ) compares it to the OFP . After runway takeoff performance data is loaded we then check the " Legs " page of the FMC for a logical sequence of legs . We generally just check to make sure there are no course reversals on the various legs of the route . If there are any user defined waypoints ( Lat/Long waypoints ) we perform bearing and distance checks of the FMC against the OFP . This is done with the the Heading Reference switched to TRUE heading instead of Magnetic for more accurate numbers . These bearing and distance checks are not done for " Named " waypoints , only Lat/Long waypoints . Wind data is then requested and then loaded via ACARS . Next is a check of the FMC distance compared to both the OFP distance and Great Circle Route distance . The FMC distance is almost always somewhere between the OFP distance and GCR distance . This check is one sure way to spot a routing entry error . Finally a check of the FMC and OFP predicted fuel over destination is done . If there is a large difference , it means either the routing or winds were incorrectly entered . Once airborne there are more checks : In the old days before GPS we would check the accuracy of the Inertial Navigation System ( INS ) as we approached the coast for any over water flight . This was usually done using a VOR/DME fix . Once airborne we again check bearing and distance as we approach each user defined waypoint ( Lat/Long waypoint ) . Once past the waypoint by about 5 mins we then plot our current Lat/Long on a plotting chart to insure we are still on course .
Yes , cargo aircraft are like other aircraft in that there is generally at least a jump seat available . Especially larger aircraft will also have <URL> . This area can be used for relief crew , or other crew that are <URL> . There are exceptions though . The upper deck of the 747 is <URL> than just the cockpit , even on the <URL> <URL> . There is more room in the back for additional crew . The <URL> and An-225 also have additional space for crew behind the cockpit . The extra crew can be loadmasters , navigators , mechanics , or other functions that can make it easier to operate in and out of airports with less services available . Here is the upper deck of a 747-400F : <URL>
A yaw damper means added cost , weight , complexity , and one more system that has to be maintained . That 's the downside . The upside , for most GA aircraft is that they relieve the pilot of having to make a " coordinated " turn . In other words , having to apply appropriate rudder input along with aileron input . Is that convenience worth the downside when the pilot has internalized doing that without having to think about it ? That 's a matter of opinion . For myself , a yaw damper in any of the , say , single engine Cessnas would be a waste . There are some GA aircraft that could benefit from a yaw damper in other than banking into a turn or leveling from a turn . For example , in level flight the old V-tail Bonanza would yaw around the vertical axis in turbulence to an objectionable degree in my opinion . Very uncomfortable , especially to passengers in the back seat . It would have been great to have had a yaw damper .
Your question : What is the logic behind the delay of the signal and how is the echo signal later bound with the signal sent ? Short answer A PESA is an array of individual antennas . Each antenna radiates the same signal , except the phase . The phase adjustment for each antenna allows for the non-moving array to behave like if it could be rotated , i.e. the direction the energy is sent to or receive from can be selected by adjusting the phase for the individual antennas . Varying the signal phase for an individual antenna of the array can be done by delaying the signal for this antenna , which in turn is as easy as making the electrical conductor ( or waves guide ) between the oscillator and the antenna longer . PESA <URL> exactly like another more traditional one with a single rotating antenna . A signal sent by a PESA , after it has been sent , is indistinguishable from a signal sent by a rotating antenna radar . Details The principle of a primary radar is to send a radio signal in a given direction and wait for a possible echo . The direction of the radiation pattern is used in determining the direction ( azimuth and elevation ) of the reflecting object . The antenna must be very directional ( small solid angle of the radiation pattern ) , else the angle determination can not be precise . <URL> Radiation pattern of an antenna with a parabolic reflector ( <URL> ) That means the antenna must be rotated to scan a useful portion of the sky ( or ground ) . To clarify the wording used , an antenna is usually composed of : A radiator which receives the signal to be transmitted ( it also collects the waves in reception ) . The radiator is the interface between electrons and waves and vice-versa . A reflector used to reflect the waves from the radiator ( it also focuses the waves on the radiator in reception ) . Sometimes directors to narrow the radiation pattern of the system . The radiation pattern of an antenna is mostly determined by the shape of the reflector ( e.g. the <URL> ) which only illuminates a given fraction of the space and , due to interferences , also varies the energy based on the direction the energy is sent to or received from . Due to the reflector , a signal from the radiator will usually travels using different paths created by the multiple reflections . Interferences are the result of combining the electromagnetic signals at a given point . For signals having the same frequency , the phase determines if signals are added ( same phase ) or canceled ( opposite phases ) . <URL> Phase determines how signals interfere ( <URL> ) We can apply this phenomenon to the multiple signals created in an antenna composed of a radiator and a cylindrical reflector . <URL> Signals summation on a cylindrical reflector antenna creates a privileged direction of radiation with some secondary ( unwanted ) lobes ( <URL> ) Array of radiators ( electronically scanned array , ESA ) Another way of varying the privileged direction of a radiation pattern is to create interferences on a voluntary basis , so that they create a stronger signal in the desired direction , and a weaker signal elsewhere . The advantage is that this electronic direction change can be much quicker than a mechanical rotation . One way to create interferences is to send the radar signal from an array of small radiators instead of a single big one . <URL> Close-up of the front of the old Cobra Judy radar ( <URL> ) This type of array is quite familiar under the name interferometer in the field of astrophysics : <URL> Siberian Solar Radio Telescope ( SSRT ) interferometer observing the Sun at 5.7 GHz ( <URL> ) If all radiators are fed with the same signal , then interferences will occur the same way on the whole surface and the result will be that the direction perpendicular to the array is privileged ( image on the left side ) . <URL> Electronic beam-deflection ( left : bore sight , right : deflected ( <URL> ) The right side of the image shows what happens if the signal sent to the individual radiators is delayed in a coordinated way : Delay increases from right to left on the array . It must be remembered that delay means phase here . The direction of the signal is now oblique due to the the location of constructive and destructive interferences . The red circles indicates signal with the same phase . See this <URL> too . Delaying an electric signal is quite easy : Just increase the length of the conductor ( see <URL> ) . A length variation between 0 and the wave length ( e.g. 10 cm for a wavelength of 10 cm -- 3 GHz ) allows to sweep the whole range of possible phase values from 0 to 360 ° . Indeed there are other ways to delay a signal without adjusting the length , but they are electrically equivalent . When signals are digitized , it 's really easy to process them , there is less electro-mechanical constraints . By varying the phase on individual radiators we can steer the signal as if the antenna had been rotated , but we can also focus the energy on a target . <URL> ( <URL> ) PESA vs AESA There are two approach
Aerodynamically , you want the aspect ratio to be as high as it can be ( for a given wing area ) . You want infinite wingspan , because that results in no induced drag . But that is not very practical at airports , and a bit heavy . Structurally , you want short stubby wings because they have a very low bending moment . In fact structurally , you want zero wing span . But that is not very practical at take-off time . As always , aerodynamic desirability implies structural objections , and vice versa . The aerodynamicists need to strike a deal with the structures engineers : a balance needs to be found . As long a wing span as possible , with as thick a profile as possible , using a material that is as light as possible . So a long wingspan is desirable and is only limited by structural constraints : as you say , at a certain point the longer wing span 's increased weight will offset any aerodynamic advantages . In aluminium , the optimum was reached over the course of a few decades . But now there is a new material with a better strength/weight ratio : composite carbon fibre . Carbon is much stronger than aluminium , and it is woven in a matrix of resin , with most wires running in the direction of highest stress . With carbon fibre , even the direction of material strength can be optimised . And the B787 and A350 have even higher aspect ratios than the B777 .
Brake temperature sensors are quite common on airliners . Turnaround times of large aircraft are often impacted by the required cooling time . This is because during take-off the brakes must be cool enough to absorb the heat of a possible rejected take-off .

What are the merits of an inlet cone/spike/centerbody vs. a 2D inlet ?
Both are ways to create compression shocks in order to <URL> . Spike intakes The central spike is characterized by : undisturbed flow , light weight and compactness , and easy adjustability to speed and mass flow at high flight speeds by translating the spike . Its disadvantages are : large loss of efficiency with angle of attack and sideslip , long internal ducting , limited space for radar installation , and limited mass flow at low speed . Typical central spike intakes are those of the MiG-21 or the SR-71 , as shown below . Note the variation in cone angle which helps to create additional , steeper shocks such that the flow is gradually decelerated over a sequence of shocks . The inside is filled with a radar system or hollow in case of the SR-71 . At the height of the intake lip the SR-71 spike has a perforated wall to suck away the spike 's boundary layer , and aft of that it contains the translation mechanism which shifts it back and forth to adjust the intake cross section and to adjust the shock position . A variant of the central spike is a side intake with a compression half-cone , as used on the <URL> , the <URL> or the <URL> . Their location at the fuselage side helps to reduce the length of internal ducting and to reduce flow distortion due to sideslip . It also frees up space at the fuselage tip for a larger radar antenna . However , now the fuselage boundary layer has to be split off by a splitter plate to ensure equal flow energy over the whole intake cross section . The picture below shows the <URL> with its central spike intake feeding two Rolls-Royce Avon engines , and the side intake of the TSR-2 . Note the additional intake doors aft of the intake lip of the TSR-2 which were needed to increase mass flow at low speed . The <URL> has a quarter-circle spike intake . Here , the wing root also helps to direct the flow , so angle-of-attack variations produce less intake flow distortion . To suck away the intake boundary layer , the spike is perforated at the lengthwise position of the intake lips . Ramp intakes What you call 2D-intakes are normally rectangular with an oblique shape . The forward edge is used to create an oblique shock which can be positioned to hit the rearward edge on the opposite side by shifting one or both edges up and down . This also changes the cross section of the intake , so adjustments for mass flow can be made over a wide range . An adjustable ramp aft of the forward edge allows to create more shocks with decreasing obliqueness , such that the flow is decelerated by a sequence of shocks . Typical ramp intakes are those of the <URL> , the <URL> or the <URL> . Their advantages are : Adaptability over a wide range of flow conditions , angles of attack and mass flows , and tailoring of the shock system for optimum efficiency over a wide range of supersonic speeds . Their disadvantage is a consequence of the wide adaptability : High weight and complexity . Note that the pressure in the intake is a multiple of outside pressure at supersonic speed , so the intake is actually a pressurized duct . A rectangular intake will need massive structural reinforcements to stay in shape while the cross section transitions to a round shape downstream . The drawing below shows the intake of the F-14 at different flow conditions . Note that the sharp intake lips require them to be exactly aligned with the local flow direction to avoid flow separation . While a central spike intake is the best choice for flying at the design speed , the rectangular intake works better over a wide range of speeds . The shift in air combat doctrine from flying as fast as possible ( 1950s ) to flying mostly subsonic with brief supersonic dashes ( since the 1970s ) is reflected in the choice of intake type . Hypersonic intakes When flying at Mach 5 and above , the obliqueness of the shock waves will need a very long intake , and effective designs use the lower side of the forward fuselage as part of the intake to create the necessary sequence of shocks for pressure recovery . Now the fuselage nose becomes the forward lip of the intake , and the body is shaped to create ever steeper shocks . Alternatively , the lower forward fuselage is shaped to work like a section of a spike . What looks like the actual intake is actually the rear intake lip , and the divergent section of the intake aft of the rear lip is reduced since the flow in the combustion area is still supersonic in order to keep temperatures manageable , making the engine a scramjet . <URL> has more information on supersonic combustion . Note that this type of intake is optimized for one speed , and very little adjustment is possible . The pictures below show a NASA CFD study of the X-43A ( left , <URL> ) and the Russian Ajax project ( right , <URL> ) . A scramjet can use both types of intake , and the fuselage design will determine which type it will be . The rear fuselage now becomes the nozzle of the engine , because most of the expansion will happen after the flow leaves the enclosed par
From this PPRune forum <URL> , the Boeing 777 does use ultrasonic sensors ( some 20 per tank ) This airplane has some 20 sensors per tank . Each of these is effectively a " radio doppler " and works on the same principle . The sensor calculates the height of fluid by measuring the difference in the speed of the sonic signal sent out thru one sensor to another , as against the ACTUAL local speed of sound ( which is a preset value ) thru standard temp air.This difference is then converted very accurately into height in the tank in mm.Which translates into quantity of fuel AT THAT sensor given the actual specific gravity of fuel at that point . - King on a Wing
The main benefit of biplanes is that the lift can be distributed across both wings . This provides more lift with less wingspan and places less load on each wing . Less load means the materials can have lower strength . This was very important in the early days of aviation , when engine power , materials , and weight were much more limited . The major downside of a biplane is aerodynamics . The wings interfere with each other , causing drag . While structural bracing between the wings can reduce weight , it also adds more drag . <URL> A biplane configuration does not make much sense for delta wings . The main drawback of a biplane is drag , but drag increases with the square of velocity , and delta wings are best in high-speed flight . <URL> , they have higher viscous drag due to the large surface area . A second delta wing will add more area , increasing both wave drag ( from the cross section ) and viscous drag ( from the surface ) . Configuration of the aircraft also becomes problematic . Most aircraft with delta wings tend to be fairly flat , allowing lower area and therefore lower drag . The closer the wings are , the more they will interfere . The further apart they are , the more structure is needed , either in a larger fuselage or in structural braces , which increases weight and drag .
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau did a report titled : <URL> This report specifically covers this and found that the accident rate was three times higher in kit built - vs - similar factory build aircraft : What did this report do The ATSB investigated the safety history of amateur-built aircraft in Australia through analysis of accident data held in the ATSB 's occurrence database from 1988 to 2010 . Comparisons were made between accidents involving amateur-built aircraft and those involving similar factory-built aircraft to help identify whether the rate and types of accidents differed between these two groups of aircraft . What the ATSB found Amateur-built aircraft had an accident rate three times higher than comparable factory-built certified aircraft conducting similar flight operations between 1988 and 2010 . The fatal and serious injury accident rate was over five times higher in amateur-built aircraft , in particular due to relatively more serious injury accidents . The pilots of amateur-built aircraft involved in accidents were significantly more experienced overall than factory-built aircraft accident pilots . However , they were significantly less experienced on the aircraft type that they were flying at the time of the accident . Over half of the accidents were precipitated by mechanical events , which were mainly complete or partial engine failures . Following the amateur-built phase one test period , mechanical failures were still significantly more common when compared with factory-built aircraft . A quarter of accidents were from loss of aircraft control . Structural failures were not common precursors in amateur-built aircraft . Collision with terrain and forced landing accidents were more frequent in amateur-built aircraft . Collisions with terrain , hard landings , and runway excursions were more likely to result in a serious injury from an amateur-built aircraft accident than for factory-built accidents . On the other hand , the EAA says that homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate of less than 1 % higher than the general aviation fleet in their <URL> , but this did n't compare homebuilt to factory built in similar models : How Safe Are Amateur-Built/Homebuilt Aircraft ? Studies by FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) show that Amateur-Built/Homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate less than one percentage point higher than the general aviation fleet . In fact , the accident rate for Amateur-Built/homebuilt aircraft is dropping . The total number of registered homebuilt aircraft is increasing by about 1,000 per year , while the total number of accidents has stayed virtually the same . Another good barometer of safety is insurance rates . Companies that insure both homebuilts and production aircraft charge about the same rates for owners of either type of airplane . That indicates a similar level of risk .
A supercritical airfoil has these characteristics : Large leading edge radius Comparably flat upper surface Rounded lower surface with a maximum thickness location at around 50 % Flat or even negative camber in the forward section High positive camber in the rear section ( rear loading ) The large leading edge radius allows it to create more lift than comparable airfoils at high angle of attack . After <URL> re-invented <URL> ( they had first be developed by K. A. Kawalki in Germany in 1940 , and British airfoil research resulted in similar shapes , first used in the <URL> ) , he transferred some of their characteristics to a GA airfoil , the <URL> . From the <URL> : The unusual airfoil unexpectedly aided general aviation as well ; its rather blunt leading edge allowed it to generate high lift coefficients before stalling , and Whitcomb published a low-speed airfoil which he called GA ( W ) -1 ; it is now routinely used in light aircraft and gliders . As usual , Wikipedia is mostly correct , but the use of the GA ( W ) -1 on gliders is everything but routine . This gives an indication of their drawbacks : The low forward camber limits the range of the laminar bucket to lower lift coefficients . A <URL> tries to maintain the laminar bucket almost up to stall . A positive camber throughout will produce higher maximum lift coefficients than what a supercritical airfoil is capable of . That is why the GA ( W ) -1 uses only the blunt nose and the rear loading , but not the camber distribution of supercritical airfoils . The high rear loading gives them a large , negative pitch coefficient which translates into a larger travel of the center of pressure over angle of attack , requiring a larger horizontal tail . In airliners this does not matter because their large flaps dictate the size of the tail .
The theoretical bare minimum would be a light gun to give light signals to aircraft . A more generally acceptable minimum is a two-way radio to do radio communications with aircraft . From there up other systems can be added . The list below gives some examples but is not exhaustive . A telephone . Always useful when you want to get in contact with other parties on the ground ( e.g. air traffic control centre ) or other parties with you . Meteorological instruments can provide current wind and visibility at the runway to the tower controller . This is not directly to support the Air Traffic Control function , but to provide information services to pilots . Airport lighting control : runway ( and taxiway ) lights are usually controllable from the tower . These systems can become quite complex on larger airports A display with a feed from an approach radar . This present the air traffic situation around the airport to the controller . Whilst on larger airports the approach controllers are usually not located in the tower itself , smaller airports often combine tower &amp; approach control . Even when approach controllers are physically located elsewhere , the approach radar assists tower controllers as well in building a clear mental picture of the situation . An emergency button that makes the fire department jump to life . Surface radar display . This presents the ground traffic situation to the controller . Often not found on small airports , but essential for efficient operations at busy airports , especially in low visibility . More radio 's . To split tower control who do the runways and ground control who do the taxiing aircraft . Further divisions can be made . A system that shows which runways are active , which are closed for use by the airport authority ( e.g. for maintenance ) Electronic flight strip system . The traditional paper strips are now often replaced by a digital equivalent . These E-strip system usually communicate with the whole flight data processing system , correlating strips to radar tracks . Gate allocation system . It 's always nice to now where those arriving aircraft should be directed once they are of the runway . Gate video systems showing the situation at the gate . ( to bust pilots that say they are ready for engine start / pushback whilst they are still loading cargo :-) ) Departure management system . When you have a complex airport with multiple runways and a maze of taxiways , a DMAN may help to get aircraft airborne at the right time in the right sequence in the right direction . Arrival management system . With many aircraft arriving from all directions , headed for different terminal / gates it helps to have an AMAN to avoid overloading your Terminal Manoeuvring Area with incoming flights competing to be first . Integration of the Surface radar , DMAN and Gate Allocation System with the lights control system . The level of integration varies . In the most extreme case pilots just have to follow the taxiways that light up green and stop at red stop bars . This avoids a lot of radio communications and confused pilots who did n't exactly remember a taxi clearing involving a dozen of taxiway letters .
There are actually quite a few reasons to fly an instrument approach , especially one with vertical guidance ( like an ILS ) , even if the weather does n't require it : It serves as a backup to the visual approach . There are various visual illusions that can cause a pilot to fly an approach too high or too low and monitoring the vertical guidance can help to mitigate those . It helps to ensure that you land on the correct runway , and even at the correct airport . ( Unlike <URL> . ) ATC uses it when pilots do not have the airport or runway in sight . This happens quite frequently at large airports where they have to line many aircraft up on final . The last guy is a long distance from the airport so may not be able to see it but can fly the approach . It can be useful if it is hazy or the sun is making it hard for the pilots to find the airport . Some parallel runways are approved for simultaneous approaches ( as is the case at Narita for runways 34L &amp; 34R ) so ATC will clear two airplanes for the respective ILS 's . This keeps them tracking the centerline of the approach instead of maneuvering visually where they might drift over into the way of the other airplane . Flying the approach on the autopilot leaves more time for the pilot to focus on other things and possibly catch something that might have been missed while hand flying a visual approach . Sometimes instrument approaches are used for noise abatement reasons . If I had to guess about the particular approach that you mention , I would say that it is probably company SOP ( Standard Operating Procedures ) to fly the ILS whenever possible for the safety benefits , and that Narita allows simultaneous parallel landings to the two runways so ATC would require it as well .
A Fixed Base Operator ( FBO ) is an entity - usually a commercial company - which provides " aviation services " at an airport . One of the main services they provide is fueling , either full service or a self service pump . They do n't all provide both 100LL and JetA , but most do . Larger ones provide other services , such as catering , lavatory service , pre-flight briefing computers and wifi access , ground power units , and tie down or hangar space for parking . Charges vary from place to place , most large FBOs will charge a fee for aircraft parking , but sometimes waive a day or so of that if you purchase fuel . They can often assist in arranging ground transport or hotels as well . Most are open hours like 7AM - 8PM , but that varies as well . Most self-service pumps can be used 24 hours a day . Some have a " crew car " available to borrow for a short trip to get lunch or run an errand , though calling ahead to check on that is important .
A Pelican tail is a V-tail with the two tail surfaces set apart . Compare this to a straight V-tail as that of the <URL> : <URL> Tail view of the F-117 ( picture <URL> ) The closest to a Pelican tail which has actually been flown is maybe that of the <URL> : <URL> Tail view of the YF-23 ( picture <URL> ) Clearly , the distance between the two surfaces is dictated by the engines , but Northrop could have placed them on top of the nacelles . However , doing so would had been a poor choice for several reasons . A Pelican tail has those advantages : If the vertical part is too close to the wing strake or fuselage chines , the strake vortex could hit the tail surfaces and cause oscillatory loads . <URL> so they would not break off . A Pelican tail should easily avoid this . A pure V-tail has <URL> , because the pitch-induced angle of attack change is reduced and the reaction force , too , by the V angle . Placing a horizontal strip in the middle improves pitch damping . Wikipedia has conflicting information on weight savings , but generally V - and Pelican tails should be more efficient than a conventional tail . However , for the best maneuverability a conventional tail is preferable . Again , placing a horizontal part between the two V surfaces improves pitch maneuverability , even when the control surfaces are only on the V part . Their symmetric deflection will induce a considerable lift change on the horizontal part . Placing the vertical tail outside and aft of the engine exhaust will shield the lateral IR radiation better . The drawbacks are : Higher structural complexity compared to a true V-tail . Lower maneuverability and yaw damping than a conventional tail . EDIT : I knew I had seen a Pelican tail before , but could not remember where . Now I found it : <URL> This ist the German <URL> helicopter ( picture <URL> ) , and yes , this is a Pelican tail ; however without control surfaces . It had two intermeshing rotors which made a tail rotor unnecessary . Anton Flettner had built the similar <URL> in 1940 and introduced the 282 in 1942 .
Generally aircraft windows are made of what we colloquially call " plexiglass " of some kind ( Lexan polycarbonate is common in light General Aviation aircraft , acrylic plastics are also used ) . This material is light , relatively strong ( not shatter-proof , but it 'll take a moderate beating ) and has decent optical properties . Its major drawback is " crazing " -- hairline cracks on the surface of the material that form over time from dirt , stress , temperature , UV exposure , and the like . Bonus answer : The little hole serves a couple of purposes , but the biggie is pressure relief/equalization . <URL> and they 've covered it pretty thoroughly . Basically the hole ensures that the cabin pressure is pushing against the outer ( primary , usually thicker ) sheet of plexiglass , which is plug-wedged into the fuselage structure and ca n't go anywhere . Should the outer pane be damaged the hole will also theoretically bleed cabin pressure off at a controlled rate - though how successful that equalization is would depend on your altitude ( and thus the pressure differential between the cabin and the outside air ) and the degree of damage to the outer pane .
Vortex ring state is characterized by rapid descent and reduced effectiveness of control inputs . At the onset , it is characterized by increased vibration and buffet of the airframe , with uncommanded changes in helicopter attitude . Also , any increase in the collective is ineffective and counterproductive . From <URL> : Incipient vortex ring conditions are typically : increased vibration and buffet , the onset of small amplitude ' twitches ' in pitch and evidence of longitudinal , lateral and directional instability . Established vortex ring conditions are characterised by : a very rapid increase in rate of descent towards and beyond 3000fpm , reduced effectiveness of cyclic inputs in roll or pitch the application of collective pitch failing to arrest the rate of descent and usually increasing it . From FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook - <URL> : A fully developed vortex ring state is characterized by an unstable condition in which the helicopter experiences uncommanded pitch and roll oscillations , has little or no collective authority , and achieves a descent rate that may approach 6,000 feet per minute ( fpm ) if allowed to develop . The best measure against vortex ring state is quite simple - go forward i.e. increase airspeed . Basically , you enter into forward flight so that the rate of descent does n't oppose the induced flow . You need ' undisturbed ' airflow over the rotor disc . Power is to be applied after gaining sufficient airspeed . From skybrary : Incipient Stage ... Keep the collective position unchanged and apply forward cyclic to achieve an accelerative ( nose down ) attitude so as to increase forward airspeed quickly . As soon as a steady increase in airspeed is indicated , and above 30 KIAS , more power can be applied if necessary without waiting until the best rate of climb speed is reached . If this action does not resolve the situation rapidly then it is best to treat the condition as established and take the actions below . Established Condition . Recovery can only be effected by changing the airflow around the rotor and will inevitably lead to significant loss of height , which makes recovery from a low level occurrence impossible . There are two theoretically possible actions : Moving the cyclic forward and lowering the collective . Combining these actions is likely to produce the quickest recovery with the least height loss . Application of forward cyclic should increase airspeed but a large input held for several seconds may be required before significant pitch attitude and consequent speed change is achieved , with a significant nose down attitude resulting . Lowering the collective to reduce power towards auto-rotation , so unstalling some of the inboard portion of the blades , may also be effective but forward airspeed must be gained before power is re-applied during recovery . Autorotation has also been suggested as a measure for overcoming the vortex ring state ( by the FAA handbook , for example ) , but it may lead to further loss of height , which has to be taken into account . Another issue is that there are some variations between the different helicopter types - in case of tilt-rotor aircraft like V-22 , the only way is to go into forward flight .
The pulse jet engine works because it uses the dynamic pressure of air for compression . Consequently , it needs speed to work well . If the pulse jet is on the ground , it is not easy to start - it needs to be fed with compressed air , and once it runs ( it can run even when not moving because the oscillating pressure wave inside the tube will compress the inflowing air ) , it develops litte thrust . Thrust will go up with airspeed , so you need additional thrust sources for initial acceleration and take-off . In case of the V-1 , this was done by a steam catapult or by air-launching the device . Note that the V-1 was accelerated to 370 km/h on a 45 m long catapult which means more than 100 m/s ² ( 10g ) average acceleration . Most of the development work went into making the airframe withstand this acceleration . A modern design would need additional engines as well , and once those are included , the rationale for pulse jets becomes very weak . They make sense if you have an air-launched , disposable application , such as long-range air-to-air missiles . This is a niche in which their higher-speed cousins , the ramjets , <URL> . Pros : Very easy to build , very light . Runs and produces some thrust when at rest ( as opposed to ramjets ) . Cons : Thrust grows with flight speed . This can be seen as a pro , but normally requires additional means of acceleration . Therefore listed as contra here . Low fuel efficiency . The fuel energy is converted to other forms of energy : Just listen to the videos of <URL> to get an idea . High levels of vibration due to the intermittent operation . When the <URL> was tried out with <URL> , the aircraft experienced unacceptable vibration . Need heat-resistant materials . The central part will get very hot in operation , so at least nickel-chrome stainless steel is needed if air cooling is insufficient . Can not go supersonic . For this , there are <URL> . EDIT : NACA tested the As 014 pulse jet and wrote a <URL> , from which the performance data depicted below is taken : It seems that <URL> has improved the pulse jet design a lot : He needs no compressed air for starting and makes clever use of surrounding cold air to increase mass flow and keep material temperatures down .
In order to state the plane is airworthy you must be able to show that all AD 's have been complied with and that the aircraft is within annual ( or 100 hour ) inspection ; these proofs are typically found in the logbook so no , without the logbook your aircraft is probably not airworthy . It may be possible to fly the plane legally in the US anyway if you receive authorization from your FSDO ( which , I believe , would be a " ferry permit " ) . It 's not legally required that your logbook be complete to the beginning of time , just that it shows the current requirements are met ( along with the signatures/cert numbers of the AI 's that are stating them to be met ) . However , an incomplete logbook is very important from a resale point of view . Not having complete logs will make a plane very difficult to sell and will certainly affect the price most purchasers would be willing to pay .
There are a few classes of Non-rev travel . Jumpseating Online pass travel Interline pass travel Jumpseating This is open to pilots and flight attendants , air-traffic controllers ( not sure if this is currently true , but it used to be ) , certain company and government officials ( e.g. the FAA and others ) . In general pilots can only occupy pilot jumpseats and flight attendants can only occupy flight attendant jumpseats . I know of cases where pilots can sit in the FA jumpseats but this is largely a topic of the Pilots and FA Union contracts . In general pilots can jumpseat on any other 121 carrier and some 135 carriers . Note that jumpseating does not necessarily mean you 'll be in the cockpit , as current regulations stipulate you should not sit in the cockpit unless there are not seats in the cabin available . If you list for a jumpseat you will generally be the lowest priority for a cabin seat , boarding after all other non-rev travelers and then in a specified priority order jumpseaters will fill up the cabin and then the cockpit jumpseats until space is exhausted . Jumpseating is the most versatile of the options , but the most limited in who can use it . It is good to keep in mind your jumpseat agreements probably allow jumpseating on cargo 121 carriers in addition to passenger 121 carriers , so keep Fedex , UPS , Atlas , etc in mind when travelling . Your spouse/kids wo n't be able to join you though . Online Pass Travel The specifics of this travel depends on your airline , but I will speak in general terms . Pass travel is usually available to the employee , the employeers domestic partner or spouse , the employees minor children and the employees parents . There is usually also a program for a limited number of passes for friends ( buddy passes ) . Pass travel is usually limited to your airline those you have a business relationship with . For example a regional carrier can usually pass travel on the legacy carrier they contract with . A legacy carrier can usually pass travel on its regional contracts . If a regional contracts with multiple legacies , you sometimes only pass travel on the legacy system of the legacy you perform flights for . It can be complicated . There is always a defined priority for pass travel . In general employees ride before spouses/parents/children who ride before buddy passes ( except when travelling together , you may all share the priority of the highest priority pass on the itinerary ) . When multiple companies are involved , the priority levels may reflect a higher priority for the company operating the flight employees than the legacy/regional contract carriers . Again , this will vary greatly from company to company and you will learn the specific rules that apply to you when you are hired somewhere . Interline travel These passes are known as ID75 , ID90 , etc where the number is the percent discount from a full fare ticket . You can generally buy passes for yourself , your spouse/domestic partner and your children . No buddy passes . To get an ID90 , you visit your travel office and request an interline ticket for a specific city pair . For example you can buy an ID90 for Rome - NYC . You get an old school paper ticket for that route and no specific airline . When you want to use the ID90 , you present it to the ticketing agents for the airline you want to ride that flies the route you want to fly . They will in turn issue you a non-revue standby boarding pass . These are generally lower priority than online pass travel when it comes time to board . These tickets are fully refundable , so they are often purchased as backups to get home when travelling in case you can not get back with online passes . How it all works If you are the employee , you have a company ID and use this to get through security . If you are the spouse/partner/child / buddy , then you will print out a standby boarding pass and use that to get through security . You can check bags , which will get tagged standby and should board if you do . It can be good to remind the gate you have bags checked when you get a seat . If you are flying on your own carrier or under your legacy brand , you generally have computer access to the passenger boarding totals . These can often be hard numbers of people booked , checked in and standbys listed . You can use this to gauge the likelihood of getting on a plane . If you are travelling offline then a carrier might have a phone number available but they may only tell you " it looks good ! " or " it looks bad " and will not divulge numbers . Once you are at the gate , you play the waiting game . You will have a boarding priority which may look something like this for a legacy carrier flight : Legacy pilots Legacy flight attendants Legacy retired pilots/FA The legacies regional contract pilots / FA Legacy spouse/parents/domestic partner/kids The regional contract spouse/parents/domestic partner/kids Codeshare pass agreements Buddy passes Interline passes Cabin jumpseats Cockpit jumpseats
Generally , a compressor can not work efficiently at supersonic speed due to the shockwaves , the role of the <URL> and diffuser is to slow the air below Mach 1 . There is a similar need for a ramjet , so that the combustion can occur within the engine and produce thrust . The cone position and diffuser geometry are adjusted according to the airspeed . The overall shape of the diffuser is diverging . From <URL> , the diffuser decreases velocity and increases pressure according to : $ \ frac 1 \ rho \ ; dp = - \ mathrm V \ ;d \ mathrm V$ where $ \ rho $ is air density . Look at this video : <URL> for more details about how pressure and velocity are affected in a nozzle / a diffuser . Here is a summary : <URL> The J58 is turbojet within a ramjet . The forward section of the engine has a complex role . It adapts to a large range of speed ( 0 to Mach 3.2 ) and altitude ( 0 to 85,000 ft ) , and modifies the airflow to work either as turbojet , or as a ramjet , depending on the airspeed . <URL> Simplified adjustment of the airflow ( <URL> ) . Actual mechanism used at different airspeed ranges in the J58 : <URL> ( <URL> )
Both a POH and an AFM meet the " Operating Limitations " requirement in the <URL> acronym . The difference between the two is mainly in length and content : an AFM is usually a thinner document , satisfying the requirements of <URL> and not much else , while a POH contains these required items plus other information like system diagrams ( The contents &amp; format of a POH are standardized in <URL> ) . Parts of the POH ( like the Limitations section ) are FAA-Approved , and serve as the AFM , and both documents are typically associated with a specific airframe ( by serial number ) . A better explanation might be this : The is a regulatory document ( it 's contents are prescribed under the section of the regulations the aircraft was certificated under - Part 23 , Part 25 , etc ) . The is a GAMA-defined document whose contents meet the regulatory requirements of an AFM , and present other information in a standardized way so that a pilot can go from a Cessna to a Piper to a Mooney to a Socata and browse the book to learn about the airplane they 're about to fly with all the information presented the same way no matter who the manufacturer is . The other two types of documents you may encounter are an " Owner 's Manual " ( which usually goes along with a thinner AFM &amp; provides some of the information found in the newer-style POH ) and a Pilot Information Manual ( PIM ) which is a " generic " version of the POH which many pilots buy so they can study the procedures without removing the regulatory document from the aircraft . <URL> talks a little about the differences between the two documents ( and a whole lot of other flight documents ) .
Molding of the intricate shape requires expensive carbon fiber For it to dampen the noise it 's best with 5 + blades ( see 3 . ) Which is hard to balance and too much weight for your run-of-the-mill 4-seater single engine plane By the time the benefits were realized , enter the jet engine for the big planes that would have benefited from it . You only see it in few turboprops nowadays . Edit : For more on the correlation between no . of blades and noise : it was mainly discovered from tests . Here 's a long <URL> with tons of info , and a snippet from it follows ( T denotes Test , summary : more blades , less noise ) : <URL>
Please use the equations of <URL> . The numbers might be different , but the physics are the same . EDIT : Thanks to D_S for providing the link to the manual . When flown with the maximum allowable load factor of 1.5 g at 80.000 ft ( 48 ° bank ) , the turn radius at Mach 3.2 ( equivalent to v = 953.3 m/s in 80.000 ft ) will be 83.5 km . To be more precise , you will need to add the effects of earth rotation , but for now I leave this away . As you can see , the turn will still need 163 km or 103.7 miles , but not the <URL> which is more than 6 times bigger . To turn this around : A circle at Mach 3.2 which has a diameter of 1092 km requires a bank angle of 9.6 ° . That can hardly be called a turn .
I 've heard it said that the break-even point for owning vs renting is 200 hours/year . I fly a lot less than that , but I do n't like sharing my toys , so I own anyway . I make it a point to not actually count my cost of ownership , because it would n't be fun any more , but I 'll give you some rough numbers . I bought a 1962 Mooney for \ $ 30,000 . That 's about as cheap as it gets , and this was reflected in the condition of the plane and the high-time engine . In the first year had it , I spent \ $ 18,000 on an engine rebuild , new prop , new carb , new magnetos , new oil pump , and all the other firewall-forward upgrades that were required when I got the new engine . Five years later , I spent \ $ 14,000 on new paint . It still needs a new interior , but that can wait . I spent about \ $ 3000 at West Texas Aero installing speed upgrades . Budget \ $ 10/hour for your next engine rebuild . Annual inspection typically runs \ $ 3000 to \ $ 6000 depending on what they find wrong . I 'm getting a tank resealed this year , so it 's going to be an expensive one . Parking runs typically \ $ 50 - \ $ 100/month , depending on where you are . Insurance for my old crate runs \ $ 750/year . Expect to pay more for a nicer plane or if you have less experience . Note : get a commercial license ; it will pay for itself in reduced insurance in the long run . I think gas will typically run \ $ 5-6 / gallon , depending on a lot of factors . My Mooney burns around 9.5 gph , and flies 142 kts so it 's really economical in that respect ( and the main reason I do n't upgrade ) . Light twins are cheap to buy , but that 's because their cost of ownership is through the roof . A low-time pilot can expect to pay \ $ 12,000 / year for insurance and the annual inspection will also be a back-breaker . I used to have money . Now I have an airplane .
Fluid Types <URL> contains a good summary of the different types of fluid : Types Type I fluids have a low viscosity , and are considered " unthickened " . They provide only short term protection because they quickly flow off surfaces after use . They are typically sprayed on hot ( 130 -- 180 ° F , 55-80 ° C ) at high pressure to remove snow , ice , and frost . Usually they are dyed orange to aid in identification and application . Type II fluids are pseudoplastic , which means they contain a polymeric thickening agent to prevent their immediate flow off aircraft surfaces . Typically the fluid film will remain in place until the aircraft attains 100 knots or so ( almost 200 km/h ) , at which point the viscosity breaks down due to shear stress . The high speeds required for viscosity breakdown means that this type of fluid is useful only for larger aircraft . The use of type II fluids is diminishing in favour of type IV . Type II fluids are generally light yellow in color . Type III fluids can be thought of as a compromise between type I and type II fluids . They are intended for use on slower aircraft , with a rotation speed of less than 100 knots . Type III fluids are generally light yellow in color . Type IV fluids meet the same AMS standards as type II fluids , but they provide a longer holdover time . They are typically dyed green to aid in the application of a consistent layer of fluid . Chemical Composition The main component of deicing fluid is usually propylene glycol or ethylene glycol . Other ingredients vary depending on the manufacturer , but the exact composition of a particular brand of fluid is generally held as confidential proprietary information . Call ahead to the airport to see what kind of deice/anti-ice fluid that they have because each one is different . Time Limits Every year , the FAA publishes tables which include information about how long the various deice fluids will provide protection under various weather conditions . Here is an example table : For this particular fluid ( ABAX ECOWING AD-49 Type IV ) we can lookup a specific example such as : -10 Degrees Celcius 75 % fluid and 25 % water Light Snow This shows that the fluid will provide protection for 1:40 to 2:05 . If you are delayed longer than that , you will need to deice again . Since every part of the aircraft needs to be protected , the timing starts when they first start spraying the aircraft . Note that other types of fluid ( particularly Type I fluids ) have much shorter holdover times than this , so be careful and make sure that you check ! Resources <URL> <URL>

Does a jet engine keep running when it can no longer be controlled from the cockpit ?
General rule here : the engine will remain at its last power setting should the FADECs lose comms with the flight deck controls ( in your A380 case ) or the thrust lever cables come unhooked ( in the case of an older aircraft with mechanical cable-and-pulley controls ) . However , the fire handle will kill the engine even if the main controls fail -- it operates the firewall fuel and hydraulic shutoff valves . In QF32 , this did n't happen because the cable for the # 1 engine fire handle itself was damaged by shrapnel entering the wing .
My questions are : Is it really normal to see reports without viz ? Yes ! Well , maybe not " normal " , but it does happen . Automated weather stations are like another piece of equipment and components fail from time to time , including the components which measure the visibility . The other components also fail from time to time ( I 've see ASOS/AWOS reports without temperature , barometric pressure , etc. ) Why does this happen so often for AWOS when ATIS does n't have problems with it ? You should n't see this at all with ATIS , because a human is involved , and if the equipment which measures visibility is inoperative , a trained observer ( often the same person that is manually recording the ATIS ) can look out the window and record the visibility themselves . Should this be reported to some entity ( NOAA/FAA ) to get these systems repaired or exchanged ? I would let the airport manager know just in case they were n't aware . They are responsible for notifying the FAA . The fact that it is missing visibility information does not mean that visibility is unobstructed , right ? I have heard people assume this . If the visibility is missing , it means just that . It is missing . It might be 1/4 SM or it might be 20 SM . Some people may make assumptions that if there is no precipitation , that the temperature / dew point spread is high , etc. that the visibility is good , but that is a potentially dangerous assumption because visibility can be influenced by many different things . There could even be a dust storm coming through when everything else looks good ! If the recording says " VISIBILITY MISSING " , is it indicated in the metar somewhere ? Sort of . It 's just " missing " ( i.e. the entire wind block from the METAR will not be there ) , so if you do n't see it then , well , it 's missing .
A windmill is a turbine , so it 's better to build an optimized turbine . I 've studied your idea and this draft design has come out : <URL> The apparatus has these innovating characteristics : Configurable for 2 , 3 and 4 engine aircraft Can be positioned exactly for optimal efficiency Adjustable up or sideways for local constraints Bird/snake anti-roasting protection ( removable ) Simple and robust 50 or 60 Hz AC selection by adjusting engine thrust Optional gas water extractor For increased operation time , the apparatus can move with the airplane until a certain speed ( configurable ) is achieved ( cable not included ) .
Absolutely . The jet engines used in airliners are quite powerful and can easily <URL> . Other ( large ) airliners , not so much . It depends on the aircraft 's size , weight and distance from the engine actually . There are records of a <URL> ; as the thrust of an A380 engine is quite higher than that of the Lancer , the damage would be worse . The minimum safe distance between the aircraft varies depending on the aircraft and engine type . For example , according to the Australian <URL> : An aircraft engine shall not be started or operated : ... ( b ) within 8 metres ( 25 ft ) of other aircraft ; ... turbine engines , in addition , shall not be operated within the appropriate distance specified below of any other aircraft , fuelling equipment or exposed public areas which lie to the rear of and within a 15 degree arc either side of the exhaust outlet axis of that engine : <URL> Minimum distance between aircraft for operation of engines ; image from <URL>
The landing gear system is operated by the pilots . The extension and retraction , depend on the action from the pilot monitoring , on 2 pilots operation . The pilot has a lever on their panel , on which they select the extension ( down ) and/or retraction ( up ) . Some aircraft has a system to avoid extending them on high speed , to avoid some damage , and on the ground , avoiding retracting , for obvious reasons . There are lights , green and red , indicating their position . <URL>
The first figure , 1 litre per mile , is very wrong . The second , 39 to start , is most probably the fuel required for a warm up from a cold start . The Abrams tank weighs <URL> tonnes , so you wo n't get 1 mile on a litre . Its fuel consumption is quoted as <URL> , or 1.66 gallons per mile , which is 6.3 litres per mile . Quite a difference . The engine is the Honeywell ( previously Lycoming ) <URL> . It has a two spool gas generator , with a two stage power turbine . It features a heat exchanger through which the HPC exit air flows , to preheat it from the exhaust gas , prior to combustion , to improve engine efficiency . The engine has a <URL> that keeps it running at <URL> so that it can rapidly accelerate from a stationary position if needed to avoid or engage a hostile force . In tactical idle it consumes 30 + gallons per hour , instead of 10 at the non tactical idle setting . It 's <URL> that " in 1990 , Project on Government Oversight in a report criticized the M1 's high costs and low fuel efficiency in comparison with other tanks of similar power and effectiveness such as the Leopard 2 . The report was based on data from U.S. Army sources and the Congressional record . " Some critics say the tank fuel consumption is so poor , that in combat , it has to often wait for the fuel supply logistics to catch up . Other reports <URL> ( See paragraph at the very top of the page ) . The M1 Abrams was <URL> after a competition in June 1973 , between the Chrysler Corporation and the Detroit Diesel Allison Division of the General Motors Corporation to build prototypes of a new tank designated M1 , and later named the Abrams tank . In November 1976 , it was announced Chrysler won the competition . The M1 was faster and more maneuverable than its predecessors in the M60 series , while offering a lower , smaller silhouette . Besides the substantial gains in performance , the Textron Lycoming AGT-1500 turbine engine was far more reliable than the diesel tank engines then in use with the Army . There was still another benefit . The engine change , despite a penalty in fuel consumption , also resulted in much quieter operation , so much so that soldiers encountering the tank in early maneuvers started calling it " Whispering Death " . The Abrams <URL> also states a figure of 6.3 liters per mile , and also states the value of 38 liters to start . As suggested by user3528438 ( thank you ) , the 39 litres ( 10 US gallons ) is quite probably the fuel required to complete a warm up from a cold start . At the tactical idle setting , this would be the fuel consumed in about 15 to 20 minutes .
No , not at all - there are at least two Delta Wing aircraft that feature a conventional tail , and they are the Gloster Javelin and the Mig 21 <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> ( Courtesy of <URL> ) In addition ( and I believe this is within the spirit of what you 've asked ) you then you have aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon or Saab 37 Viggen which feature canards : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> Ultimately , " Delta " only describes the wing shape - though there of course features of the shape that will lead to many designs appearing similar . The Wikipedia article has a nice infographic showing the general variations of Delta Winged designs : <URL> <URL>
The guns of modern fighter jets are fixed to the airframe -- they ca n't be moved in any direction ; the pilot has to maneuver the aircraft to bring the guns to bear . The image shows the mounting of General Electric M61A1 Vulcan cannon in an F-16 . <URL> Gun installation in F-16 ; image from <URL> The pilot aims the guns using an optical representation in the Heads-Up Display ( HUD ) . Some of the aircraft use the <URL> where : ... a prediction angle is continually computed and displayed on the Heads Up Display ( HUD ) as a reticle offset from a fixed reference on the gunsight . ... ( which ) accounts for ballistic curvature , own motion , and predicted target motion . Basically , it shows where the shells will pass through at a certain distance . Some aircraft use <URL> . It basically shows a pair of lines which the cannon shells will follow - the lines moves as the aircraft maneuvers , showing the effect of the maneuver on the flight path ( of the shell ) .

You keep it clean : adding flaps adds drag . You can see this in Section 3 of the Cessna POH , which includes a Maximum Glide ( distance ) diagram . In the C172S POH that I checked , it notes that maximum distance is achieved with : SPEED 68 KIAS PROPELLER WINDMILLING FLAPS UP ZERO WIND ( A tailwind would extend your range , but only in one direction . ) Two other points worth noting : If the engine failure also caused an electrical failure then you wo n't be able to use the flaps anyway ( in models with electrically operated flaps ) You might want to reduce your gliding distance if the best landing spot is relatively close by , and extending flaps is one way to do that ( along with slipping , S-turns or other maneuvers , and extending the gear )
Generally the planes are scrapped by a <URL> . The parts will either be removed and sold as spares , or chopped up and recycled or disposed of . So a lot will depend on how easy it is to remove the part , and how much of a market there is for it . Airplanes are disassembled to a large extent during heavy checks , which can provide an opportunity for substituting in spares . Engines : Probably the most valuable part of the airplane . These will be removed and either used as whole spares or for spare parts , depending on the condition and how many of the type are still in service . Cockpit instruments : These will be removed and used as spares as well , if there is enough of a market ( everyone wants those <URL> these days ) . Interiors : These may be removed as well , they can be used as spares . Control surfaces : These can be removed and used as spares as well . Windows : These can be removed and reused . Systems : Pumps , electronics , lights , actuators , etc. : Most of these can be removed and sold as spares . Landing gear : This can also be removed and reused , depending on the number of cycles it already has . Tires : The tires may be reused if not worn out . The <URL> may not be reused . Airframe : Although some parts may be able to be used , generally the effort and the fact that there are probably many cycles on the part will prevent much from being used as-is . The metal will be chopped up as scrap . They are already working on recycling major <URL> as well , since manufacturing scrap is already being created . <URL> , with modern recycling processes , the metal , plastic , wires/electronics , and carbon fiber composites are used for : 15 % High-grade industrial 50 % Low-grade industrial 35 % Landfill As it often is with business charts , it 's not clear if these are by weight , volume , or what . <URL> claims to recycle 90 % of the weight of an aircraft . There are of course cases like <URL> where the plane is donated to some institution , but this does n't happen to most planes . There are also ways that airplane parts find <URL> .
The crash was only one of the ( albeit an important ) reason for the grounding of Concorde . Actually , the aircraft was retired around three years after the crash . The main reason was that not enough people were flying it to keep it profitable . The Concorde as a technological marvel , but it had a number of disadvantages : The aircraft was costly - The program cost over $ 3B and produced 20 aircraft , of which 14 were used in commercial service . Maintenance costs - The small number of aircraft and technological sophistication meant that the cost of spares was high and options limited . Operating costs - The Concorde consumed nearly three times per passenger fuel when compared to the Boeing 747-100 . Still , the aircraft made operational profit due to the high cost of tickets . Recession - After 9/11 attacks exacerbated the global downturn in aviation due to recession , there was an enormous drop in first class air travel , on which Concorde was dependent on . While announcing the retirement , British Airways cited commercial reasons , with passenger revenue falling steadily against a backdrop of rising maintenance costs for the aircraft .
Can a commercial airplane fly outside the safety area ? Yes , there is nothing physically stopping the plane from doing so . Is it allowed to do so ? No , precisely for the event should an engine fail then it will have enough range to get to the airport and make a safe landing . Extending the allowable range of twin engine aircraft is what <URL> is about . By default commercial airplanes with 2 engines must remain within 60 minutes flying time of an airport in case of engine failure . This was decided at a time where engines were unreliable . However as engine reliability increased airplanes could have that range increased with an ETOPS certificate .
The first aircraft jet engine was ground tested by Frank Whittle in April 1937 . In September of the same year , Hans von Ohain ( ground ) tested his jet engine . The first jet aircraft , He 178 flew in August 1939 .
General rule here : the engine will remain at its last power setting should the FADECs lose comms with the flight deck controls ( in your A380 case ) or the thrust lever cables come unhooked ( in the case of an older aircraft with mechanical cable-and-pulley controls ) . However , the fire handle will kill the engine even if the main controls fail -- it operates the firewall fuel and hydraulic shutoff valves . In QF32 , this did n't happen because the cable for the # 1 engine fire handle itself was damaged by shrapnel entering the wing .
<URL> results from soot in the combustion gasses , so the carbon part of the hydrocarbon fuel was incompletely burned . The <URL> ( sorry , paywalled , but you can read the first page ) reports that in the first decades of jet engine design much combustor development was trial and error . Specifically , to arrive at a smokeless combustor , the <URL> team had to perform 465 modifications and 140 full engine tests . Mainly , these tricks help : Slow flow speeds by careful diffusor design at the compressor exit Swirling of the flow at the combustor entry to improve fuel-air mixing Measured inflow of air into the combustor , such that the fuel injection area has an essentially stoichiometric mixture for best flame stability . Then more air is added in a secondary and a third dilution region . This dilution helps to lower the gas temperature so the gas stream is palatable to the turbine . Longer combustors , so that 99 % combustion can be achieved at the end of the secondary region . Selecting the right fuel helps , too . If you would burn methanol or ethanol , a smokeless combustor is easier to achieve , but the <URL> of the fuel suffers . Lighter fuels with shorter hydrocarbon chains help , but are more expensive to produce and reduce energy density , so kerosene was preferred even if its combustion produces soot .
Refueling an airliner with APU running is a perfectly normal procedure and it is done daily all around the world . The APU is located at the tail cone partially to reduce the risk of fire spreading to the fuel tanks , which are normally in the wings and center fuselage . Some operators and authorities ( not all ) restrict starting and/or stopping the APU while fueling .
Navigation has gotten much simpler over the years . Initially , navigation would be done by a combination of dead reckoning , looking out the window for landmarks , and for night or long-distance flights , by celestial navigation ( many old airplanes have a window at the navigator 's station specifically to let the navigator see the stars ) . This took quite a bit of time and effort , so the pilot could n't do it and also fly the airplane . In the 1920s , radio navigation was added to the navigator 's toolkit , but finding bearings to beacons and calculating a location was still an entirely manual process . Additionally , radio beacons did n't cover the entire world , so older navigation techniques were still needed for most flights . In the 1950s , fully-automatic radio direction finding systems became common and navigation beacons were available across most of Europe and North America . At this point , the workload involved in navigation dropped to the point that the pilot could also navigate : plot out the sequence of NDBs to follow ahead of time , then tune the radio and follow the navigation display . Very recently , navigation has been integrated with the autopilot to the point that the pilot can punch in a sequence of waypoints and have the airplane fly the route entirely on its own . And yes , even today if the electronic navigation system fails , the fallback is map , compass , and slide rule .
The aircraft weight needs to be 70 kg or less . FlyNano mentioned this on their <URL> ( my paraphrasing ) : Do I need a pilot 's license to operate FlyNano ? According to the <URL> ... FlyNano is below the necessary weight of 70kg ... In Finland for example no classification , no aviation license or medical certification are needed . But skill is needed . Nevertheless a good understanding of water plane operation , rules and aviation safety is requested . ... I found that <URL> . But regardless , and emphasized by FlyNano also , pilot skills are required .
Flow conditions are not so different , only the reaction of the flow to an obstacle is . By <URL> , supersonic flow is handled easily , and <URL> in decelerating and compressing the flow . However , supersonic flow demands sharp intake lips which are hit by the flow at the right angle , otherwise drag rises quickly to intolerable levels . These sharp lips will cause flow separation in subsonic flow when hit by the flow at an angle , so aerodynamic tricks like <URL> need to be added to the intake to keep flow angles at the intake lips in check . Note that the intake will ensure a <URL> at the compressor face of the engine , regardless of flight speed . Therefore , the engine will not need to be optimized for supersonic flight . However , to keep its frontal area low and the <URL> , its <URL> should be low . The only troubles this causes are increased engine fuel consumption and <URL> .
I find it hard to make a general answer since the fuel systems could be different between various aircraft , but , according to Jan Roskam 's Aircraft Design series ( I just had to return the book , but I think it 's Part IV in the series ) some model of the F/A -18 utilizes the following system which , in sustained inverted flight ( or any sustained flight condition wherein the aircraft does not experience a positive load factor ) , would eventually starve the engine of fuel . Keep in mind too that fuel is n't the only factor for sustaining this flight condition : oil flow through the engine is typically gravity fed ( reference for that is an engineer from Bell Helicopter who worked on the V-22 powerplant ) . Suction is used to scavenge the oil out of the engine/gearboxes/etc , but the flow of the oil up to a point where suction will pull it out is via gravity ( or whatever acceleration the aircraft is experiencing ) . Hence , not only do we need to provide fuel , but we also need to provide for proper oil flow as well . Anyhow , the F/A -18 fuel system . Again , I wish I had the image from the text to show you , but the basic idea is this : if you had a flop tube capable of scavenging from the entire fuel tank , it would engender more problems than it solved . Hence , inside of the primary fuel tank there 's a second , smaller tank . This tank has a series of poppet valves that allow fuel to flow into the inset tank during coordinated ( i.e. , positive load factor ) flight . When the aircraft is not experiencing a positive load factor , the pressure of the fuel on these valves holds them closed and the fuel stays within the inset tank . A short flop tube within this space provides fuel to the engines for the duration of the maneuver . However , as noted , this inset tank is only a portion of the larger main tank , so its capacity would be some fraction of the main tank , limiting the duration of the maneuver . So , to answer your question ( how does fuel starvation happen and why is n't it solved via a pump ) it 's a design problem that , per the printing of that text , could not be solved by adding capacity to the pump . There just simply was n't fuel present at the fuel sump to be scavenged . The real design problem would lie in the design of flop tubes capable of scavenging from the entire tank without creating more design problems ( an assumed point on my part ) . Examples , I think , would crop up if you decided to make a multiplicity of flop tubes ( larger pumps required , more parts , more complex plumbing , etc. ) , or longer flop tubes ( potential risk for damage to the tube head/tank with increased " flopping " inertia , larger pump required for greater head losses , etc. ) ... but I also do n't know what the current standard is .

What is the minimum turning radius of an SR-71 ?
Please use the equations of <URL> . The numbers might be different , but the physics are the same . EDIT : Thanks to D_S for providing the link to the manual . When flown with the maximum allowable load factor of 1.5 g at 80.000 ft ( 48 ° bank ) , the turn radius at Mach 3.2 ( equivalent to v = 953.3 m/s in 80.000 ft ) will be 83.5 km . To be more precise , you will need to add the effects of earth rotation , but for now I leave this away . As you can see , the turn will still need 163 km or 103.7 miles , but not the <URL> which is more than 6 times bigger . To turn this around : A circle at Mach 3.2 which has a diameter of 1092 km requires a bank angle of 9.6 ° . That can hardly be called a turn .
For any <URL> , the event must have a probability of 50 % at least ( that is more than playing playing heads or tails ) . Related US <URL> for AIRMET Z : AIRMETs are issued every 6 hours , where there is a 50 % probability that any of the following en-route weather phenomena will cover an area of 3000 square miles or greater .

Freezing Level information is included after AIRMETs for moderate icing or statements indicating that no significant icing is expected . Freezing level is defined as : The lowest freezing level above the ground or at the SFC as appropriate . Freezing levels are delineated using high altitude VOR locations describing the location of the lowest freezing level above the ground or SFC as appropriate . Freezing levels above the ground are delineated at 4000 feet intervals above mean sea level ( AMSL ) . Multiple freezing levels above the ground are delineated using " BOUNDED BY " followed by high altitude VOR locations . The range of freezing levels across the forecast area is also included .

Good question . 14 CFR Part 139 requires FAA to issue airport operating certificates to airports that : Serve scheduled and unscheduled <URL> with more than 30 seats ; Serve scheduled air carrier operations in aircraft with more than 9 seats but less than 31 seats . Also : VFR charts depict airport 's hard and soft surface runways . Enroute charts depict airports having hard surface runways of at least 3000-foot in length . If your airport meets those criteria , you may contact the local Federal Aviation Administration , Airports District Office or Aeronautical Information Management , AJV-21 , at 1 - (866) 295-8236 to have your airport charted . That means for a private airstrip , it 's your call as the owner to have it placed on a chart . Pretty cool . More : <URL>
Increasing horizontal stabilizer area increases pitch stability and the permissible range for centre of gravity at the cost of some aerodynamic efficiency . Stability in pitch means that the aircraft tends to maintain constant angle of attack ( which roughly corresponds to maintaining constant speed with pitch ) . An aircraft is stable in pitch if the aft surface flies at lower angle of attack than the front surface ( this applies to both conventional tails and canards ) . Making the horizontal stabilizer larger does the following : The absolute change in lift force on the horizontal stabilizer when angle of attack changes is larger , so the aircraft returns to the trimmed angle of attack faster ( increased stability ) . As centre of gravity moves aft , the difference in angle of attack between the surfaces decreases to keep the plane balanced , reducing pitch stability . If the horizontal stabilizer is larger , the angle of attack changes more slowly for the same change in lift , so the centre of gravity may be permitted further aft before the aircraft becomes not stable enough . As centre of gravity moves forward , the difference of angle of attack between the surfaces increases until angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer exceeds its stall angle of attack and control is lost . If the horizontal stabilizer is larger , it can provide more ( downward ! ) lift before it stalls , so the centre of gravity can be permitted further forward before loosing control authority .
The answer can be found in Annex 16 of the ICAO , a copy including the noise limits can be found <URL> . Below a little excerpt from the annex : ( a ) For acoustical changes to Stage 1 airplanes , regardless of the number of engines , the noise levels prescribed under § 36.7 ( c ) of this part . What are the ' Chapter 2 ' and ' Chapter 3 ' aircraft noise classifications ? Certificated noise levels for larger aircraft are classified by the ICAO ' Standards and Recommended Practices -- Aircraft Noise : Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation ' into a ) Chapter 2 types , characterised by the noisier , low bypass turbofan aircraft and early high bypass turbofan aircraft , and b ) Chapter 3 types , characterised by the modern , quieter , high bypass turbofan aircraft . Under European legislation , since 2002 , ' Chapter 2 ' aircraft ( of over 34 tonnes maximum take-off weight or with more than 19 seats ) have no longer been allowed to operate at European airports . There are separate noise certification schemes for small propeller aircraft and for helicopters . ( b ) For any Stage 2 airplane regardless of the number of engines : ( 1 ) Flyover : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 5 EPNdB ; the limit is 93 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral and approach : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2 EPNdB ; the limit is 102 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( c ) For any Stage 3 airplane : ( 1 ) Flyover . ( i ) For airplanes with more than 3 engines : 106 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 44,673 pounds or less ; ( ii ) For airplanes with 3 engines : 104 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 63,177 pounds or less ; and ( iii ) For airplanes with fewer than 3 engines : 101 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 106,250 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral , regardless of the number of engines : 103 EPNdB for maximum weight of 882,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 882,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2.56 EPNdB ; the limit is 94 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less . ( 3 ) Approach , regardless of the number of engines : 105 EPNdB for maximum weight of 617,300 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 617,300 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2.33 EPNdB ; the limit is 98 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less . ( d ) For any Stage 4 airplane , the flyover , lateral , and approach maximum noise levels are prescribed in Chapter 4 , Paragraph 4.4 , Maximum Noise Levels , and Chapter 3 , Paragraph 3.4 , Maximum Noise Levels , of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) Annex 16 , Environmental Protection , Volume I , Aircraft Noise , Third Edition , July 1993 , Amendment 7 , effective March 21 , 2002 .

There are no height or weight requirements as far as I know and you dont need perfect vision . I wear glasses and have a " corrective lens " note on my medical . I think that at minimum your vision needs to be correctable to 20/20 . See <URL> for some information as well as the <URL> . You can also get special dispensation for certain medical conditions . On a small side note , if you are asking this in relation to a Private Pilot License , they may be doing away with the current third class medical regulations which will ease the regulations greatly .
Yes , it 's true . Usually called approach or arrival briefing Details will vary according to aircraft and operator but a typical list is NATS : NOTAMs1 ATIS2 notes , chart briefing point by point , date , frequencies , courses , minimums and missed approach procedures . Terrain , minimum safety altitude , which route Special notes for arrival , taxiing , likely gate for arrival ? I noticed that you specifically asked about something going wrong . The following assumes a serviceable aircraft . According to operator , if the aircraft is not on a stabilised approach by 1,000 feet , a go around will be performed and the missed approach procedure ( MAP ) followed . The MAP is printed on the approach chart . The initial action is : to get the aircraft safely climbing away ( aviate ) to the altitude and heading defined in the MAP ( navigate ) then call ATC to let them know ( communicate ) . Aviate , navigate , communicate , always in that order . A stabilised approach might differ between operators but is essentially . The flight path is correct with only minor changes in pitch and heading needed to stay on it . No more than 20 kts above the approach reference speed briefed as above . Correctly configured for landing ( flaps , slats , gear , spoilers armed , autobrake set etc ) Checklists completed Rate of descent < = 1,000 fpm Power setting is appropriate There may be other special checks for some types of approaches which must have been briefed as above ) . The MAP might be something like : The MAP is unique for each approach so must be briefed in advance . 1 <URL> : Warn of recent changes , temporary restrictions , equipment malfunctions etc. . 2 <URL> : A continuous broadcast of airfield information such as weather , special precautions , runways in use etc. .
For the FAA ( all my answers can be looked up , and expanded upon in FAA Order <URL> mainly , but I 'll try to keep it short ) , most departures from the same runway use distance for separation . The standard is the lead aircraft is clear of the runway , but most of the time can be shorter under most circumstances . The only times it becomes time based , if it 's wake turbulence related , or various conditions of non-radar separation needing to be applied . In general for runways , aircraft are broken into 3 categories for separation ( excluding weight class , which add wake turbulence time if necessary ) . Category I aircraft are light single engine propeller driven aircraft weighing less than 12,500 lbs ( and helicopters ) . Category II aircraft are light twin engine propeller driven aircraft weighing less than 12,500 lbs . Category III is everything else . I 'll mainly discuss same runway departures , since there 's many considerations and it gets complex , and the FAA Order 7110.65 does a fairly good job of depicting and showing this separation standard . For the same runway when both aircraft aircraft departing are category I , the min distance between them is 3,000 feet and airborne . This means that the first aircraft has to be 3,000 feet down the runway and airborne , before the next aircraft starts it 's takeoff roll . If the trailing aircraft is a Category II and the first aircraft is a Category I or II , the distance increases to a separation of 4,500 feet between aircraft . If either aircraft is a Category III aircraft , it 's 6,000 feet and airborne required . Now if both aircraft are IFR , there needs to be IFR separation insured after the runway separation . In most environments the minimum radar separation is 3 nautical miles between aircraft . Now , between jets , the runway separation of 6,000 feet and airborne , will often be right at 3nm between aircraft ( due to the speed differential mainly ) . Other options include turning one aircraft off the path of the other by at least 15 degrees and have them diverge apart . Wake turbulence is one of the few areas that time is applied . If a heavy ( 300,000 lbs or greater ) is departing in front of anything else , the next aircraft ca n't start their departure roll for 2 minutes when both are departing from the same intersection on the runway , and 3 minutes if departing the runway from different intersections . And a Super ( A380/AN225 ) I believe are 3 minutes , when departing the same intersection , but I 've never worked them in the tower . There are a few other times when time is used , intersections , opposite direction . For arrivals , all except non-radar separation is distance based .
Briefly , " overhaul " is n't a strictly defined term but it 's generally used to refer to the intensive inspection , maintenance and repair of an aircraft component , frequently - but not exclusively - the engines . The word overhaul by itself is a general term that 's used in all sorts of places but it 's not defined in <URL> , for example . The most specific definition I could find is in <URL> between the FAA and EASA : " Overhaul " means a process that ensures the aeronautical article is in complete conformity with the applicable service tolerances specified in the type certificate holder 's , or equipment manufacturer 's instructions for continued airworthiness , or in the data which is approved or accepted by the Authority . No person may describe an article as being overhauled unless it has been at least disassembled , cleaned , inspected , repaired as necessary , reassembled and tested in accordance with the above-specified data . Note that that definition only mentions " aeronautical articles " , which is very broad indeed and not limited to just engines , airframes or anything else . In the general aviation world , a very common usage of " overhaul " is in the context of piston engines , which have a <URL> ( TBO or TBOH ) set by the manufacturer . Once an engine reaches that number of hours , it needs to be overhauled . But even there , the term is n't precise and the FAA has a circular called Reciprocating Engine Overhaul Terminology and Standards that explains what it usually means : c. Overhaul . In the general aviation industry , the term engine overhaul has two identifications that make a distinction between the degrees of work on an engine : ( 1 ) Major Overhaul . A major overhaul consists of the complete disassembly of an engine . The overhaul facility inspects the engine , repairs it as necessary , reassembles , tests , and approves it for return to service within the fits and limits specified by the manufacturer 's overhaul data . This could be to new fits and limits or serviceable limits . The engine owner should clearly understand what fits and limits should be used when the engine is presented for overhaul . The owner should also be aware of any replaced parts , regardless of condition , as a result of a manufacturer 's overhaul data , SB , or an Airworthiness Directive ( AD ) . ( 2 ) Top Overhaul . Top overhaul consists of repair to parts outside of the crankcase , and can be accomplished without completely disassembling the entire engine . It can include the removal of cylinders , inspection and repair to cylinders , inspection and repair to cylinder walls , pistons , valve-operation mechanisms , valve guides , valve seats , and the replacement of piston and piston rings . All manufacturers do not recommend a top overhaul . Some manufacturers indicate that a powerplant requiring work to this extent should receive a complete overhaul . Apart from that usage , the term <URL> seems to be <URL> in the airline industry to describe maintenance facilities , but there is n't any specific definition that I could find . So there 's no single definition of " overhaul " . It just means that you 've very thoroughly inspected and tested something on an aircraft , whether it 's an engine or a wheel , and you 've verified that it 's fit to be used in flight , i.e. it 's airworthy . The reasons why it 's important are probably obvious ; they 're the same reasons that your car needs regular servicing to run safely , efficiently and reliably .
You are right , the horizontal tail of a conventional airplane appears to have a higher incidence , but the actual angle of attack is smaller than that of the wing . The wing , flying ahead of the tail , produces downwash , so the flow at the tail location has a distinct downward component . The downwash angle can be calculated from the lift coefficient and the geometry of the aircraft : To simplify things , let 's assume the wing is just acting on the air with the density $ \ rho $ flowing with the speed $ v $ through a circle with a diameter equal to the span $ b $ of the wing . If we just look at this stream tube , the mass flow is $ $ \ frac { dm } { dt } = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v $ $ Lift $ L$ is then the impulse change which is caused by the wing and equal to weight . With the downward air speed $ v_z $ imparted by the wing , lift is : $ $ L = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v \ cdot v_z = S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho $ $ $ S$ is the wing area and $ c_L $ the overall lift coefficient . If we now solve for the vertical air speed , we get $ $ v_z = \ frac { S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho } { \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v } = \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L \ cdot v } { \ pi \ cdot AR } $ $ with $ AR = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { S } $ the aspect ratio of the wing . Now we can divide the vertical speed by the air speed to calculate the angle by which the air has been deflected by the wing . Let 's call it $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { v_z } { v } \ right ) = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ A typical airliner cruise lift coefficient is 0.4 , and a typical aspect ratio is around 8 : This results in a downwash angle of nearly 2 ° if the lift distribution over span is elliptical . In reality , it is more triangular-shaped , so the downwash angle is larger near the center of the aircraft . Note that the engine nacelles of the <URL> are tilted 3 ° up to align them with the local flow . The resulting angle of attack is lower by those 3 ° , and if the angle of attack difference between wing and tail is less than that , the tail surface will appear angled upward . To achieve static stability , the tail will have to fly at a slightly <URL> .
I heard of a A320 landing , no lights , both generators out , RAT deployed ... , made a successful landing . Is this possible ? Yes A United Airlines Airbus A320-200 , registration N409UA performing flight UA-497 from New Orleans , LA to San Francisco , CA ( USA ) with 109 people on board , was in the initial climb when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit , levelled off at 5000 feet and returned to New Orleans . The crew reported before joining downwind that they had lost all instruments and requested to be talked down by ATC via Precision Approach Radar ( PAR ) . The crew descended to 600 feet where they got visual contact with the water of Lake Pontchartrain and continued visually for a landing on runway 19 about 10 minutes after departure . During landing the aircraft blew both right hand main gear tyres , went left off the runway , stopped with all gear just off the paved surface north of the intersection with runway 10/28 , and was evacuated via slides . A number of passengers needed medical attention due to smoke inhalation . Post landing photos showed the RAM Air Turbine ( RAT ) deployed . Runway 01/19 was closed for about 10 hours . The crew told passengers that they had lost all electronics and were flying on minimal backup systems , landing would occur overweight with minimal braking and minimal steering ability . From <URL> Early on , NTSB investigators suspected a faulty fire-warning sensor in the cargo hold . And they tentatively concluded that the cockpit crew had skipped a portion of the pre-flight checklist then failed to restore power to some equipment , making it more difficult to carry out the emergency landing From <URL> Basically it seems there was nothing wrong with the aircraft apart from a faulty smoke sensor . The crew missed this in their preflight checks , noticed it after take-off and then turned off all the electric generators ( they were supposed to turn one back on according to the checklist - they did n't ) . Anyway , they landed the plane OK on emergency power from batteries and RAT . with only 28VDC ( battery power ) * On the A320 the RAT supplies the ESS bus , not main buses 1 and 2 . It powers both the AC ESS bus and the DC ESS bus through the ESS TR ( transformer rectifier ) . So that 's not just 28V DC but AC too . In the interval after both main generators failing and APU being unavailable , I believe the DC batteries power the DC ESS bus until the RAT is deployed and providing power ( which should happen automatically and quickly ) . So in this short interval there is only DC power on the DC ESS bus .
Simple answer ... No . You could rule out the types of planes that could land at an airport by an <URL> but there is nothing specific .
If you assume the main gear does not rotate ( in the left-right sense ) , then the pivot point will always be somewhere on a line joining the two main gears . You can then use trigonometry and the turn angle of the nose wheel to identify the centre of rotation . ( Assume the nose tyre does not slip sideways . ) ( By the way this is very similar to Ackermann steering used on cars - lots of standard mechanical texts talk about this . )
Why did they stop building it ? Because they built 32 , and that was as many as was needed at the time . 32 spy planes was plenty for the USAF/CIA to use , so building more would have been a waste . By the time those airframes may have needed to be replaced after 30 years or so , the SR-71 had been withdrawn from service and there was no need to build any more . I think the question you 're really trying to ask , though , is : Why was it withdrawn from service ? And why was n't it replaced when it was withdrawn ? The answer to those questions is a bit more complex , but essentially comes down to " Because it was n't really needed any more . " The SR-71 was designed and built in the 50 's and 60 's . That means it was designed shortly before the first space flight , and built shortly afterward . When designed , there was a huge need for a fast , " impossible to shoot down " reconnaissance aircraft . The SR-71 suited that - it could dodge missiles just by outrunning them , and by the time any adversary scrambled a fighter and got to the SR-71 's altitude , the SR-71 would be a couple of hundred miles away and possibly even over a different country . So what happened ? Satellites happened . Why maintain a fleet of very high maintenance planes and keep them on high alert , then fly them over your rival 's airspace ? That 's expensive , time consuming , difficult , risky , and ( quite understandably ) tends to upset your rival . It was , in short , an expensive way to annoy Russia and China . Okay sure , it got some reconnaissance too , and did its job ( as an aircraft ) beautifully , but when times are tense the last thing you need is to antagonise each other . As an aircraft , then , it was a huge success ... but as a geopolitical pawn , and as a military asset ? It 's a little more questionable . It certainly performed a vital role , but it had negative downsides from doing that . Fast forward a few years , and we developed reconnaissance satellites with a whole bunch of advantages With a few of them in the right orbit , you can have a satellite over an interesting part of the world pretty much 24/7 . Even without that many , you can pass over an area pretty regularly . Less obvious . Okay , your rival does not like you launching them - but once in space they 're just " there " , there 's no antagonising " Oh look , an SR-71 flying over us " They 're " fire and forget " for the most part . Once in space , you just use it : you do n't need to keep a bunch of pilots and aircraft on the ground ready to fly It 's less obvious what you 're looking at , and when ... if an SR-71 flies over the base that contains your new secret weapon , you 're gon na notice . But when a satellite flies over for the 18th time today ? Not so much No planning and preparation time ( which , for an SR-71 , was a huge undertaking ) . You just start taking pictures , or wait for a satellite to get to the right place , then start taking pictures . They have disadvantages , too For 24/7 coverage , you need quite a lot of them , and they are n't cheap You have to replace them occasionally ( and/or boost them into higher orbits ) If you upgrade your camera , it 's a lot harder to replace the one on a satellite than an SR-71 But overall , a satellite is a more reliable , less antagonistic way to spy on your rivals . They 're not perfect , but you know you 've got permanent spying capability with no need to plan your reconnaissance ahead of time . In short : It was n't needed anymore .
Yes , the required obstacle clearance is based on this minimum performance : Cross the departure end of the runway ( DER ) at at least 35ft AGL ( that 's above the DER , not above the airport reference elevation ) Climb to 400ft above the DER before turning Maintain a climb of at least 200ft per nautical mile ( FPNM ) until reaching minimum IFR altitude The minimum IFR altitude is 1000ft above obstacles , or 2000ft in mountainous areas . This is explained in detail in <URL> ( starting on page 1-14 ) . The FAA carries out an assessment to see if the airport needs a specific procedure ( ODP or SID ) and if it does n't then the standard clearance performance above applies : If an aircraft may turn in any direction from a runway within the limits of the assessment area and remain clear of obstacles that runway passes what is called a diverse departure assessment , and no ODP is published .
Two things : <URL> . This can be alleviated by carefully touching down , but you never know what exactly will happen in the next landing , so better do n't count on it to be smooth Deceleration distance : The higher mass requires a higher approach and touch down speed ( higher by the square root of the mass ratio between your actual mass and the maximum certified landing mass ) . Now you have more mass and more speed , but the landing strip and the airliner 's brakes are still the same . The risk is that you overshoot the runway with an airplane full of fuel or that you overheat the brakes ( which will result in their failure , and again an overshoot ) . Since the kinetic energy is proportional to mass times speed squared , the energy which needs to be absorbed by the brake goes up with the square of the mass increase . If the selected runway for your overweight landing is long enough and the weather is calm ( so a smooth landing is easier ) , an overweight landing is not such a problem . Now let 's look at the 777-300ER in detail . I use the figures from <URL> , because the <URL> is trying much harder to hide the relevant data . The MTOW ( maximum take-off weight , which is actually a mass ) is 351,534 kg , and the maximum landing weight is 251,290 kg , about 100 tons less . Now let 's assume that <URL> and returning to the airfield uses 5 tons of fuel , so the mass ratio is 1.379 . Therefore , the approach speed has to be 17.4 % higher and the total kinetic energy at touchdown is higher by a factor of 1.9 compared to the case at maximum allowable landing weight . If we now assume that speed is reduced linearly during the landing run and that the wheel brakes will just absorb as much energy over time as in the case at maximum landing weight , the deceleration needs to be lower by the mass ratio , so the aircraft decelerates with only 72.5 % of the deceleration at maximum landing weight . To shed its kinetic energy , the landing run will take longer by the increase in kinetic energy , i.e. 1.9 . Since the average speed is also higher by 17.4 % , the landing distance will be higher by a factor of 2.233 or 223 % of the landing distance at maximum landing weight . This neglects that the heating of the brakes is an instationary process , so you can not simply brake with the same intensity for more than twice the time they were designed for . But this little estimation should illuminate what impact a higher landing mass has on the energy and distance involved .
Redundancy , particularly during <URL> operations . How it works depends on the specific airplane type . In the most advanced systems with triple ( or more ) flight guidance computers ( FGCs ) , a " voting " concept is used during critical operations like autoland . All 3 computers calculate their commands independently , and vote on what to do . The middle value , or sometimes the average of the 2 " most similar " values , is then passed to the flight control actuators . In this way , if any one of the computers fails and starts producing garbage commands , those erroneous commands will not be selected ( they are automatically rejected by the voting scheme ) . A monitoring system can also detect a failed computer in this way and take it offline , allowing " fail-active " functionality -- an autoland can continue on the 2 remaining functional computers . Less complex aircraft , and aircraft without autoland , still sometimes have 2 FGCs , but do not support fail-active operation . In these systems only one of the two computers is active or selected at any given time . A transfer switch in the cockpit allows the pilot to transfer control from one computer to the other if one fails . And it 's not just airliners . Business jets commonly also have dual FGCs , and in recent times even small general aviation airplanes like the Diamond DA-42 have dual systems ( Garmin G1000 in dual-GFC700 configurations ) . <URL> ( click for high res version ) shows a Cessna Citation CJ business jet with dual Garmin autopilots . At the top of the PFD , notice there is a small green arrow pointing left ; this indicates the left FGC is currently selected . The photo also shows the XFR ( transfer ) button on the mode select panel , top center , just underneath the master caution/warning annunciator panel . Pushing this button would switch to the right ( # 2 ) FGC and change the arrow on the PFD to point to the right . These indications are fairly representative of other dual-FGC systems . <URL> of a Hawker 800 with Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 . You can see the same arrow on the PFDs . In this aircraft the transfer switch is labeled " AP XFR " and is again on the autopilot panel just underneath the glareshield at the top of the panel toward the left hand side . And finally <URL> with 3 FGCs and full autoland capability . It 's a bit hard to read in this photo , but just above the autopilot disengage bar ( the " spacebar " looking thing on the right side of the mode select panel just under the glareshield ) the 3 buttons are labeled " A/P ENGAGE " , " L " " C " and " R " for the left , center and right FGCs . During an autoland all 3 would be selected and illuminated .
Because the requirements were different . When U-2 was developed , the requirement was for an aircraft which would fly high at 70,000 ' due to the ( mistaken ) belief that the Soviets would be able to detect and engage aircraft only below that altitudes . Once the U-2 entered service however , it became obvious that they could detect U-2 ( they complained about the overflights , though misidentifying the aircraft ) , and once <URL> , it became obvious that U2 is n't going to be of much help . SR-71 , which came later , was the result of a requirement which expected it to not only fly higher , but more importantly , faster . Interestingly , the Soviets went the same way with the <URL> . The main reason for the retirement of spy aircraft was the advent of reconnaissance satellites , which are immune to being shot down ( not that it is impossible , but no one has done it except in tests ) . Spy aircraft are still operated only over areas where the threat from anti-aircraft systems are extremely limited or non-existent . At the time of its retirement , the USAF accepted that <URL> : In congressional testimony , Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Larry D. Welch identified the increased survivability of reconnaissance satellites , SR-71 vulnerability to the Soviet SAM-5 surface-to-air missile and the cost of maintaining the SR-71 fleet . As for why U2 has outlived the SR-71 , the main reason is the operating costs - the operating costs of SR-71 is quoted to be <URL> , while the U-2 <URL> ( incidentally , U-2s operating cost is less than that of its proposed replacement , the <URL> ) . From the <URL> : The Air Force decision to retire the Blackbirds in 1990 is based on several factors . ... The cost factor is the most significant to the Air Force because it limits expenditures in other areas . Reagan Administration Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge Jr. estimated that the money used to operate the SR-71 fleet could operate and maintain two tactical fighter wings .
The accessory gearbox is generally driven by the N2 shaft ( connecting the high-pressure turbine to the high-pressure compressor ) and in turn drives the engine accessories such as generators , hydraulic pumps , oil pumps , etc. . The air turbine starter is also part of this gearbox so during starting the accessory gearbox drives the high-pressure compressor . This analogous to the serpentine belt on your car , which connects your crankshaft to your cars engine accessories ( alternator , water pump , power steering , air conditioning , etc ) .
In order to state the plane is airworthy you must be able to show that all AD 's have been complied with and that the aircraft is within annual ( or 100 hour ) inspection ; these proofs are typically found in the logbook so no , without the logbook your aircraft is probably not airworthy . It may be possible to fly the plane legally in the US anyway if you receive authorization from your FSDO ( which , I believe , would be a " ferry permit " ) . It 's not legally required that your logbook be complete to the beginning of time , just that it shows the current requirements are met ( along with the signatures/cert numbers of the AI 's that are stating them to be met ) . However , an incomplete logbook is very important from a resale point of view . Not having complete logs will make a plane very difficult to sell and will certainly affect the price most purchasers would be willing to pay .

Why is landing on a carrier not handled by a computer ?
<URL> that are capable of <URL> , and some aircraft can use this system to <URL> . However , <URL> and still has its limits , and other reasons for not always using this system are <URL> . Further reasons for this technology not being more fully developed yet are probably similar to <URL> . A completely automated , unmanned landing on a carrier has been done , <URL> . Although a computerized system is theoretically more capable of performing precise carrier landings , the details are complex . A lot of sensing and control must be worked out . The team behind the X-47B was awarded the <URL> for the advances in aeronautics they achieved . The sensors and processing that the UAV uses to do this are probably not all standard equipment on naval aircraft . Adding them would create extra expense and weight . If the system requires addition to the carrier as well , there is more added expense . And in a combat situation , do you want to rely on systems that could be jammed or failed ? If you are going to land the plane without a pilot , you might as well not have the pilot at all , and this is the route that future unmanned systems are taking , but there is a lot more work to be done before they completely replace human pilots .
The thing about computer models is that they are just that ; models . They can only approximate the actual behavior we see in the real world . Computer models are good for trying many different ideas and making predictions . It can be faster to create a new computational test than to make a physical model for a wind tunnel . But very detailed fluid dynamics calculations require large amounts of computing power , and this takes time and money as well . Wind tunnels can give much more detailed and accurate information , and are useful for validating the results given by the computers . The results do n't always match , which means that the computer models must be revised . This is where wind tunnels are still very useful . They can test an entire airplane in actual flow , where computing that detail across the whole aircraft would require long computations . Although a wind tunnel is also only a model of real conditions , it provides an actual body in actual flow conditions , which means the results can correlate much more closely to the real conditions being tested . Computational analysis is limited by assumptions , the chosen modeling method , and computational power . Until computing power reaches the point where it can run models that will truly match a wind tunnel 's accuracy and detail , there will still be a need to use wind tunnels to provide data .
Its much safer , you do n't kill the carrier aircraft if you drop away and have a major aircraft malfunction . Gravity gives you the separation you need . If you treat the two aircraft like a formation flight , which it essentially is , its dangerous for the critical aircraft to go belly up , ie blind , to the carrier . In an emergency the first step in formation flying is to ensure separation which the critical aircraft ca n't do because it ca n't see if it 's clear to descend and it may not have the ability to laterally sidestep . Thus , a blind push on the nose could kill both aircrews .
The simple fact is that an unintended gear deployment could be catastrophic , as it has a profound impact on the flight dynamics of the aircraft ( one of the reasons there are warnings for both retraction and extension ) . The benefits would be marginal as checking gear down is part of the bread-and-butter procedures for all retractable gear aircraft . Keep in mind adding some automation to an aircraft has far ranging impact , just off the top of my head adding automatic gear mechanism would require : Standardization of the automation Modification of procedures Training of pilots , and then re-certification of pilots Training of maintenance crews , and then re-certification of the crews Possible change to the maintenance schedule of aircraft Certification of the new system by the regulator and you would still need a backup / redundant system ; and now you are back to the manual controls . I can imagine this being implemented in remote piloted or autonomous aircraft though ; as an additional workload relief .
From Anne Graham 's book , <URL> : This charging mechanism uses the ' ability to pay ' principles , since airlines using larger aircraft are in a better position to pay higher charges . Some costs such as runway wear and tear do increase with weight and also larger aircraft require vortex separations , which can reduce the number of aircraft movements during a certain period . Overall , however , there is not a strong relationship between aircraft weight and airfield cost . A flat rate landing charge for all aircraft types may be more appropriate , particularly at congested airports . This is because the cost of occupying the congested runway is movement related and independent of aircraft size . Each aircraft movement will consume the same resource .
Frost can be formed in two ways . On a colder object by water directly desublimating on its surface or on any object when air is saturated with water . Frost can form on a moving airplane , but only the second way . Why would they have anti-ice on pitot tubes , propeller and leading edges otherwise ? When the air is not saturated with water , ice will sublimate . If the air is moving it carries away the sublimated vapour and thus increases the sublimation rate . When flying in visual meteorological conditions , that 's generally the case , so frost wo n't form in VMC , thogh watch out when dew point is close to temperature ; in such case light haze may form that already causes some icing while visibility is still above the VMC limit . Ram and friction heating also help sublimating the ice a bit . However when you fly into a cloud in freezing temperature , the water droplets will freeze on the aircraft when they hit it . They will hit it on forward-facing surfaces : wing and stabilizer leading edges , propellers , engine inlets , pitot tubes and nose and windscreen . That 's why these components have anti-ice , either using heating or deicing boots . VMC-only aircraft will often only have pitot tube heating and carburettor heating , because those can sometimes gather frost in sufficiently moist air that is not yet forming cloud . This lack of anti-ice makes flying into IMC even more dangerous in winter than it already is for all the other reasons . Icing only happens when the cloud contains supercooled water droplets , which occurs in clouds where the ambient air temperature is between freezing point ( 0 ° C/32 ° F ) and around -40 ° C / -40 ° F when the droplets freeze to ice pellets . The exact point the droplets freeze varies somewhat because it depends on other parameters like amount of dust , but pilots can check whether they are accreting any ice by looking in the corners of the windscreen . Whether freezing conditions are to be expected will also be mentioned in the detailed weather forecast .
You start from wrong assumptions , which explains your doubts . The line the induced drag is due to the tip vortices is as true as saying that wet streets cause rain . Also , the opinion that the tip vortices strength will be as same as the bound vortex is wrong . Unfortunately , <URL> themselves and copy what <URL> without thinking the issue through . Ideally , you would forget about all what you have heard about vortices and lifting lines , but since you ask I will try to explain <URL> a little . In potential flow theory , lift is caused by vortices which are caused by the movement of a wing through air . These vortices run along a closed line : Within the wing they form the bound vortex , then they leave the wing backwards as trailing vortices and are connected at the point where the movement started by the <URL> . Now comes the important part which <URL> : There is no single vortex ; instead , potential flow assumes an infinite number of infinitesimally small vortices which form out of nowhere when lift is increased or speed is reduced . Consequently , no single vortex leaves the wing at the tips , instead , a sheet of vortices leaves the wing at the trailing edge . The change in strength of the bound vortices over span is equivalent to the strength of the vortices leaving the wing , so the vortices fade out towards the tips . My advice is : If you do not want to operate or to write a potential flow code , do yourself a favor and forget all that . It is much better to interpret lift as the consequence of a pressure field around a wing which <URL> downwards . <URL> is simply the component of the resulting pressure forces parallel to the direction of movement , while the perpendicular component is lift . Please make sure to follow at least the last link ; it gives a very good explanation what induced drag really is . Tip vortices are the consequence of air filling the void above the downward moving air behind the wing . They are not originating from the wingtips , but the consequence of the vortex sheet rolling up ( if you want to stay in that picture ) . Note that the distance between the cores of the vortices is <URL> . For an elliptic wing of span $ b $ , it is actually only $ \ frac { \ pi } { 4 } \ cdot b $ A higher wingspan allows to capture more air for lift creation , so less downward acceleration is needed . Lower downwash speed also causes a less powerful trailing vortex . Note that the mass of air affected by the wing grows with the square of the wingspan !
Flutter happens when structural and aerodynamic <URL> converge . Aerodynamic eigenfrequencies depend on the time the air molecules take to transverse an aerodynamic surface .
Landing distance is a function of the formula Any change that will increase kinetic energy will require longer landing distances . When we land , the kinetic energy needs to go somewhere . It can be converted into heat with the brakes , opposed with drag from the thrust reversers or deployed spoilers Higher landing speed will cause an increase kinetic energy that must be converted on landing and thus you will have a longer landing distance . Braking , thrust reverser or spoiler issues will increase the landing distance because they will not be as effective ( take more time ) in converting kinetic energy . In a hydraulic issue , most likely the manufacturer has chosen to fly the airplane at a speed greater than needed for a normal landing ( VREF + 20 ) and will most likely not have the ability to use normal braking . Most jets use hydraulic fluid to stop the brakes . In the jets I fly , without normal braking means we use the emergency brakes which are not routed through the anti-skid system so precaution must be taken to not skid the tires . This all adds up to a substantial landing distance penalty . Hare the landing distances for some airplanes . Learjet family : Factor of 3.15 Learjet 45 family : Factor of 2.2 Challenger 604 family : Factor of 1.7 ( braking ) times 1.8 ( airspeed ) for a total of 3.06
You are absolutely correct , <URL> . But tradition and a subjective feeling of being treated better means that people will prefer to be seated facing forward . Some even claim that they develop motion sickness when sitting backwards . This can indeed be the case for some people in trains with their big windows , but much less so in aircraft . Just note which seats will be occupied last in a train with lounge/mixed seating . In order to cram the highest number of passengers into their planes , the airlines would need to convert all seats to the backward orientation , and you can be sure there will be some passengers who will complain . If passenger safety would be important to them , airlines could already use better seatbelts , like the 5-point-harnesses used in gliders and aerobatics planes , but they all use the minimum lap belt which is mandated and nothing more . Convenience and cost always win over safety . Now I need to mention two caveats : If passengers should be seated backwards , the industry needs to develop new seats . It will not be helpful to turn existing seats around - they would collapse at much lower loads than what a backward-sitting human can sustain . However , to fully support these higher loads , seats will be more heavy and possibly even the floor structure needs to be beefed up . Backward-facing seating will only help in the fraction of cases where deceleration loads are too high for a forward-facing person , but low enough to make the crash survivable . If the plane flies into a mountain or ditches and sinks before people get out , the better seating will not help . Some military transports have backward-facing seats . In some crashes , the survivability rate was seven times higher in those than in forward-facing seats . Early air travel also used mixed seating , e.g. on the Zeppelins or the <URL> . One airline to use mixed seating was Southwest Airlines with their <URL> , and business jets have mixed seating as standard . Thanks to @reirab for pointing out that United Business class also has some backward-facing seats . Cabin of the Do-X . No seatbelts , seats not bolted to the floor . These were the days ... Cabin of the Dassault Falcon 7X business jet .
The uses of the HP air of the pneumatic system are in the FCOM : air conditioning engine starting wing anti-icing ( <URL> ) water pressurization hydraulic reservoir pressurization The HP air sources are engine bleed , APU , and HP ground connection . The Bleed Monitoring Computers ( BMC ) do not recognize if the ground cart is connected or not . The BMC of the engines can detect overpressure and overheat and act accordingly ( check FCOM for logic schematic ) . However , the APU logic does not check for overpressure and overheat ( see below ) . Having APU and ground as dual HP sources can lead to overheat and/or overpressure of the pneumatic system . Even when starting an engine with external pneumatic power , engine bleeds <URL> ( no need letting the BCM catch an error for you ) . <URL>
I could not find a definite definition of congested area . As mentioned <URL> : [ ... ] neither the FAA nor the NTSB has ever provided [ ... ] a precise definition of [ ... ] a " congested area . " Rather , a " congested area " is determined on a case-by-case basis . According to the Board , " the determination must take into consideration all circumstances , not only the size of an area and the number of homes or structures , but , for example , whether the buildings are occupied or people are otherwise present , such as on roads . " The same is echoed <URL> : [ For the definition of congested area , ] FAA and the NTSB have opted for taking a " case-by-case " approach in determining how to apply certain terms . AOPA <URL> : Congested areas . " Over any congested area of a city , town , or settlement , or over any open air assembly of persons , an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft . " The FAA does not define congested area in the FARs or in the Aeronautical Information Manual . Interpretations in low-flight enforcement cases are not consistent for purposes of drafting a precise definition . Such a determination is usually decided on a case-by-case basis , and in the cases that we 've seen , congested has been interpreted rather broadly . For example , a highway with moderate traffic was found to be " congested , " as was a seaside area where 200 to 300 persons were sitting on the beach or bathing in the water . The same can be seen <URL> , and <URL> , and <URL> .
In flight mode the stick commands a load-factor . Which means it will be impossible to flare the aircraft , because as you pull on the stick , you 'll be commanding a positive g-load . Because of this the Airbus has a flare mode which activates at 50 ' RA . At 50 ' the pitch angle is stored ( memorized ) . At 30 ' the aircraft commands a 2 ° nose down ( it takes 8 seconds ) . The pilot would gently counter this by pulling back , resulting in a nice flare and no increase in the auto-thrust . If the pilot did not float for way too long ( they should not ) , the plane will touchdown before the 8 seconds pass , further eliminating the need to push forward on the stick to keep the nose gear planted . The logic reverts to ground mode when two conditions are met : on ground for 5 seconds and pitch angle < 2.5 ° . If the 5 seconds pass and the nose is still +2.5 ° , the logic will remain in the flare mode and the THS will not reset to 0 ° . The pitch will revert to the one set at 50 ' . As the plane continues to slow down this may result in a nasty nose landing gear slam or a tail strike depending on the stored pitch angle and any gusts ( kind of like <URL> ) . <URL> I do recommend you check your company 's Flight Crew Operating Manual ( FCOM ) and to not use the internet for flight . If your instructor does not like too many ' why ' questions during class , you can try and ask them after class . When you get your answers , try to validate them from the FCOM . Some <URL> have custom logic set by Airbus . So the installed logic may differ .
I 've heard about lots of bird strike incidents that occured during a takeoff roll or the early phase of takeoff climb but hardly heard of bird strikes on approach or landing . This is always a dangerous thing . Only because you hear more bird strikes that occur on takeoff , it does not mean there are more at takeoff . I found , for example , <URL> about bird strikes from the year 2000 . It says : [ ... ] 38 % of the bird strikes occurred during take-off and climb , and 56 % during approach [ ... ] That means there are more bird strikes during approach than on takeoff . I assume things have n't changed a lot since then . This question is even answered in the <URL> : Q : Do most bird strikes occur while in flight , at takeoff , or landing ? A : About 60 % of bird strikes with civil aircraft occur during landing phases of flight ( descent , approach and landing roll ) ; 37 % occur during take-off run and climb ; and the remainder occur during the en-route phase . A more specific statistic : <URL> <URL> Possible reason for subjective perception of bird-strikes happening more often during departure I thought a little about it and came to following possible reason : After a bird-strike on final , the pilots will continue landing . It would be unwise not to land immediately . For the passengers it will look like a normal landing . If the bird damages the engine , there is only a small change of sound , because the engines are running very low . However , when a bird-strike occurs while taking off , there is immediate action taken by the pilots . And because the engines are at or near full thrust , the sound of a dying engine can be perceived by the passengers . Last but not least , a departing aircraft has a much higher speed than a landing one , which means more damage . So , for newspapers , a bird-strike at take-off is more <URL> . More damage to the plane than a bird-strike on final Passengers not reaching their destination Dramatic passenger interviews about their " near-death-experience " A newspaper is not interested in a bird-strike on final , where everything went fine and no passenger noticed anything . To support my theorem , I googled " bird strike " and clicked on the " News " - tab . I looked through every article that had to do something with an bird-strike incident . 5 out of 6 articles were about a bird-strike on take-off . That 's over 80 % .
The one that decided to ground the fleet was Qantas . Qantas was having a new airplane model and potentially made a trade-off between having a not known design flaw and keep flying and the risk . At that time the A380 entered in service three years before and around 20 aircraft were in service with a mix of engines . Today , there are 200 A/C in service for 10 years . The possibility of having a design flaw or an unknown problem is really low . It was not a airworthiness directive as the directive was created <URL> in January 2011 . Qantas starting to get back in service the airplanes on 27th November ( incident was on 4th Novemeber )
The ship 's complement for a Nimitz class carrier is 3200 . That is the crew required to maintain ship operations . A further 2480 crew comprise the Air Wing - everyone needed to perform duties directly associated with flying activities , including maintenance , ordnance handling , emergencies , etc. . It 's treated as a separate entity because any one of ten Air Wings could be embarked on a carrier at any given time . That is a total crew of 5680 . I could n't find a breakdown of specific trades or ranks for either entity . Source : <URL> Note that the newer Gerald R. Ford class carriers make extensive use of automation , and so have several hundred fewer crew members in the ship 's complement .
There are several model variations of that type engine . Refer to the <URL> . You will find listed the specific model number numbers and thrust for each approved engine . For example , here are the CFM engine models approved for specific model/serial numbers of the 737 . You will have to get the latest revision of the TCDS for new models , like the 737 MAX . This excerpt from the 737 TCDS shows the model variety of one type engine ( the CFM56-7B ) as approved for certain 737s : <URL>
Yes , we can ask you to plan your landing roll in a certain way . We wo n't technically instruct you to brake the aircraft in a specific way , but simply to aim for a specific taxiway after landing . There can be different reasons for this , but generally it is an attempt to expedite traffic flow on the ground at the airport . For example , if you are landing on a long runway and your parking position is near the far end of the runway , I might ask you to keep the plane rolling down the runway and vacate at the end , in order for you to have a shorter taxi time . It could also be that the taxiway you would normally use to leave the runway is blocked by another aircraft or vehicle , and I want you to leave the runway via a taxiway that is further down the runway . However , extending the landing roll does extend the runway occupancy time as well , so if there is another aircraft behind you on short final I will not offer you to perform a long landing roll . This is also why you should always ask ATC if you are planning to perform a long landing for one reason or the other -- if we have someone else just a couple miles behind you , we might have to instruct them to go around if you do not vacate the runway like we expect you to . With regards to reverse thrust specifically , there are airports where the use of reverse thrust is only permitted in special situations . This is to reduce the noise level at and around the airport . However , this is purely a regulatory thing , and is not actually related to ATC . ICAO offers the following guidance on the subject ( DOC 4444 ) : 7.10.3.1 When necessary or desirable in order to expedite traffic , a landing aircraft may be requested to : a ) hold short of an intersecting runway after landing ; b ) land beyond the touchdown zone of the runway ; c ) vacate the runway at a specified exit taxiway ; d ) expedite vacating the runway . 7.10.3.2 In requesting a landing aircraft to perform a specific landing and/or roll-out manoeuvre , the type of aircraft , runway length , location of exit taxiways , reported braking action on runway and taxiway , and prevailing meteorological conditions shall be considered . A HEAVY aircraft shall not be requested to land beyond the touchdown zone of a runway .
The direction of rotation of the propeller introduces an asymmetry which designers try to mitigate by adding more asymmetries . Specifically , a right-turning tractor propeller ( clockwise from the pilot 's viewpoint ) will swirl the propeller wake in the same direction which adds a negative sideslip angle on the vertical tail ( which sticks up into the upper half of the wake only ) . By pointing the axis of rotation of the propeller slightly to the right ( right sidethrust ) , this sideslip angle can be reduced . Other means of correction like an incidence on the vertical tail would not work equally well : Once the engine is throttled back , such an incidence would require to re-trim the aircraft . On multi-engined aircraft a sidethrust can help to reduce rudder input in engine-out cases . Here each wing engine points slightly away from the fuselage so its thrust will pull the aircraft into a helpful sideslip when the opposite engine has failed . The propeller axis can also point slightly down in order to move the thrust line closer to the center of gravity , reducing thrust-related trim changes , and to reduce the <URL> effect ( sideways <URL> ) at high angle of attack . This is called downthrust . One example would be the <URL> - engined version of the <URL> : When the new engine was installed , its lower thrust line required 2 ° more downthrust . This is one of the few topics where the English version of Wikipedia stays schtum ; only the German version has an article on it ( <URL> and <URL> ) .
The Airways that the planes fly on criss-cross the sky and there are many , many intersections where there can be a potential for 2 aircraft to meet . So yes , it is normal that aircraft are routinely flight planned to be on " collision courses " . The flight plans do n't keep aircraft separated . They are used so that Air Traffic Controllers can know the exact routing and plan where any conflicts may occur . It is normal and safe as ATC can then keep the aircraft separated using radar . Generally aircraft flying eastbound fly at odd altitudes and westbound aircraft fly at even altitudes . This works quite well but we can still have 2 westbound aircraft both flying at 36,000 ' on a " collision course " because westbound can mean any track from 180 degrees to 359 degrees . In this case the 2 aircraft were crossing paths at about 90 degrees to each other at the same altitude . Normally they would be constantly monitored and the ATC controller would simply have one aircraft climb or descend to avoid the other aircraft . Another common practice is to tell one aircraft to turn slightly off course to avoid the other aircraft . On this day the ATC system and the controller were both overloaded and a number of factors contributed to the controller not seeing the conflict until it was almost too late . At the last minute he told one aircraft to descend to avoid the other . This action alone would have been fine but the order was given far too late . The Traffic Collision Avoidance System on the aircraft also saw the conflict and automatically issued an instruction for one pilot to climb while instructing the other aircraft to descend . The controller did not know that the TCAS had also spotted the conflict and his command to descend was contrary to the TCAS climb command . The pilot chose to follow the controller 's instruction instead of following the TCAS climb instruction . The other aircraft was also following his TCAS instruction to descend so both aircraft were now descending while still on a conflicting flight path routing . TCAS is there as a safeguard when the ATC system fails . It should always take priority over an ATC instruction . It is clear that the ATC system failed these pilots and TCAS operated as it should . As pilots we spend so much time following ATC instructions that I can see how it would be difficult to ignore the controller and instead follow the TCAS instruction .

How do pilots maintain awareness of other airplanes during taxi ?
At a large airport , all aircraft movements are coordinated by the ATC tower on the ground frequency . Aircraft should never move without authorization from the controller . The tower will issue instructions to aircraft that might look something like this : Taxi to Gate 1 via Alpha , Alpha 1 , Lima 3 , cross runway 24 , hold short Delta . These names correspond to markings on the ground that match up with the airport taxiing maps . By talking with the pilots , the controllers are able to build up a map of where aircraft are . It also helps that they can look out the window and see the aircraft on the ground . At airports without a tower , taxiing is n't much of an issue . There are n't many planes around , and there 's generally only one runway and not many taxiways . Nevertheless , aircraft taxiing when there is no ground controller comply with " see and be seen " by looking outside and turning on aircraft lights . Furthermore , if the aircraft has a radio , it should self-announce its movements on the ground .
The crew of <URL> ( 4 in total ) enter or exit the cockpit from the underside , using a ladder . It can be seen in <URL> . This picture shows the ladder ( the one on the right ) : <URL> On the top of the ladder , there is a door , which looks like this : <URL>
Aircraft have fixed gears ( when they have gears at all ) ! However in a sense a variable-pitch propeller can be considered analogous to transmission in a car and it was manual in some aircraft . The power transmitted by propeller is , within some reasonable range , proportional to its rotation rate . And so is , again within some reasonable range , the power produced by the engine . So for slow planes a fixed pitch propeller with connected by fixed gear does a decent job . As you open the throttle , the engine speed increases , so does the propeller and that 's exactly what it needs to do to transmit the power . Simpler aircraft have no gears at all and propeller is mounted directly on the engine shaft , higher power engines often have 2:1 reduction gear as the engine rpm would be too high for a propeller . Now at higher speed , the apparent propeller pitch is reduced as the air is already moving , so it would spin faster and faster and eventually too fast for the engine . To counter this , faster propeller-driven aircraft have variable pitch propeller . As speed increases , it is set to higher angle of attack ( coarser ) so it keeps delivering power without increasing rpm . Early variable pitch propellers had manually controlled pitch , but quite quickly constant speed propellers were developed ( many WWII aircraft had them already ) where a weight-on-spring controls the propeller pitch so that constant rpm is maintained . The manually controlled units required a lot of attention and the constant-speed system is rather simple , so manual pitch control was quickly abandoned . And that is kind of equivalent to perfect variable gear transmission . The pilot still has a throttle lever and a propeller pitch lever and selects power and rpm independently . Higher rpm allow higher power , but do n't require it , so landing is usually done with low power , but max rpm so the engine reacts quickly if power is added ( does not need to spin up ) . During cruise some more moderate value is selected ( according to manufacturer recommendation ) to reduce wear of the engine . Turboprop engines always have constant-speed propellers , because in a turbine engine the difference between turbine speed at idle and at full power is not actually that big . Again the rpm limits maximum power , so landing is done with low power , but high rpm and the engine reacts quickly when power is added . Last the turbojet/turbofan engines just turn the turbines and compressors as they need . It 's not much different from the fixed propeller really , though the jet engines now usually have variable guide vanes in the stator ( that are just linked to rpm ) .
No , no , by all means do n't turn left . See also <URL> . Transport category aircraft are capable of climbing out on one engine . It is a certification requirement for them . So if the left engine failed after rotation , the first thing the pilot has to concentrate on is to keep the plane flying and under control . That means ease the pull on the stick a bit to avoid stalling as the plane is not able to climb as fast and push the right rudder pedal to keep the plane flying straight ¹ . Once the plane is in straight climb at $ V_2 $ speed , it 's time to deal with the engine . First both pilots cross-check the instruments and the rudder position to determine it was the left engine that failed . Then they feather the propeller ( auto-feather might have done it already ) and cut fuel to the failed engine . If the engine fire warning is on and did not extinguish when fuel was cut , they discharge fire extinguisher . These things are done according to standard emergency procedure that the pilots have to remember and train in simulator . I do n't know the specifics for ATR-72 , but in all aircraft it is roughly like above . Meanwhile the aircraft climbs to safe altitude and then they should level off and let it accelerate a bit to get some safety margin for manoeuvring . The plane is now in relatively safe condition . Even if engine was on fire , it is unlikely to spread while the aircraft is flying . So the pilots now have time to declare emergency and ask the controller for what options they have for landing . Whether they do a complete circuit and land back on the same runway or turn around and land in opposite direction or land on some other runway then depends on wind and where they are relative to the runways at the time . There were many accidents where plane crashed after one engine failure during take-off because pilots started manoeuvring before they attained sufficient altitude and safe speed . It is better not to hurry , engine failure does not require it . ¹ Of course provided there are no obstacles in the way . For example if you were taking off from VQPR runway 33 and your right engine quit , you 'd still have to do a right turn rather early to avoid the <URL> right in the axis of the runway and quite a bit above it . But for any airport that require such avoidance ( and there is quite a few of them in various mountains ) , the pilots are specifically briefed and trained for that airport which includes instructions on how to best handle engine failure during take-off and during approach and viability of the procedure is verified in simulator and with a test flight . The above answer just outlines the generic procedure .
<URL> ( a ) Except as provided in paragraph ( b ) of this section , each required flight crewmember on flight deck duty must remain at the assigned duty station with seat belt fastened while the aircraft is taking off or landing , and while it is en route . ( b ) A required flight crewmember may leave the assigned duty station - ( 1 ) If the crewmember 's absence is necessary for the performance of duties in connection with the operation of the aircraft ; ( 2 ) If the crewmember 's absence is in connection with physiological needs ; or ( 3 ) If the crewmember is taking a rest period , and relief is provided - ( i ) In the case of the assigned pilot in command during the en route cruise portion of the flight , by a pilot who holds an airline transport pilot certificate not subject to the limitations in § 61.167 of this chapter and an appropriate type rating , is currently qualified as pilot in command or second in command , and is qualified as pilot in command of that aircraft during the en route cruise portion of the flight . A second in command qualified to act as a pilot in command en route need not have completed the following pilot in command requirements : The 6-month recurrent flight training required by § 121.433 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( iii ) ; the operating experience required by § 121.434 ; the takeoffs and landings required by § 121.439 ; the line check required by § 121.440 ; and the 6-month proficiency check or simulator training required by § 121.441 ( a ) ( 1 ) ; and ( ii ) In the case of the assigned second in command , by a pilot qualified to act as second in command of that aircraft during en route operations . However , the relief pilot need not meet the recent experience requirements of § 121.439 ( b ) . tl ; dr : You need at least one pilot at the controls at all times , unless completely necessary to operate the aircraft , or take care of physiological needs .
Basic flying rules require the pilot to be able , at any time : to maintain the aircraft safe attitude , to avoid other aircraft and obstacles , to know where he/she is , to find their way to the landing aerodrome . Does the pilot need to see outside ? It depends ... Any of these tasks are possible with viewing the environment . A trained pilot in an aircraft with the appropriate equipment , with the appropriate support and equipment on the ground , can also perform any of these tasks without seeing anything outside the aircraft . VMC vs. IMC There is a set of minimum conditions to declare that the outside environment is visible : these conditions are known as <URL> ( VMC ) . When VMC are not achieved , the conditions are said to be IMC , for <URL> . VFR vs. IFR Any flight must be done under one of the two existing set of rules : <URL> ( VFR ) <URL> ( IFR ) . The rules to be followed are dictated by regulation and are directly dependent on the meteorological conditions . In VMC : A VFR flight is allowed . A pilot may elect to fly IFR , at convenience . In IMC : You must use IFR , but you have to be allowed to do that . The aircraft must be certified for IFR . ( For the sake of completeness , a <URL> flight may be allowed while under IMC ) . What we said so far is : a pilot may fly without visibility ( IMC ) , but to do that must be trained and allowed , must follow IFR , and the aircraft must be certified for IFR . Landing without visibility , source : <URL> . Which instruments are required to fly IFR ? Some instruments are required to allow the pilot to maintain a safe attitude of the aircraft , e.g. ( left-to-right , top-to-bottom ) <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , <URL> . <URL> Main instruments , source : <URL> Some instruments are required to allow the pilot to navigate , e.g. <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , documentation on-board . ILS principle , source : <URL> Some equipment is required to be interlocked with <URL> ( ATC ) , e.g. radio , <URL> . Typical ATC room , source : <URL> See also : <URL> Some equipment may be required to avoid collision and accidents into terrain , e.g. <URL> , <URL> , <URL> . IFR flying aircrafts are separated by ATC , to help the pilot to avoid other aircraft . TCAS , source : <URL> Most of the commercial airliners fly under IFR , regardless of the conditions . In addition they have a <URL> . Try to fly IFR with <URL> .
Yes they do , and so do some independent training organisations . For instance EPST markets an aptitude test called <URL> , developed to test the suitability of candidates before they engage in pilot training . Some airlines only hire self funded students ( who have paid for their own CPL , type rating etc ) and they can be flight tested in the simulator .
There is a chance you suffer from <URL> but you should consult a physician to obtain a proper diagnosis ( Disclaimer : I am NOT a doctor ) . For what its worth commercial planes are pressurized generally to about the <URL> this equates to about .75 Atm . In the reverse case 33ft underwater already has you at 2 Atm . When I fly ( generally unpressurized ) I usually chew gum which i find helps .
In the early days of aviation it was simply easier to have the gear fixed . The landing gear adds drag , but so does <URL> and <URL> . Airplanes generally did not fly very fast or far , so the drag from the landing gear ( and that other stuff ) was not a big issue . The first design with retractable gear <URL> . Since then , retractable gear has been a design decision each airplane must make . Retracting the gear into the airplane allows for a cleaner form , which reduces drag . However , this is at the expense of added weight . The retract system , which is usually hydraulic , must be added , and the plane must be designed to make room for the gear somewhere at least mostly inside the aircraft . The plane must also be designed to handle situations where some or all of the gear does not extend properly . For planes that need to be fast and/or efficient , retractable gear is worth the reduction in drag . The additional drag has to be supported by the structure as well . Aircraft with retractable gear will have a maximum speed at which the gear can be extended . Even gear with proper fairings would add significant drag at the speeds airliners fly at . This would be much more critical at supersonic speeds . In these cases the weight of reinforcing the gear could be even higher than the weight of the retracting system . Particularly smaller general aviation planes tend to not have retractable gear . The retract system adds extra weight and complexity ( and therefore cost ) , which will be fairly significant in a small plane . Fixed gear is simple and can be designed to minimize drag as much as possible . These planes do not typically need to fly fast or have large range , so the added drag is less of an issue . Other small planes do have retractable gear , which will allow for greater speed and range . The PA-32 type shown in <URL> was later produced in a <URL> as well .
Most airplanes have a POH ( Pilot Operating Handbook ) with a table on aircraft distances . <URL> .
The pilots also need to use oxygen in case of smoke , fumes , or fire in the aircraft . Thus , they need enough oxygen to be able to get down and land in a fire scenario , which is much more than a decompression ! Fire procedures have the crew on 100 % oxygen at positive pressure to prevent them from breathing in smoke and fumes , while in a decompression , their masks mix oxygen with cabin air , in much the same way the cabin masks do . This is also why the cabin masks are not used in smoke/fumes scenarios .
Are there general aviation aircraft that have more than 2 " ranges " Yes . <URL> . The loading graphs look like this : Note also that the aircraft is certificated in both the Normal and Utility category , and the weight/CG ranges are different ( Utility being a subset of what 's permissible for Normal category operations ) - so there are two different operating envelopes that must be considered .
The FAA provides an <URL> I would say it falls under " aviation concern " . In your description if you include tail number and time they should be able to figure out who was flying ( or in the cockpit if its a 2 man situation ) . You can also contact your <URL> and report the tail number and time of incident . Aircraft owners/renters ( the people the tail number will trace back to ) will more than likely know who was flying a given tail number at a certain time so as long as you know when it happened you should be ok its not necessarily on you to know who was flying but the tail number and incident time is key .
Mostly you would n't need to ask . Most commercial flights use the airline 's standard call sign and the flight number printed on your ticket . Sometimes the call sign can be confusing - British Airways use ' Speedbird ' ; PAN AM used to use ' Clipper ' . There 's a list of common callsigns on <URL> The flight number should be enough - just listening for calls referring to ' two-two-zero ' will almost certainly identify United 220 . Code-sharing flights , however , will generally use the flight number of the operating airline . Your ticket might say ' United 220 ' , but if the flight is operated by , say , American Airlines so the call sign might be ' American 406 ' . All that said , if you 're using your phone when you have been explicitly asked to turn it off the airline is within its rights to confiscate your phone or remove you from the flight .
The key in holding the same speed as your wingman or the other aircraft is not to find the " perfect " throttle position , the key is to slightly adjust the throttle . When you look at cockpit-videos of those formation pilots ( like <URL> - move the camera to the throttle , it 's a 360-degree video ) , you can see that they are constantly moving the throttle . They almost never stick the throttle at one position . In that way , they can slightly adjust the speed and stay in formation with the wingman for a long time . While flying in close formation at high speed , it 's the same . Little adjustments of the throttle helps the pilot to keep the same speed as the wingman-aircraft . Flaps are not used in high-speed-flying because they can only operate below a maximum speed , otherwise they could get damaged . By using the air-brake , the handling of the aircraft changes , therefore the air-brake is not used very often while flying in formation . tl ; dr : Skill
Some modern airliners have a place where the flight number can be displayed on the cockpit displays . This information can be entered off the dispatch paperwork when setting up the flight plan , and is displayed throughout the flight for easy reference . For example , you can make out " DLH463 " on the screen at the bottom right of <URL> , corresponding to Lufthansa flight 463 . The Boeing 787 <URL> : The two outboard displays are a fixed format that provides primary flight display information combined with an " auxiliary " display that consolidates frequently referenced information for the crew , such as flight number , each pilot 's microphone-selected radio and its frequency , and transponder code . You can see this on <URL> at the top of the leftmost monitor : " FLT - > BAW787 " ( Photos not embedded due to licensing restrictions . )
Airways simply allow for better management of traffic . Imagine for a moment that everyone had an off-road capable car , if all the drivers were going " GPS Direct " to their destination how would drivers ensure separation ? How would you avoid hitting other cars if there were no roads ? Airways are the aviation solution to this problem : Defined routes between navaids ( VORs , NDBs , and the like ) . Airways can also be defined using " fixes " defined by GPS coordinates which can provide something closer to " GPS Direct " routing while still providing a defined route . Airways also provide a bunch of other benefits , including : Traffic Flow Management Flightplans in Europe are validated by the <URL> and checked for criteria such as direction of airways ( which can change during the day , e.g. one airway being for eastbound traffic only between 1000 UTC and 1400 UTC ) , correct flight level ranges and airways correctly connecting waypoints , such as fixes , VORs or NDBs . The bottleneck in all flight operations is understanding airport capacity ( how many operations/hour ) and sector capacity ( how many aircraft handled per sector/per controller ) . The goal is sometimes to distribute traffic between two sectors , although having the same destination . Below you will find two routings to Düsseldorf - EDDL , one departing from <URL> and one from <URL> ( click on links to see visual representation ) : The routing from EDDP to EDDL is going via WRB - TINSA - ADEMI - INBAX - DOMUX , which is within the boundaries of a sector called <URL> . The routing from EDDT to EDDL is going via PIROL - DENOT - HMM - XAMOD , which is within the boundaries of a sector called <URL> . During peak hours , both sectors are separate and deal with traffic only within their sector , which uses the full capacity of each controller handling the sector . Outside peak hours , the sectors can be combined and worked by one controller . This allows a granular usage of controller resources and airspace . Separation between Traffic From the example above we have seen that there is 2 routing endpoints at Düsseldorf - EDDL for traffic arriving from the North-East and South-East , XAMOD and DOMUX . Both waypoints or fixes are respective STAR or transition entry-points for arrivals into Düsseldorf . By using a standardized routing to and from airports , we can now expect traffic to always arrive via these two points from the east , unless other coordination has been achieved by the ATC units involved . Looking at the reverse routing for both airports , we will see these routes : MEVEL and NUDGO are two of the SID exit waypoints out of Düsseldorf , <URL> and NUDGO being 26nm east of DOMUX , however the relevant fix here is ELBAL , which is one of the fixes on the SID23L from Düsseldorf to NUDGO , <URL> . With something simple as using standardized entry and exit fixes to and from an airport , we have managed to maintain a traffic flow with ensured separation between departing and arriving traffic , something which would not be possible with GPS direct routing or would require constant ATC vectors . Handoffs from ATC Unit to ATC Unit The above examples show different routings and sometimes different sectors handling traffic on these routes . How is traffic handed off to other controllers and where ? A handoff consists of moving the radar track of the aircraft from one controller to another and thereafter instructing the aircraft to change the frequency to the next sector controller . Handoffs are initiated at sector boundaries , at specific fixes , which have been agreed on between different ACC ( Area Control Centers ) or sometimes even within one ACC between single sectors . Since we are already familiar with Düsseldorf airspace , let 's use the below routing from <URL> . From the graphical represenation you will see that traffic from EDDM to EDDL will pass the waypoint ARPEG , which is close to the destination airport . Before reaching the waypoint ARPEG , aircraft will be under control of either the <URL> ( page 5 ) and need to descend towards the destination airport . The next sector for arriving traffic into Düsseldorf via ARPEG would be Paderborn High Sector ( PADH ) . The agreements between HEF/GED and PADH are that arriving traffic to Düsseldorf via ARPEG is to be expected at FL240 level at ARPEG and released after handoff for further descent through PADH , even if the aircraft has not yet crossed the sector boundary and is not in PADH airspace . These coordination waypoints and handoff procedures are documented in Letters of Agreement between or within an ACC . Weather When weather ( wrong-way lows , strong jetstreams , storms , etc ) affects the Direct route , flight dispatchers will pro-actively suggest routes around it . It 's not unusual for NYC-SFO traffic to be routed over Canada or over Kentucky when the Midwest is storming . Exceptions - Free Route Airspace Where airport and air traffic density allows , the use of airways is not mandatory or in some cases , not even expected or provisioned for . One e
What you are hearing is " V-One " , written as V1 . It actually is said when they can no longer safely abort the takeoff with the remaining runway , but they still are not quite ready to takeoff . As they get a little faster , there should then be a second callout of " Rotate " when they have achieved the required takeoff speed , and that is when they actually takeoff . To answer the " why " part , it is said by the pilot who is n't actually flying the airplane since he has more time to monitor the speed and can say it at exactly the right time . It alerts the other pilot that it is no longer safe to abort the takeoff and that pretty much no matter what happens now , they should continue and come back to land if needed . Edit : In my answer above , I simplified somewhat by only mentioning the available runway . There are other factors that can come into play even with a runway that is longer than needed . One example would be the speed after which the brakes can no longer stop the airplane because they would over-heat and become ineffective . This is known as the brake energy limit , and it is not safe to abort above this speed , even if you have " plenty " of runway . V1 must be calculated or looked up prior to every takeoff , along with the other performance numbers . They vary based on the weight of the aircraft , the configuration of the aircraft , the altitude of the runway , and the weather ( outside temperature , wind , etc. ) . Sometimes this is done via a computer and sometimes manually via lookup tables or even graphs . For an example of the graphs , and more information about how temperature and altitude affect takeoff performance , see my previous answer here : <URL> There are also times when a pilot may increase or decrease V1 intentionally , even when it is not required . For instance , if there is wet ice on the runway it may not be safe to abort even at a very low speed , so you would be forced to continue no matter what ( note that I 'm NOT saying that this is a good idea ) . Using a lower power setting to extend engine life is another example , and you can read about it in my question here : <URL> For way more information than you probably care about takeoff performance , see my other answer here : <URL> In closing , aircraft performance planning is a rather complicated subject and it is only one of many subjects that we must master in order to safely fly an airplane . This only just scratches the surface of it , and there is a lot more that must be considered ( such as " hey , will we be able to out-climb that tree off the end of the runway ? " ) .
The EMB-145 used a combination of <URL> settings and the thrust levers to select the desired thrust and to signify the need for additional thrust . The thrust levers had a detent that selected " 100 % " thrust for the given mode the FADEC is operating in . If you pushed the thrust levers past the detent to " max " this would give you extra thrust . The mode the FADEC is operating in is selected by a button in the cockpit that cycles through the available modes . For takeoff power the modes were " ALT T/O " , " T/O " and " E-T/O " which gave you 90 % , 100 % and 107 % thrust for takeoff when the thrust levers were in the detent . If advanced past the detent this would put the mode into a reserve mode and depending on model would give you up to 110 % or 117 % thrust . Setting the exact amount of thrust needed was up to the engine FADEC units , our job was just to tell it what thrust mode it was in and it scaled the output of the thrust levels to that mode . Flying a 90 % thrust takeoff , a normal rated climb and then reducing to cruise levels only required initially setting the thrust levers into the detent and adjusting the FADEC mode .
Unlike passengers in economy who are trying to sleep in sitting position in seat that can be only partially reclined , the pilots sleep lying in a bed . Long range aircraft have a crew rest area . They are often above or below the main cabin and therefore low , now allowing standing up , but they always have beds or fully convertible chairs . The flight crew rest area is most commonly for 3 and separate cabin crew rest area for whatever is the usual number of flight attendants in given plane .

Why does flight duration differ for the same flight ?
I 'll expand on the other answers here . Wind : The biggest factor in this is wind . Winds at common cruising altitude can sometimes reach well into the 100 Knot spectrum . Keep in mind that this can be in any direction . So lets say a long haul flight has a 100 Knot headwind half the year and a 100 Knot tail wind for the other half . That 's a 200 Knot ground speed difference which can really make an impact on flight time . ATC Holds Vary : ATC for various reasons may put a plane into a holding pattern on arrival . This may add to the time spent in the air for a given flight depending on the hold . Landing Slots : There are <URL> here in the US ( and presumably others elsewhere ) that require planed ahead landing slots . If the slot time changes but the departure time remains the same an airline may chose to slow the plane a bit ( or speed it up a bit ) to compensate . Aircraft Loading : Aircraft efficiency ( and subsequently speed ) will vary a bit with the loading of the aircraft . Since not every flight on a given route is loaded equally there may be efficiency gained or lost as a result of loading .
You presume that they flew back the very same day ... but that is an incorrect presumption . For long flights over about 8 hours , strict rest limits apply so they can not fly again for 8-10 hours at a bare minimum . Typically , a crew from a long-haul flight will stay in a hotel in the destination city for anywhere from 12 to 48 hours , depending on the flight length , timezone changes , airline schedules , union contracts , and so on . Yes the hotels and travel bonuses costs the airline a pretty penny but that 's the cost of doing business . So at this very moment there will be 1 or maybe 2 LX crews , resting ( or touristing ... ) in San Francisco , waiting to fly a return service . For more information you can google or ask a new question on Fatigue Risk Management Systems .
Basically everything that consumes power on an aircraft can potentially cause interference , short-circuits , or otherwise jeopardize the safety of flight and therefore must be switchable . Sometimes the switch is in the form a button , otherwise by a fuse . There are several particular reasons that the transponder can be turned off . If the transponder malfunctions , it may cause interruptions to all ATC surveillance in an area . There have been occurrences in the past that due to a fault the transponder it was basically acting as a radar jammer . In one particular incident it took a while before the aircraft that caused it was identified and after requesting the pilot to switch of the transponder , secondary surveillance was restored . Another reason is that when the aircraft is at the gate , the transponder is switched of to reduce the amount of radio transmissions . 100 aircraft on the surface of a large airport can produce a massive Radio Frequency noise , which negatively affect radar systems . When taxiing , radar replies are useful for aircraft identification , hence the transponder is switched on at push-back or engine start . For an example to see how such requirements are worded in aircraft certification regulations , see rbp 's answer . The focus here and in the media1 on the transponder in relation to hijacks is a red herring . If an aircraft is hijacked , there are way more important things to worry about than an active radar transponder . If hijackers turn off the transponder it means that they have access to the cockpit already . 1This answer was written shortly after flight <URL> went missing while en-route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . Initial speculation focussed on a possible hijack scenario .
I found a resource specifically for Emirates , so I 'll try to explain it with respect to Emirates , though various other Airlines would use more or less the same principle . Emirates uses Panasonic Avionics IFE ( In Flight Entertainment ) system . They have the 3000i which is older generation of IFE system on older aircrafts and the latest version ex2 on new aircrafts . Media licensing is managed , I believe , by the IFE provider via links to the major studios . In this tie up , the media is encrypted and stored in portable media loaders for the airline to update on the aircrafts . As the media is encrypted so the studio does n't have much objection in giving away the rights to air the movies on board rather quickly . The Portable media loaders use optical connection for faster data transfer to minimize the loading time . The Main Aircraft Interface ( AI ) Server is nothing but a small computer which is generally called a LRU ( Line Replaceable Unit ) a small box which controls the entire IFE system of the aircraft the back end software can either be windows 95 or Linux depending on the type of system . 3000i uses windows . The movies are stored on other LRUs which are generally an array of Digital Data Servers or Media Servers ( MS ) or in lay mans terms Hard Drives ! These are connected in a LAN network and ethernet IP addressing is used in the entire aircraft system . The data is distributed over Optical fiber in first phase and over normal ethernet network to the specific seats . The interface is done via Ethernet Switches which intelligently routes the data from the Media server to the Area Distribution box to the Seat Electronic box and finally to the Smart Display . Using a central dedicated computer instead of individual computers on different seats is preferred as it is less costly . Also , the IFE is connected to Aircraft 's Main IFE cpomputer , and not the Aircraft 's main computer , so by hacking it all you get is the files ( IFE files ) , not the aircraft data , though the moving map system data might be first dumped into the IFE system from the Airplane 's main computer
Stall warning systems generally function on the principle of measuring pressure distribution or angle of attack . As each aircraft will have a different type of stall warning system , the necessary test will vary by aircraft as well . Here , I will answer based on aircraft that I have experience with , but these concepts should cover the majority of light aircraft . Aural stall warning systems can generally be divided into two types , pneumatic and electric . Pneumatic Pneumatic stall warning systems are found in many light Cessna aircraft , including the 172 and 177 . The following system description is from the Cessna 177 Maintenance Manual : The system is composed of an adjustable plate on the left wing leading edge , connected to a reed type horn by means of plastic tubing . The horn is actuated approximately 5 to 10 miles per hour above stalling speed as a negative air pressure area at wing leading edge causes a reverse flow of air through horn . See this excerpt from Figure 15-6 in the C177 Maintenance Manual depicting the pneumatic stall warning system and it 's location in the aircraft : <URL> To test this type of system , air must be drawn out of the system through the leading edge scoop located in the left wing . The maintenance manual and <URL> call for a test procedure as follows : Prior to flight , test the pneumatic stall warning system and determine if it is functioning properly , [ ... ] by covering the opening in the left wing with a clean cloth , such as a handkerchief , and applying a slight suction by mouth to draw air through the horn . A properly functioning horn will provide a sound that is clearly audible . The sound is something like that from a kazoo . In actual practice , speaking personally and from my observations , the " clean cloth " is typically dispensed with . Alternately , a <URL> is available for a small price if you would rather not have to put your mouth on a strange airplane . Failure of these systems will typically be due to a problem either with the horn -- such as a loose reed , or with the leading edge scoop -- such as a cracked or misaligned scoop . Electric Electric systems operate on some of the same principles , but use a movable tab -- instead of pneumatic suction -- to sense the change pressure distribution . This type of system is found on aircraft such as the Cessna 182 , Piper Cherokee , and Beechcraft King Air . The system operation can be generalized as follows : pressure changes cause the tab to move up thereby sending an electrical signal which will sound a horn in the cockpit . In some cases the tab actuates a microswitch . In more complex systems the tab actuates a transducer which signals a stall warning computer . The simpler of these types of systems can typically be tested with aircraft electrical power on by manually lifting the tab and listening for the warning horn . With the more complex King Air system , testing is accomplished with a switch in the cockpit which tests the circuitry and horn . In this system , signals from the stall warning transducer are blocked out by a weight on wheels switch when on the ground , with the effect that lifting the tab will not allow for system testing . Flight Safety ( FSI ) offers the following system description in their King Air 200/B200 Pilot Training Manual : The stall warning system senses angle of attack through a lift transducer actuated by a vane mounted on the leading edge of the left wing ( Figure 15-10 ) . Angle of attack from the lift transducer and flap position signals are processed by the lift computer to sound the stall warning horn mounted on the copilot 's side of the cockpit . The horn sounds when the following conditions are present : Airspeed is 5 to 13 knots above stall , flaps are fully retracted . Airspeed is 5 to 12 knots above stall , flaps are in the APPROACH ( 40 % ) position . Airspeed is 8 to 14 knots above stall , flaps are fully extended . The system can be tested prior to flight by placing the STALL WARN TEST switch , located on the copilot 's left subpanel , in the TEST position . This simulates a stall condition and sounds the warning horn . <URL> Figure 15-10 from the FSI King Air 200/B200 Pilot Training Manual Other Systems Other types of systems exist with which I have no actual experience , either as a pilot or mechanic . I offer the following information without much real knowledge of it , but hopefully with good sources . Others more knowledgeable than I might be able to verify it . The Boeing 737 has a stick shaker type stall warning system to provide the required warning , rather than an aural warning system . The SmartCockpit.com <URL> document gives the following system description : Stall Warning System The stall warning " stick shaker " consists of two eccentric weight motors , one on each control column . They are designed to alert the pilots before a stall develops . The warning is given by vibrating both control columns . The system is armed in flig
The B-52 Stratofortress is a military jet , and specifically a US military jet , which if flown over USSR was very much in risk of being harmed . Thus , it was an intelligent decision to follow a longer route , rather than being a victim of ongoing cold war , following the longer route could have also helped the crew in achieving the longest flight record . Secondly , the B-52 did not have a very good <URL> even before 1962 , thus taking precautions was a necessity for the crew , and they did this by choosing to fly over more helpful nations . Also , aviation was not developed very much in Asia back in 1962 with very few strips of a large distance , to be used in case of emergency . For more information , you may refer <URL> and <URL> !
There certainly are similar routes - the Niagara Scenic Falls route , given in FAR <URL> comes to mind . ( <URL> . ) Comply with the following procedures when conducting flight over the area described in paragraph ( a ) of this section : ( 1 ) Fly a clockwise pattern ; ( 2 ) Do not proceed north of the Rainbow Bridge ; ( 3 ) Prior to joining the pattern , broadcast flight intentions on frequency 122.05 Mhz , giving altitude and position , and monitor the frequency while in the pattern ; ( 4 ) Use the Niagara Falls airport altimeter setting . Contact Niagara Falls Airport Traffic Control Tower to obtain the current altimeter setting , to facilitate the exchange of traffic advisories/restrictions , and to reduce the risk of midair collisions between aircraft operating in the vicinity of the Falls . If the Control Tower is closed , use the appropriate Automatic Terminal Information Service ( ATIS ) Frequency ; ( 5 ) Do not exceed 130 knots ; ( 6 ) Anticipate heavy congestion of VFR traffic at or above 3,500 feet MSL ; and ( 7 ) Use caution to avoid high-speed civil and military aircraft transiting the area to or from Niagara Falls Airport .
I did n't do statistics , but <URL> lists units to low tens a year worldwide . Most of them happen at airport due to fire indication ( sometimes even false ) or smoke on board . On the ground , fire spreads a lot faster than while flying , because when flying , the wind is too strong and blowing the flames off . The most notable example would be <URL> . The aircraft was already at the gate when the flames were first noticed , evacuation was immediately initiated and by the time everybody left , it was already engulfed in flames , about 3 minutes after the fire started . While China Air might not be " western " in strict sense of the world , it is largest airline on Taiwan and follows the same standards . Another notable accident is <URL> . Here are some recent evacuations mentioned on AvHerald : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> Notice , that they are all smoke or fire events . For some other reasons , see e.g. : <URL> <URL> two similar accidents where both aircraft were evacuated via slides . The reason in these , and many other gear collapse incidents , is that they do n't want to wait in a damaged plane where there is a risk of fire , plus the difficulty of getting stairs to the aircraft resting in strange attitude .
Absolutely . In fact it 's not a bad idea to do so , if only to get some practice filing flight plans and using the system . In the US VFR flight plans are a search-and-rescue tool : They 're only used if your aircraft is overdue to give the rescue folks information to help plan the search . In your particular case I would file a flight plan that lists your home airport as your departure and destination , with the airport you intend to use for your touch-and-go landings as an intermediate waypoint . If you want to enter information on the nature of the flight ( training , touch-and-gos at XXXX , etc. ) in the remarks field you can do that too . Activate the flight plan when you depart , and close it when you return to your home airport . You can optionally also call Flight Service over the radio when you get to the touch-and-go airport to give them a position report and let them know you 've reached that waypoint ( I would do this on your way out of the area to return home , along with an ETA update if appropriate ) . As an alternative ( or in addition to the VFR flight plan ) you could get <URL> from the ATC facility responsible for your airspace . Be aware that they may drop you and ask you to squawk VFR while you shoot your touch-and-gos since you 'll probably be going off their radar , but you can always request service again when you start your return leg .
This is an excellent question and at the same time , very broad . Every student and pilot can give you a ton of advice about what qualities the best <URL> must have . I will list a few qualities to look for and then guide you to a few resources which can further elaborate the topic . I presume you are going for Part 61 ( <URL> ) . I also presume that you have selected a flight school or will choose from a few around your . Once you get to a flight school , normally you will be assigned a CFI by them . They will interview you and you should do the same . Ask the CFI why are they teaching and what are their goals ? Generally speaking , one half of CFIs are doing it for their future career goals ( i.e. to get a job in an airline ) and others are doing just because they earned the CFI rating and hence are earning money by teaching . Once you start flying with a CFI , see how does they respond to your mistakes ? You are a student and are learning something new . There is no way that you will master everything taught just once . ( Maybe you can , I 'm not just that smart . ) Observe how the CFI will notice your mistake , bring it your attention , rectifies it themselves or gives you instructions to do it , and most importantly , how your mistake affects their mood ? Before and after each lesson , notice how they answers your questions and explains you what you guys will be doing and have done ? Some people ( like me ) would ask a million questions . Often times , you will find teachers/instructors who do n't like to be questioned a lot . All your questions are genuine , you just need to see how are they answered . Ask your pilot friends to guide you , or check with other students at your flight school . Your friends will can give you a very honest feedback . You can benefit from other students too , but if a CFI works for someone else , they may not work for you . You are the one to judge and make the call . Naturally , you can not know about a CFI 's style unless you take a few lessons with them . That will definitely cost you money . But spending a little money to learn a valuable lesson is not wasting money . It is an investment . I am not talking about some other details as they are discussed thoroughly in the references below . Here are some resources which have answered this same question in more detail . <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> ( AOPA has an article about almost everything aviation-related ) <URL> <URL>
In the US most General Aviation rentals are " Wet Hobbs Time " -- You are billed based on the actual clock time the engine was running ( in tenths of an hour ) , and fuel/oil are included in the rental price . This is attractive to renters because of the simplicity : You do n't have to pay the FBO separately for the fuel , oil , and aircraft , and you 're basically paying for the amount of " clock time " you spent in the plane . It 's easy to understand , especially for new students who may not quite grasp the concept of how the recording tachometer measures " time " . Hobbs billing is attractive to the FBO as well , for different reasons : Rentals are typically blocked out by clock hours ( " 10 AM to 2 PM " ) . Since booking is clock time billing based on clock time ( Hobbs hours ) makes sense . In practice the two numbers are usually close ( and when they 're not the error tends to favor the FBO ) . Let 's look at your " Tach vs. Hobbs " scenarios ( for the sake of simplicity let 's assume both flights are three " clock hours " chock-to-chock ) : Pattern Work Pattern work consists of three basic phases : Takeoff ( full throttle , high RPM - Tach runs faster than Hobbs ) Circuit ( low power , low RPM - Tach runs slower than Hobbs ) Descent &amp; Landing ( near idle power , very low RPM - Tach runs MUCH slower than Hobbs ) There might be a taxi in there for full-stop practice , but you 'll be close to idle there too . If we average this out over three hours of pattern work ( and assuming you and your instructor do n't commit suicide to break the monotony ) the Tach hour meter will be reading a number much lower than the Hobbs meter . In this scenario you might have 2.25 tach hours for your 3 Hobbs / Clock hours . 3-hour Cross Country A cross country consists of 5 phases : Takeoff/Climb ( full throttle , high RPM - Tach runs faster than Hobbs ) Cruise ( moderate throttle , moderate RPM - Tach and Hobbs run about the same speed ) Descent ( moderate-low throttle , moderate-low RPM - Tach may be a bit slower than Hobbs ) Circuit/Approach ( low power , low RPM - Tach runs slower than Hobbs ) Landing ( near idle power , very low RPM - Tach runs MUCH slower than Hobbs ) If we assume Phases 1 and 3 take about the same time they roughly cancel each other out . Phase 2 ( Cruise ) is a wash too , so we 're left with two brief periods where the tach is running noticeably slower than the Hobbs ( the pattern and landing at the destination ) . In this scenario you might have 2.85 Tach Hours for your 3 Hobbs / Clock hours . In both of these scenarios the FBO comes out ahead of the game -- they 're billing you for 3 hours of time , but their maintenance cycle is based on the tach . This might be enough to squeeze another day or two of profitable flying out of an airframe before it 's next annual or 100-hour inspection . There are scenarios where you can " beat " the Tach clock , but most of them involve being downright abusive to the aircraft/engine . For example if you flew that 3 hour cross country at low altitude and full throttle ( very high RPM ) you might rack up 3.3 tach hours for your 3 Hobbs hours . The FBO is basically stuck eating that maintenance expense . Along similar lines when renter pilots abuse an engine ( for example by leaving the mixture knob full rich for the whole flight ) the tach time does n't always tell the whole maintenance story - the mechanic 's time cleaning the plugs because the next renter could n't get through a runup has to be paid for somehow .
Most of the time the turbulence we experience is termed " chop " , which is akin to what you experience on a boat on the lake -- bumps but no real altitude deviations . With altitude deviations we 'll call it " turbulence " . Within these broad categories we 'll qualify them with " light " , " moderate " , " severe " and " extreme " in reports to ATC and other aircraft . These reports do suffer from a fair bit of subjectivity with respect to aircraft type ( wing stiffness ) and pilot experience . If it is light chop , I 'll generally just ride it out and turn the seatbelt signs on . The first thing I 'll do if encountering moderate chop or turbulence is to query ATC and get ride reports from aircraft ahead of us and at different altitudes than us . From this information I 'll make a determination to ride it out or to request a climb/descent . If the turbulence was particularly bad , slowing down was an option , but I only came across that need a few times . Our ability to descend would often be limited by route length and fuel and major lateral deviations also depended on contingency fuel , so in some cases we had no choice but to stay in the chop . If the turbulent areas were well forecast or had lots of PIREPS , our dispatchers would sometimes route us differently . As for power adjustments , if we were n't slowing down due to aircraft limitations I would just adjust power so that maximum airspeed deviations stayed below Mmo .
You have this tagged both FAA and ICAO but for the FAA thats governed under <URL> ( c ) Hand fire extinguishers for crew , passenger , cargo , and galley compartments . Hand fire extinguishers of an approved type must be provided for use in crew , passenger , cargo , and galley compartments in accordance with the following : ( 1 ) The type and quantity of extinguishing agent must be suitable for the kinds of fires likely to occur in the compartment where the extinguisher is intended to be used and , for passenger compartments , must be designed to minimize the hazard of toxic gas concentrations . ( 2 ) Cargo compartments . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located for use in each class E cargo compartment that is accessible to crewmembers during flight . ( 3 ) Galley compartments . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located for use in each galley located in a compartment other than a passenger , cargo , or crew compartment . ( 4 ) Flightcrew compartment . At least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located on the flight deck for use by the flightcrew . ( 5 ) Passenger compartments . Hand fire extinguishers for use in passenger compartments must be conveniently located and , when two or more are required , uniformly distributed throughout each compartment . Hand fire extinguishers shall be provided in passenger compartments as follows : ( i ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 6 but fewer than 31 passengers , at least one . ( ii ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 30 but fewer than 61 passengers , at least two . ( iii ) For airplanes having passenger se ats accommodating more than 60 passengers , there must be at least the following number of hand fire extinguishers : Minimum Number of Hand Fire Extinguishers Passenger seating accommodations : 61 through 200 : 3 201 through 300 : 4 301 through 400 : 5 401 through 500 : 6 501 through 600 : 7 601 or more : 8 ( 6 ) Notwithstanding the requirement for uniform distribution of hand fire extinguishers as prescribed in paragraph ( c ) ( 5 ) of this section , for those cases where a galley is located in a passenger compartment , at least one hand fire extinguisher must be conveniently located and easily accessible for use in the galley . ( 7 ) At least two of the required hand fire extinguisher installed in passenger-carrying airplanes must contain Halon 1211 ( bromochlorofluoromethane ) or equivalent as the extinguishing agent . At least one hand fire extinguisher in the passenger compartment must contain Halon 1211 or equivalent . You may also find some <URL> .
None of four airlines I worked for ( two commuters , two Part 121 ) had specific guidance as to the max number of go-arounds . However , as mentioned in the other answers , 2 or 3 was believed to be a good rule . The only time I did multiple go-arounds , all missed approaches , was trying to get into Pullman , WA during a snowstorm in the late 1980s in an SA-227 Metroliner . I tried the VOR approach 3 times . Each time when we got down to the MDA , we did not have the forward visibility to descend further . Each of the 3 times the station personnel saw us pass over , and each time passengers looking out the windows saw the runway below us when we were overhead . That , of course , resulted in our being criticized when we arrived at our alternate by some passengers for not having landed at Pullman . I had explained en route to the alternate the problem with forward visibility , but when you 've disrupted people 's travel plans , they do n't want to listen . I briefly considered the feasibility , when we were over the runway , of entering a tight left turn to see if I could keep the runway in sight , but I rejected that . And , yes , I considered descending below the MDA before catching sight of the runway . That would have been doable as I was very familiar with the airport and knew that the gently rolling fields around the airport topped out well below the MDA . The problem was that with all the snow on the ground and the snow in the air , we could n't determine our altitude above the ground visually until we were actually over the runway . The fields around the airport had no trees , they were wheat fields in season . Even if I had chosen to bust the MDA , I still would have been too high for any kind of a normal landing when I caught sight of the runway end . If getting down was an emergency , we could have done it . It was n't technically legal , but you could go into beta with the props and really drop out of the sky , then as you flared come out of beta . But it was n't an emergency , so we went to our alternate , which was actually our next stop anyway , so all of the passengers were n't unhappy . The advantage of multiple approaches is that conditions might get better while you 're doing them , and you can get in . The disadvantage is that the nervous energy you 're expending is telling . Our SA-227s had no-autopilots , no radar altimeters , and , of course , no GPS . I imagine that these days that airport has one or more GPS approaches that would make landing in those conditions a piece of cake .
Both DUAT ( DTC ) and DUATS ( CSC ) provide the same information . They are functionally equivalent . You also left one out : Lockheed-Martin operates a web-based briefing service at <URL> . Which you prefer to use for interactive access is largely an aesthetic consideration - as a pilot you can sign up for an account on each of these services , so the usual advice is to sign up for all of them and use the one you like better ( personally I used to prefer DTC 's DUAT interface , but the direct ( 1800wxbrief . com ) system is a now my preference for web-based briefings when I 'm not using ForeFlight ) . From a non-interactive standpoint , CSC DUATS has an API that can be used by other programs ( like ForeFlight ) to receive weather/NOTAMs/etc . and to file flight plans . This can be advantageous , however Lockheed-Martin has recently ( 2013 ) implemented an XML-based API that lets application developers directly communicate with the automated flight service system , and it is likely that this will be the preferred way to handle this sort of thing as time goes on .
The flight instructor certificates held at that point provide all the same privileges . This is not true . A ground instructor certificate is valid to give ground training for all aircraft ... airplane , helicopter , glider , balloon , etc. . A flight instructor must have those ratings on their certificate . Record keeping requirements also differ between the two certificates . <URL> requires the flight instructor to keep a record of all knowledge test endorsements to include the student name , date , kind of test and result . The ground instructor has no such requirement . The flight instructor must also have an advanced or instrument ground instructor certificate to qualify for a gold seal .
Ideally it would not . With increasing Mach number the <URL> of the vertical tail goes up proportional to the Prandtl-Glauert factor $ \ frac { 1 } { \ sqrt { 1-Ma ^ 2 } } $ while the destabilising fuselage as a slender body is mainly unaffected by Mach effects . But that is only theory which assumes a perfectly rigid body . In reality , elasticity decreases the effectivity of the vertical tail . Higher loads lead to higher deformations which in turn decrease the loads and with them the stabilising moments . What happens in detail depends on the structure : A light aircraft will experience decreasing directional stability as dynamic pressure increases . At supersonic speed , fin effectivity is further reduced by the now again decreasing lift curve slope as Mach increases further . Now even the rigid aircraft experiences decreasing directional stability and elasticity will reduce stability further . <URL> Directional stability over Mach , from Ray Whitford 's Fundamentals of Fighter Design
The FAA 's <URL> says that it 's about formatting : Q : Will an FPL be automatically rejected or is that a manual function ? A : ERAS automatically rejects an improperly formatted FPL . The Rejection ( REJ ) message usually includes information which identifies the error . The filer should correct the error and reenter the FPL . That seems to be confirmed in this <URL> that goes into detail on computerized flight plan formats , filing etc. . Section 3.7.2 lists all the possible reasons for the ERAS computer to return a REJ ( rejected ) message , and they 're all to do with formatting or invalid values , e.g. airspeed ca n't be zero . To me , that makes sense : no one knows the equipment or capabilities of an aircraft except the person ( or organization ) submitting the flight plan . Even if the FAA had a database of every aircraft in the world , what happens if your GPS unit burns out and you want to file IFR using only standard IFR equipment ( VOR , ILS ) ? Or you want to fly at a reduced ( or increased ) cruise speed for some mechanical or performance testing reason ? The FAA could n't possibly know if your submitted values are correct . I do n't know ( and could n't find out ) if there 's any situation where <URL> ca n't generate a <URL> even though the flight plan is accepted as valid . If it does happen , I suppose that would be a sort of secondary check . As an aside , I was at an <URL> meeting last week and we discussed the new ICAO flight plan format ( new to the US , that is ! ) . A couple of controllers were there , and they said that you have to be careful about what equipment you put in your flight plan in case you get assigned something beyond the pilot 's capabilities . For example , a Cirrus is <URL> and if you input all the equipment correctly in the flight plan then you may get a complex SID rather than just departure vectors . If you are n't familiar and comfortable with the avionics then you might get yourself in trouble , so it would be better to file only basic avionics . That kind of decision is n't something the FAA could or should validate .
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau did a report titled : <URL> This report specifically covers this and found that the accident rate was three times higher in kit built - vs - similar factory build aircraft : What did this report do The ATSB investigated the safety history of amateur-built aircraft in Australia through analysis of accident data held in the ATSB 's occurrence database from 1988 to 2010 . Comparisons were made between accidents involving amateur-built aircraft and those involving similar factory-built aircraft to help identify whether the rate and types of accidents differed between these two groups of aircraft . What the ATSB found Amateur-built aircraft had an accident rate three times higher than comparable factory-built certified aircraft conducting similar flight operations between 1988 and 2010 . The fatal and serious injury accident rate was over five times higher in amateur-built aircraft , in particular due to relatively more serious injury accidents . The pilots of amateur-built aircraft involved in accidents were significantly more experienced overall than factory-built aircraft accident pilots . However , they were significantly less experienced on the aircraft type that they were flying at the time of the accident . Over half of the accidents were precipitated by mechanical events , which were mainly complete or partial engine failures . Following the amateur-built phase one test period , mechanical failures were still significantly more common when compared with factory-built aircraft . A quarter of accidents were from loss of aircraft control . Structural failures were not common precursors in amateur-built aircraft . Collision with terrain and forced landing accidents were more frequent in amateur-built aircraft . Collisions with terrain , hard landings , and runway excursions were more likely to result in a serious injury from an amateur-built aircraft accident than for factory-built accidents . On the other hand , the EAA says that homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate of less than 1 % higher than the general aviation fleet in their <URL> , but this did n't compare homebuilt to factory built in similar models : How Safe Are Amateur-Built/Homebuilt Aircraft ? Studies by FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) show that Amateur-Built/Homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate less than one percentage point higher than the general aviation fleet . In fact , the accident rate for Amateur-Built/homebuilt aircraft is dropping . The total number of registered homebuilt aircraft is increasing by about 1,000 per year , while the total number of accidents has stayed virtually the same . Another good barometer of safety is insurance rates . Companies that insure both homebuilts and production aircraft charge about the same rates for owners of either type of airplane . That indicates a similar level of risk .
The purpose of the test flight is for the safety of passengers . For most maintenance , in a not-for-hire aircraft , a private pilot can perform the test flight and determine the aircraft is airworthy , but they must do it without passengers . <URL>

How did the De Havilland Mosquito compete with jets ?
The Mosquito was a great aircraft but it was not faster than Germany 's Messerschmitt ME-109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 piston powered fighter aircraft . It also did not successfully compete with the jet powered Messerschmitt Me 262 . The limited numbers of ME-262 were probably the only reason the Mosquito could survive in the same airspace . On 26 July 1944 the first aircraft to be shot down by a ME-262 was in fact a Mosquito : <URL> " a 262 A-1a , caught and severely damaged the Mosquito in a pursuit . The Mosquito , which managed to escape into cloud , later crashed at its destination airfield in Italy , and the airframe was written off "
Usually , no . There are two main methods used to deice an airplane in the air . One is letting warm air that is bleed from the jet engine to heat the wing leading edge . The other is to have have rubber air bladders ( called deice boots ) on the leading edge of the wing and tail surfaces that are pumped up and the ice falls off . Both of those methods are only useful to deice the leading edge of the wing and tail surfaces which is pretty much the only dangerous place where an airplane can gather ice while it is flying . Airplanes on the ground are a different story . Ice can be built up pretty much anywhere as there is no airflow to prevent it . Excessive ice on control surfaces can make them behave " unevenly " or in extreme cases even unresponsive . Bigger chunks of ice breaking off the fuselage can get ingested by the engine and cause problems . It is therefore important that the airplane takes off ice-free . In fact , as little as frost on the surface of the wings can cause a significant loss of lift and can even cause a plane to crash .
Most de-icers are run by the airport FBO so the people who work on de-icing in the winter work on other FBO duties such as refueling and the like when there is no de-icing to do . Some de-icers are just hired permanently for winter times .
Concorde went supersonic during its climb phase to the cruising altitude . The altitude at which the Concorde can go supersonic was limited by the regulations . For example , the aircraft was only allowed to go at 400 knots during the climb phase between 6,000 and 32,000 ft ; also , the aircraft was allowed to go supersonic only after it has crossed the coastline . As the air gets thinner during climb , the Mach number increases for same IAS , reaching around 0.93 at 25,000 ft and 0.95 at 28,000 ft. After this , the afterburners are engaged and autopilot is set to the cruising altitude ( ~ 60,000 ft ) . During this climb phase to the cruising altitude , the aircraft goes supersonic , settling at around Mach 2 at over 50,000 ft. The flight envelope limitations of Concorde ( at one configuration ) is shown in this image : <URL> Source : pprune.org The altitude affected the thrust requirements , as more thrust is required for the same speed at lower altitudes due to density . This is one of the reasons for Concorde flying at altitude far above that of subsonic airliners .
One of the main reasons wing tip tanks were used was to <URL> by adding mass to the end of the wings . As time has progressed and our understanding of materials has grown as well as our ability to design structures better the need for tricks like this has gone away . As our general understanding of aerodynamics has gotten better so has the understanding of the <URL> . As such wing tip tanks have been traded out for wing tip devices . In some cases the tip tanks are an option available as a later add-on or at purchase time . Generally this increases the range of the aircraft at the cost of useful load . As such , it may just be that most people who order planes these days prefer the higher useful load and the reduced range , rather than the extended range flying with a lighter load . You can find some more discussion <URL> .
Brake temperature sensors are quite common on airliners . Turnaround times of large aircraft are often impacted by the required cooling time . This is because during take-off the brakes must be cool enough to absorb the heat of a possible rejected take-off .

The other answers are good , but do n't touch on one key method ... Prevention . Small aircraft like a Cessna 172 have a limited cruise time , about 4 hours maximum . They are small enough that they get relatively uncomfortable after 2-3 hours , and if flying in turbulence or challenging conditions , flights can be relatively short . The best way I 've found to avoid the problem is to make sure to use the facilities as close to departure time as possible and to limit my intake of fluids in the hour or so leading up to a flight . The other option you have is to land and use the " facilities " . Many unmanned airports that have terminals ( like <URL> ) have a keypad access and facilities inside . Airports are pretty common and you usually are n't more than 30 minutes away from an airport with a bathroom . Just as a personal account of this , I was doing night training at my local field ( Class C ) and it was late ( 10:00 PM or so ) . One gentleman came on the radio and asked the tower if the FBO was open so he could use the facilities . The controller responded that the FBO was closed but he could taxi him to a quiet corner of the airfield for a few minutes . The pilot gladly took him up on the offer .
The requirements for Flight Data Recorders ( FDRs ) on airliners like the A320 is in 14 CFR 121 . For a good summary of the requirements for flight recorders in various types of aircraft , see the <URL> . Depending on the certification date of the aircraft ( 14 CFR 121.343 ) , the FDR must record between 6 and 17 parameters . Since engine parameters are included , this could be up to 23 different parameters on 4-engine aircraft . Newer Digital FDRs ( DFDRs ) must record at least 88 items ( 14 CFR 121.344 ) . Some of these parameters are conditional , and some require multiple parameters , so the total will probably be more than 88 parameters . The NTSB report on the <URL> notes that the FDR recorded 178 parameters during the flight . According to <URL> , tape-based DFDRs can record at 64 12-bit data words per second . Newer DFDRs using solid state recording can store up to 256 12-bit data words per second . This 256 words per second is also specified in the information on <URL> . It says it can record > 100 hours at 64 words/second , which translates to about 35 MB total . The parameters are per DO-160C standard , which you have to pay to access . Accident reports will generally include readouts from relevant parameters , to give an idea of the items that are recorded . There is a table <URL> showing some parameters , the measurement range , and recording intervals . The interval is anywhere from 0.125 seconds to 4 seconds depending on the parameter . Aircraft may also have a <URL> ( QAR ) , which records many parameters ( over 2000 ) . However , aircraft are not required to have one and the QAR is not required to survive an accident . Airlines use them for data to improve operations , and they can also be used in less severe crashes for analysis .
Not according to the authors of <URL> <URL> Despite impressive technological achievements and great expectations all around , the service 's business performance ultimately proved an abject failure . In the ten years before Verizon finally pulled the plug , Airfone generated only 50 million total calls , a fraction of the calls carried daily by cellular companies . While the Airfone service was heavily used when bad weather caused significant delays , the system 's utilization at other times was extremely low . A typical plane was equipped with as many as 60 phones . From these , the average large jet generated fewer than 100 calls per day in about 16 hours of flying time . As a result , the expensive system , with its heavy load of fixed costs , remained idle well over 99 % of the time . ... While Airfone claimed that some customers ' monthly bills topped out at $ 4,000 , there were not nearly enough of them to sustain the service 's sky-high fixed costs . ... Within a few years of the service 's launch , airlines started to remove the expensive phone infrastructure from their cabins , since the Airfone cost them more in increased fuel consumption ( because of the system 's weight ) than it generated revenues through their revenue sharing arrangement with Verizon . My emphasis .
The problems are two-fold : The airspeed is much higher in flight than when landing , so the thrust reverser doors would have to be much stronger , and therefore heavier to withstand the additional forces , along with the relative wind making them harder to close . What happens when it gets stuck in the deployed position ? Now you have to shut down a perfectly good engine and have additional drag on the airplane while in flight . ( Bonus ) It is n't really needed on most airplanes with spoilers , flaps , etc. that accomplish the same thing .
Because it was something of a <URL> trademark since his early days . His first designs , the VariViggen and VariEze , had such a wing already , and apparently he saw no reason to optimize the wing of the Starship . <URL> Rutan VariEze in flight ( picture <URL> ) The only true innovation was a variable geometry canard , which he even <URL> . Being only 85 % scale , the performance of the Starship prototype was formidable , but once the real production aircraft had been designed with full compliance to airworthiness regulations , the Beech Starship turned out to be less impressive . The additional wetted surface produced more friction drag . Piaggio 's design is clearly superior . By the way , the idea behind the variable geometry canard was sound : In the landing configuration it would balance the additional lift from the fowler flaps on the wing . But the whole mechanism cost more in weight than the reduction in drag during cruise could save . <URL> Drawing from US Patent 4641800 .
Note that the article says that No aircraft capable of being flown without a pilot At that point of time there were a number of radio controlled aircraft which could be flown without a pilot on board ( for example , the <URL> and <URL> , of which thousands were made ) . The authors of convention most probably had these in mind when they frame the article 8 . This <URL> also points in the same direction : 4.3 Article 8 details conditions for operating a " pilotless " aircraft over the territory of a contracting State . To understand he implications of this Article and its inclusion from the Paris convention of 1919 ( Article 15 ) into the Chicago Convention of 1944 , the intent of the drafters must be considered . Remote-control and uncontrolled aircraft were in existence at the time , operated by both civil and military entities . " [ A ] ircraft flown without a pilot " therefore refers to the situation where there is no pilot on board the aircraft . As a consequence , any RPA is a " pilotless " aircraft , consistent with the intent of the drafters of Article 8 . ( emphasis mine ) . So , the authors of the 1944 Chicago convention most probably had radio controlled aircraft in mind .
You will hardly find anything complete on the web as : at the time of the expansion a bunch of years ago , you did n't have that much computer assisted medias to produce representative documents . most accurate documents are inside old books you can only access at specialized libraries , rare copies owned privately or museums . Because Charles de Gaulle is a french airport , you 'll likely to find what you 're looking for in french ! I do have an Air France magazine with Charles de Gaulle history til 2002 , and another dedicated to the Terminal 2F extension , but because those are copyrighted materials , I ca n't post them here . Sorry . Though , you can head to the following sites : <URL> ( video - if you do n't mind quality of the era ) <URL> ( a couple pictures ) <URL> ( dedicated copy of the above ) <URL> ( one small cropped overview from a book - bear in mind that most relevant structures of the airport is inside that picture and everything around are empty areas ) Basically , you only had the Terminal 1 , and one runway . Airport name was " Paris Nord " before becoming " Roissy-en-France " , then finally called " Charles de Gaulle " just before inauguration ( 8 of March , 1974 ) . And initial planned extensions were identical copies of the Terminal 1 all other the place including where T2 and T3 are today . Sorry , I ca n't post a plan from the Air France book , but it 's rather similar to the one you can spot in the video above . There are also rare documents you could retrieve from old magazines issued at the time ( Air &amp; Cosmos to name the one I know of ) or magazines like EntreVoisins ( used to collect them at Maison de l'Environnement , Athis-Mons , near Delta Museum ) which sometimes raises issues about noise pollution from Paris Airport platforms ( comparative maps of the airport through the years )
All jets require a type rating . Therefore you do n't need the complex endorsement directly ( other than needing it likely for your commercial checkride , which requires a complex aircraft ) . The historical training progression is : simple prop , complex single engine prop ( requiring the complex endorsement ) , high performance ( 200 hp + , though this one is sometimes not gotten ) , light multi-engine props , and then finally moving into heavier turboprops and then jets which require type ratings . Note , my answer is FAA specific , and other agencies might have different rules/interpretations for this issue .
No , they were not designed separately . They were designed by people who had all participated in collaborations before . The origin was the research into unstable configurations performed by <URL> in Germany in the late 1970s by a modified F-104 , the control configured vehicle <URL> . <URL> F-104 CCV ( picture <URL> ) As a result , MBB designed the Taktisches Kampfflugzeug 90 ( or TKF-90 ) , the first design of an unstable delta canard which promised unmatched maneuverability . Since Germany could not afford to develop the aircraft all by itself , collaborations were started with both Dassault and BAe , so that French and British engineers could learn of the advantages of this layout . <URL> MBB TKF-90 concept ( picture <URL> ) First , BAe collaborated with MBB and joined the TKF-90 design , resulting in the European Collaborative Fighter proposal , only to continue on their own with two delta canard designs of their own , P. 106 and P. 110 . P. 106 had one engine and one vertical tail while P. 110 had two of both , like the TKF-90 . P. 106 was rejected by the RAF , but went into a collaboration with Saab and eventually became the JAS-39 . To be fair , the first company to build and fly a closely-coupled delta canard was Saab with their <URL> . Saab has a long history of innovative work , beginning with ejection seats in 1942 and sweptback jets in 1948 . <URL> Saab 37 Viggen ( picture <URL> ) . In contrast to the TKF-90 it was an aerodynamically stable layout . Meanwhile , MBB collaborated with Dassault in the Future European Fighter Aircraft ( FEFA ) program , so the French side learned of the advantages of a delta canard . Eventually , the French wanted less air-to-air capabilities and a smaller aircraft for better export chances , and the remaining FEFA partners continued in the European Fighter Aircraft ( EFA ) program which resulted in the EF-2000 , while Dassault went it alone with the Rafale . The EF-2000 is hampered to this day by this heritage . Its wing area was decreed by <URL> and <URL> to be no more than 50 m ² when a 60 m ² wing would had resulted in a much more capable design . Next , the British engineers insisted on a straight leading edge , ignorant of the fact that only a cranked delta would provide good post-stall pitch characteristics . They also refused to accept a <URL> , and the German side could only rescue the " smiling intake " in order to reduce the radar cross section of the EF-2000 somewhat . <URL> " Smiling intake " of the EF-2000 ( picture <URL> ) . The curved contour avoids corner reflections of electromagnetic waves . And do n't get me started on the odd location of the airbrake : On the center fuselage where it is least effective at high angle of attack and will blanket the single vertical tail . Designed by a committee with too many British engineers .
Much longer take-off distance and less endurance , but higher speed at all altitudes with jets . The performance advantage of jets widened with increasing altitude and resulted in a higher service ceiling . Both the <URL> and the <URL> would fly at least 100 km/h faster than any propeller airplane , and the Ar-234 could fly reconnaissance missions over France and England in complete impunity . A Me-262 test variant ( 262 V9 ) with a low-profile canopy reached 600 MPH in level flight . This gave jets the possibility to break off combat at will . They could only be engaged with success when they were flying for a landing with empty tanks or by chance , when the jet pilot was unaware of his opponent . Since the Me-262 was designed to intercept bomber formations , it was not suited for dogfights . The <URL> , on the other hand , was evaluated in 1943 against a FW-190 and would easily outturn the propeller aircraft , so this was not an engine-related characteristic .
All parts of an airliner 's horizontal surface move , not just the rear part . The rear part , called an elevator , can move much faster and is for maneuvering . The forward part , called a ( trimmable ) stabilizer , is for trimming and moves slowly . It is moved in response to changes in loading , speed or flap settings and positions the tail surface such that only small continuous elevator deflections are needed . It does n't need to move fast - high load factors would upset the passengers and overload the structure . <URL> A330 port tailplane root ( picture <URL> ) . Note the markings which show the range of incidence angles covered by the trimmable stabilizer . Benefits of a stabilizer-elevator configuration : Camber : The elevator deflection changes the camber of the airfoil of the tail surface and makes the production of the intended lift change more efficient . If the elevator deflection is supposed to create a downforce , negative camber is produced and vice versa . This reduces the drag which is created in order to maneuver the aircraft . Lower control forces : By moving a smaller surface , less hydraulics power , and on small aircraft , less muscle power is needed for the same moment change than with a full-flying tail or all-moving surface . Makes sense , right ? Better tailoring of the hinge moment derivatives : Two effects are important for getting the control forces right : The change in hinge moment over deflection angle ( $ c _ { r \ eta } $ ) , and the change in hinge moment over angle of attack ( $ c _ { r \ alpha } $ ) . With tabs , the right elevator hinge position , nose shape and control horns , both can be tailored individually , while a full-flying tail or all-moving surface will give the designer less freedom to manipulate both independently . Note that full-flying tails only emerged with hydraulic controls , because only those systems can manage the control forces of all-moving control surfaces at high speed . <URL> Horn balance and overhang balance on control surfaces ( picture <URL> ) Benefits of a full-flying tail surface By avoiding a contour break due to a flap deflection , all-moving control surfaces can avoid the shocks which would otherwise occur at high subsonic speed . This is their main benefit for combat aircraft . At supersonic speed , the uncambered surface will produce less drag , so for supersonic speed the all-moving control surface is more efficient . By moving all of the tail surface at high speed , an all-moving control surface will produce the highest rate of moment change over time possible . To produce also the highest sustained moment change , however , it needs to be larger than a comparable stabilizer-elevator combination because it forfeits the benefits of variable camber . The all-moving control surface has no gaps which could add radar reflections , allowing for a more stealthy design . Lower mechanical complexity . This is somewhat offset by the need for much beefier hydraulics .
Your observation about roll inertia is correct : Winglets add proportionally more roll inertia for their small increase in L/D , and this increase exists only for the higher range of lift coefficients . At low lift coefficients ( think cruise ) , when the induced drag is low , they add more friction drag and reduce the L/D overall . There are three aspects to maneuverability : How quickly can you accelerate into a roll ? Here the added inertia of winglets reduces roll acceleration How high is the maximum sustained turn rate ? This is determined by the maximum lift at zero sink rate , and here winglets are helping . Especially when mounted to low aspect ratio wings . How high is the maximum turn rate ? Now only lift counts , and the increased drag is compensated by an increased sink rate . Again , winglets help a little , but less than with the sustained turn rate . Now look at the time any fighter will spend around 1g ( hint : Something close to 100 % ) and how much is spent at high lift coefficients , like when turning tightly in air combat . Winglets would help in the turn ( and I think Ethan 's opinion is wrong ) , but be a source of drag for the rest of the mission . Adding winglets would require to increase the fuel volume to prevent a reduction in flight time and range . Normally , winglets are only used on highly loaded , high-aspect ratio wings when their L/D at a rather high lift coefficient needs to be pushed up even more . Highly maneuverable configurations are less concerned with single-percentage increases in L/D for a small part of the flight , and in order to improve turn performance , increasing wing span is much more effective . But that increases roll inertia and roll damping , so fighters use low-aspect ratio wings and compensate their higher drag in a turn with more powerful engines . Note that the trend in fighter aspect ratios went down with the improving thrust-to-weight ratio of jet engines . Now that is the reason why you do n't see winglets on fighter jets : They would lower L/D for most of the flight . To perform the same mission , the fighter without winglets can be made smaller . But let 's make no mistake : Low aspect ratio configurations gain the most from winglets : They were essential on the <URL> to give it enough L/D for a successful flare .
Just to roll around on " unimproved " airfields ( grass/dirt/gravel strips ) , the biggest thing planes need is simply a decent set of tires : <URL> This MiG-29UN trainer shows off the fairly beefy main tires put on these planes specifically to allow them to more easily roll over minor imperfections in the runway/taxiway surface , including dirt/gravel/grass strips ( though here it 's landing on a traditional asphalt/concrete surface ) . Compare these to the relatively small gear wheels and low-aspect rubber on the similarly-sized F-16 : <URL> Now , your question oversimplifies things , because " foreign object debris " or FOD is in fact a primary danger of unpaved airstrips for jets , and this danger has to be accounted for in the design . Here 's the main reason the MiG-29 can take off from dirt : <URL> <URL> MiG-29s and similarly-minded Su-27s , and their variants , have special doors to close off the lower intakes normally used in flight , instead drawing in air through the gill-like ports over the top of the wing strakes . This prevents the engine from ingesting dust , rocks , birds , rodents , etc on takeoff and landing . This engine protection system , while effective , adds mechanical complexity and weight which U.S. designers and military brass have generally thought unnecessary given that requirements rarely include the ability to operate from unimproved strips . Most U.S. fighters in the jet age , therefore , have had to operate from airbases with some form of paved runway surface ( and the U.S. military actually has higher standards for runway surface quality than most international airports ) . The U.S. arsenal does , however , have several aircraft that are specifically designed to operate from rudimentary airstrips at forward bases . These designs avoid FOD damage primarily by keeping the engines up as high as the design will allow . For instance , the A-10 's two engines are on pods angled up on the fuselage between the wings and tail for a variety of reasons including FOD avoidance : <URL> Most of the other designs in the Western arsenal that can do this are high-wing designs with wing-mounted engines , which keep them out of the dust produced by takeoff and landing in a similar fashion . Here are a C-130 and C-17 landing at an Afghanistan forward base : <URL> <URL> The Harrier is a notable exception to this general strategy by Western designers of just keeping the engines out of any debris cloud . While it 's probably not done routinely , a Harrier can set down just about anywhere , and as this picture shows , it ingests no small amount of dust in the process : <URL>
The Mosquito was a great aircraft but it was not faster than Germany 's Messerschmitt ME-109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 piston powered fighter aircraft . It also did not successfully compete with the jet powered Messerschmitt Me 262 . The limited numbers of ME-262 were probably the only reason the Mosquito could survive in the same airspace . On 26 July 1944 the first aircraft to be shot down by a ME-262 was in fact a Mosquito : <URL> " a 262 A-1a , caught and severely damaged the Mosquito in a pursuit . The Mosquito , which managed to escape into cloud , later crashed at its destination airfield in Italy , and the airframe was written off "

How or when can the 250 KIAS speed limit below 10,000 ft be exceeded ?
Not a local thing at all ! In Australia , it is extremely common to hear , especially for aircraft on departure . Listening to LiveATC , particularly Sydney International Approach/Departure ( YSSY ) you will quite often hear ATC give an aircraft permission to exceed 250KIAS below 10,000 ft. Qantas 123 : Approach , QFA123 , with you passing 2,300 , climbing 5,000 . . Sydney Approach : QFA123 , Identified , Climb FL240 , cancel speed restrictions below 10,000 . . There are a number of reasons this is used . The first , I have already hinted to in the example radio call above . Departures : It is extremely common to hear ATC cancel speed restrictions on departing aircraft . This gives better separation for aircraft departing in the same direction . For example , one of the busiest sectors in the world is Sydney - Melbourne Australia . The common SID 's out of Sydney for Melbourne are the DEENA4 WOL transition and the WOL1 Departure , depending on operational runway . As a large amount of aircraft use these departures , the further the lead aircraft can get on the SID prior to the trailing aircraft becoming airborne , the better . Arrivals : Again , using Sydney , they receive a large amount of Regional Turbo-Prop traffic ( Dash 8-Q300 / Q400 , Saab 340B , BE350 ) . You will commonly hear Approach cancel speed restrictions on these aircraft on decent so they can give them more space on the approach . They land reasonably slower than a B747/A380 , so the more room , the better . Another reason is simple . These guys are operating commercial operations , hence faster is better , especially on descent . So if there is no or low traffic in the TMA , ATC will commonly release the speed restriction on aircraft to accommodate the company operations .
FLC mode maintains airspeed during a climb or descent , while VS mode maintains a specific vertical speed . Often air traffic controllers will request that you " maintain 250 knots in the descent " or something to that effect , which is much easier to achieve when using Flight Level Change . As another answer points out , by maintaining airspeed , climbs are made safer as the autopilot will not attempt to maintain a rate of climb regardless of whether or not the airspeed is safe . FLC mode is typically only available in advanced autopilots , and as far as I know they need to connect to an Air Data Computer to get the necessary information . How to use FLC would depend on the equipment available to you : aircraft with auto throttle will maintain speed and an appropriate rate of descent automatically . for aircraft without auto throttle you 'd set your target altitude , enable FLC , adjust your target speed if needed , and set your throttle for climb or descent to maintain the desired altitude change rate . I 'm referencing the Garmin GFC700 as it 's the only autopilot I 've used with FLC mode , but I imagine the same steps and rules would apply .
It 's apparently loosely based on <URL> and like in the actual incident , I do n't think he deliberately inverts the plane . In the actual event , the horizontal stabilizer gets jammed in an extreme position thus forcing the plane to invert . Now if it were possible to fly a commercial airplane that big inverted , Alaska Airlines too would 've landed safely eventually ( which did n't happen , despite the pilots trying to fly it upside down according to the CVR transcripts ) .
Do stealth airplanes need to limit contrail generation ? Not just stealth aircraft , most military aircraft are required to avoid contrails . Contrails form due to moisture in the aircraft 's exhaust . <URL> is NOT to fly in regions of air that support contrail formation . <URL> which is used by the B-2 stealth bomber uses LIDAR ( light detection and ranging ) to differentiate contrails from clouds and tells the pilot to change his altitude as/when necessary . That being said , it is essential to remember that though contrails are visible to the naked human eye they are NOT visible to Radars . Ergo , until the stealth aircraft is really close ( assuming it is on a SEAD/DEAD mission ) one can not see the contrails and by the time they do , it is too late . Moreover , stealth aircraft generally operate during night when contrails are less visible . Stealth aircraft have low visibility on radar . Not necessarily . VHF radar should be able to detect them at long range . Moreover , RCS of aircraft is a complex phenomenon , depending on many stuff ( frequency , aspect angle , polarization of signal etc ) . You will never find a " static " figure for this .
The icing occurs due to the presence of supercooled liquid droplets . From <URL> : The condition most favorable for very hazardous icing is the presence of many large , supercooled water drops ... Thus , heaviest icing usually will be found at or slightly above the freezing level where temperature is never more than a few degrees below freezing . For ice to form on the aircraft , the following conditions are required : The presence of liquid water i.e. rain or cloud droplets . The temperature at aircraft structure should be at or below freezing point . Now , as the altitude increases , temperature decreases . Using this , the best way to avoid these conditions would be to either : Fly above the altitude where the temperature is below -15 degrees , where supercooled water drops are not present ( they would 've frozen already ) , or Fly below the altitude where the temperature is above freezing point , where the water droplets , if present are not supercooled .
Before we get started , I should mention that the most basic constant-speed propellers were driven by balancing air pressure and centrifugal force . The blades were shaped in such a way , or equipped with a counterweight that would cause the blade to intrinsically move to a shallow pitch . However , when air was moved over the blade , it would begin to overpower the counterweight and push the blade to a higher pitch . It 's a pretty ingenious design that meant that the prop would automatically be at a high RPM when the plane was moving slowly ( takeoff , landing , climbs ) , and would automatically move to a higher pitch when the plane sped up for cruise . There is even a single-bladed propeller that utilized this design very efficiently for light aircraft . The problem is that this type of propeller is not pilot-adjustable , and I am assuming you are wondering about adjustable props , so that 's what we 'll talk about from here on . In the first picture , observe that the pilot valve is resting directly on the flyweights ( separated by a bearing ) . The second picture better depicts the valve system . So we see that the speeder spring is pushing down on the top of the pilot valve 's shaft , which is in turn resting on the flyweights . First off , the flyweights are turned by the crankshaft , so any change in engine RPM is immediately reacted to . There are a few ways that the propeller is attached to the piston , and a rack and pinon type gear system is common and easy to imagine . The rack is fixed to the piston so that when it moves , the prop blade 's pinion gear is rotated and thus the blade is rotated . Another common type uses a peg that is offset from the center of the blade 's circular base . When the piston moves , it pushes or pulls on the peg and because the peg is offset it causes the blade to twist . Overspeed : When your airspeed increases . When the RPMs increase , the centrifugal force causes the flyweights to want to spread apart in order to conserve momentum . Because they 're in an L shape and have a hinge in the corner , this causes the lower part to rise up , pulling the pilot valve up and compressing the speeder spring . When the pilot valve is raised , pressurized oil from the pump is allowed to flow into the prop hub through a tube that passes through the center of the hub piston . The oil fills a cavity in front of the piston , pushing it backwards . The prop blade is rotated to a higher pitch ( closer to feather ) which slows the engine RPM . When the RPM is reduced , the flyweights will be under less centrifugal force , and the speeder spring will push them back to equilibrium ( on-speed ) , pushing the pilot valve back down to block the hub oil tube from gaining or losing oil . Underspeed : When your airspeed decreases . When the RPMs decrease , there is less centrifugal force acting on the flyweights . Due to their shape as described earlier , they are no longer able to push up on the speeder spring with the same force as before , so the compressed spring will begin to expand . This brings the top of the flyweights in , and their bottoms down . When their bottoms move down , the pilot valve moves down as well and unblocks the hub oil tube . Positive oil pressure in the hub and the blades ' built-in tendency to want to move to a low pitch pushes the oil out of the hub and back into the oil system . The piston moves forward and the blades rotate to a low-pitch condition . The flyweights do not necessarily return to equilibrium , especially if you manually set the spring to maximum compression with the prop lever : you want the prop to stay at minimum pitch no matter what . Loss of oil pressure : Oil pressure is constantly pushing against the bottom of the pilot valve , trying to force it upwards . The speeder spring is resisting , and while the flyweights are on-speed , the whole system is in equilibrium with the valve blocking the hub tube . When you lose oil pressure , that pressure is no longer holding the valve up and the speeder spring will win , pushing the valve down and allowing the oil to flow out of the hub . This resets the prop to the low-pitch climb setting , giving us maximum power because that 's more useful than maximum speed in the emergency situation that is probably about to occur . So why do we do this ? All propellers are set at a pitch . Theoretically , a propeller is pitched to move forward a certain distance each revolution , just like a screw moving through wood . But unlike wood , air is fluid and difficult to grip . If you imagine screwing a screw into a board , the only way to make it go in faster is to turn it faster . This is because the screw 's pitch is fixed . If you could space out the rungs on the screw ( increase the pitch ) the screw would move through the wood faster but it would become much harder to turn . An airplane 's propeller works much the same way . When we first take off , we need to impart maximum power into the air and it does n't matter if we do n't move forward very far for each revolution , because we 're not going very
There are generally two ways of determining the ground speed from within the aircraft . The first is by using an inertial navigation system . This consists of a number of accelerometers and gyroscopes that measure all accelerations and rotations of the aircraft throughout a flight . By mathematically integrating all measurements this navigation system is able to compute the speed and position of the aircraft at any time . The accuracy will degrade over time but ground speed is usually not far off , otherwise position would be far off very soon . The second method uses external radio signals . Nowadays this is mostly GPS , but ground speed is also determined by using a number of VOR ( VHF Omnidirection Range ) and/or DME ( Distance Measuring Equipment ) stations . These navigation beacons are widely available over most continents . A navigation computer would select the right set of beacons and by analysing the rate of change of the beacon bearings / distances the aircraft 's speed can be determined . Modern navigation systems combine all these methods into a one solution . GPS , inertial navigation and DME measurements are then fused mathematically together to obtain a highly accurate and robust position and ground speed .
The combat advantage of fighters ( as opposed to heavier-payload bombers ) is their maneuverability , therefore a missile delivery restriction such as g-limit ( think Sidewinder heat-seeker in a dogfight ) or attitude would unnecessarily restrict their efficacy . As a Vietnam-era fighter and attack pilot I fired both unguided ( aim and shoot rockets ) and guided ( target lock-on and shoot ) missiles , and neither had associated attitude limits . Missiles that fall clear of the weapon station before rocket-motor ignition ( such as the TV-guided Walleye or the optically-pilot-guided Bullpup ) are obviously restricted from negative g to ensure safe separation from the airplane , i.e. , negative g release from an under-wing weapon station would all but guarantee impact with the airplane .
No , for two reasons : Speed of sound is always relative to the material the sound propagates in ; it moves faster through denser media , such as the aluminum structure of the aircraft itself . The aircraft 's structure moves with the aircraft , so the vibrations of the jet engines will be transmitted to the cockpit/cabin at the same speed as when the airplane were flying subsonic . The air inside the cockpit is still , and so sound within this local bubble is unaffected by the speed of the bubble itself ( and so sound can travel faster than sound ) . If this were n't true then radios and other cockpit sound sources like alarms would be inaudible at supersonic speeds , which would be a major safety hazard and tactical disadvantage to supersonic flight . You actually do n't even have any significant aural cues inside the cockpit that you 've exceeded Mach 1 ; you have to rely on your airspeed gauge to tell you .
When there are several airports close to each other , a single ATC , formally known as Terminal Control Center may service all airports . The airspace boundaries and altitudes assigned to a Terminal Control Center , which vary widely from airport to airport , are based on factors such as traffic flows , neighboring airports and terrain . <URL> is an example of a large and complex Terminal Control Center . Its service area is up to 20,000 feet and out to 100 nautical miles . It controls : six London airports one Royal Air Force station provides en-route services to other aircraft that entered its airspace Another example can be found with <URL> and <URL> , which have adjacent control zones that share a common boundary west to east and have an overlaying class C TMA airspace up to FL100 . Both airports share the same TMA controller/approach sector : Image Source : www.skyvector.com FAA is implementing a new airspace system which will increase efficiencies at metropolitan areas with complex air traffic flows . This system , known as <URL> is introducing the concept of a <URL> : In FAA parlance , metroplex refers to a system of airports in close proximity and their shared airspace that serve one or more major cities . A metroplex has at least one , but often two or more major commercial airports .
You kind of have two questions in one - When can I call Clearance Delivery to get my clearance ? and How long is that clearance good for ? <URL> - the local controllers will usually have your clearance 30 minutes before your scheduled departure . Sometimes you can get this information a little earlier yourself - the new Flight Service tools like <URL> can give you expected clearance and flight plan routing information based on what you filed , if the ATC computer already knows what it 's going to do with your flight . <URL> , and you can do the same thing yourself with the Lockheed-Martin tools with a few more manual steps . You still need to talk to the controllers but if you know what they 're going to say it makes that conversation faster ! The second part can go one of two ways : The point of the " void time " is that the ATC system is reserving a spot in the system for you up until that specific time . After that ATC is going to let other aircraft use the airspace they were holding for you ( they may allow someone to make an instrument approach to the airport you 're leaving from , for example ) . This is used a lot for non-towered fields where you have no local controller to talk to . Clearances from Clearance Delivery at a towered field can include a void time , but they generally do n't because they assume you 're in the plane and ready to go at or around the time you call in , and you have local controllers to talk to if you have a problem during the run-up or something which delays your departure . Basically the clearance is good until someone tells you otherwise in that situation . The tool that gets used at towered fields more often is : You 've been issued a clearance , but you ca n't execute it until the tower has coordinated you a spot in the airspace . This is generally more efficient than reserving airspace with a clearance and void time when there are controllers to talk to , and if everything is working well your release should be ready right around the time you 're ready to take the runway for departure .
$ V _ { MO } $ is a " maximum operating speed " . It is one of many " <URL> " defined for an aircraft that limit operation at various flight phases . All V-speeds are <URL> ¹ . The $ V _ { MO } $ is the maximum permitted speed for the aircraft . This includes a safety margin , so pilots can reasonably fly near that speed . Exceeding it is not immediately dangerous , but as it reduces safety margins , is an incident that should be investigated . There is another speed , $ V _ { NE } $ , the " never exceed speed " , which is somewhat higher and which marks the point where things start to get dangerous . When the aircraft exceeds $ V _ { NE } $ , <URL> may develop that will destroy the aircraft and/or important parts may break off as the <URL> becomes higher than what they are designed for . Also these speeds have their <URL> counterparts ² , $ M _ { MO } $ and $ M _ { NE } $ . At high altitude , the same indicated airspeed ( IAS ) corresponds to much higher true air-speed , since indicated airspeed decreases with pressure , while the same Mach number corresponds to slightly lower true air-speed , since speed of sound only depends on temperature . So at high altitudes , the Mach limits are reached first while at low altitudes the IAS limits are . Exceeding the $ M _ { NE } $ has different effect , though also dangerous . Above that speed flow separation occurs above the wing due to supersonic speed of the flow . This leads to loss of lift and significant down-pitching moment ( a.k.a <URL> ) , which aircraft not designed for supersonic flight may not have enough elevator authority to compensate . ¹ The airspeeds are given as <URL> , the speed measured by pitot probes , so they can be directly compared to the indication in cockpit ( aircraft with <URL> ( " glass cockpit " ) usually correct those measurement errors that can be estimated , showing so called <URL> ) . However it may not be just a simple number but may be tabulated depending on other parameters . In particular $ V _ { NE } $ and $ V _ { MO } $ may depend on altitude , because <URL> depends on <URL> and at lower density ( due to lower pressure at altitude ) the same TAS corresponds to lower <URL> / <URL> / <URL> . ² Mach number is true airspeed as fraction of speed of sound . In this case the limiting factor is formation of shockwaves due to the flow speed locally exceeding speed of sound around some parts of the aircraft .
The key in holding the same speed as your wingman or the other aircraft is not to find the " perfect " throttle position , the key is to slightly adjust the throttle . When you look at cockpit-videos of those formation pilots ( like <URL> - move the camera to the throttle , it 's a 360-degree video ) , you can see that they are constantly moving the throttle . They almost never stick the throttle at one position . In that way , they can slightly adjust the speed and stay in formation with the wingman for a long time . While flying in close formation at high speed , it 's the same . Little adjustments of the throttle helps the pilot to keep the same speed as the wingman-aircraft . Flaps are not used in high-speed-flying because they can only operate below a maximum speed , otherwise they could get damaged . By using the air-brake , the handling of the aircraft changes , therefore the air-brake is not used very often while flying in formation . tl ; dr : Skill
This answer applies to FAA certified aircraft . For experimentals , there are really no restrictions . I mean , you can build the airplane from scratch so replace what you want ... but for certified aircraft : The following is copied and pasted from the AOPA website : FAR Part 43 specifies who may do what to an aircraft in the way of maintenance , repair or alteration . It requires that only properly certified mechanics work on aircraft and " okay " them for return to service . However , it does allow preventive maintenance to be performed by a certificated pilot , holding at least a Private certificate , on an aircraft owned or operated by that pilot , provided the aircraft is not used in commercial service . The responsibilities for a pilot performing preventive maintenance are very similar to those imposed on the certificated mechanic performing other duties . The FARs require that anyone who works on an aircraft must have the appropriate maintenance and service information available . This means quite simply that before you set about performing preventive maintenance items on your airplane , you must first have the proper maintenance manuals available . A list of " preventive maintenance " allowed is specifically listed in FAR 43 appendix A ( 4 ) c and is copied below : Preventive maintenance . Preventive maintenance is limited to the following work , provided it does not involve complex assembly operations : ( 1 ) Removal , installation , and repair of landing gear tires . ( 2 ) Replacing elastic shock absorber cords on landing gear . ( 3 ) Servicing landing gear shock struts by adding oil , air , or both . ( 4 ) Servicing landing gear wheel bearings , such as cleaning and greasing . ( 5 ) Replacing defective safety wiring or cotter keys . ( 6 ) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates , cowlings , and fairings . ( 7 ) Making simple fabric patches not requiring rib stitching or the removal of structural parts or control surfaces . In the case of balloons , the making of small fabric repairs to envelopes ( as defined in , and in accordance with , the balloon manufacturers ' instructions ) not requiring load tape repair or replacement . ( 8 ) Replenishing hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic reservoir . ( 9 ) Refinishing decorative coating of fuselage , balloon baskets , wings tail group surfaces ( excluding balanced control surfaces ) , fairings , cowlings , landing gear , cabin , or cockpit interior when removal or disassembly of any primary structure or operating system is not required . ( 10 ) Applying preservative or protective material to components where no disassembly of any primary structure or operating system is involved and where such coating is not prohibited or is not contrary to good practices . ( 11 ) Repairing upholstery and decorative furnishings of the cabin , cockpit , or balloon basket interior when the repairing does not require disassembly of any primary structure or operating system or interfere with an operating system or affect the primary structure of the aircraft . ( 12 ) Making small simple repairs to fairings , nonstructural cover plates , cowlings , and small patches and reinforcements not changing the contour so as to interfere with proper air flow . ( 13 ) Replacing side windows where that work does not interfere with the structure or any operating system such as controls , electrical equipment , etc. . ( 14 ) Replacing safety belts . ( 15 ) Replacing seats or seat parts with replacement parts approved for the aircraft , not involving disassembly of any primary structure or operating system . ( 16 ) Trouble shooting and repairing broken circuits in landing light wiring circuits . ( 17 ) Replacing bulbs , reflectors , and lenses of position and landing lights . ( 18 ) Replacing wheels and skis where no weight and balance computation is involved . ( 19 ) Replacing any cowling not requiring removal of the propeller or disconnection of flight controls . ( 20 ) Replacing or cleaning spark plugs and setting of spark plug gap clearance . ( 21 ) Replacing any hose connection except hydraulic connections . ( 22 ) Replacing prefabricated fuel lines . ( 23 ) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements . ( 24 ) Replacing and servicing batteries . ( 25 ) Cleaning of balloon burner pilot and main nozzles in accordance with the balloon manufacturer 's instructions . ( 26 ) Replacement or adjustment of nonstructural standard fasteners incidental to operations . ( 27 ) The interchange of balloon baskets and burners on envelopes when the basket or burner is designated as interchangeable in the balloon type certificate data and the baskets and burners are specifically designed for quick removal and installation . ( 28 ) The installations of anti-misfueling devices to reduce the diameter of fuel tank filler openings provided the specific de
A higher configuration number indicates that the flaps/slats are extended by an higher amount . In turns this means that for the same angle of attack the wings will produce higher lift ( and drag ) in the higher configuration . You achieve take-off when the lift is at least equal to the weight of the aircraft , and with higher flap/slat deflection you will have sufficient lift even when the nose is relatively low on the horizon , leaving plenty of margin against a tailstrike . On the other hand , if you are using a low configuration , the flaps/slats will be mostly retracted , and you will need a higher AoA to produce sufficient lift , meaning that you have to raise the nose of the aircraft more , leaving less margin against a tailstrike .
You have almost solved the problem yourself . The <URL> does not help you because , for some reason , it assumes <URL> to be equal to UTC . For your problem , LMT needs to be for 85 ° of East longitude . So , ignore that website and let 's move on . For every degree of longitude , you calculate 4 minutes of difference from UTC . You have already correctly calculated the LMT difference from UTC for 85 ° E : First of all , what I 've done is converting longitude into time as follows : $ $ t = 85 \ cdot4 = 340 \ hspace { 1mm } min = 5h \ hspace { 1mm } 40m $ $ This leaves you with the question of whether to add or subtract this difference , as you stated : But then , in order to compute the UTC time , what do I have to do , either adding up this time to the current LMT or subtract it ( and what is the reason ) ? Let me start with the reason -- the explanation of why we want to either add or subtract the difference between LMT and UTC -- and then give you the solution . LMT can be thought of as roughly equivalent to time based on the Sun 's position . It is not equivalent to that , which is <URL> , but it is related . Keeping that approximation in mind , consider the difference in time between when the sun reaches solar noon over Delhi , and when the sun reaches solar noon over London . As the earth rotates , the sun reaches solar noon first over Delhi , and then , a few hours later , over London . Thus you know that UTC will be a few hours behind Delhi LMT . This means that you need to subtract the calculated difference between LMT and UTC . Another way to put this is : LMT for East longitude is ahead of UTC ( subtract the difference to find UTC ) , and LMT for West longitude is behind UTC ( add the difference to find UTC ) . Thus a more proper way to perform your calculation mathematically would be to properly incorporate the negative sign : $ $ t = -85 \ cdot4 = -340 \ hspace { 1mm } min = -5 h \ hspace { 1mm } 40m $ $ Therefore , if the LMT in Delhi ( LON = 85 ° E ) is 17:45 , then : $ $ UTC = 12h05m $ $
The specific reasons may be specific to each propeller/engine combination , but in general it seems to be related to stresses . According to this <URL> on page 2-2 : Stabilized ground operation between 400 and 1,150 propeller RPM is prohibited . Operation between 0 and 400 propeller RPM is permissible only with propeller feathered . STABILIZED GROUND OPERATION WITHIN THE PROPELLER RESTRICTED RPM RANGE CAN GENERATE HIGH PROPELLER STRESSES AND RESULT IN PROPELLER FAILURE AND LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT . This is probably due to the frequency of the aerodynamic forces at those RPM 's resonating with the frequency of the propeller , and getting amplified to unsafe stress levels . This is called ground resonance and is also an issue with helicopters . In addition to over-stressing the propeller blades , it can also affect the fatigue life . There is also a discussion in <URL> , and it is mentioned in <URL> . As voretaq7 mentions , fixed-pitch propellers have similar restrictions for similar reasons . Some engines include a damper that removes this restriction by damping out the resonance .
When using an airfoil with a sharp leading edge in subsonic regime , you need to adapt the angle of attack so that the <URL> occurs right on the sharp edge . At every flight condition there should be an AoA which achieves this . Higher AoA , and the stagnation point is too low . To low AoA , and the stagnation point is too high . However flight conditions change frequently , so the required AoA changes dynamically as well . Since AoA also drives the lift and lift is the priority in a pilot 's mind ( he wants to keep flying after all ) , stagnation point will only occasionally match the leading edge . During flight the AoA will often fail to match the stagnation point , let 's say with too high AoA , separation would occur below the leading edge ( on the " intrados " ) . This is the only good illustration I could find : <URL> Source : The University of Sydney ( Australia ) The stagnation point is at the tip of the only grey line that stops right on the black plate . Basically all incoming flow between these leading edge and stagnation point ( unfortunately no line shows this on the picture ) will follow this trajectory : Incoming at high speed onto the airfoil , below leading edge , going towards the stagnation point , but aims just slightly higher up . The stagnation point is the point of highest pressure , so the incoming flow slows down Comes a point where the slowdown is sufficient to actually reverse the flow which now shoots up along the surface towards the leading edge , now driven by the pressure from stagnation point Arriving at the leading edge from below the flow needs to do a U-turn around the leading edge to keep following the wing shape and flow towards the " extrados " and keep on with its life . Therein lies the problem : when finally arriving at the leading edge , the air has non-zero speed ( zero speed only occurs at stagnation point , of which there is only one ) , but must instantly reverse it . Physics says nope , and you get a large leading edge vortex to smooth the motion out . Unfortunately that is also called a flow separation bubble , which may became a stall . This is : bad for performance ( drag ) bad for safety ( stallable ) bad for comfort ( vibration from the eddies ) bad for structure ( vibration fatigue ) Why does it only happen in subsonic flight ? At supersonic speeds , information can not travel back on the flow using the same pressure gradient trick , once the air is on the intrados/extrados , it stays there , and can not back up the other way . So no ' adaptation ' is possible , regardless of AoA . Why use rounded leading edge to remedy this in subsonic ? With a rounded edge , the U-turn is not so sharp , it is actually manageable for the air . This means you 'll not always have flow separation , so you 're safe . The rounder , the easier larger the range of AoA stay " adapted " . TL ; DR It 's possible to fly subsonic with sharp leading edge , but less safe and lower performance . The key is AoA adaptation .
The Pilot Monitoring ( PM ) or Second In Command ( SIC ) can not log the approach . FAA has <URL> : You then ask if , for the purposes of maintaining instrument currency , an instrument approach on the above flight flown by the PIC can be logged as an instrument approach by the SIC . The answer is no . As the SIC you have not " performed " the approach as contemplated by FAR 61.57 ( c ) because you were not the sole manipulator of the controls during the approach .
Fuel is stored in fuel tanks , which typically have two requirements : They must be sealed so as to contain the fuel in all probable flight attitudes . ( Ideally they will keep it contained in a few improbable ones too . ) They must have appropriate plumbing to get the fuel to the engines . ( There are some exceptions to this , but <URL> . ) Anti-Shock bodies are typically not fuel tanks - they meet neither requirement as they are not watertight ( fuel will just pour out of them ) , and there 's no plumbing to get the fuel out of , or for that matter into them . As " Exhibit A " , take a look at the anti-shock bodies around the 787 flap tracks &amp; actuators - Note that the anti-shock body is hollow , but unsealed . Any fuel ( or water ) in here would simply pour out the trailing edge when the flaps are extended . <URL>

What is the difference between " amended " and " revised " clearances ?
An amended clearance usually indicates something has been added to it , but the original content remains the same . Revised usually means the clearance has had modifications to the original content , including possible additions and deletions .

Requirements for a FTD : ( 1 ) Be a full-size replica of instruments , equipment panels , and controls of an aircraft , or set of aircraft , in an open flight deck area or in an enclosed cockpit , including the hardware and software for the systems installed that is necessary to simulate the aircraft in ground and flight operations ; The important mention is it must be a full-size replica of controls and panels .

Although the 737 has grown over the years , the 737 and 757 remain in different size classes . Both models can be <URL> certified , although the 757 is more often used in long flights . At the time the 757 was introduced ( in the 80 's ) , the 737 classic series was current . For the <URL> : Passengers : 146 Length : 119 feet Wingspan : 95 feet Wing area : 1135 sq feet MTOW : 138,000 lb Takeoff distance : 8000 feet Range : 2160 nm Thrust : 2x 23,500 lbf Max fuel : 5,311 US gal The 757 was significantly larger . For the <URL> : Passengers : 200 Length : 155 feet Wingspan : 125 feet Wing area : 1951 sq feet MTOW : 255,000 lb Takeoff distance : 6500 feet Range : 4100 nm Thrust : 2x 43,500 lbf Max fuel : 11,489 US gal The 757 is about 35 feet longer , seats about 50 more passengers , and flies about 2,000 nm further ( roughly twice as far ) . The extra range is due to the larger wingspan and longer fuselage , being able to carry more fuel . For this reason , the 757 is used on longer and busier routes , while the 737 is used on shorter , less busy routes . In the 90 's , both models were updated . The 737 was significantly upgraded , including new wings and a new engine , which increased its efficiency . The 737 NG series eventually included the <URL> model , currently the largest 737 model . Passengers : 180 Length : 138 feet Wingspan : 117 feet Wing area : 1341 sq feet MTOW : 187,700 lb Takeoff distance : 9843 feet Range : 3235 nm Thrust : 2x 28,400 lbf Max fuel : 7,837 US gal The <URL> was also introduced . This was a stretched version of the 757-200 . Passengers : 243 Length : 178 feet Wingspan : 125 feet Wing area : 1951 sq feet MTOW : 272,500 lb Takeoff distance : 7800 feet Range : 3595 nm Thrust : 2x 43,500 lb Max fuel : 11,489 US gal Although the more efficiency gains of the new 737 bring the range up to nearly that of the 757 , the 757 remains significantly larger .
At the absolute simplest , compared to a two-bladed propeller , a slightly smaller three-bladed propeller can produce more thrust at a given RPM , improving climb performance . Because of the smaller diameter , the propeller tips actually travel slower than the equivalent two-bladed design , reducing noise inside and outside the airplane . Hartzell Propeller has a great <URL> . Their explanation of why more blades produces less noise is pretty good : A 2-blade propeller produces two pressure pulses per revolution , where a 3-blade propeller will produce three smaller pulses per revolution ( for the same amount of total thrust ) which is inherently smoother and therefore quieter . The 3-blade propeller will generally have a smaller diameter than the 2-blade propeller that it replaces , which also reduces the tip speed and noise .
Reversible is when there is a direct linkage from controls to control surfaces . For example the cable linkages in a light aircraft up to an MD-80 . Irreversible is when there is a hydraulic power control unit in the way , it can be mechanical or fly-by-wire . And such controls would sometimes need an artificial feel system to relay how much force is being applied . It is found in airplanes that can not be steered by just muscles . A good way to picture it , is what happens if you move an aileron by hand , would the yoke turn as a result or no . Superman might be needed for a 747 's rudder , but still , the rudder pedals wo n't budge . More information <URL> and <URL> . <URL> Source : <URL> Photo shows an unpowered rudder that was swung by the wind , in the cockpit the rudder pedals would show the neutral position , hence irreversible .

Do they generate the same navigation signal ? The DVOR reverses the useage of the two 30Hz signals . However , by also reversing the direction of it 's rotating variable signal it produces exactly the same result in the receiver . The receiver has no " knowledge " that it 's a DVOR as opposed to CVOR it 's receiving and operates as normal . Can they be used by the same receiver , or do VOR receivers need to be specially adapted to DVORs ? Affirm , same receiver . Is one more accurate than the other ? DVOR is more accurate , and more expensive . CVOR is required to be ± 4 ° , however DVOR is required to be ± 1 ° , per Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 10 , Volume 1 . Is one more susceptible to interference than the other ? The DVOR is more practical in crowded areas or where there are tall buildings . However , it 's a big structure - around 100ft in diameter .

According to the <URL> , this definition is in <URL> : ( d ) Commercial aircraft . A " commercial aircraft " is any aircraft transporting passengers and/or cargo for some payment or other consideration , including money or services rendered . [ ... ] ( h ) Private aircraft . A " private aircraft " is any aircraft engaged in a personal or business flight to or from the U.S. which is not : ( 1 ) Carrying passengers and/or cargo for commercial purposes ; ( 2 ) Leaving the U.S. carrying neither passengers nor cargo in order to lade passengers and/or cargo in a foreign area for commercial purposes ; or ( 3 ) Returning to the U.S. carrying neither passengers nor cargo in ballast after leaving with passengers and/or cargo for commercial purposes ;
A PAPI and a VASI are very similar in the the information they provide . The only functional differences between the VASI and PAPI is that the VASI has the red over the white , the PAPI the white actually goes to the right of the red , and the PAPI offers higher precision ( or more glideslopes depending how you look at it a larger airliner with a high cockpit may elect to fly a slightly higher glidepath ) . The concept is the same though . A VASI looks like this : Usage : As the saying goes , Red over White , you 're alright . ( on glidepath ) Red over Red , you 're dead . ( too low ) White over White , you 're out-of-sight ( too high ) A PAPI like this : A regular VASI only offers one glide slope and is designed for an aircraft where the cockpit is n't so high up . However , there is a such thing as two-light PAPI , and a three-bar VASI . So either of them can really be tailored to fit the costs and types of aircraft flying to that airport . In the case of a four-bar PAPI it is higher precision . Since the PAPI systems uses a narrower beam of light you must fly the glide path more precisely than the VASI to stay on the beam . The PAPI , with its extra lights , forewarns you when you are drifting from the desired glide path . <URL> So one red light would indicate slightly above glide slope , two and two would indicate the normal glide slope , and three red lights would indicate slightly below the glide slope on a 4-bar PAPI . A Three bar VASI works in similar fashion except there are only two glide paths with two reds being the lower , two whites the higher .
From " Smart Cockpit " <URL> ( PDF ! ) <URL> AFDS Status Annunciation The following AFDS status annunciations are displayed just above the PFD attitude display : • FLT DIR ( the flight director is ON and the autopilots are not engaged ) • A/P ( the autopilots are engaged ) • LAND 3 ( three autopilots are engaged and operating normally for an automatic landing ) • LAND 2 ( AFDS redundancy is reduced ; in some cases , only two autopilots are available ) • NO AUTOLAND ( the AFDS is unable to make an automatic landing ) . With a LAND 3 indication , the autopilot system level of redundancy is such that a single fault can not prevent the autopilot system from making an automatic landing ( fail operational ) . With a LAND 2 indication , the level of redundancy is such that a single fault can not cause a significant deviation from the flight path ( fail passive ) . An EICAS message is displayed for any fault which limits the capability of the automatic landing system . Aural alerts for EICAS messages not affecting safety of flight are inhibited until after touchdown . Changes in autoland status below 200 feet , other than a transition to NO AUTOLAND status , are inhibited . From Chapter 9 , pages 22-23
From <URL> : Air carrier means a person who undertakes directly by lease , or other arrangement , to engage in air transportation . Commercial operator means a person who , for compensation or hire , engages in the carriage by aircraft in air commerce of persons or property , other than as an air carrier or foreign air carrier or under the authority of Part 375 of this title . Where it is doubtful that an operation is for " compensation or hire " , the test applied is whether the carriage by air is merely incidental to the person 's other business or is , in itself , a major enterprise for profit . To make this more clear <URL> says : 2-128 TYPES OF CERTIFICATES UNDER PART 119 . There are two , basic types of air operator certificates ( AOC ) issued to U.S. applicants who will conduct operations in common carriage . See Table 2-4 , Certification for a summary of certificate requirements . A . An Air Carrier Certificate . This certificate is issued to applicants that plan to conduct interstate , foreign , or overseas transportation , or to carry mail . B . An Operating Certificate . This certificate is issued to applicants that plan to conduct intrastate transportation . From your perspective it is n't a too important distinction . As a commercial pilot all that matters to you is that both air carriers and commercial operators need to have operating certificates . As a commercial pilot you can be hired by someone who has an operating certificate but you can not provide the same services on your own unless you yourself have an operating certificate ( e.g. a charter operator can hire you , but you can not operate a charter service ) . As a commercial pilot you can be paid to act as PIC and can engage in the commercial operations that are excepted from operating certificates in <URL> . You can not act as either an air carrier or a commercial operator without complying with 14 CFR 119 , which requires that you have an operating certificate .
Manufacturers typically plan their aircraft production well into the future , which includes having a buyer lined up for each aircraft , so they will know their position in the production line and have an anticipated date for delivery . An order means that the buyer has agreed to purchase a certain aircraft in the production line , at a certain price . The buyer may cancel , but there will probably be a substantial penalty for doing so . An <URL> <URL> that the manufacturer has reserved a certain aircraft in the production line for the buyer , usually at a certain price . However , the buyer will make the decision on whether to convert this to an " order " at a later date . There is less commitment than with an " order " . A <URL> is even less of a commitment than an " option . " This just means that the buyer has agreed to purchase aircraft at a certain price , but it 's not tied to a specific aircraft at that time . It is becoming more common for buyers to mix these three types of orders , which allows them to have a balance of locking in an aircraft and price with orders , and less risk and commitment with options and purchase options . These can all be canceled , though of course there will be more penalties for breaking a more firm commitment . Buyers may also <URL> , either for their own or the manufacturer 's business reasons . The detailed finances of how much is actually paid for aircraft , and how much it costs to make or break any of these contracts , is generally not disclosed . Negotiations can be very specific to each order . For a rough estimate , <URL> considers that for 6 aircraft worth 45 million per unit , options would be worth 2.3 million each to the airline , or about 5 % . <URL> estimates the down payment on a firm order at 10 to 15 percent , but notes that at least in the case of business and commuter aircraft , depending on market conditions , this may not always be required .
The speed indicator in the cockpit shows indicated airspeed . Indicated airspeed is usually different than GPS speed , due to wind and aerodynamic effects . GPS speed is your speed with respect to the ground . If you are standing on terra firma it reads 0 . If it reads 100 knots you will be 100NM away from where you are now in one hour , so long as you keep flying in a straight line . Airspeed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding air . So if you are standing on terra firma with 20 knots wind blowing in your face , your airspeed will be 20 knots . If you travel at 100 knots airspeed against a 20 knots headwind wind , your ground speed is 80 knots . If you do 100 knots airspeed with 20 knots tailwind , your GPS speed reads 120 knots . But even in calm wind conditions the airspeed indicator will read differently than the GPS speed . This has to do with the way airspeed is measured . Airspeed is measured with a pitot tube . A pitot tube has two pressure measurement ports . One that measures the total pressure $ P_t $ . This port is facing the incoming airflow . The other measures the static pressure $ P$ and is placed perpendicular to the airflow . The difference between the two pressures is called impact pressure ( pressure rise do to the airflow impacting the pitot tube ) and is denoted $ q_c $ . The impact pressure is related to the speed of the airflow the pitot tube is exposed to . If the flow is considered incompressible ( which is an acceptable approximation for speeds up to 200 knots ) the impact pressure can be derived from Bernouilli 's equation . $ q_c = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ rho V ^ 2 $ $ q_c $ is the impact pressure in Pa $ \ rho $ is the density in kg/m3 $ V$ is the true airspeed in m/s The airspeed indicator is calibrated for standard sea level conditions , where $ \ rho $ is 1.225 kg/m3 . In reality the aircraft will fly at altitude and therefor the actual density of the air is lower . Therefor the indicated airspeed will be lower as well . For example if an aircraft flies 75 m/s ( about 146 knots ) at 6000 ft the density will be 1.02393 kg/m3 . $ q_c = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } 1.02393 \ cdot 75 ^ 2 = 2879.8 \ textrm { Pa } $ The equivalent airspeed at sea level for the same $ q_c $ is : $ V _ { EAS } = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 q_c } { \ rho_0 } } = \ sqrt { \ frac { 2 \ cdot 2879.8 } { 1.225 } } = 68.6 \ textrm { m/s } $ Your airspeed indicator will read only 68.6 m/s ( 133 knots ) despite the fact that you are moving with 75 m/s ( 146 knots ) with respect to the air . Conversion of true airspeed to the equivalent airspeed can be done directly by : $ V _ { EAS } = V \ cdot \ sqrt { \ frac { \ rho } { \ rho_0 } } $ $ V _ { EAS } $ equivalent airspeed ( m/s ) $ V$ true airspeed ( m/s ) $ \ rho $ actual air density ( kg/m3 ) . $ \ rho_0 $ density at standard sea level conditions ( 1.225 kg/m3 ) The effects of the lower density on your aispeed indicator become more pronounced the higher you go . Once you go faster than about 100 m/s true airspeed the effects of compressibility can no longer be ignored and the above no longer applies . Airspeed indicators are corrected for effects of compressibility and therefore do n't use the equivalent airspeed but instead use calibrated airspeed for calibration . $ V _ { CAS } = a _ { 0 } \ sqrt { 5 \ left [ \ left ( \ frac { q_c } { P _ { 0 } } +1 \ right ) ^ \ frac { 2 } { 7 } -1 \ right ] } $ $ V _ { CAS } $ is calibrated airspeed $ a _ { 0 } $ is the speed of sound under standard sea level conditions ( 340.3 m/s ) $ P_0 $ is the static air pressure under standard sea level conditions ( 101325 Pa ) $ { q_c } $ is the impact pressure The impact pressure is also a bit more complex for compressible flow : $ \ ; q_c = P \ left [ \ left ( 1 +0.2 M ^ 2 \ right ) ^ \ tfrac { 7 } { 2 } -1 \ right ] $ $ P$ the static pressure $ M$ the Mach number Effectively , the higher and faster you get , the greater the difference between the indicated airspeed and the true airspeed . For example , Mach 0.8 at 40000 ft in no wind will result in a GPS speed of 489 knots , but a calibrated airspeed of only 242 knots , which is less than half . Therefore at high altitudes and speeds , the indicated airspeed will be lower than the ground speed / GPS speed , unless you have extreme headwind .
In Europe , some airways are only available in certain flight level ranges , so a commercial airliner and a GA turbo-prop travelling from the same departure airport to the same destination airport could be travelling on different routes due to airway restrictions in place and the inability of one aircraft to climb to the same level as the other . Below the routing for PC12 operating IFR at FL150 and an A320 operating at FL250 . The above flightplan from EDDL to EDDM validates for FL240 , but anything above FL245 will not pass , it will error out with : To fly the same flight in higher levels , you would need another routing : This routing works fine for anything above FL245 , below it would again error out with :
A shortcut is a deviation from the filed flightplan given to an aircraft by ATC during the flight , if traffic and other factors permit . A flight crew can not expect to get any shortcuts , so they can not plan for it . Routes in the RAD are flightplannable routes . If a direct route is available in the RAD , it can be used when filing the flightplan , prior to the flight . This allows airlines to plan for the shorter route , thus allowing them to bring less fuel and advertise a shorter flight time .
A heading ( in the general case of moving " forward " ) is the direction your nose is pointed in . This may not be your course ( <URL> ) . Headings are measured from onboard a traveling vehicle or object ( e.g. from the cockpit of an aircraft or the bridge of a ship at sea ) . An azimuth is a bearing , more precisely a compass bearing from a specific point of observation like a radar station . ( The " North " used as a reference may be either magnetic or true depending on the system you 're working with , but for purposes of this discussion it does n't matter . ) Often the point of observation is fixed ( ground radar , a control tower , an artillery spotter , etc. ) , though it need not be as long as the observation can be mapped to a compass bearing somehow . Bonus Answer : The " O'Clock " positions are an informal type of relative bearing <URL> : The 360-degree circle is broken up into 12 chunks ( 30 degrees each ) for easier scanning , with " 12 O'Clock " being directly in front of you and " 6 O'Clock " directly behind . An important caveat to be aware of is that when ATC provides a " clock bearing " for traffic it 's relative to the aircraft 's course ( 12 O'Clock is aligned with the aircraft 's track over the ground as shown on the radar ) . Depending on wind there may be considerable variation between your course ( direction of travel ) and your heading ( direction the nose is pointing ) , so the called traffic may appear in a different location when you look out your window .
Actually , " stay in the pattern " is non-standard phraseology and should n't be used , even though it means the same thing as " <URL> . Specifying the direction is n't required but it is a good idea to ensure that everybody is thinking the same thing .
Flaps are at the back of the wing , slats are at the front . Easy ! :) If you want it more technical : They both help to generate more lift . See these diagrams with angle of attack and lift coefficient : <URL> <URL> As the lift coefficient is inversely proportional to the minimum airspeed , a higher CL will allow a lower Vmin .
Published waypoints are waypoints that appear on the charts and in the published navigation databases used by GPS navigators or FMSes . They are referenced using the published identifier for the waypoint . Examples : TPA , ITAWT . Unpublished waypoints are waypoints created by the pilot . FMS allow for the creation/entry of a waypoint by the pilot . The waypoint is defined by one of the following : Latitude/Longitude Place/Bearing/Distance Place-Bearing/Place-Bearing The pilot-defined waypoint can then be added to the flight plan . Here 's a snip of how a waypoint is defined in an A320 : <URL> As to when you would use it , the short answer is when you need to or want to . A common example would be to deviate a short distance off an airway ( maybe 5 or 10 nm ) to avoid a temporary flight restriction . You would just want to avoid the restricted airspace and using a published waypoint or waypoints would take you farther off your route than necessary .
Your friend is right . Elevator trim is n't setting a pitch , it is compensating for control forces on the elevator , which vary with speed . If you are trimmed for level flight at 100 kias and reduce power the plane will initially slow . As it slows the trim will cause a nose-down moment causing the plane to pitch down . Given no input , the plane will equilibrate at whatever nose-down pitch is needed to regain the forces it was trimmed for , which means speeding back up to 100 kias . You are correct that to maintain 100 kias with reduced power the nose should be lowered , but the trim will take care of that for you . You might have a misconception about how trim works , based on your argument . A typical trim setup in light airplanes is essentially another control surface on the elevator : <URL> The elevator is the large control surface and that smaller control surface is the elevator trim . When you adjust the pitch trim you are adjusting this trim tab which provides a force on the elevator that counters aerodynamic forces . This is why the airplane responds in pitch to maintain constant aerodynamic forces ( e.g. constant indicated airspeed ) for a given trim setting . You can test this in the airplane easily . Take your plane up to the altitude you practice maneuvers at , set 75 % power ( or some other number ) and trim for straight and level . Add power and watch the plane climb , decrease power and watch it descent , both without touching the trim . Go back to straight and level and trimmed and accelerate without climbing -- note you are having to retrim as your speed increases . Decelerate without descending -- note you are retrimming as your speed decreases .

What 's the maximum bank angle of a glider ?
The bank angle ( $ \ phi $ ) in a stationary turn is limited by the maximal load factor of the aircraft ( or the pilot - whichever is less ) : $ $ \ phi _ { max } = \ arccos ( \ frac { 1 } { n _ { max } } ) $ $ Utility category gliders ( $ n _ { max } = 5.3 $ ) have a maximum bank angle of 79 ° . Aerobatic gliders with $ n _ { max } $ between 7 and 10 can fly only slightly steeper turns ( 82 ° -84 ° ) . If you 're flying with an airspeed slower than design manoeuvring speed $ V_A $ the limiting factor is the maximum lift coefficient . In that case , the formula gets $ $ \ phi _ { max } = \ arccos ( \ left ( \ frac { V_S } { V } \ right ) ^ 2 ) $ $ $ V_S $ is the stalling speed in the current configuration , $ V$ the airspeed of the glider . <URL> ( own work ) Then , how do you get the tightest turn radius ? With high speed and high bank angle or with low speed and low bank angle ? Without the structural limitation the radius could become 0 . With it , however , your best option to get a minimal turn radius is to fly with maneuvring speed and maximum load factor . You can use the following diagram to calculate the minimum turn radius at any speed ( just multiply the ordinate with the squared stall speed of your aircraft ) . <URL> As stated in many comments , during aerobatics/dynamic manuevers you can get any bank angle for a certain ( sometimes really short ) period of time : <URL> 0 ° / 180 ° bank angle <URL> <URL> 90 ° bank angle <URL>
In AF447 the falling motion most definitely affected the angle of attack . Due to the fact that the pf did keep the stick pulled back for all but the last few seconds of the fall the aircraft was so steep that , although the aircraft was falling at a slight pitch up , angles of attack actually reached as high as 60 ° . The descent was so steep that the air was passing over the pitot tubes at such an angle that it was reading below 40 knots , although the plane was moving far faster then that . The computer required that the airspeed be of a certain value to consider the aoa plausible so the stall warning stopped sounding even though the aoa was between 30 ° and 60 ° during the fall . When it hit the water the forward ground speed and the vertical speed were both 107 kts . As far as why the pilot did not realize he was stalled , that 's the question of the century . Much effort has been put into figuring that out , and there are numerous things that are at play . But in the end I do n't think anyone has come up with a satisfactory answer for that . If you want to dig into the causes of this crash and get a good understanding of Airbus systems in general I highly recommend <URL> and it 's companion <URL> . The author is uniquely qualified and gives the most thorough explanation yet is not as technically challenging as reading the BEA report . All of the numbers mentioned in this answer come from the linked book .
You are right , the horizontal tail of a conventional airplane appears to have a higher incidence , but the actual angle of attack is smaller than that of the wing . The wing , flying ahead of the tail , produces downwash , so the flow at the tail location has a distinct downward component . The downwash angle can be calculated from the lift coefficient and the geometry of the aircraft : To simplify things , let 's assume the wing is just acting on the air with the density $ \ rho $ flowing with the speed $ v $ through a circle with a diameter equal to the span $ b $ of the wing . If we just look at this stream tube , the mass flow is $ $ \ frac { dm } { dt } = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v $ $ Lift $ L$ is then the impulse change which is caused by the wing and equal to weight . With the downward air speed $ v_z $ imparted by the wing , lift is : $ $ L = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v \ cdot v_z = S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho $ $ $ S$ is the wing area and $ c_L $ the overall lift coefficient . If we now solve for the vertical air speed , we get $ $ v_z = \ frac { S \ cdot c_L \ cdot \ frac { v ^ 2 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho } { \ frac { b ^ 2 } { 4 } \ cdot \ pi \ cdot \ rho \ cdot v } = \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L \ cdot v } { \ pi \ cdot AR } $ $ with $ AR = \ frac { b ^ 2 } { S } $ the aspect ratio of the wing . Now we can divide the vertical speed by the air speed to calculate the angle by which the air has been deflected by the wing . Let 's call it $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { v_z } { v } \ right ) = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ A typical airliner cruise lift coefficient is 0.4 , and a typical aspect ratio is around 8 : This results in a downwash angle of nearly 2 ° if the lift distribution over span is elliptical . In reality , it is more triangular-shaped , so the downwash angle is larger near the center of the aircraft . Note that the engine nacelles of the <URL> are tilted 3 ° up to align them with the local flow . The resulting angle of attack is lower by those 3 ° , and if the angle of attack difference between wing and tail is less than that , the tail surface will appear angled upward . To achieve static stability , the tail will have to fly at a slightly <URL> .
The major ways : Run really fast into the wind at minimum angle of attack and then pull up a bit , and you 'll get a little lift that you might then use to find a thermal . This is very location-dependent , and you 're unlikely to fly very long at a stretch . Get a tow from a car or a powered plane like a sailplane would . A car limits your altitude , but is cheap and easy to set up ; arranging a pull pilot is a bigger deal but can get you hundreds of feet in the air . Tether yourself to the ground with a long rope , push the control bar forward and rise up in the air like a kite . Then , cut yourself loose , pull the control bar into your stomach and cut around in a spiral to gain forward airspeed before leveling off . Most hang gliding I 've seen done has involved launching from a tall hill or cliff , then looking for a ridge or thermal updraft nearby to keep you in the sky .
<URL> : An aircraft over the Ivory Coast collided with a <URL> at the altitude of 11,300 m ( 37,100 ft ) , the current record avian height . This happened on November , 29 1973 .

I tested this out in the Seminole today . My ( extremely nonscientific ) results are as follows : Wings level , hold aileron to maintain roll and correct using rudder : 200 FPM Ball centred , ailerons flush and correct using rudder : 0 FPM 5 degrees bank angle , hold aileron to maintain roll and correct using rudder : 100 FPM 2.5 degrees bank angle , hold aileron to maintain roll and correct using rudder : 200-250 FPM At least under today 's conditions * , wings level was better than 5 degrees of bank , but approximately 3 degrees of bank was slightly better than both . Today 's conditions , for the interested : 6000 MSL -7 C Engine shut down and feathered About 1/4 -1 / 2 ball deflection on all except # 2 Probably about half tanks No idea what the altimeter setting was
An altitude engine is a type of engine that uses a <URL> ( and less often , a <URL> ) to generate sea-level pressure in its intake manifold , up to its critical altitude , at which point power will start to fall off . It is also sometimes called a turbo-normalizer . Non-altitude engines will lose power as they climb because the ambient air pressure drops off at a rate of about 1 " Hg per 1,000 ft of altitude ( up to 10,000 ft ) . The altitude engine allows aircraft to fly at higher altitudes at full power , and increases the aircraft 's speed and efficiency , because true airspeed increases with altitude . It also allows an aircraft under IFR to fly at higher MEAs or under VFR over higher terrain , and allows the pilot to choose a favorable altitude for weather . There are also what are called turbocharged engines , which are a type of altitude engine that can generate more intake manifold pressure than at sea level . For example , a Mooney Bravo M20M can generate 36 " of manifold pressure , and can generate at least 30 " of manifold pressure up to its critical altitude of 22,000 ft. An altitude engine is considered less taxing on the engine than a turbocharged engine because the former does n't develop above sea-level pressure or high turbine-inlet temperatures . The altitude engine is also easier to fly than a turbocharged engine , since it never develops more power than would be developed at sea level . Altitude engines also typically have a controllable-pitch prop , and develop more than 200 horsepower , so they require both a <URL> and a <URL> . See <URL> .

There are two factors which limit the possible speed of piston engines : <URL> , and relative speed of moving parts , here the pistons in their cylinder barrels . If the engine runs too fast , the flame front originating from the spark plug will not have traveled far enough to have burnt most of the fuel by the time the piston moves down again . This puts a fundamental limit to the growth in power output over speed in piston engines . Also , if the relative speed between moving parts is too high , the lubrication will fail and the parts will overheat quickly . In order to run at the highest possible speed , <URL> used castor oil , which in turn motivated early aviators to wear long scarves over their mouth so their digestive system would not be compromised by sitting right in the exhaust stream of their engine . Today , lubricants have improved but still set a clear limit to the maximum speed at which a piston engine can be run . Cooling can be managed by pressurizing the cooling system and improving radiator and pump performance while inertial loads on the engine components can be dealt with by lightweight , high-strength materials . Reducing the <URL> will allow a higher speed before the ignition limit bites while reducing the <URL> will reduce piston speeds , again allowing a higher engine speed before lubrication fails . An optimimized engine will balance both so that the possible speed can be fully exploited . For the IO-360 and IO-540 , those dimensions are 5 ⅛ " and 4 ⅜ " , respectively . This places them below the <URL> and closer to the typical <URL> . I could not find reliable data on the engine speed of <URL> , which should come close to the maximum sensible engine speed at that size class . The best I could find was the 3,700 RPM of the <URL> , an engine with 5.9 " bore and 6.5 " stroke , so I would guess by using good fuel and lubrication , the Lycoming might end up somewhere between 4000 and 4500 RPM . I 'm sceptical that much useful power can be extracted at 5000 RPM and am sure that the lifetime at this speed will be measured in minutes , not hours .
The aerodynamic coefficients $ c_l , c_d , c_m $ are in general functions of the angle of attack $ \ alpha $ , Reynolds $ Re $ and Mach number $ Ma $ . For your experiments , since you are operating in a very low $ Re $ regime , assuming incompressible flow , your lift , drag , moment curves will largely depend on viscous phenomena ( i.e. $ Re $ number ) . Generally , as $ Re $ number drops , the boundary layer thickens . For this reason , you will expect a lower $ c_l $ number ( due to viscous decambering ) and a higher $ c_d $ . You may also discover non-linear behaviors even on operating angles due to laminar separation bubble forming/bursting on the suction surface and this is very dependent on the turbulent intensity of your wind tunnel so the stall angles and post-stall behavior may not be the same for flight conditions where turbulent intensity is very low . Finally , you can confirm with Xfoil that for $ Re = 300k \ Rightarrow \ alpha _ { L = 0 } = -4.33 \ deg $ while for $ Re = 150k \ Rightarrow \ alpha _ { L = 0 } = -3.64 \ deg $ for the NACA4412 .
At the absolute simplest , compared to a two-bladed propeller , a slightly smaller three-bladed propeller can produce more thrust at a given RPM , improving climb performance . Because of the smaller diameter , the propeller tips actually travel slower than the equivalent two-bladed design , reducing noise inside and outside the airplane . Hartzell Propeller has a great <URL> . Their explanation of why more blades produces less noise is pretty good : A 2-blade propeller produces two pressure pulses per revolution , where a 3-blade propeller will produce three smaller pulses per revolution ( for the same amount of total thrust ) which is inherently smoother and therefore quieter . The 3-blade propeller will generally have a smaller diameter than the 2-blade propeller that it replaces , which also reduces the tip speed and noise .
45 degrees . 8.9.3.6 Aircraft vectored for final approach should be given a heading or a series of headings calculated to close with the final approach track . The final vector shall enable the aircraft to be established in level flight on the final approach track prior to intercepting the specified or nominal glide path if an MLS , ILS or radar approach is to be made , and should provide an intercept angle with the final approach track of 45 degrees or less . ICAO Doc 4444 ( PANS-ATM ) That said , we very often use a 30 degree intercept angle , even if we are allowed to go up to 45 degrees .
The optimization problem is unchanged from the all engines operative ( AEO ) cruise optimization . You should still : Climb as high as practical ( <URL> , thinner air is better for range ) Set the lift coefficient such that drag is minimized for propeller aircraft ( $ c _ { Di } = c _ { D0 } $ ) . For turbojets , minimize energy per flight time ( $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ cdot c _ { D0 } $ ) . For turbofans , pick a value between those two extremes . For the computation of the theoretical optimum polar point please see <URL> for a complete derivation including wind , or <URL> for a shorter explanation . Your flight altitude will certainly be lower , because you need to generate more thrust on the remaining engine ( requiring higher density ) , which in turn will result in a lower TAS ( true air speed ) . The CAS ( calibrated airspeed ) should stay about the same , however . The configuration ( flaps , gear ) should stay unchanged , only rudder deflection will be added for <URL> compensation . The resulting sideslip will increase the zero-lift drag of the airplane a little , so a slightly lower speed than in the AEO case would result . In the unlikely case that the required density will result in an altitude below ground level , you will need to slow down and need to set flaps to stay airborne , and now the new optimum with flaps will result in a markedly higher lift coefficient because deploying flaps will increase the zero-lift drag quite a bit . If you have the flaps-down polar , the optimum is easy to find .
No . A ( pure ) glider can not make a go-around in the way a powered machine can . The glide path can be influenced by airbrakes , flaps , chutes or slipping , but mostly those are for reducing your L/D , i.e. steepening the approach ( you win again , gravity ! ) . Gaining height without updraft is only possible by converting kinetic energy ( speed ) , and that gain is limited by the stall speed . So while you can get up a few meters by pulling up from landing airspeed , you will find yourself way too high above the runway at minimum speed and hoping for the best . The <URL> is achieved by starting with really high ( unlandable ) speed which is then converted into height and shortly followed by the inevitable landing ** . For some older ( mostly wooden ) gliders , even this is not a very good idea because they combine a lower VNE with lower L/D ratios , leaving you low and slow after pulling up from redline speeds . In a glider , you get one chance for a smooth landing ( freak thermals excluding ) . But this is one of the most important points in training , and you get used to the concept very quickly . A proper landing procedure together with brakes , flaps , etc. will bring you down safely . * but not necessarily safe or recommended ** lest you catch a proper thermal or dynamic updraft .
I am not a glider pilot , but the principle holds for flying any fixed wing aircraft1 : you should keep your head level with the aircraft , as you described , not the horizon . As your instructor explained , there may come -- or will come -- a time when you are not able to keep your head level with the horizon due to the nature of a particular maneuver or orientation , and that is a practical matter to consider . It is certainly difficult to incline one 's head 60 ° to the side in a steep turn . From my perspective , however , the more important reason is that your frame of reference needs to be the aircraft . You are used to viewing the world with the ground as your frame of reference ; down is down , up is up . As you learn to fly , however , you need to learn a new way to view three dimensional space , or -- more specifically -- the way you move through that space in the aircraft . It might sound cheesy , but you really need to learn to become one with the aircraft and hold the same perspective regardless of the aircraft 's orientation . Now , that being said , as you gain experience and develop your skills , you may come to realize that this perspective shift does not always require that your head remain rigidly perpendicular to your shoulders . Rather , it is a matter of perception which will eventually be independent of how your head is oriented relative to the aircraft . At my first flying job I spent much of my time in maneuvering flight and my head was rarely still -- much less level with the aircraft . I spent a great deal of time with my head on a swivel , looking up and down , side to side , craning forward to clear into a turn , looking back into the cockpit , etc. . At this stage in your training , however , it is probably important to train to keep your head straight within the aircraft ; certainly follow your instructor 's instructions , and you should do well . 1This probably holds true for rotorcraft as well , or any aircraft for that matter . I am only sharing what I am familiar with .
This is heavily dependent on the local jurisdictions you plan to operate in and what their laws are . First off you must find out if your desired countries of operation accept foreign certificates . This varies heavily all over the world and can range from full no questions asked acceptance , to you needing to simply take the test again ( in that country ) through any various case you can think of . Second you need to find out what certificate you need . Here in the US to give rides ( and receive compensation for such ) you need a commercial certificate . This looks like it <URL> . Hours . The FAA requires a few more hours than the Canadian certificate will , <URL> Are at least 16 years of age ; and Have logged at least 10 hours of flight time in a glider and that flight time must include at least 20 total glider flights , and Have 2 hours of solo flight time in a glider , and Have passed the FAA written examination ; and Have passed the flight exam with a FAA Examiner . <URL> A minimum of 6 hours of flight training under the direction and supervision of an instructor At least 2 hours of solo flight time , including a minimum of 20 takeoffs and 20 landings Right off the bad Canada requires 4 less hours which , no matter how you spin it will be cheaper ( since you have to pay for less time ) . Here is the US if you are not a citizen you will need to pass an NTSB background check to train . I do not know if Canada has a similar requirement . Travel , assuming you are in the Caribbean already it may be cheaper to travel to Florida ( or the like ) to train then go all the way up to Canada for your training . Edit : According to this document the ECCAA does issue glider ratings <URL> ( a ) The Authority may issue the following ratings for pilots ( i ) Category ratings in the following aircraft : ( a ) Aeroplane ; ( b ) Rotorcraft ; ( c ) Glider ; ( d ) Lighter-than-air ; ( e ) Power lift .
<URL> it says on page 4 : ... for a new Class B cargo compartment definition as well as design criteria for a new Class F cargo compartment type . This latter class of compartment was introduced because whilst it was concluded that manual fire fighting was not feasible for larger compartments , alternatives other than just the existing Class C were identified . And a bit further on page 5 ( emphasis mine ) : ... Further , a new Class F cargo compartment definition is added , which is not limited in size and which provides the means to control or extinguish a fire without requiring a crewmember to enter the compartment . This proposed Class F compartment standard accommodates the carriage of large amounts of baggage and cargo loads on Combi aeroplanes as well as in compartments of smaller sizes exceeding the new Class B definition . New aeroplanes designs can take advantage from the variable solutions under the Class F definitions to ensure an acceptable level of fire protection . And more concrete : The AMC further provides guidance for usage of other fire protection means in the new Class F compartment such as Fire Containment Covers ( FCC ) or Containers rather than having a liner installed to contain a fire and to protect the critical systems and structure of the aeroplane . I guess it 's meant to allow storage of cargo in non-cargo areas ( which do not have the adequate fire protection measures such as liners ) if other non-traditional measures are installed ( such as the Fire Containment Covers )
30 degrees . Boeing aircraft , including the 787 , have a Pitch Limit Indicator ( PLI ) in the flight display that tells the pilot how far the wing 's angle of attack ( AOA ) is from stall . the PLI also is limited to 30 deg of pitch attitude , regardless of AOA . But it depends on aircraft configuration During takeoff climb , there is no single target AOA to fly that will guarantee certified takeoff performance . Takeoff-climb AOA will vary with such factors as airplane gross weight , thrust , altitude , flap setting , and CG . Takeoff-climb speeds ( hence , AOA ) are limited by stall speed , tail clearance , and minimum control speeds . The higher speed and greater thrust of an all-engine takeoff reduce the AOA significantly relative to an engine-out takeoff at the engine-out climb speed ( V2 ) . From <URL> At Farnborough 2014 , pilots Neville and Bryan were pulling stunts that would get airline pilots fired . Most airlines limit pitch to 20 degrees ( or in a few cases 25 ) from what I 've read . They kicked off the demonstration with a spectacularly steep takeoff , pitching the plane up just shy of 30 degrees . I 'd guess they flew just inside what Boeing consider unsafe for those conditions . Boeing wo n't reveal ... just how steeply it can take off From <URL> ( my emphasis ) . I think we can be reasonably confident that no production 787 will ever , after take-off , initially climb at greater than 30 degrees . Flight envelopes The way I understand it , asking about the " maximum " of anything for an aircraft is less useful than understanding the flight envelope . This is because the maximum depends very greatly on the exact situation of the aircraft including things like altitude , weight , speed etc. . <URL> Actual flight data from the six Boeing 787 test aircraft .
Yes there is a distinction , pitch , roll and heading are angles [ unit = radian ] and latitude , longitude and altitude are linear distances [ unit = meter ] . Together , these six parameters define the six Degrees of Freedom that define the momentary state of a rigid object with reference to the earth . All six are defined relative to earth axes . For the linear dimensions this is clear , we just need to define a suitable zero point . For the angles : Pitch is the nose up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Roll is the wingtip up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Heading is the angle relative to a suitable earth reference , usually magnetic north or geographical north . Conversion of aircraft axes into earth axes is a non-trivial matter and the cause of much confusion , for instance in questions comparing lift to weight : lift is always coupled to aircraft axes , weight to earth axes . The axes sets are defined as follows : Aircraft axes Origin : Centre of Gravity of aircraft X-axis : in the symmetry plane of the aircraft , + = forward to the aircraft nose Y-axis : in the span wise direction of the aircraft , + = to the right wingtip Z-axis : perpendicular to the XOY-plane , + = down into the floor . Earth axes Origin : Centre of Gravity at the start of the response X-axis : In the horizontal plane ( relative to gravity ) , + = pointing north . Y-axis : Perpendicular to XOZ-plane , + = pointing east . Z-axis : Pointing to the centre of the earth = + Edit Yes navigation lat/lon is given in [ degrees ] - the INS sensor ultimately converts displacement into proper navigational definitions of course . But for measuring 3-D aircraft inertial effects the SI system is used , and displacement is internally treated as a linear motion , units [ metres ] .
The angle of attack is the angle between the wing ( wing chord to be precise ) and the direction of travel ( undisturbed airflow ) . The angle of pitch is the angle between the main body axis and the horizon . The difference can theoretically be any angle , but during normal flight it will be limited to about 15 degrees . The reason that the angle of attack sensor was inoperative was due to low airspeed . Below 60 knot IAS the indication is unreliable and therefore the indicator is inhibited . This also inhibits the stall warning . This lead to the confusing situation that lowering the nose to correct the stall increased the airspeed beyond 60 knots , thereby reactivating the stall warning .

What is a " Russian IATA code " ?
It 's a Russian internal city or airport identifier . Many small cities do n't have IATA codes , but do have internal Russian codes . This system is called CRT ( Center for schedules and tariffs , ЦРТ , Центр Расписаний и Тарифов ) named after a department in the organization that manages them ( see below ) . Wikipedia article cited below claims it 's also called " Sirena " code ( named after Sirena -- a booking system for airline and railway tickets ) . Here 's a translation of a fragment from <URL> : The internal city and airport coding system in the former USSR is structured analogous to IATA . [ ... ] The airport code in this system consists of 3 letters of the Russian alphabet . As in IATA codes , the 3-letter combination is interpreted as atomic and has no internal structure . As in case with IATA , all 3-letter codes are unique . Like IATA , the codes were assigned to cities such that the code has something in common either with the name of the city or with its IATA code [ ... ] Contrary to IATA , the internal codes were changed after cities were renamed in the 1990s : Saint Petersburg 's internal code was changed from ЛЕД to СПТ , Samara ( formerly Kuibyshev ) -- from КУФ to СМШ , Ekaterinburg ( formerly Sverdlovsk ) -- from СВХ to ЕКБ . Many small cities and airports in the former USSR have an internal code only . In late 1990s foreign ( non-Russian ) cities were assigned internal codes because of the popularity of these destinations ( e. g. Barcelona -- БЦН ) . As of April 2009 , there are about three thousand internal codes that are actively used . It appears that the codes are maintained by the <URL> . The section Coding Directories on their page <URL> says : STC maintains the aggregated database of coding directories for the purpose of universal use of codes in information systems for passenger services reservation and sales , publication of timetables and fares , ticketing , settlement and other commercial issues related to passenger services . STC maintains the codifiers in pursuance of Provision on Assignment , Maintenance and Use of Internal Codes of Carriers , Organizations , Airports , Cities ( points ) and Civil Aviation Agencies ( № ДВ-63 / и dated 12.05.94 ) and Directive " On Coding Directories Approval " ( № ДВ-109 / и date 14.07.94 ) . STC supports the following coding directories : Airlines Airports Cities In Russian , STC is translated as CRT ( ЦРТ ) and I 've heard people refer to the internal codes as " CRT codes " .
One seller 's link on Amazon claimed 10 " x 5 " , but when I measured an old one ( only one I have handy ) , it was between 10.25 " and 10.5 " long by 5 " wide . So I 'd recommend using the latter value , knowing that the chart will probably be a hair under 10.5 " long and so you have room for error ( or a badly refolded chart ) .
The fire sensor 's time to give the alarm is customizable depending upon the fire safety alarm being used . Two widely used types of continuous-loop systems are the thermistor type detectors , such as the Kidde and the Fenwal systems , and the pneumatic pressure detector , such as the Lingberg system . ( Lindberg system is also known as Systron-Donner and , more recently , Meggitt Safety Systems . ) . A typical delay of 10 Seconds is quite common . Here is the <URL> for your further reading
IATA themselves <URL> : Airlines and CRSs [ computer reservations systems ] may request the assignment of a unique three-letter code to identify an airport The <URL> also says the same thing : when a three-letter code is used alone to indicate a location , it designates the name of an airport or location as adopted by IATA ( whose code only has three letters ) According to Wikipedia , IATA has several <URL> that can be from one to four characters , but airport codes specifically are always three based on all the sources I mentioned .
I think what the placard actually says is . Lifeline Extension Belt ( ie , its 2 things , not one ! ) An <URL> indicates the narrow OHB you reference as number 16 . Which is titled " Lifeline " . This line is used to aid evacuation from the overwing exits and more details can be found in <URL> Extension belts are used for infants on their carers laps , an extra belt loops round the child and attaches to the carers lap belt . <URL>
Oxygen in passenger masks is either generated by oxygen generator or released from pressurized container via reduction valve . In either case it is released at fixed rate . But human breath is discontinous . So the bag acts as a buffer . You inhale the oxygen accumulated in it and then it slowly refills while you are exhaling .
I do n't know , but ... If you look at the <URL> you will see there is nowhere for the airline to indicate the code it would like to receive . I imagine many new airlines might indicate a preference in an accompanying letter ( e.g. they would like a code starting with a specific letter ) If you look at the allocated codes you can see that , initially , some attempt was made by IATA to make the two-character codes mnemonic However if JB was already allocated , it is reasonable that the IATA staff would look for an available code starting with either J or B . Since the Blue of JetBlue is more distinguishing than the Jet part of the name , the IATA employee may have started with B and noticed that the following were already <URL> ( note I have not checked dates these codes were allocated but the hypothesis seems plausible to me ) The last two are puzzling but perhaps they changed their names ( perhaps as part of a takeover , merger or split ) . Airline codes do get reused . For example , B5 was used by FlightLine before it went out of business . Then B6 would be the next available code .
What is a TRACON ( Terminal Radar Approach Control ) ? TRACON is a go-between : Descending cruising flights received from ARTCC and handing them over to airfield TOWERs Climbing departing flights received from TOWERs and handing them over to ARTCC . <URL> ( <URL> ) <URL> Potomac consolidated TRACON , operation room ( <URL> ) A TRACON is the name in the US for what is also known in other countries as the Terminal Control Center , the control in charge of operations close to one or more large airports ( but not on the airports themselves ) . TRACON manage arrivals and departures , the related transitions to/from cruise , and also aircraft transiting in their area . From Nasa 's <URL> page ( with some adjustments ) : TRACONs are facilities containing radar operations from which air traffic controllers direct aircraft : During departure , descent and approach phases of flight . Transitioning from the en route phase through to the approach phase into a destination airport located within the TRACON 's airspace . Transitioning after takeoff to the departure phase until the flight is handed off to the Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) for its en route phase , [ ... ] via a preferential departure route ( PDR ) leading away from the departure airport . The TRACON controller directs the movement of aircraft in and out of that airspace by monitoring a radar screen and maintaining voice contact with pilots . Controller position : High altitude descent controller Low altitude descent controller Approach controller Feeder controller Departure controller One TRACON can handle the air traffic for several different airports in its sector . Although the controller 's individual responsibility is only for his or her own sector , all controllers within a TRACON have full radar information on all the aircraft that are under control of the entire TRACON facility . In addition , these controllers are able to communicate with one another instantly - something that contributes significantly to assuring the safety of aircraft passengers . As emphasized by @TomMcW in his comment , smaller airfields do n't have an associated TRACON , the approaches and departures are in this case directly managed by controllers at the airfield tower . Controllers mostly use the Automated Radar Terminal System ( ARTS ) or the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System ( STARS ) to track aircraft : <URL> Philadelphia TRACON ( <URL> ) When do pilots need to be helped by a TRACON ? Pilots are directed to a TRACON center either by the Tower controller ( for departures ) , or the ARTCC controller ( for descents and transits ) . The aircraft scheduled to land on a given runway are sequenced by the feeder controller , to maximize the landing flow . Where are TRACON usually located ? TRACON premises by themselves can be located anywhere . Controllers work on radar screens , in the half-light , they do n't have a view of the outdoor . Basement rooms are usual . Depending on the country they may be located close to major airports , within the area they control . TRACON controlled areas are located around major airports . In the US : <URL> In Europe ( TCC ) : See <URL> What is the difference between TRACON , En Route and Tower ? Taking the US ATC system only into account for this discussion . 1 / Airport operations are controlled by controllers in the tower . They need a view on the runways and other location of the airport . Radar is only used for tracking aircraft on the ground ( ground radar ) . Takeoff and landing clearances are delivered after visual check of the runway status . <URL> O’Hare International Airport air traffic control tower ( <URL> ) From <URL> : Control towers were established to provide for a safe , orderly , and expeditious flow of air traffic at an airport and in its vicinity . There are four major controller classifications at control towers : Flight Data Controller Clearance Delivery Controller Ground Controller Local Controller . <URL> Inside an air traffic control tower ( <URL> ) 2 / Enroute traffic is controlled by Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) <URL> Typical sector radar team ( <URL> ) From <URL> : ARTCCs , usually referred to as " Centers , " are established primarily to provide Air Traffic Service to aircraft operating on IFR flight plans within the controlled airspace , and principally during the en route phase of flight . There are 21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers ( ARTCC ) in the United States . <URL> US ARTCC boundaries ( <URL> ) Any aircraft operating under Instrument Flight Rules ( IFR ) within the confines of an ARTCC 's airspace is controlled by air traffic controllers at the Center . This includes all sorts of different types of aircraft : privately owned single engine aircraft , commuter airlines , military jets and commercial airlines . ARTCC manages flights between TRACON airspaces , while they are cruising at high altitude . ( You c
A demonstrated crosswind component is highest crosswind ( corrected to make it 90 ° ) which has been shown to be possible to safely land by a test pilot . It shall not require exceptional skill by an ordinary pilot , however it does not mean every pilot will be able to do so . It is also NOT a limit ( contrary to what some say ) - if the pilot does decide to land higher crosswinds , they can do so ( but please take caution ) . This number may not necessarily be the highest crosswind component that it 's possible to land in -- it just has to be above the minimum capabilities required in the regulations . For example , say an aircraft , flown perfectly ( yes , we 're dreaming ) , was capable of handling a 30 knot crosswind component ( no gust , ISA conditions ) , the manufacturer only needs to demonstrate safe landing with a crosswind component of one-fifth of the reference stall speed in the landing configuration . This would be : 10 knots @ 50KIAS VS0 12 knots @ 60KIAS VS0 14 knots @ 70KIAS VS0 15 knots @ 75KIAS VS0 <URL> : ( a ) A 90 degree cross-component of wind velocity , demonstrated to be safe for taxiing , takeoff , and landing must be established and must be not less than 0.2 VS0 .
SOIA ( Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches ) allow airports with parallel runways that are 750 to 3000 feet apart to conduct ( almost ) simultaneous approaches to the two runways . At an airport , one runway uses the ILS PRM approach , while the other runway uses an offset LDA PRM approach ( with glideslope ) . SOIA refers to the LDA PRM approach , where another aircraft is flying the ILS PRM approach ahead . PRM stands for Precision Runway Monitor , which is a high-update radar system allowing for " equivalent " safety with reduced margins . For a PRM approach is conducted , there must be two frequencies per runway : a primary frequency for both the transmission and receipt of instructions a " monitor " frequency , only for ATC to transmit on The reason for the " monitor " frequency is just in case the primary frequency is blocked and breakout instructions have to be provided . The tower controller will communicate to aircraft on both frequencies , both in normal PRM operations and when providing breakout instructions . There is also a " monitor " controller that ensures that the two aircraft never get dangerously close together -- if such a situation occurs , the " monitor " controller overrides the tower controller on both frequencies to allow for immediate breakout instructions to be given . Of the two apporaches , the more interesting of the two is the offset LDA PRM approach . In the LDA PRM approach , aircraft fly an approach course that is 2.5 to 3 degrees offset from the runway heading , following the glideslope until the MAP ( this course does not meet up with the runway threshold ) , at which point the pilot should proceed visually to the runway . <URL> The MAP on a LDA PRM approach is 3000 feet away from the ILS approach course , meaning aircraft have to manoeuvre towards the extended runway centreline to be stable by 500 feet -- the less spacing between the two runways , the more aircraft will have to turn . This does mean that it is less suitable to larger aircraft , due to the manoeuvring required at higher speeds ( than other aircraft ) , though most SOIA approaches are designed for larger aircraft as well . Before reaching the MAP , the pilot must have have : the runway in sight ; the aircraft on the adjacent ILS PRM approach in sight ; and notified ATC that traffic is in sight . This means that the aircraft on the ILS PRM approach should be ahead of the other aircraft . To allow time for visual contact , aircraft should be clear of cloud before the MAP , which is taken into account when deciding on the minimum cloud ceiling allowed for the approach . The NTZ ( No Transgression Zone ) is a 2000 foot wide area between the two approach courses which aircraft must not enter at any time . ATC would immediately issue breakout instructions to both aircraft if an aircraft breaches the NTZ , as there would be very little horizontal separation between the two aircraft . [ The FAA AIM ] [ 3 ] states that : In the unlikely event that an aircraft " blunders " off its course and makes a worst case turn of 30 degrees toward the adjacent final approach course , closing speeds of 135 feet per second could occur that constitute the need for quick reaction . Special training requirements vary from country to country . In the US , SOIA special training requirements are : Parts 121/129/135 : operator training as agreed to by FAA and educational video Part 91 transport category : read about PRM approaches in AIM , video Part 91 other : read about PRM and SOIA approaches in AIM , video An example of a SOIA approach is the SFO runway 28R LDA PRM approach :
How do you define a crew duty day ? When does it start and when does it end ? In the most simplistic terms , a crew 's duty day can be defined in two parts : the " flight duty period " ( FDP ) and the " flight time " . The FDP begins when the crew " clocks in " for their shift . There might be administrative duties to accomplish prior to flying , so " flight time " has not yet started . The FDP ends when the last flight that they operate blocks in . The Flight Time begins and ends with each Block Out to Block In , and there might be several individual flights within a single FDP . Once the FDP is over , they might still be required to attend to admin duties , but their FDP " clock " has stopped ticking . Their " rest " clock has not yet started , just because their FDP has ended . ( Some of these terms and definitions will be expanded upon later . ) Also what are the legal limits ( in other words how long can a crew duty day last in terms of hours ) ? This is an extremely complicated question , and the rest of this answer will be devoted to this , in conjunction with your other sub-questions . [ Are there ] standardized set of rules ? Not necessarily rules , per se ... but the ICAO does have a lot of documentation about duty/rest , fatigue management , and the effects on safety . Although the ICAO can not publish laws , most of it 's member nations write their aviation laws in close conjunction with ICAO 's recommendations . These nations have ratified treaties stating that they will " abide by " most of the ICAO 's recommendations . does each country define its own rules ? Yes , each regulatory body has its own laws for determining duty/rest requirements . Most are very similar , and based on the ICAO 's body of documentation and research . Narrowing this down even further , each carrier develops it 's own policies and procedures that are based on ( and approved by ) it 's parent nation 's regulatory body . What happens when you fly say from the US to Australia ? Which set of rules prevail ? You will follow the policies of your air carrier , which are enforced by your carrier 's country of registration . Let 's start with the US . Ok , within the US , most of the rules regarding duty/rest for Part 121 Air Carriers are enumerated in <URL> . There are some " All Cargo " duty/rest requirements under Part 121 <URL> ( Domestic ) , <URL> ( Flag ) , and <URL> ( Supplemental ) ; however , carriers can chose to use these 121 Subparts OR Part 117 , but not both . Once they make that choice ( listed in their GOM/OpSpecs and approved by the FAA ) , they are stuck with it . What is the exact definition of a " crew duty day " ? As noted in the comments of the question , this is not a legal term within the US FARs . Under Part 117 , we find the definition for these related terms : Calendar day means a 24-hour period from 0000 through 2359 using Coordinated Universal Time or local time . Duty means any task that a flightcrew member performs as required by the certificate holder , including but not limited to flight duty period , flight duty , pre - and post-flight duties , administrative work , training , deadhead transportation , aircraft positioning on the ground , aircraft loading , and aircraft servicing . Flight duty period ( FDP ) means a period that begins when a flightcrew member is required to report for duty with the intention of conducting a flight , a series of flights , or positioning or ferrying flights , and ends when the aircraft is parked after the last flight and there is no intention for further aircraft movement by the same flightcrew member . A flight duty period includes the duties performed by the flightcrew member on behalf of the certificate holder that occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without a required intervening rest period . Examples of tasks that are part of the flight duty period include deadhead transportation , training conducted in an aircraft or flight simulator , and airport/standby reserve , if the above tasks occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without an intervening required rest period . Rest period means a continuous period determined prospectively during which the flightcrew member is free from all restraint by the certificate holder , including freedom from present responsibility for work should the occasion arise . From there , it can get extremely complicated and an airline 's crew scheduler probably could not do their job without the aid of a computer . Flight crewmembers are restricted to a certain number of hours in a duty period , and there are limits to cumulative hours as well : total Flight Time can not exceed : -- 100 hours in any 672 consecutive hours or -- 1,000 hours in any 365 consecutive calendar day period . And then ... total Flight Duty Period can not exceed : 60 flight duty period hours in any 168 consecutive hours or 190 flight duty period hours in any 672 consecutive hours . They are required to have a certain number of hours of " rest " in between these duty periods , and those rest hou
The drogue system was standardized in the 50s and reverse engineered by the USSR in that time so nearly all aircraft that use it are compatible with each other .
Special VFR is used to leave or enter a control zone coming from or continuing the flight in airspace G ( Golf ) , when the weather minima for VFR flight are not met within the control zone , but would be met in airspace G. Example : Airspace G ( Golf ) requires a visibility of 1.5 km and aircraft need to remain clear of clouds . Airspace D ( Delta ) requires a visibility of 5km and 1000ft vertical and 1.5 km horizontal separation to clouds . If the weather report would show a visibility of 4km/4000m and a cloud base of 1400ft , the flight would be allowed in airspace G but not in airspace D. Requesting Special VFR within a control zone will drop the VFR weather requirements to the values required for airspace G , so flight may enter or leave the controlzone . The lower visibility requirements are compensated for in the control zone by stricter separation requirements between aircraft . SVFR is separated to SVFR and IFR traffic .
When the velocity of the airflow locally exceeds speed of sound above the wing a shock wave forms and the flow detaches beyond this shock wave . <URL> Similarly to stall , the supersonic separation of flow removes the component of lift produced by decrease of pressure on the upper surface of the wing and so the effects are similar . I causes reduction of lift and because centre of pressure is about quarter chord on the upper surface , but midchord on the lower , it causes a significant pitch-down moment , which might be impossible to recover even if the post-stall lift is otherwise sufficient to keep the aircraft flying straight . This effect is often called <URL> . Supersonic planes often have all-moving elevators to have sufficient control authority to compensate for it . A difference from normal stall is that after supersonic flow separation the lift remains proportional to angle of attack and so the aircraft continues to behave more or less normally except for the change in trim . Mach tuck may occur as low as Mach 0.7 depending on aircraft design , because the air moves faster over the wing . It can be delayed by using <URL> , because the shock waves only form when the air velocity component perpendicular to the wing exceeds speed of sound . Supersonic aircraft eventually encounter supersonic flow separation , but the lower surface lift is sufficient to balance the aircraft weight at that speed and altitude and the aircraft can continue flying with the upper surface flow separated . That 's not the case with most subsonic aircraft , which for efficiency reasons tend to cruise at altitudes where they have very small margin to stall . As the stall speed increases with altitude while speed of sound slightly decreases with the lower temperature there , the stall speed will eventually equal critical mach number , which creates the <URL> and absolute ceiling for the aircraft . For most civilian transport aircraft the range between stall speed and critical mach number ( where drag increases and supersonic flow separation would begin ) reduces considerably at cruise altitude , but they usually do n't have enough engine power to reach the actual coffin corner .
They are basically window-shaped screens , displaying a feed from a camera so the middle aisle suits ( where the alternative is a wall ) passengers can enjoy the " view " . The most interesting thing to me are the virtual windows . First Class passengers in the middle suite will have a set of " windows " like everyone else , only theirs will show images from an outside camera . <URL>
A gust alleviation system is a control system fitted to some Fly-by-wire ( FBW ) aircraft that reduces the effect of gust loads on the aircraft by deflecting control surfaces such as ailerons , rudder and elevators . The system works by measuring the upward acceleration of the aircraft and comparing that with the acceleration commanded by the ( auto ) pilot . A feedback loop adds a correction signal to the signals controlling the deflection of the control surfaces in order to counteract the accelerations cause by wind gusts . In its simplest form the accelerations are sensed near the center of gravity of the aircraft . More advanced implementations work with multiple sensors in the body and in the wings . These gust alleviation systems do not only attempt to annul the effect of the gusts on the aircraft 's normal ( upward ) acceleration , they also reduce the wing bending moments . This is turn reduces metal fatigue . In the A380 the load alleviation system is nicknamed " valse des aileron " ( Waltz of the Ailerons ) because of the dancing movements of the aileron : <URL>
Qualifier : I am a master parachute rigger and taught sport skydiving for 10 years . Standard jump altitude is 12,000 feet AGL - this is one turn of the standard parachutist 's altimeter . This height provides 1 minute of freefall , is within reach of a Cessna with a decent engine and does not require supplementary oxygen . For most places , this means an operating altitude between 12,000 and 15,000 feet MSL . Dropzones in high areas like Denver will reduce their jump altitude to 9,500 feet AGL mainly because the piston-powered planes take too long to climb higher and/or the upper part of the climb runs into the oxygen zone .
A major advantage is standardization . An aircraft can be given a <URL> , and assuming everything goes to plan , everyone involved will be on the same page as to what is going to happen . When air traffic control instructs an aircraft to fly a departure procedure , a large volume of information ( e.g. climb to this altitude , turn this way , turn that way , etc. . . ) can be communicated just by giving the name of the procedure . This is far more convenient and predictable for both the crew and controllers than giving every instruction individually . This allows controllers to focus on preventing conflicts and dealing with abnormal situations rather than issuing routine instructions , and it reduces the risk those instructions may be miscommunicated or misunderstood . The procedure itself will have been developed by specialists based on all sorts of criteria , among them : Obstacle clearance . This can be anything from the huge mountain range near the airport to buildings to towers to anything else . The procedure can be designed with a required minimum rate of climb , and pilots can ensure they are able to meet that requirement to climb over any obstacles . Obstacles might also be virtual , such as restricted areas for military purposes . Noise abatement . Communities in the vicinity of airports often have noise complaints . Departure procedures can be designed to direct aircraft away from noise sensitive areas . Traffic flow . Near a busy airport , large numbers of aircraft are maneuvering at low altitudes . Standardizing departure and arrival flows along certain corridors allows air traffic control to deal with aircraft moving in predictable ways and avoids potential conflict between different aircraft . Departure procedures help ensure separation between arriving and departing aircraft . Regional traffic flows . In congested airspace where several busy airports are located in close proximity , procedures can be developed to ensure that traffic to and from each airport are kept separated . A good example is the busy airspace around New York City , where <URL> are used to separate traffic into the region 's airports . Winds . Different runways may be used depending on wind conditions . There may be different departure procedures available for different runway configurations and/or universal departure procedures that have different instructions depending on the runway used . Navigational aids . While modern <URL> procedures are now available , traditional departure procedures guide aircraft from the runway through routes navigable through NAVAIDS like <URL> and <URL> onto established <URL> . Of course , an aircraft flying a departure procedure can always be given instructions to deviate from that procedure if it becomes necessary , such as for other traffic . If conditions permit , it 's also possible for a controller to give a " shortcut " by circumventing part of the procedure , perhaps by turning early toward the next waypoint on the flight 's filed route .
According to <URL> it seems a " cruise captain " is the captain who flies only during the cruise stage of flight . You can find a <URL> but it does not elaborate much on the duties . To act as the pilot in command ( at least by FAA regs ) they would have to be current , and type certified in the aircraft in question . It seems the term is more a turn of phrase and the regulations are not any different for a cruise captain . On very long haul flights that may require 3 full crews , there will be a crew in the middle section of the flight that never sees takeoff or landing from the cockpit . The <URL> defines cruise captain in the foot note on page 3 . Cruise Captain in this report refers to a pilot certificated as cruise captain by the Malaysian Aviation Authority , and is qualified by the company to act as PIC during cruise only and who was engaged in the operation of the aircraft . It sounds like " Cruise Captain " in this case is a Malaysian Aviation Authority term ( although it may apply elsewhere as well ) . I am looking for the actual regulation that defines it but have not yet come across them .

Do two airlines have IATA code N8 ?
IATA issues duplicate airline codes to regional airlines where the codes are not likely to overlap , from <URL> : Controlled duplicates are issued to regional airlines whose destinations are not likely to overlap , so that the same code is shared by two airlines . This happens because IATA uses a 2-letter code for for airlines which has a limited range of available codes . Since NCA does n't operate a passenger service in the same region as Fika Salaama , it would be very unlikely to confuse the two .
It looks to me like the <URL> you quoted is unreliable or at least not current , e.g. it gives results for codes QQQ and ZZZ too , but they <URL> . The actual IATA code for <URL> seems to be MZX . Anyway , there 's no particular reason why <URL> , ZZZ or any other specific combination should be assigned ; they just <URL> . There 's also no reason why IATA should assign a code to every airport : the US alone <URL> but only 500 or so have air carrier service .
The idea that missiles will be all a fighter aircraft needs was prevalent in the late Fifties . The <URL> Phantom II carried initially only missiles , but at the start of the Vietnam war this turned out to be inadequate . The long-range missiles back then were rather unreliable , and in a real conflict things turn out always different than anticipated . As <URL> said , the plan is the first casualty of war . F-4s frequently found themselves in close-combat situations for which they were inadequately prepared . Even today , a gun gives the pilot a lot more options , and if the situation is unclear , close-up visual inspection before shooting is still vital to avoid <URL> . From the F-4C on , F-4s were equipped with a gun .
In short : the 24 bit address is critical on the technical layer of Air Traffic Control , but it is not used in the operational level . For identification of aircraft and association to flight plans , the air traffic controllers and the flight data processing systems rely mostly on the Mode A code and the aircraft ID ( call sign ) transmitted by the transponder . The ICAO 24-bit aircraft address is an essential element of the way Mode S radar and TCAS work . Before Mode-S radar , only modes A and C were used by civil ATC secondary radars . Mode A and Mode C are unaddressed ; every transponder receiving a Mode A or Mode C interrogation will reply * . This causes two problems , garbling and FRUIT . Garbling is caused by the overlap of replies from multiple transponders . A transponder replies on 1090 MHz in the from of a number of pulses . For Mode A &amp; C , there are at most 12 pulses between a set of framing pulses . When multiple aircraft reply to the same interrogation , these pulses mix up and it becomes difficult to find out which transponder sent which pulse . This leads to false altitudes or false squawk codes . FRUIT ( False Replies Unsynchronised to Interrogator Transmission ) is caused by replies that are triggered by other radars . When multiple radars operate in an area , transponders can be quite busy and the radar is easily mislead by a reply to another radar . In addition to the timing ( range ) being wrong , the reply can be Mode A ( squawk code ) while the radar interrogated Mode C ( altitude ) . There is no way to see what kind ( A or C ) reply was sent . To overcome these problems of Mode A/C , Mode S was introduced . Mode S is quite different from Mode A/C and requires a more sophisticated radar and transponder . It uses the 24 bit address to distinguish responses from various aircraft and to interrogate specific aircraft . Most Mode S interrogations are addressed ; the interrogation contains the unique 24 bit address of the aircraft it is interrogating . This reduces the probability of garbling since other aircraft will not reply Unaddressed Mode S interrogations will solicit replies that contain the address of interrogator ( radar ) . This prevents FRUIT since the radar can verify that the reply is correctly addressed . Unlike Mode A/C which does not have any error checking , a Mode S reply contains a 24 bit CRC check code . Mode S Altitude and identity ( squawk ) replies have their own identifier so they can be distinguished . Mode S radars can be operated in clusters and coordinate between them who is interrogating which aircraft at which time . This further reduces the message load and garbling / fruit probability . For TCAS , the Mode S address is used to distinguish replies for various aircraft in the vicinity of the own aircraft . The TCAS transponder interrogates omnidirectionally ( in all directions ) and get 's replies from all direction . Again , this is very susceptible to Garbling and FRUIT . Whilst TCAS can work with Mode A/C , for its reliability and coordination of resolution advisories , the 24-bit address is crucial .
Essentially they plan on some fraction of the fleet undergoing some sort of maintenance check at any one time , so they build their flying schedule around the remaining fraction . And then there is some amount of flex due to things needing unscheduled maintenance or coming out of maintenance early . What makes the task easier is the fact that maintenance needs can be forecast fairly far in advance , and so the schedules can be built around a knowledge of how many aircraft are likely to be available . As an illustration ( not necessarily representative of any particular airline 's actual numbers ) , let 's say you have a fleet of 200 aircraft , and you know that on average each aircraft will be down for two 2-week heavy maintenance checks each year . That works out to essentially one month out of 12 , each aircraft is down , or a little under 10 % of the time . Add in a little time for shorter maintenance visits ( but still longer than an overnight ) , plus an allowance for the fact that some aircraft just need unscheduled work , and the maintenance planners may end up telling you to plan on 175 aircraft available each day . So that 's what you build your schedule around . Now let 's say that one aircraft takes a birdstrike &amp; an engine needs to be changed . That is now a hole in the schedule . It can be covered by cancelling a flight ( undesirable , but always an option ) . If an aircraft is finished with maintenance ahead of schedule ( say it was scheduled down all day for some work , but the work is actually done by noon ) , that aircraft may be able to be put into service . Perhaps it 's possible to delay some sort of minor maintenance a day ( not a heavy check , but something quicker ) and essentially create one aircraft-day of capacity , and push the check off to a weekend day when the schedule uses fewer aircraft . Or maybe the schedule was built with one or two aircraft available as spares that day . Depending on a variety of factors , spares may or may not be available , or even deliberately built into the schedule at all . Having an A-380 sitting around unused all day is an EXPENSIVE insurance policy against something unforeseen happening , but cancelling a flight on something that big is an expensive event when it happens ! If you operate all out of one giant hub and you know that your fleet of 500 aircraft ( flying 450 lines every day ) is likely to have 2-4 aircraft every day go to the hanger for unexpected maintenance , it 's probably a good financial decision to allocate two or three of those lines as dedicated spares . If your aircraft operate a point-to-point schedule , it 's harder ( or unfeasible ) to keep a spare aircraft at every airport you serve , " just in case " something happens to break there . There are complicated decisions that airlines will continuously evaluate to find what balance works best for their particular operation . In some cases , it may be possible to substitute an aircraft from a different fleet for a broken jet ... an MD80 goes to the hanger , and a 737 with a reserve crew flies the rest of the day that the MD80 would have flown . Or maybe a 757 broke , and the decision is to use the 737 to cover the flight , and re-accommodate the extra passengers that the 757 could hold that the 737 now ca n't . That 's a tactical decision that the airline 's operations center will make , considering the availability of both aircraft and crews , as well as the passenger loads . ( They also may pull a " healthy " 757 off of its less full schedule to fly in place of the broke 757 , use a 737 that was n't going to be very full to cover that 757 's route , put an RJ on the 737 's route that day , and cancel the RJ 's flights " due to maintenance . " And if that inconveniences 4 flights of 40-50 people who mostly just get delayed a few hours , that 's probably a better plan than stranding two flights of 200 people who 'd otherwise have no way to get where they 're going until tomorrow or later . )
In the US , yes . Kerosene [ for use in aviation ] is taxed at $ 0.244 per gallon unless a reduced rate applies . These taxes mainly fund airport and Air Traffic Control operations by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , of which commercial aviation is the biggest user ( <URL> ) . More information from <URL> . In the UK , it <URL> on the user . Aviation turbine fuel used for private pleasure flying : # 0.5795 per litre Aviation gasoline ( Avgas ) : # 0.3770 per litre Air transport <URL> . Furthermore : Article 24 of the [ 1944 Convention of International Civil Aviation ] requires all contracting states not to charge duty on aviation fuel already on board any aircraft that has arrived in their territory from another contracting state . Further to this , the exemption of airlines from national taxes and customs duties on a range of aviation-related goods , including parts , stores and fuel is a standard element of the network of bilateral ' Air Service Agreements ' ( ASAs ) between individual countries .
Nontowered airports absolutely can have ILS approaches , and it 's fairly common , though of course not as common as at towered fields . Two examples in my neck of the woods are <URL> and <URL> . Also , at many towered airports , the tower is not 24/7 and closes at night . If such an airport has an ILS , it 's still available after the tower closes ; ATC services for IFR approaches are provided by a nearby/higher facility like a TRACON or ARTCC , just like a nontowered field . Two examples of this in my neck of the woods are <URL> and <URL> . I am not , however , aware of any Cat II or III ILS approaches at nontowered fields . Protecting ILS Critical Areas is usually the responsibility of the tower , but even VFR aircraft are prohibited from entering the ILS Critical Area when the tower is closed : ( 1 ) Localizer Critical Area . Except for aircraft that land , exit a runway , depart , or execute a missed approach , vehicles and aircraft are not authorized in or over the critical area when an arriving aircraft is inside the outer marker ( OM ) or the fix used in lieu of the OM . <URL>
Because there is no need for more engines . Though one can argue that losing one engine in a twin results in loss of half the thrust , the question is how often does that happen . Engine reliability has improved significantly through the years and engine failures are quite rare today . I 'm not sure how ground clearance is an advantage for quads . For quad engined aircraft using today 's high bypass turbofans , the inboard engines would have to be mounted higher for suffecient ground clearance - this is actually a disadvantage as it results in a longer landing gear . In aircraft , more engines means more ( cost and ) maintenance and in a way , more things to fail , as there are more subsystems . In effect , there is no great reliability advantage of quads over twins . One main reason for having more than two engines , ETOPS certification , is no longer relevant . In fact most of the longest routes in the world are flown by the 777 , a twin . The best way is to look at the market - there are no quad engined aircraft under development and most of the aircraft in order are twins ( A380 and 747-8s are struggling to get orders ) . This clearly shows that the customers prefer twin engines over quads .
They do in fact exist , though they often use smaller helicopters . A Google search on the term " heli taxi " yields thousands of results , and while a lot are probably irrelevant , the first few pages give hundreds of operators around the world , ranging from companies ferrying passengers between airports and major cities to companies servicing oil platforms at sea , islands too small to have airfields , etc. .
Each airborne flight has only one flightplan , which was submitted for that particular flight . The routing is embedded into that flightplan and only that one routing is valid for that flight . In case the routing is no longer available for the next flight due to airspace closure via NOTAM or airways being restricted by time of flight / day of flight , another routing will be used for that flight and submitted in the flightplan . In case the routing needs to be changed for an already airborne flight , a new IFR clearance is read to the crew en-route , which alters the existing flightplan . Alternate routings are usually managed by the airline 's dispatch / planning centre and the best routing for a specific flight is created by the dispatchers , taking into account weather , NOTAMS , restrictions and many other factors . En-route changes to a flightplan are made by ATC units and their data processing centres , if an impromptu change needs to be made due to airspace closures or other restrictions coming into effect which were unforseen .
Yes . Fighter aircraft have air conditioning systems . In general , they are called as Environmental Conditioning Systems ( ECS ) . Their primary functions ( as far as cockpit goes ) include , Cockpit Pressurization Heating/Cooling/air-conditioning Windshield anti-fog/anti-ice The systems usually use conditioned engine bleed air or this purpose . The cockpit air conditioning is usually managed by the pilot . For example , in case of F-15 , the <URL> : <URL> Image from f-15e . info with the available controls listed as , TEMP switch : A three-way switch to manage cockpit temperature . When AUTO , cockpit temperature is automatically maintained at the temperature selected on the TEMP knob . When MANUAL , cockpit temperature may be changed with the knob , but not maitained automatically . When OFF , it shuts down off ECS air . TEMP knob : A rotary knob to set the cockpit temperature . FLOW switch : A three-way switch to select air flow . MIN , MAX and NORM settings are available for minimum/maximum/normal air flow , respectively . FLOW knob : A four-position knob to set the air source . When BOTH , bleed air is supplied from both engines . When L ENG or R ENG , bleed air is supplied from the left/right engine only . When OFF , no bleed air is supplied . The following image shows the other controls associated with ECS . <URL> Image from f-15e . info
1 . Money Meals are available at different prices . Most US airlines know you are n't choosing them on the basis of cuisine and pick the lowest priced meal they can get away with . Other airlines eg Emirates , Singapore compete by offering high customer services and so invest more money in better food and service . 2 . Culture Airlines which are mostly flying a home market will adapt the food to the traditions of the country . EL-AL are n't going to be serving bacon cheese-burgers and Air India used to do very good veggie curries .
The answer : High heels ! The <URL> would punch a hole in the aluminium or composite flooring , and a carpet is the lightest way to distribute the loads such that the local pressure from high heels can be tolerated . This is the real reason . From <URL> On the floor of the fuselage also very high localized loads can occur , especially from small-heeled shoes . Therefore floors need a strong upper surface to withstand high local stresses . Other reasons are improved noise absorption and damping of vibrations . Nobody likes it when the floor panels start to resonate when excited by some engine or pump frequency . With composite panels now in widespread use for cabin interiors , manufacturing flaws need to be covered , and carpets serve this purpose well . From <URL> : Because sandwich panel facesheets are very thin , core print-through is common . Further , pinholes can form as phenolic resins outgas during reaction and cure . Therefore , panels visible to passengers typically are surfaced with some type of decorative material to cover surface flaws . Floor panels can be painted or covered with flame-retardant carpet .
The air conditioning system on board airliners is an open system : it scoops up air from the atmosphere , compresses it , expels it through the cabin vents , and then outflows it through discharge valves . In modern airliners there is a certain amount of re-circulation : the expelled air was of such good quality that it seemed a waste to just dump it in the atmosphere . <URL> <URL> In the A320 family of airliners : Outside air is compressed in the engine compressors , part of it is tapped of as bleed air : already compressed and warmed , it is used for refreshing the cabin air ( marked green ) . Temperature and pressure regulators then provide automatic mixture control for the amount of outflow : the outflow valve is regulated , decreasing the opening results in increase of cabin pressure and decrease of flow . The recirculation fans regulate how much air is re-used , after being filtered through HEPA filters which remove pathogens and other nasty stuff . The whole cabin air volume is refreshed every 2 - 3 minutes , as also referenced in <URL> : with such a frequent refresh rate , it would be pretty safe to assume that there will always be roughly the percentage of oxygen in the cabin as there is in the outside atmosphere ( see below for the actual percentage ! ) . People have climbed to the <URL> without the help of oxygen masks , and that summit is about at cruising altitude of an airliner . AFAIK , the aircon system does not have oxygen sensors , but it does have temperature and pressure sensors which are of more immediate concern . Low concentration toxic gases are much more dangerous than a drop in oxygen concentration . In fact , the human body makes use of this : when holding your breath , the urge of breathing fresh air again after a while comes from the <URL> , not from any decrease in oxygen . So CO$ _ 2 $ detectors on board of aircraft would make sense , as would detectors for the very lethal carbon monoxide . These are available , even in the form of a key hanger for GA pilots ( not including any links due to them being adverts ) . There have been reports of dizziness and fainting on board of airliners , and investigations into these . <URL> did not reveal a particularly high carbon dioxide content : Discussion With additional measurement reports pending , I found in-flight cabin air quality measurements of oxygen to be relatively stable , ranging from 11.2 % to 12.5 % . Typical outdoor CO2 levels are between 350-400 ppm ( 0.035 % - 0.04 % ) or up to 500 ppm by some sources . Carbon dioxide levels measured in-flight in the aircraft cabin ranged between 0.04 % or 400 ppm and 0.1 % or 1000 ppm to date in our studies and were measured at close to 0.5 % or 5,000 ppm in earlier studies . As indicated at CO2 HEALTH EFFECTS , occupants are unlikely to be affected or to notice CO2 levels under 2 % or 20,000 ppm - a far higher number than in-flight aircraft cabin carbon dioxide levels . Notice that the oxygen contents on board is a bit over half of that of the outside air - the cause of dizzy passengers ? Reports of dizziness do keep appearing , and nothing beats direct detection of noxious gases by a sensor . Problem is , there are so many of them . Oxygen , carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide sensors would be good candidates for inclusion into the aircon systems . On your second part of the question Is there any situation ( emergency or not ) in which some other gas could pressurize the cabin and lower the O2 percentage inside it ? Yes , in air conditioning systems that use bleed air there definitely is , an engine malfunction can for instance inject gases from burning oil into the cabin air , a problem that was reported a few times for the BAE 146 . <URL> The British Aerospace BAe 146 was the aircraft type most commonly involved in fumes/smoke events when taking into account flying activity . The Airbus A380 , Boeing 767 , Embraer EMB-120 and E-190 were among other aircraft types that also had a higher than average rate of fumes/smoke occurrences over the period . The most common source of fumes/smoke was aircraft systems issues , primarily relating to failure or malfunction of electrical and auxiliary power unit ( APU ) systems . Equipment and furnishings also featured highly as a source of fumes and smoke . Within this category , air conditioning and galley equipment were the most common sources of fumes/smoke . External sources of fumes/smoke and cargo/baggage related events were relatively rare .
I have worked on large and small aircraft . You will find a 400hz power bus only on large aircraft . The reason is the greater quantity of poles in the generator and hence weight . Smaller aircraft use a 28v DC system for the avionics .
I 'm no expert , but I can think of two general reasons : risk of incapacitation , and general physical limitations ( reaction speed , stamina , the ability to maintain concentration for extended periods etc. ) . The age 65 limit only applies to part 121 ATP pilots , by the way ; you can still be a commercial or private pilot for as long as you can keep getting a valid medical . Older people are simply at <URL> and many other medical conditions , and they 're also much more likely to require medication that may not be approved by the FAA or other national authorities . Of course that does n't mean that every older pilot is the same but I guess that the FAA has decided that since the risks increase with age , at some point they become unacceptable . To understand the specific reasons for that decision you would probably need to dig up the original <URL> or transcripts of the public debate/hearings , but I have no idea if that 's possible or not . Then the other aspect is general physical and mental condition . They both deteriorate with age , and the NTSB sometimes <URL> as a potential factor in accidents : On the day of the accident , the pilot had flown several formation sorties . The day was hot , and the formation activities were demanding . The accident flight was relatively long , and the co-owner of the airplane guessed it was about 45 minutes long . Most formation sorties were 30 minutes or less . The accident pilot was in his early 70s and was by far the oldest member of the flight . Due to the pilot 's age , the demanding schedule , and the length of the formation sorties , fatigue could have been a factor , although it could not be conclusively determined . Of course , any discussion like this is a generalization and I 'm sure it 's easy to find individual 70-year old pilots or controllers who are ' sharper ' than younger ones ( after all , experience counts for a lot too ) . But there 's no escaping the overall pattern that older people in general are more prone to medical issues and less physically/mentally capable than younger ones , and at least one US court <URL> that there 's no effective way to determine individual risk so a general rule is not discriminatory : The court also concluded that ExxonMobil had established , through the testimony of several medical experts , that the risk of sudden incapacitation in flight significantly increased with age , and that there are no adequate means of individually testing each pilot to determine whether a pilot was at risk to suffer such an incapacitation .
You can just look them up . Here 's a screenshot from Flightradar24 taken at about 1410 UTC on 22 May 2017 . I imagine in an emergency they 'd be given priority just like any other aircraft in distress . The crew might have specific orders covering that situation that requires them to head for a military base . Their operation is so secret , though , that I doubt we 'd find out unless a emergency occurs . <URL>
This depends on the airline , but to answer your question : Yes , some airlines do have electrical outlets in the cabin . It seems that since the FAA relaxed the rules on portable devices that the airlines are seeing the need to add them to more of their fleet . For example : US Airways has a <URL> which tells which of their aircraft have outlets . There are some in both coach and first class . United has an <URL> whichs shows that a lot of their fleet has electrical outlets and more are coming . There are different types of outlets , and some of them require an adapter to use while others do n't .
How the Swiss Air pilots got paid would , of course , depend on Swiss Air policy . I suspect pay policies vary greatly between airlines and countries , but for what it 's worth below are the pay policies for the four airlines I worked for in the 1980s and 1990s . At all four I would have been credited with only the time from push back until the parking brake was set on return insofar as flight time was concerned , but as you will see that would n't have made any significant difference in my pay . commuter # 1 no union -- a straight salary but with an hourly addition if your flight time went over a minimum , which it never did . commuter # 2 no union -- a straight salary regardless of the number of hours flown , but they never abused that . 747 freight carrier no union -- a straight salary plus an hourly addition if your flight time went over a minimum , which it occasionally did . 747 passenger carrier in-house union -- flight time hourly pay with a guaranteed minimum . You always went substantially over the minimum . They tried to get you as close as possible to the regulatory max of 1000 hours a year . Additionally , they had a policy that whenever your duty time ( as opposed to flight time ) went over 16 consecutive hours , you got paid for each hour over that at a rate of 1.5 times your regular hourly flight time rate . Also , you were paid half your regular hourly flight rate while deadheading . Then , if you had less than 8 hours ( I might not be remembering that number correctly ) between assignments , your duty time continued . My first assignment for this airline was a 32-hour duty day . I operated from JFK to AMS ( Amsterdam ) , so my duty time started at show time , 2 hours before departure . At Amsterdam 5 hours on the ground then commercialling ( riding in the back on another airline ) to SIN ( Singapore ) and then to CGK ( Jakarta ) positioning for a Hajj flight . Crew scheduling regularly abused pilots , but nobody complained because you were being so well paid when they did abuse you . The breakdown for hours at the flight time rate for that trip was approximately : 7.5 hours operating time JFK-AMS 8 hours deadheading pay AMS-SIN-CGK ( half of 16 hours riding in the back ) 24 hours extended duty pay ( 32 hours duty time minus 16 hour threshold times 1.5 ) So , 39.5 pay hours at the regular new first officer rate of 55 per hour = 2,172.50 , which looked pretty good to me since I had come from a carrier than paid me a straight 4500 per month salary as a 747 captain . I ca n't remember all the flight time/duty time details , but back then at least the international rules were much less restrictive than the domestic rules . Also , back then it was common practice to do things like scheduling a flight for , say , 11:59 for regulatory purposes , when everyone knew it would go slightly over the 12-hour international rule of the time . It may be worth noting here , that the mind-set of the crew , at least the cockpit crew , is totally different from that of passengers . The passenger wants to get from point A to point B , whereas the crew is simply ' at work ' regardless of whether they go anyplace or not . Consequently , at least in my experience and opinion , delays are n't nearly as frustrating to crew as they are to passengers .
In an aircraft the brake pedals control the respective side brakes . This allows for the pilot to turn the aircraft not only with the pivoting nose wheel ( if it has one ) but also with the brakes . This allows for a very tight turning radius . <URL> ( <URL> ) If each pedals controls different sets of wheels eg the left wheels and the right wheels of the main gear , is that not a safety flaw rather than measure given that at any point in time , It is by design to allow for the tight turning . Some smaller aircraft also do not have a steerable nose wheel so differential braking is the only option . it is impossible for the pilot to apply an equal amount of pressure to the brakes ? Pushing equally on each toe pedal will result in equal brake operation . Is n't ABS enough to the point that only one pedal is enough . The pedals allow for brake steering which a single pedal would prevent . <URL> but that simply prevents the tires from skidding . Finally do both captain and pilot step on the brakes at landing . IF not then why have two pedals ? Im not sure , when I fly with an instructor or co-pilot in smaller planes only one person operates the brakes .

What are SIDS and STARs ?
Both are predefined routes through the air which connect the airport areas ( terminal areas ) to the enroute airway system in a way remotely similar to local roads that everyone follows from and to highways . This ensures ( in theory ) an orderly fashion of after departure reaching ( SID ) and leaving towards the airport ( STAR ) the enroute airspaces for all aircraft . SID stands for <URL> . STAR stands for <URL> . The links touch upon everything else .
The MiG-31 is an all new design with higher strength for low-level flight and new engines . The reason it looks just like the MiG-25 has to do with the structure of the Soviet aviation industry . The basic shape is first defined by the Central Aerodynamic and Hydrodynamic Institute ( <URL> is the abbreviation of its Russian name ) and then given to the design bureaus which do the mechanical design . Production is then relegated to dedicated manufacturers which build the designs of different bureaus in parallel . Both aircraft were designed as interceptors . The main difference is the advanced radar , digital data links and the more powerful engines of the MiG-31 which made a longer fuselage necessary . The MiG-25 radar , a development from the 1960s , could only detect high-flying targets , while the <URL> radar of the MiG-31 can also detect and track low flying aircraft ( <URL> capability ) ; a necessity after NATO changed its strategy to <URL> flying to avoid detection . If you need to tell both apart on pictures , look for these features : While the main landing gear of the MiG-25 has a large , single wheel , the main gear of the MiG-31 uses two smaller wheels in a staggered arrangement . <URL> MiG-31 main landing gear ( picture by Burkhard Domke <URL> ) While most MiG-25 were single seaters , the MiG-31 has two occupants , a pilot and a weapon systems officer behind him . Two-seater versions of the MiG-25 can be easily distinguished because the two cockpits are separate units , the front cockpit replacing the radar . <URL> MiG-31 on the ground with canopies open ( picture <URL> ) The wing root of the MiG-31 has a small strake added while the wing of the MiG-25 is a pure trapeze with a straight leading edge . The picture below shows the MiG-25 in black lines and the MiG-31 overlaid in red . <URL>
Fuel bias is as you described it . As the engine ages , it burns more fuel than a brand new one . The fuel flow ( and drag ) corrections are entered into the FMS . This would allow the FMS calculated quantity not to disagree with the tanks totalizer . The figures are based off previous flights and engine tests . Maintenance personnel can refine the database by entering correction factors for drag and fuel flow . ( 737 manual ) also There are also " biases " to consider , depending on the make and model of aircraft . For example with Gulfstream aircraft , our flight planning experts typically add a 16 % bias for flights of less than three hours . However , biases depend on the age of the aircraft , how the operator flies it , planned flight level , and speed . So , it 's best practice for operators to compare actual fuel burns with flight plan burns to confirm accuracy . ( <URL> ) Boeing does not call it bias when I checked the 787/737 manuals , but ' bias ' is likely a flight planning software term . <URL> ( <URL> ) From a flight planner for a flight sim . <URL> ( <URL> ) Random real flight plan . Note : company software differs . <URL> Boeing 787 FMS interface where the drag and fuel flow corrections are entered .
<URL> Frankfurt Airport ; a mosaic of concrete and asphalt The runways at Frankfurt Airport are asphalt ( old satellite imagery shows that they were concrete before ) , and the airport handles plenty of Superjumbos , the Airbus A380 , so it 's not a matter of handling heavy planes . All runways in big airports , even those covered in asphalt , have reinforced concrete foundations that vary in depth . They 're deepest where the touchdown zones are located , shallower elsewhere . That 's why runway extensions usually just add extra takeoff distance , but the landing zones remain the same , creating a <URL> . <URL> Displaced threshold ; can exist for other reasons <URL> Zoom in You 'll see almost all the parking spots and holding areas for the runways are concrete , as well as the runway exits . This is where a plane is expected to be stationary . Concrete handles such stationary loads pretty well , while on a warm day the asphalt would deform . Asphalt is called a flexible surface ; concrete is called a rigid surface . <URL> ( PCN ) is a standard used in combination with the <URL> ( ACN ) to indicate the strength of a runway , taxiway , or apron ( ramp ) . Exposed concrete is notorious for cracking when exposed to extreme high and low temperatures . It 's also more expensive to install and repair . But overall can be cheaper to install if you 're already laying down concrete elsewhere , like most new airports , they just go for concrete everywhere , but it depends on where that new airport is located -- <URL> Hot Dubai ; asphalt almost everywhere except parking areas and hold short areas <URL> LAX ; good climate and budget ; concrete almost everywhere a plane touches The variables come down to climate , use , load , budget , job creation , maintenance , etc. . <URL> A single runway ( like at <URL> ) can also have both surfaces <URL> <URL> showing the PCN for all runways ; Flexible and Rigid <URL> ( <URL> ) Another point in favor of an asphalt runway , is that it 's more gentle on the tires during touchdown ( since it 's flexible ) . You can find runway data at <URL> for US airports , elsewhere you 'll need to check the airport 's <URL> , like <URL> for Amsterdam ; check the section 2.12 RUNWAY PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS . Or try searching for a nonofficial runway data repository , there could be one .
There is more information available from NATS on the website on <URL> [ TBS ] and from a very descriptive <URL> PDF . While Heathrow ( EGLL ) is the first airport where this is being researched and tested , there are als other works , such as a research paper called <URL> PDF which applies TBS at Charles Des Gaulles ( LFPG ) . The main focus of using TBS is to increase airport capacity during strong headwind operations , which significantly decrease groundspeed and therefore traffic flow . None of the papers I have found speak of hazards related to decreasing the lateral distance between flights . The general idea seems to be that the minimal safety gain accompanying lower groundspeeds due to strong headwinds ( lower GS means lower closure rate to objects / stationary traffic on ground ) can be partially sacrificed and offset by TBS to maintain airport capacity or reduce the impact of the strong headwinds on airport capacity . This sacrifice becomes available since stronger headwinds also aid the dissipation of wake vortex . The below table is based on own calculations , assuming constant approach speeds . It should show you how the time to cover a set distance increases with decreasing ground speeds , which means that e.g. it takes longer to cover 3nm to reach the runway threshold . Reducing the lateral separation ( the values chosen are deliberately a bit extreme , as none of the papers mentioned a formula to calculate TBS distances ) reduces time to cover the distance , but covering 2.5 nm at 130 GS is becoming quite close to 3nm at 150 GS .
Inspired by this question , I would like to know what the pro 's and con 's of the mostly used vacuum-gyro and the less used high-pressure-gyro is . It is largely related to the instruments in your aircraft but in reality its all about air pressure and the systems are really doing the same thing in the end of the day . Lets look at the evolution a bit , early aircraft that lacked an electrical system generally used a small external venturi to generate low pressure suction for the early gyro instruments . Note the venturi tube in front of the door about half way up the body on this early <URL> . <URL> ( <URL> ) Since it was easy to generate low pressure this way early instruments were built as suction based . As planes got faster and external ( drag educing ) things were removed these systems went internal . Since the instruments were already suction based it was logical to make engine ( or electrical ) suction pumps to drive them . When pumps moved into the engine compartment they came with some issues . Wet suction pumps have an oil issue that can seep into the system and cause issues with the instruments . That was solved with the advent of the dry pneumatic pump however that was a bit more susceptible to debris clogging but could provide both positive and negative pressure . <URL> . However the end result is that both systems provide the same outcome and in the view of the instruments there is no real difference . Gyro Instruments Within the case of the gyro instrument the air flows through the air seals of the gimbalsʼ bearings and across the rotor , spinning the rotor on its axes . The exhausting airflow from the rotor housing applies precession forces to maintain a reference to earth in the attitude gyro and the attitude of the aircraft in the directional gyro . The mechanics of the gyro instrument remain the same , whether it is driven by the airflow in a pressure or vacuum system . The air - flow through the instrument is a result of the differential pressure between the instrumentʼs air inlet and the air outlet ports . In a vacuum system the pressure at the air outlet port is lowered below atmospheric pressure . The differential pressure between the atmosphere and the pump now forces air to flow through the instrument . In a pressure system the pressure at the air inlet port is raised above atmospheric pressure and the airflow is in the same direction . So what are some pros and cons , In a vacuum system the filter is upstream and air is pulled through it and it does a good job of keeping the air clean . ... filtering the air entering the instrument . This filter will remove most contaminates from the air , but moisture is not one of them . Periodic replacement of this filter will ensure clean airflow through the instruments . While in pressure based systems the air filter is generally mounted in line but has a similar effect In a pressure system there is an inline filter in the line between the outlet port of the pump and the inlet port of the gyro instrument . This restricts , but does not completely stop , the flow of all contaminates to the instrument . However pressure systems have a moisture problem since the compression of air creates moisture , this may add moisture while a suction system will only draw ambient moisture . Unfortunately when air is compressed , moisture is created . Although the pressure is extremely low ( approximately 2.5 to 4.5 PSI ) , this system is no exception . Moisture is the No. 1 contaminate , contaminating the gyro bearings in a pressure system . The paper also outlines that both systems are susceptible to downtime due to pump inspections and system maintenance . Which is a con of both systems . Side-question : Are there any other ways to make the Artificial Horizon work ? <URL> <URL> ( <URL> )
Angle of Attack is the angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the relative wind . The elevator is also a " wing " in the effect that it is an airfoil . 1 ) Then what is the angle between the chord line of the elevator and relative wind ? Because if I am not wrong , by pitching the elevator up , the wing of an aircraft is subjected to the ' angle of attack ' . It 's also called " Angle Of Attack " . Pitching the elevator up also changes the angle of attack of the elevator . There are such conditions as elevator stall , although much less common than wing stall . 2 ) When you say angle of attack exceed critical angle of attack , is it because the elevator is pitched up thus creating wider angle between the chord line and the relative direction of the wind ? The " Critical AoA " is the angle at which the airfoil is generating the most lift . [ <URL> ] : The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient . This is also called the " stall angle of attack " . Below the critical angle of attack , as the angle of attack increases , the coefficient of lift ( Cl ) increases . At the same time , above the critical angle of attack , as angle of attack increases , the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface Usually when you exceed the critical AoA , the air on the upper surface of the airfoil de-laminates and becomes turbulent . This results in a loss of lift ( stall ) . <URL> <URL> 3 ) In the Air France 447 accident , the PF kept saying , keeps the wings level . What does it mean ? How can the wings be leveled when the angle of attack is so high ? Does keeping the wings level means reducing the angle of attack to zero ? I 'm not sure what context you are talking about . I 've read the transcripts pretty carefully and I do n't recall the PF saying to keep the wings level . The Captain said to descend , while the PF was trying to climb . The SIC was pushing the stick forward while the PF was pulling back , causing the wings to remain level ( or at a slight climb ) . Keeping the wings level ( avoiding an un-coordinated turn ) in a stall condition is the best way to avoid putting the aircraft into a spin . This is possibly what they meant , although they did n't know that they were in a stall ( or if they did , they were not reacting to it appropriately ) . Yes , leveling the wings would be making the AoA at zero ( zero meaning where the airfoil is developing lift , and depending on the bank angle ) , but only if there were positive airspeed to make the relative wind parallel with the chord . In the case of AF447 , the aircraft was falling out of the sky at a spectacular 15,000 FPM , which means that the relative wind to the airfoil was basically perpendicular . They did n't have the forward airspeed to change the AoA , so they should have lowered the nose to gain airspeed and decrease the AoA . The important thing to remember is that the pitch angle of the aircraft is not the same as the AoA . You can take an aircraft at zero forward speed and drop it straight down , the pitch angle will be zero but the AoA will be perpendicular .
These are indeed related to MRO activities . Line maintenance generally refers to minor , unscheduled or scheduled maintenance carried out on aircraft that occurs at or near the gate or terminal ( Tarmac ) , launch area , ready area , hardstand or alert area . This is usually carried out by the operator . This is the basic level of maintenance and is limited by the ground support equipment available . Third Party Base Maintenance refers to the base maintenance ( i.e. maintenance done in aircraft hangar with special tools ) carried out by a third party - other than the manufacturer and the operator . This is usually the next level of maintenance . Component maintenance refers to the maintenance carried out on some component removed from the aircraft ( for e.g. rotable or LRU ) due to fault or completion of specified service time in a dedicated shop or lab . These are usually done for avionics units , engines , transmission items etc. . This is usually done by the OEM or their authorized agent .
The oblique wing and the swing wing aim to reduce the drag over a wide range of speeds by changing the wing sweep . While the swing wing rotates a part of the wing to achieve this , the oblique wing rotates the whole wing . The first production aircraft with variable sweep wings was the <URL> , while the most famous one is the <URL> . <URL> " <URL> " by U.S. Navy - U.S. Navy National Museum of Naval Aviation photo No. 2011.003.301.027 . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . However , the only full sized aircraft to be produced with an oblique or pivot wing was the <URL> , which was strictly an experimental aircraft . <URL> " <URL> " by NASA - <URL> . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . A comparison between the two can be made like this : Aerodynamics : The oblique wing is much more refined aerodynamically compared to the swing wing and had lesser drag . In fact the AD-1 was designed to be as close to the optimal for all the flight regimes . Also , the aircraft was designed to have an elliptical lift distribution to reduce induced drag . on the other hand , the variable geometry aircraft did not offer any significant advantages over fixed wing baseline aircraft . However , the asymmetric stall of the oblique wing aircraft would cause problems as one side of the wing is swept forwards and the other side is swept towards the rear . Structure : The hinge was arguably the most critical structural part in variable sweep wing aircraft . The hinge should not only have a very high reliability , but also have the capacity to bear the high aerodynamic loads . <URL> " <URL> " by Sovxx - Own work . Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via <URL> . In this case , the swing wing aircraft are better off compared to the oblique wing aircraft as the amount of load on the hinge is significantly lower . For example , the oblique wing hinge has to take not only the weight of the entire aircraft wing ( the swing wing aircraft typically rotate only a part of the wing ) , but also the entire fuel load ( the amount of fuel carried in the variable part of the wing is significantly small ) . Also , the hinge should take the load of the control system too . Handling and Controls : The handling of the swing wing aircraft have been brought closer to the fixed wing aircraft over time . However , the handling qualities of AD-1 was found to be poor , with unusual trim requirements and inertial coupling affecting the <URL> . For instance , the AD-1 required about 10 ° of bank in order to trim the aircraft with no sideslip at 60 ° wing sweep.The aircraft also experienced pitch-roll coupling and the associated aeroelastic effects made for unpleasant handling qualities above 45 degrees sweep . One advantage of the oblique wing aircraft is that the center of lift and mass does n't move as the wings are swept . This happens in the swing wing aircraft and the control system is complicated Engine and payload In case of swing wing aircraft , the engines can be mounted in the fuselage ( like F-14 ) or in the ( fixed part of ) wing itself ( like B-1 ) . In case of the oblique wing aircraft , locating the engines anywhere except the fuselage is effectively ruled out . In case of military aircraft , use of hardpoints in the variable point of the wing is limited ( for one thing , this will increase the load on the hinge ) . This is a much more serious problem for oblique wing aircraft as this limits the payload that could be carried . However , the main reason for the lack of further development of oblique wing aircraft is their unusual and unpleasant control qualities .
The difference is in mission , and the difference is non trivial . The twin rotor configuration goes back to the 1960 's . ( <URL> . The CH-47 replaced it in Viet Nam in 1965 ) . Chinook became the Army 's heavy tactical lift during Vietnam . Like the C-130 , that particular design is timeless . The CH-47F is the current configuration . It carries about twice as much as a CH-46 could . It is also one of the faster helicopters there is ( it can fly almost 200kts ) though the CH-53E has flown faster . The CH-46 was an adaptation of the same idea , but made smaller and marinized : it had to meet a host of Marine Corps and Navy requirements to fit on amphibious ships and supply ships . Space and fit are non-trivial limitations when writing requirements for naval aircraft . ( As an aside , the US military no longer operates the CH-46 . It appears that the last CH-46 squadron in the USMC , <URL> , let go of its last Phrogs in 2015 <URL> <URL> ) Not having to take off some power for a tail rotor is an advantage . The CH-46 mission for the Marine Corps was vertical assault ( it carried more than a Huey and predecessors like <URL> ) ; for the Navy , it was the <URL> mission . The payload and maneuvering benefits from the lack of a tail rotor made the VERTREP mission a perfect fit for the CH-46 . One of the challenges in ship borne operations is the ability to run simultaneously resupply by air and ship-to-ship ( <URL> ) while not being operationally constrained ( for the ship drivers ) " getting into the wind . " That limitation tail rotor helicopters do n't handle as well as the CH-46 . ( That point was a core argument against CH-60S as replacement for CH-46 ; but that 's another matter ) . I 've flown VERTREP in helicopters with tail rotors ; the CH-46 was less constrained than we were . What about Marine and Navy Heavy Lift missions ? The Marine Heavy lift ( analogue to the CH-47 for the Army and Air Force CSAR ) is fulfilled with the CH-53 , and has been for over 40 years . The CH-53 can fold its tail to fit on a ship . You ca n't fold a Chinook . The Navy VOD ( heavy lift ) was handled by CH-53 's for 40 years . <URL> ( Flexible , that 's helicopters ! ) Smart Requirement Writing led to smart choices " The Military " would have made a significant mistake " to just make one type " since back in the 60s and 70s , making mission specific aircraft was the way to go . Quite frankly , it makes for cheaper aircraft to build it for one core mission . ( See the A-10 as a fine example of that ) . Note : An early failure in " one size fits all " was the F-111 . A current " one size fits all " example of cost going through the roof is F-35 . At the time the CH-46 and CH-47 were procured , the military was smart : apply the KISS principle to get aircraft that fit mission requirements . The Army and Navy mission requirements were not identical . ( So how do I know all that ? 25 years Navy pilot ( helicopters , ASW warfare specialty , did other stuff like Vertrep ... ) , significant experience in multi-service operations , and a few years having to work in an acquisition job . )
The key piece of knowledge to understand a FBW system is that you need to differentiate between signalling and actuation . signalling is what tells the control surface to move and to what position . In old airplanes , this was by steel wires . In FBW airplanes it 's by copper wires carrying an electrical voltage . actuation is what actually moves the controls surfaces to the commanded position , the muscles . Traditionally this is hydraulics , but you can also find electric actuators these days . For the Airbus , Normal , Alternate &amp; Direct all use electrical signalling ( whether produced by computers or not ) . But what to do if there 's no electrics ? That 's Mechanical backup , where you have steel-wire signalling of specific surfaces .
It is an historical name . The first polars were drawn by Otto Lilienthal in polar coordinates . <URL> ( sorry , German link ) we find an example :
The T-tail positions the horizontal stabilizer out of the turbulent " prop wash " . This reduces the strength and weight that would be required of the structure if it had to endure the aerodynamic stress behind the two propellers ( which is terrific ) . This simple shape has everything to do with parts and assembly simplicity and low cost for the homebuilder . Drag increases exponentially with speed ; so for slow aircraft , draggy shaped components are much less a problem .
It 's tough to tell based on your question , but I think you are talking about an inspection due to an over-G reported on a flight either by the pilot or the flight control system post-flight report . Maintainers will do inspections of known stress points on the aircraft to look for breaks , cracking or loosened parts and then declare it safe for flight or fix anything out of tolerance . For a low level over-G , this could be pulling a few panels . For higher level over-Gs it could be 8 hours worth of work
You can start with the FAA 's reference page for <URL> . It will point you to the FAA <URL> General Aviation Airman Designee Handbook . It 's all there . You 'll need to talk to your local Flight Standards District Office ( FSDO ) as they are responsible for administering the program . The general eligibility requirements are : General Eligibility Requirements . The managing office must carefully consider all of the requirements before designating an applicant or renewing a designee . The general requirements for appointment , which are reviewed by the NEB , are : a. Minimum Age . Minimum age of 23 years for all designees . b. Personality Traits . Must exhibit integrity , professionalism , and sound judgment . c. Training Requirement . Must have satisfactorily completed the applicable training requirement before appointment/renewal as a designee . d. Knowledge of Guidance Materials . Must have access to , and adequate knowledge of , the current regulations , policies , directives , and related guidance material appropriate to authorized functions . e. Command of English Language . Must be able to fluently read , write , speak , and understand the English language . f. Objectivity . Must maintain the highest degree of objectivity while performing authorized functions . g. Good Record . Must have a good record in the aviation industry . h. Technology Access . Must have internet access , as well as access to a computer and printer with hardware/software sufficient to support the required activities . Note : A designee is not required to be a U.S. citizen . Note : Additional eligibility requirements for specific designee types are included in the applicable designee type specific chapters ( Chapters 6 and 7 ) of this order . As to what the FAA is looking for ( this from a DPE , I used to work with ) , the FAA is looking for someone they can trust to perform the job to standards . They expect a DPE candidate to be an experienced instructor . They 'll look at the the history of students signed off for check rides by that person . If any significant number of recommended students are n't passing check rides or ' just squeak by ' , it wo n't reflect favorably on the applicant . OTOH , if the recommended students are well prepared and almost always pass , that 's a good indication . That shows the instructor 's standards are the same as the FAA 's . ' Openings ' for DPE positions are driven by supply and demand . The purpose of any Designee is to help manage the workload imposed on the FAA 's office . If the office can handle the number of applicant 's , they wo n't add a DPE . And if an existing DPE is n't performing a minimum of examinations , they 'll lose the Designation . Most of the DPEs I 've known worked for flight schools where there was a steady stream of students .
Lycoming engines have the camshaft above the crankshaft , and Continental engines have the cam below the crankshaft . This seems to keep the Conti cams better oiled and therefore less susceptible to corrosion .
The primary advance in the transistor era is the <URL> . It 's essentially a fly-by-wire throttle , incorporating rate limiters to key engine inputs such as fuel flow rate , and performing automated monitoring tasks to reduce flight crew workload . Prior to the FADEC system , sufficiently complex jet aircraft required a crew member , the flight engineer , whose primary task was monitoring and maintaining engine performance in flight . Additionally , jets without a FADEC require particular attention paid by the pilot ( s ) to the rate at which the throttle is adjusted ; you ca n't just firewall it for a takeoff as that will cause a compressor stall .
Manual thrust means that the engine thrust corresponds directly to the position of the thrust lever . Autothrust means that a target speed is dialed into the system ( using a knob that is usually located on the glare-shield ) and the auto-thrust system automatically adjusts the engines to maintain that speed . Now in an aircraft with classical controls the longitudinal stability means the aircraft tends to maintain speed with pitch and pilots basically need to use thrust to climb or descend and yoke to adjust speed , always making adjustments with the other control as well to avoid oscillations and compensate for the more complex parts of the power-pitch relationship . Due to this , it is usually recommended to fly either fully manual or fully automatic ( autopilot + autothrust ) . But Airbus A320 and newer ( A319 is just a variant of A320 ) changes that with the artificial neutral stability in normal control law . Even with autopilot off , the flight computer automatically adjusts trim so that the aircraft flies straight so that adding power makes the aircraft accelerate and reducing it makes it decelerate . However pushing the stick forward to descend will still make the aircraft accelerate and pulling it to climb will make it slow down . Due to this , Aibrbus aircraft are easier to fly with autothrust always on ( except for take-off roll ; autothrust is disabled when the power levers are advanced above certain position , which is only done for take-off and in emergency where extra power is needed ) .
Under FAA jurisdiction , these items are regulated under <URL> . The size of the registration markings must generally be at least 12 inches high : <URL> ( a ) Except as provided in paragraph ( f ) of this section , each operator of an aircraft must display marks on the aircraft meeting the size requirements of this section . ( b ) Height . Except as provided in paragraph ( h ) of this part , the nationality and registration marks must be of equal height and on -- ( 1 ) Fixed-wing aircraft , must be at least 12 inches high The markings must be displayed on either the vertical tail surfaces or the sides of the fuselage . <URL> ( a ) The operator of a fixed-wing aircraft must display the required marks on either the vertical tail surfaces or the sides of the fuselage , except as provided in § 45.29 ( f ) . ( b ) The marks required by paragraph ( a ) of this section must be displayed as follows : ( 1 ) If displayed on the vertical tail surfaces , horizontally on both surfaces , horizontally on both surfaces of a single vertical tail or on the outer surfaces of a multivertical tail . ( 2 ) If displayed on the fuselage surfaces , horizontally on both sides of the fuselage between the trailing edge of the wing and the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer . However , if engine pods or other appurtenances are located in this area and are an integral part of the fuselage side surfaces , the operator may place the marks on those pods or appurtenances . There are exceptions to these requirements , but these exceptions will not generally apply to the modern airliners referenced in your question . While the regulations do not prohibit it , I think it would be unusual for the registration to be displayed in more than one location on a given side of the aircraft -- for example , on both the tail and the fuselage . Under ICAO requirements , these items are described under <URL> . Annex 7 , paragraph 3.3.1 includes the additional requirement for heavier-than-air aircraft that the registration markings should be displayed on the lower surface of the wing structure . 3.3.1 Wings . On heavier-than-air aircraft the marks shall appear once on the lower surface of the wing structure . They shall be located on the left half of the lower surface of the wing structure unless they extend across the whole of the lower surface of the wing structure . So far as is possible the marks shall be located equidistant from the leading and trailing edges of the wings . The tops of the letters and numbers shall be toward the leading edge of the wing . The FAA has no such requirement , but other jurisdictions do , such as the <URL> , which is effectively identical to the ICAO guidance . The ICAO size requirements for heavier-than-air aircraft are similar to FAA requirements , with the obvious exception of the wing markings . These requirements are found in Annex 7 , paragraph 4.2 : 4.2.1 Wings . The height of the marks on the wings of heavier-than-air aircraft shall be at least 50 centimetres . 4.2.2 Fuselage ( or equivalent structure ) and vertical tail surfaces . The height of the marks on the fuselage ( or equivalent structure ) and on the vertical tail surfaces of heavier-than-air aircraft shall be at least 30 centimetres . Note that 30 centimetres is approximately equivelant to 12 inches , and 50 centimetres is approximately equivelant to 20 inches .
Both are predefined routes through the air which connect the airport areas ( terminal areas ) to the enroute airway system in a way remotely similar to local roads that everyone follows from and to highways . This ensures ( in theory ) an orderly fashion of after departure reaching ( SID ) and leaving towards the airport ( STAR ) the enroute airspaces for all aircraft . SID stands for <URL> . STAR stands for <URL> . The links touch upon everything else .

No alternate destination when flying from Oakland to Honolulu : is that correct ?
There are plenty of alternative airports in Hawaii , but none in-between of course . So what the author is getting at is that you 're probably going to be dead if you run into trouble . While I ca n't say I know anything much about the Cessna 402 , it apparently has a normal range of around 1,273 nm ( 1,467 mi , 2,360 km ) , compared to a distance Hawaii-Oakland of 2050nm ( 2359mi , 3797km ) . Hence , you 're going to have to install additional fuel tanks and fly pretty heavy . There a few considerations if you get a problem : You will have to descend since the engine ca n't generate enough thrust at that cruise altitude . I found a source stating the ceiling for both engines is around 26180 ft compared to 11320 ft for one engine . The fuel consumption increases in the remaining engine and will be greater than the total for both engines for the same flying conditions . You 're going to have to run the remaining engine hard for the remain of the flight . If your temporary ferry tanks screw up ( or any of the normal ones for that matter as well ) , you wo n't make it . You may damage/break the gear if you have to return to the airport overloaded . " I once saw a Cessna 402 parked on the ramp at Honolulu with the gear punched half way up into the wings from a poorly executed overweight landing . " <URL> I ca n't do a calculation on for what portion of the flight you would be ' screwed ' but I imagine it might very well be a bit of the journey . <URL> seem to be in the opinion it 's a pain to fly heavy and difficult to with one engine .
The best option is probably Jane 's Aircraft Recognition Guide . It is hard to find , but it has a large number of planes and has multiple editions .
General rule here : the engine will remain at its last power setting should the FADECs lose comms with the flight deck controls ( in your A380 case ) or the thrust lever cables come unhooked ( in the case of an older aircraft with mechanical cable-and-pulley controls ) . However , the fire handle will kill the engine even if the main controls fail -- it operates the firewall fuel and hydraulic shutoff valves . In QF32 , this did n't happen because the cable for the # 1 engine fire handle itself was damaged by shrapnel entering the wing .
The VOR and ILS CDI indicates difference , in degrees , between the radial selected and the radial sensed . If the plane was far from the VOR and we turn the course pointer 5 degrees , the CDI will move to one side . If the plane was close to the VOR and we turned the course pointer 5 degrees , the CDI would move exactly as much , because it indicates the angular difference in degrees . This is in contrast to a CDI slaved to GPS , which indeed indicates lateral distance from the selected track in miles ( en-route ; GPS approach has to simulate ILS ) . VOR does nothing with DME . DME is completely independent piece of equipment that was introduced later than VOR . The only relation is that there is a standard correspondence between VOR and DME channels and the DME receiver automatically tunes to the DME frequency corresponding to the VOR or ILS frequency tuned on your VOR/ILS receiver .
Your puck ( GlobalSat BR355 ) runs on 5v and the UART line idles high ( it is pulled high when there is no traffic ) . The first thing you need to do is find the power lines that go to the gps puck -- connect wires to these lines ( 5v and gnd ) and run them to the spot where you want the button/led . Then make this circuit : <URL> The value for R1 should be 150 ohms ( which will yield under 20ma of current through the LED , assuming your led has a voltage drop of 2.1 v ( which the ones in the link I provided do have ) ) Here is a link to a transistor that will work for Q1 : <URL> Here is a resistor that will work for R1 : <URL> And here is a link to a selection of LEDs you can use ( all with voltage drop of 2.1 v ; Any of these should work ; just choose a color and form factor that works for your application ) : <URL> Here is a link to a selection of pushbuttons that should work -- just choose a form factor you like ( look at the datasheet for the ones with 4 pins -- these are just two pairs of pins ( each pair is connected ) for mounting ease -- two pins can be harder to mount on a circuit board ) : <URL> I personally recommend you use something like this for the button : <URL> For this button here is a picture and a schematic ( as you can see , the pins on either side of the flat side of the button are connected : <URL> <URL> And something like this for the led : <URL> Just wire these components up according to the picture and solder them together -- I 'll leave how to mount the switch and the LED up to you but make sure once you are done you cover all the exposed wire with glue and/or electrical tape and/or liquid electrical tape so they do n't accidentally short out . Also make sure no exposed wires within the circuit are touching where they should n't touch ( especially make sure you separate the pins of the transistor because if they accidentally touch the circuit will not work and you may damage your gps receiver -- long story short be careful in your wiring and make sure nothing is touching that should n't .
You should refer to the published IAPs for an airport to determine if it has non-standard takeoff minimums ( for AeroNav charts , this is the T in the black triangle ) . There 's a section on this in the <URL> ( 2-6 ) : The FAA establishes takeoff minimums for every airport that has published Standard Instrument Approaches . These minimums are used by commercially operated aircraft , namely Part 121 and 135 operators . <URL> : No person may takeoff an aircraft under IFR from an airport where weather conditions are at or above takeoff minimums but are below authorized IFR landing minimums unless there is an alternate airport within 1 hour 's flying time ( at normal cruising speed , in still air ) of the airport of departure . ... and <URL> : ( 1 ) Aircraft having two engines . Not more than one hour from the departure airport at normal cruising speed in still air with one engine inoperative . ( 2 ) Aircraft having three or more engines . Not more than two hours from the departure airport at normal cruising speed in still air with one engine inoperative . Part 91 14 CFR 91 does not require a takeoff alternate . I 'm going to quote the IFH again because it 's an authoritative FAA source and because I very much agree with it ( 2-6 ) : Aircraft operating under Part 91 are not required to comply with established takeoff minimums . Legally , a zero/zero departure may be made , but it is never advisable .
The Airman Certification Standards ( ACS ) is basically an ' enhanced ' version of the Practical Test Standards ( PTS ) . According to <URL> , It ( ACS ) adds task-specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task . In general , while the PTS concentrates on what the applicant must ' do ' , the ACS specifies what he/she must ' know ' and ' consider ' ( in addition to the ' do ' part ) to qualify for a given airman certificate or rating . The differences ( in draft ) are shown in this slide . <URL> Image from Update on the ACS by FAA According to the FAA briefing , • The " skills " section of the ACS covers the flight proficiency performance metrics in today 's PTS . • For each PTS Area of Operation/Task , the ACS lists the elements of aeronautical knowledge that support that skill . • In addition , for each PTS Area of Operation/Task , the ACS lists the risk management elements or behaviors associated with it . The ACS is still under development , but FAA is targeting a June 2016 implementation ( for airplane ) depending on results of prototype ( there is one running at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University ) and some other factors .
Based on the ATA iSpec 2200 , ATA Standard Numbering System , which provides a standard for structuring maintenance data by the manufacturers . The structure helps the airlines by providing a common structure regardless of manufacturer . While voluntary , most aircraft manufacturers use it . The spec is organized into chapters by aircraft system . ATA Chapter 32 is LANDING GEAR . Chapter subsections cover subsystems . Subsection -10 is Main Gear and Doors and subsection -20 is Nose Gear and Doors . So that 's the ' common ' terminology in the aircraft manufacturing and maintenance world .
In general , aircraft are handed over on frequency to the next controller via a simple instruction to change the frequency : R : " Lufthansa One Two Tree , contact Langen Radar 128.550 " A : " Contact 128.550 , Lufthansa One Two Tree " The simplified order of contacted stations for a commercial flight , depending on availability and airspace structure is : Delivery ( if available ) Apron/Ground ( if available ) Tower Departure ( if available , sometimes handled by Approach ) Enroute ACC/Center ( multiple stations along the route ) Arrival/Approach Director ( if available / in use ) Tower Ground ( if available ) The point and altitude or flightlevel where the handoff is initiated is agreed upon in Letters of Agreement between the different sectors or ACC/ARTCC stations . <URL> ( Source : SentryRaven - Own Work ) The above picture shows the airspace around Köln / Bonn ( EDDK ) Airport , with the Köln Arrival East ( KAE ) sector being actively displayed in black . The STAR entry / clearance limit fixes are GULKO and KOPAG , in the east . Most traffic not arriving via NOR VOR in the west will terminate at these two fixes , which also serve as the handoff fix between the center controller ( Paderborn High , Taunus and/or Rhein Radar Upper Control ) and the arrival controller responsible for Köln East Sector . The Letter of Agreement between those sectors states that traffic arriving to Köln / Bonn via GULKO and KOPAG is to be cleared to FL100 and cleared for the respective STAR out of GULKO or KOPAG . The handoff is initiated approaching FL100 and approaching the entry fix , before the sector boundary . The handoff is therefore based on airspace structure and sector boundaries , not on a preset distance from the airport . While arrivals from the east are handed off at FL100 over GULKO and KOPAG , arrivals from the west at NOR VOR are handed off at FL140-FL170 . Landing and Take-Off clearances are issued by the Tower controller , as the approach controller is not necessarily based at the same airport but in most cases in a remote facility together with other approach and center controllers . They have no visibility of the airport and can thus not issue these clearances . The handoff to Tower usually happens when the aircraft is established on the final approach segment of the published approach ( usually after passing the Final Approach Fix ( FAF ) ) or a visual approach to the runway . The phraseology is the same as above : R : " Germanwings Two Six Alpha , contact Tower 124.975 " A : " 124.975 , Germanwings Two Six Alpha "
There is a push to talk ( PTT ) button located at the yoke or sidestick , in small and large aircraft likewise . When the PTT button is not triggered , all communication is routed through the intercom and not broadcasted on the frequency . Once the button is triggered , communication is broadcasted on the active frequency . In the below picture of a glider , it is located on top of the middle stick . On the second picture is it behind the yoke , to be used with the index finger . ( Image Source : <URL> ) ( Image Source : <URL> )
Sonic booms from low flying aircraft , while loud , do n't seem to cause hearing damage , as this F-14 pilot demonstrates during a Tiger Cruise air wing demonstration . Now military fighters will sometimes make a ' show of force ' in the form of a low altitude , high speed pass against threat forces which do n't have a substantial IADS capability in order to motivate them to disperse under threat of employing ordanance on them if they continue belligerence . UPDATE : I found this story about an F-16 2-ship over Iraq on a CAS patrol mission . The pilots get a radio call from desperate SOCOM operators pinned down by enemy troops at night . The pilots can not get a IR strobe to track for bombing , so the lead Viper uses a sonic boom delivered from a dive to frighten off the combatants .
It looks to me like the <URL> you quoted is unreliable or at least not current , e.g. it gives results for codes QQQ and ZZZ too , but they <URL> . The actual IATA code for <URL> seems to be MZX . Anyway , there 's no particular reason why <URL> , ZZZ or any other specific combination should be assigned ; they just <URL> . There 's also no reason why IATA should assign a code to every airport : the US alone <URL> but only 500 or so have air carrier service .
Smelling exhaust in the cockpit is not normal . Tell your instructor and squawk the problem . Bonus - turn it into a learning experience by arranging to be with the A&amp;P when he decowls and inspects . You can learn a lot about the engine that way . If you are getting a headache from this you may have mild CO poisoning . This does need to be checked out .
Can a commercial airplane fly outside the safety area ? Yes , there is nothing physically stopping the plane from doing so . Is it allowed to do so ? No , precisely for the event should an engine fail then it will have enough range to get to the airport and make a safe landing . Extending the allowable range of twin engine aircraft is what <URL> is about . By default commercial airplanes with 2 engines must remain within 60 minutes flying time of an airport in case of engine failure . This was decided at a time where engines were unreliable . However as engine reliability increased airplanes could have that range increased with an ETOPS certificate .
If I attempt to continue maintaining the flare , attempting to come to a stop , I will sink and if I do n't do anything about it , I will hit the ground . Why ? if you continue to maintain aft cyclic after the flare , you will hit the ground because some of the lift which is being generated will be used to fly the helicopter backwards , and you wo n't have enough power in to both maintain altitude and also maintain backwards flight ( which is what you are commanding with aft cyclic ) . This is why we level off after the flare : to use all the lift in the vertical direction . Its the exact opposite of take-off : if you are in a hover on the runway , and push the nose over to the 60KIAS nose-down attitude , you will descend into the runway . Although I have never tried it , I imagine that at the peak of the flare , if I add ( a lot ? ) of power without changing the attitude ( much :) , I will not descend into the runway , but rather I will start to fly backwards .
The simple fact is that an unintended gear deployment could be catastrophic , as it has a profound impact on the flight dynamics of the aircraft ( one of the reasons there are warnings for both retraction and extension ) . The benefits would be marginal as checking gear down is part of the bread-and-butter procedures for all retractable gear aircraft . Keep in mind adding some automation to an aircraft has far ranging impact , just off the top of my head adding automatic gear mechanism would require : Standardization of the automation Modification of procedures Training of pilots , and then re-certification of pilots Training of maintenance crews , and then re-certification of the crews Possible change to the maintenance schedule of aircraft Certification of the new system by the regulator and you would still need a backup / redundant system ; and now you are back to the manual controls . I can imagine this being implemented in remote piloted or autonomous aircraft though ; as an additional workload relief .
If the airport you 're based at has federal grant obligations ( basically if they 've taken money from the <URL> ) then being a " flying club " by the FAA 's definition entitles you ( as a group ) to the same rights as any other operator at the field ( like the right to fuel your aircraft with fuel you buy yourself &amp; have trucked in , or the right to do maintenance on the aircraft ) , subject to the same rules and regulations the airport lays down for all operators . The biggest material difference is that " flying clubs " are n't considered to be " commercial " ventures by the FAA ( and by extension grant-obligted airports ) . As an example , let 's say you have a flying club &amp; you " charge " $ 50/hr for the use of one of the planes , and your airport management decides that since you 're charging money for the use of the planes you 're a commercial venture , and need to have commercial insurance and the like . If you meet the FAA definition of a " Flying Club " and the airport has federal grant obligations you can ask your local FSDO to step in and effectively tell the airport management to get stuffed - as a flying club you 're treated more like an individual than a commercial business , and the airport is not allowed to impose those commercial requirements on you . If you do n't meet that definition the FAA wo n't intervene on your behalf ( as far as they 're concerned you are a rental outfit / commercial FBO at that point and the airport is correct in treating you as one ) . Note that you can still call yourself a " flying club " even if you do n't meet the FAA 's definition -- I belong to a flying club that has no aircraft ( we 're just a bunch of folks who like to talk about flying and organize the occasional fly-out event or safety seminar - some of us own planes , and some rent from local FBOs ) , and it does n't really matter to us that we do n't meet the FAA definition of a flying club because we do n't have any interaction with the airport where that designation would benefit us . If you 're the kind of organization that has aircraft available for the use of your members however it probably makes sense to ensure that you 're organized &amp; run in such a way as to meet the FAA definition of a flying club .
Greg covered this very well <URL> . The " miss by a surprising distance " bit is especially important here in the context of FAR 91.15 -- you would have to have a VERY large-scale paintball match for this to be viable , and some specific rules of engagement for the aircraft ( always firing " into " the arena area as you do n't want to miss and send a paintball into someone 's car or kitchen window as that would get some distinctly unfriendly attention from the FAA , and probably the local constabulary ) . Operationally , if we 're doing this with an airplane high-wing aircraft would obviously be the order of the day ( Cessna 152 ) , with a pilot ( whose sole job is to fly the airplane ) and a gunner/bombardier ( who is responsible for hitting targets on the ground ) . You really do n't want the pilot distracted by the game . Your weapons guy is going to have to be able to account for the aircraft 's speed and altitude in targeting ( which is pretty hard with an adjusted scope/bomb sight - doing it without one is going to be tough ) . As for shooting back at the plane , if we 're talking about a " regular " airplane ( something manned , like a Cessna 152 ) I would advise against allowing players to target the plane . At safe operating altitudes they 're unlikely to hit the plane , but if they do aircraft skin is very thin &amp; dent repair is very expensive : If someone is lucky enough to score a hit it could be a costly " death " . Now , as a paintball player myself I will tell you that I find the idea of death from above when I ca n't shoot back at the aircraft to be rather unsporting ! What I would suggest instead is to deploy <URL> . These can be had pretty cheaply and with some basic electronics skills they can be modified to carry/drop paint grenades ( think Squadbusters ) on your enemy . If you want to get really fancy add a GoPro or some other remote camera to help with targeting , or add a paintball gun to the thing <URL> . The FAA 's rules for " unmanned aerial systems " are still being written , but if you keep to the general rules for model aircraft ( below 400 feet , and not charging anyone money for the drone 's services ) I think you 'll be OK ( when the final rules come out you 'll have to review your drone for compliance ) . As a bonus if the drone is n't too large and you have an indoor arena with liberally-minded management you may even be able to use your drone during indoor games . ( Kill rules for the drone and its operator are left as an exercise for the players . )
Theres two different approaches , passive and active stability on all three axis . X axis ( roll ) : In the X axis , flying wings are stabilized the same as any other plane . Passive stability is achieved through a slight upwards dihedral between left and right wing . As such the " lower " wing creates slightly more lift in upwards direction and allows the plane to roll back to horizontal flight . Active stability is achieved through ailerons near the wing tips which create a controlled differential lift allowing the pilot or flight computer to control the roll velocity . Y axis ( pitch ) Passive stability in the Y axis in traditional planes is achieved through the high-leverage corrective force of the horizontal stabilizer ( with the exception of canard type planes where the main wing itself takes this role ) Active stability is achieved through elevator controls on this stabilizer , which increase or decrease the vertical force in one or the other direction . In a flying wing this stabilizer is not present . Instead the rearward area of the main wing takes this role . For this to work , a stable flying wing needs to have wings that are significantly swept backwards in such a way that the overall torque force at both positive and negative high angle of attack is always decreasing this angle of attack . Active stability is achieved through control surfaces at the very back of the wing . These are often the same control surfaces also used for Roll control , but deflecting in unison instead of opposite directions ( Elevons ) Z Axis ( yaw ) Similar to pitch , the passive and active yaw control on conventional planes is done with a stabilizer fin with a rudder at the tail . In true flying wings this is not present ( Some do n't even have winglets ) But the high wing sweep ( usually the wings of a flying wings meet at roughly 90 ° angle at the tip ) causes a higher drag force at the forward facing wing if the craft yaws to one side , which enacts the required corrective force . Active control is achieved by causing additional drag through some sort of braking flaps near the wing tips ( the actual implementations vary - split elevons - separate break flaps - ... ) This can also be augmented by using differential thrust . ( Note : The corrective force is much lower than that caused by a tail fin . As such a powered flying wing should have its engines relatively close to the center , otherwise a one-engine-out scenario would cause an uncorrectable yawing moment . This however limits the effectiveness of differential thrust if the craft is supposed to stay flyable in such a condition ) Speed and stall stability : A speed stable plane has its nose pitch up at higher speeds and pitch down if the craft gets slower , thanks to the center of gravity being in front of the center of lift , which causes the nose to drop . This is balanced out by a ( usually parasitic ) downward force from the horizontal stabilizer acting at the tail of the plane . This arrangement of forces should also cause the nose to drop and the angle of attack to reduce in a stall situation . As a flying wing does not have this stabilizer , a similar balance of forces needs to be achieved through a careful design of wing profile and twist . If you look at Horton flying wing glider designs for example , they have a " thick " profile creating the majority of lift in the center ( which thanks to the wing sweep is also the front ) Towards the end and back of the wings , the profile becomes thinner and more symmetric . At the same time , the wings are slightly twisted , so the intrinsic angle of attack is a few degree lower at the tip ( and as such at the rear of the wing ) than near the nose . At high speeds , the front of the wing creates more lift than the back and rises the nose . This part has the highest wing load and will stall first , while the swept back outer wing area - thanks to its profile , lower AoA and lower load will not have stalled yet . The nose drops , and the control surfaces in this rearward part stay functional . It should be noted that not all flying wing designs did achieve a safe stall behavior . Some , like early 1940 's and 1950 's American designs failed to implement stall stability correctly , while others ( like the B2 bomber ) the plane was deliberately designed aerodynamically unsafe to faciliate other features ( stealth ) which would have been compromised by a " twisted " wing .
All standard fixed wing aircraft are able to glide . The key measure of performance in gliding is the glide ratio which is related to the <URL> of the aircraft . The glide ratio of a clean A320 is 17:1 which means it can travel 17 units of distance forwards for every 1 unit of distance downward at best glide speed . Using your figure of 11,000 meters away and dividing by 17 results in a minimum altitude above ground ( AGL ) of 647 meters . In practice , the aircraft would need to be higher than this to accomodate turns and other factors , but if the A320 was at 1000 meters AGL or higher I would expect it to have no problem landing at an airfield or airport 11km away . Note that aircraft routinely glide every time you fly even though you may be unaware of it . When a commercial flight begins its descent often power will be brought back to idle , so the aircraft is gliding at that point . There have been several instances of large commercial aircraft landing fully unpowered . One well known example is the case of the <URL> in which a Boeing 767 ran out of fuel and glided to landing at a nearby airbase .
end question
start question
Is a recoil start ( hand propping ) allowed if it is n't mentioned in the aircraft manual ?
You did n't say exactly what " allowed " means , e.g. do you mean approved by the manufacturer , or legal in a certain country ? But if you 're asking is it legal in the US ( under FAA regulations ) , then the answer is yes . AOPA has a nice article on exactly this question , called <URL> . It says : There is no specific FAA regulation that applies to hand propping an airplane , either to prohibit it or to direct how it is to be done But : The FAA contends that hand propping is a two-person operation and has expressed this view in the <URL> ( FAA-H-8083-3A ) under the section titled " Hand propping . " Of course , this publication is not regulatory , but the NTSB was surely influenced by it in a 1983 legal decision . In that case , the FAA sought to suspend a pilot 's certificate for being careless or reckless when , while attempting to start a VariEze experimental aircraft , it " got away " and ran into a parked aircraft . The NTSB concluded that the pilot had violated <URL> ( careless and reckless operation ) : The board affirmed the administrative law judge 's finding that there had been a 91.10 ( now 91.13 ) violation That means that hand propping itself is n't illegal , but doing it wrongly and against the FAA 's general procedures could get you in trouble : There have been at least two previously issued NTSB ( full board ) decisions and one subsequent decision that refer to these generally accepted procedures and precautions for hand propping . The precedent has been set . So , hand proppers beware ; if you fail to follow proper precautions and the airplane gets away , the FAA might pursue action against you for being careless or reckless .
Perusing the A380 Training Guide , Edition 01 , 01 Sep 2008 , Section 5 - Engine Starts , Subsections 5.8.6 ( Engine Start Valve Stuck Closed ) , 5.8.6 Engine Start Valve Stuck Closed ECAM actions -- ENGINE MASTER OFF . Check MEL , and in conjunction with , advise LAE of situation in preparation for Start Valve Manual Operation . For Start Valve Manual Operation on Engines # 2 and # 4 , the adjacent engine ( if already running ) will require shutdown , to enable LAE 's access to the manual start override procedure on the port side of the affected engine . As the CAB Pb on the RMP is common to the Cockpit , Ground and Cabin Crew , advise the Cabin Crew to refrain from using the Cabin Interphone during the procedure . When ready , accomplish normal engine start sequence : a ) Engine Start Selector to IGN/START . b ) Engine Master Lever to ON . c ) Command LAE to OPEN START VALVE AND KEEP OPEN . d ) At 50 % N3 , command LAE , START VALVE CLOSE . e ) Monitor engine parameters closely until stabilized . Advise Cabin Crew upon completion of procedure . In flight , only windmilling start will be available . Glossary ( correct if needed , please ) : ECAM = Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor LAE = Licensed Aircraft Engineer CAB = Cabin Pb = Pushbutton RMP = Radio Management Panel IGN = Ignition N1/N2/N3 = N1 is LP ( Low Pressure stage ) , N2 is IP ( Intermediate Pressure stage ) , N3 is HP ( High Pressure stage ) MEL = Minimum Equipment List ECAM will display " ENG MASTER X ... ... OFF " ( X will be the engine with stuck valve ) <URL> ( The message will appear in the lower left quadrant . ) Check the Minimum Equipment List ( MEL ) to determine if loss of engine is GO , GO IF , or NO GO , if failure is not in the MEL , it is classified by default as NO GO . Advise the on-site Licensed Aircraft Engineer ( LAE ) of the warning message in preparation for completing the Start Valve Manual Operation procedure . If the engine with the stuck valve is # 2 ( left side inboard ) or # 4 ( right side outboard ) , the adjacent engine will be required to be shutdown before commencing the manual start procedure . ( This is because the engineer has to access the left side of the engine and for safety 's sake the other engine , which would be gehind him must be shut down . If the fault is on the left outboard ( # 1 ) then the engineer would be on the far side of the engine from the # 2 so # 2 does not need to be shutdown . ) Since the Cabin Pushbutton ( CAB Pb ) on the Radio Management Panel ( RMP ) is common to the Cockpit , the Cabin Crew area AND the Ground circuit , the pilot should advise the Cabin Crew to not use the Cabin Interphone during the procedure . ( If the pilot and the engineer are discussing starting the engine ( or not ) they do n't want a flight attendant to be talking about starting pre-flight stuff at the same time , if the engineer heard the word start , he might wrongly assume it was the pilot . ) When pilot and engineer are ready , begin the normal engine start sequence with changes : a ) Turn the Engine Start Selector to IGN/START . <URL> b ) Flip the Engine Master Lever ( For the faulted engine ) to ON . <URL> c ) Over the interphone , command the engineer to manually open the start valve and keep it open . ( I have n't yet looked for and found a schematic for an example engine , sorry . As shown in other diagrams/answers , it might be a socket wrench , etc. ) d ) Watch the Engine Warning Display . <URL> <URL> Once N3 is spun up to 50 % , over the interphone , command the engineer to manually close the start valve . e ) Monitor the engine parameters closely until all are properly stable . f ) After the engineer has closed up the engine and vacated the area , start the other engines , if one was shut down per step 3 . Over the cabin interphone , notify the cabin crew that the procedure is complete . ( so they can resume using the interphone if needed . ) If the engine failed in-flight and upon restart a stuck valve warning was shown , all of the above would not be possible . At that time , the only way to restart the engine would be to attempt a windmill start ( using the flow of air through the engine to turn the engine ) , there are other procedures for that . Also , I do not yet have the engine schematics to show what the LAE actually does .
There are a lot of good reasons not to roll such an airplane . If the plane has gyroscopic instruments , you might tumble them ( cause the spinning gyro to hit the inside of the instrument ) . This can be expensive . You might easily over-stress the air frame . <URL> . ( That 's for a new aircraft ) A botched roll can easily hit 4.5 or higher . If you over stress the air frame , you might just put a lot of very expensive " wrinkles " in the skin that would be very hard to explain to the FBO , your boss , or the insurance company . Trashing the gyros would be cheaper . If you 're not lucky , the wings fold up and you fall out of the sky . It 's a stupid way to die . Non-aerobatic aircraft typically have limited elevator authority ; once upside down , you might find it very difficult to keep the nose pushed up high enough to keep the roll going . Turning a botched roll into a " split-S " is one of the worst " recovery " mistakes you can make , and you 're setting yourself up for it . Non-aerobatic aircraft often have gravity-feed fuel systems . A little bit of 0 or negative " G " and it will get very very quiet in the plane . Some people consider this silence detrimental to the continued safety of the flight . Non-aerobatic aircraft rarely have inverted oil systems . As the engine gets quiet , it also loses most of its lubrication . Bare metal on metal friction can be detrimental to achieving <URL> . Having said all that , in the hands of an expert , it is technically possible to barrel roll most aircraft . A good way to tell if you 're an expert is to call your insurance company and tell them exactly what you plan to do . If they 'll quote you affordable coverage , you might be an expert . Obligatory links because if I do n't include them someone else will : <URL> . I 'm pretty sure he 'd never get away with this today . <URL> . Bob Hoover is beyond expert . Way , way , beyond expert . If you want to roll an airplane , contact your local aerobatic club . In the US and some countries , it 's the <URL> . Get some competent dual instruction in a suitably rated airplane .
The answer can be found in Annex 16 of the ICAO , a copy including the noise limits can be found <URL> . Below a little excerpt from the annex : ( a ) For acoustical changes to Stage 1 airplanes , regardless of the number of engines , the noise levels prescribed under § 36.7 ( c ) of this part . What are the ' Chapter 2 ' and ' Chapter 3 ' aircraft noise classifications ? Certificated noise levels for larger aircraft are classified by the ICAO ' Standards and Recommended Practices -- Aircraft Noise : Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation ' into a ) Chapter 2 types , characterised by the noisier , low bypass turbofan aircraft and early high bypass turbofan aircraft , and b ) Chapter 3 types , characterised by the modern , quieter , high bypass turbofan aircraft . Under European legislation , since 2002 , ' Chapter 2 ' aircraft ( of over 34 tonnes maximum take-off weight or with more than 19 seats ) have no longer been allowed to operate at European airports . There are separate noise certification schemes for small propeller aircraft and for helicopters . ( b ) For any Stage 2 airplane regardless of the number of engines : ( 1 ) Flyover : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 5 EPNdB ; the limit is 93 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral and approach : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2 EPNdB ; the limit is 102 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less . ( c ) For any Stage 3 airplane : ( 1 ) Flyover . ( i ) For airplanes with more than 3 engines : 106 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 44,673 pounds or less ; ( ii ) For airplanes with 3 engines : 104 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 63,177 pounds or less ; and ( iii ) For airplanes with fewer than 3 engines : 101 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 850,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB ; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 106,250 pounds or less . ( 2 ) Lateral , regardless of the number of engines : 103 EPNdB for maximum weight of 882,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 882,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2.56 EPNdB ; the limit is 94 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less . ( 3 ) Approach , regardless of the number of engines : 105 EPNdB for maximum weight of 617,300 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 617,300 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 2.33 EPNdB ; the limit is 98 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less . ( d ) For any Stage 4 airplane , the flyover , lateral , and approach maximum noise levels are prescribed in Chapter 4 , Paragraph 4.4 , Maximum Noise Levels , and Chapter 3 , Paragraph 3.4 , Maximum Noise Levels , of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) Annex 16 , Environmental Protection , Volume I , Aircraft Noise , Third Edition , July 1993 , Amendment 7 , effective March 21 , 2002 . [ Incorporated by reference , see § 36.6 ] .
This question was answered in an earlier ( 2013 ) message . Generally , if you are ferrying an airplane and are compensated as a commercial pilot , are not carrying passengers or cargo for hire , you are operating under Part 91 of the US federal aviation regulations . That you are a paid ferry pilot is not relevant . See 19 CFR 122.1 ( d ) A " commercial aircraft " is any aircraft transporting passengers or cargo for money or other consideration . As you are not transporting passengers or cargo ( both of which would be covered under the commercial operator rules ) or you have a passenger as a friend or the aircraft owner who does not pay for passage , you are ferrying an aircraft which is covered as a private flight . Make absolutely certain you understand how the US eAPIS system applies to you as a foreign national bringing the aircraft into the US , and you have appropriate documentation and the owner is prepared to jump through whatever hoops Customs needs to get the aircraft ashore . The US Customs Guide for Private Flyers is a useful reference . Simon , I disagree with your understanding . There are many operations which are not commercial , with paid pilots . An example of this is a corporation owns an airplane which requires a pilot . The corporation can hire a pilot to fly its airplane and carry its parts/executives/employees / friends . While the pilot must carry a commercial certificate and carry at least a Class II medical certificate , the flight is not considered a commercial flight , nor is the the company considered a commercial operator since it does not hold out its aircraft for hire , unless its in the air carriage business . If on the other hand that same aircraft owner decided to carry the company next door 's freight and executives and charge them for it , that changes the story .
The rules on this are well-established and clear . They are laid out in <URL> . In particular , you should fly at an altitude which is ( emphasis mine ) : At the highest of the following altitudes or flight levels for the route segment being flown : ( i ) The altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC clearance received ; ( ii ) The minimum altitude ( converted , if appropriate , to minimum flight level as prescribed in § 91.121 ( c ) ) for IFR operations ; or ( iii ) The altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance . For each segment of your route , you evaluate the minimum , assigned , and expected altitudes , and fly the highest . In this case , you 'd fly at 9,000 feet on the leg where the MEA is 9000 , and then descend back to 8,000 when the MEA drops to that altitude or lower . If you lose your radios and squawk 7600 ( or stop squawking altogether ) , ATC will expect you to fly those altitudes . They will provide separation between you and all other IFR traffic at 9,000 feet on the first leg , and 8,000 on the second leg . The only exception to this is if you encounter VFR conditions , in which case you should maintain VFR , land , and call ATC so they stop holding the airspace open for you . In this situation , you should not worry about inconveniencing ATC or other traffic . We have these rules specifically set up so that nobody trades paint if a radio fails . ATC will manage IFR traffic separation for you . " Better in terms of traffic separation " happens when everybody follows the same plan .
<URL> , a model aircraft is defined as : any ' Small Unmanned Aircraft ( SUA ) ' ( 0-20 kg ) used for sporting and recreational purposes and a ' large model aircraft ' is defined as any ' Unmanned Aircraft ' ( over 20 kg ) used for sporting and recreational purposes . The following rule applies to all " small unmanned aircraft " , i.e. up to 20kg : ( 3 ) The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft must maintain direct , unaided visual contact with the aircraft sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft , persons , vehicles , vessels and structures for the purpose of avoiding collisions . The following rule applies between 7kg and 20kg only : The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft which has a mass of more than 7 kg excluding its fuel but including any articles or equipment installed in or attached to the aircraft at the commencement of its flight , must not fly the aircraft : ( a ) in Class A , C , D or E airspace unless the permission of the appropriate air traffic control unit has been obtained ; ( b ) within an aerodrome traffic zone during the notified hours of watch of the air traffic control unit ( if any ) at that aerodrome unless the permission of any such air traffic control unit has been obtained ; or ( c ) at a height of more than 400 feet above the surface unless it is flying in airspace described in sub-paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) and in accordance with the requirements for that airspace So in theory , a model aircraft weighing less than 7kg could be flown to any altitude , with the only limitation being the requirement to keep in it sight . From 7kg to 20kg the altitude is 400ft , unless you meet the airspace requirements . In practical terms , the requirement to keep the aircraft in sight " unaided " is the main limitation and that restricts the altitude of smaller models in particular . If it 's over 20kg , the model aircraft is subject to all the regular UK aviation rules but in practice a written exemption is required : Large model aircraft having a mass between 20 kg and 150 kg are subject to all of the Rules or Articles of the Air Navigation Order . As many of these Rules are practically impossible for the model operator to meet , the modeller must request a specific written Exemption to allow the model to be flown The CAA homepage for model aircraft is <URL> .
When flying an orthodrome , with few exceptions , the heading will be constantly changing . In theory the change is continuous , but in practice most aircraft are quantatized to the nearest degree . An exception are missiles , where because of a higher speed , having a more precise heading is more critical . Therefore most longer range missiles will internally use a higher granularity in the heading ( like 0.01 degree or less ) . To be clear , a loxodrome is a course which crosses all meridians of longitude at the same angle , and has a constant bearing measured to true or magnetic north . Loxodrome are also called rhumb lines . All loxodromes spiral from one pole to the other pole , except longitudinal loxodromes . An orthodrome is also called a great circle route , and is characterized with heading changes ( for most headings ) to allow the vessel/aircraft to fly the shortest path along the surface of the earth to get to another point on the earth . Assuming that the earth is a sphere , an orthodrome is defined by a plane which goes through the center of the sphere , and the curved lines formed by the outer portion of the sphere intersecting the plane form what is known as a great circle route . The equator and meridians of longitude and their inverse lines on the other side of the sphere , form orthodromes . In those examples , travel on the equator is a constant heading of 090 or 270 . On longitude lines , the heading is either N or S , until polar passage . An equatorial orthodrome can not be a loxodrome . A longitudinal orthodrome is a loxodrome , although a rather uninteresting one . It all seems rather straight forward now , right ? There are wikis on both rhumb lines / loxodromes and also great circle routes or orthodromes . The graphics in them may help understand things . <URL> <URL> Addendum to readdress question from OP : If an aircraft flies straight ahead , i.e. there is no wind , the rudder is not actuated and the aircraft is parallel w.r.t. the surface of the earth underneath it , will it follow an orthodrome/great circle ? The answer is always yes . What the OP appears to be asking is whether the airplane , flying with only an inertial reference ( NOT an inertial guidance system ) and a fixed distance above the surface of the earth , can be accomplished without a change in direction , except for the circling of the earth . So to explain this , let 's call the earth a sphere for this discussion . If a great circle route is extended , it will scribe a line which wraps around the sphere , and divides the sphere into two identical half-spheres . Those half-spheres can be made with a single directional cut of the sphere . If you will , the sphere is split in half by a plane ( geometric type , not aeronautical type ) and the circle formed by that plane is the great circle route wrapping around the sphere . The heading of an airplane flying a great circle route will with few exceptions , be constantly changing . The exceptions are when the plane is the equator or is a meridian of longitude and the corresponding reciprocal meridian . So once again , when the path of the aircraft is constrained to the surface or some fixed distance above the surface , the inertial direction relative to the surface of the sphere , will remain a constant direction . Since only great circles which pass through the poles or travel the equator have one axis fixed relative to lat/long of the earth , they will have constant headings . The ones which are polar will have heading flips at the poles . All other orthodromes will have continuously changing headings . There is just one more aspect of navigation that I would be remiss to not mention , and that is Transport Wander , which may be observed on a heading indicator on an aircraft , and is the function of the sin ( track angle ) * delta longitude/flight hours * tan ( latitude ) / 60 . The polarity changes with east vs west and northern vs southern hemispheres . To the OP , I am sorry that I misinterpreted your question , and for the resultant confusion .
If you have concerns over the safety of what is going on , here is what you should do : Record a video with your phone . Try to get the N number ( it should be painted in large letters on the side of the aircraft ) . Record the date/time and your exact location where you shot the video from . <URL> , preferrably by calling the <URL> . The FAA will investigate the operation for the legality of it . If this is legal depends on a number of factors . Most <URL> . Usually as far as the FAA is concerned , once a sea plane is on the water it is considered a boat . You may also have to call your local natural resources department .
The standard operating procedures state that before every flight , a thorough pre-flight inspection should be performed . Depending on the aircraft , minute and tiny details are not even omitted . Things do not normally and occasionally fall off from a flying airplane , the same way as different objects do not fall from a driving car , although the pre-drive inspection of a car is no where nearly as comprehensive as the pre-flight inspection . Yet , how many times we have seen a bumper , guard , muffler or rear-view mirrors falling off ? How dangerous it would be when it happens ? This depends on the part which has fallen . Some parts are not noticeable until landing or next inspection and some can cause disasters . <URL> reports <URL> : No deaths or injuries have been reported in such incidents , but the Federal Aviation Administration is not even 100 percent certain of that . The proper term for this incident is Things Falling Off Aircraft ( TFOA ) . The pilot must then submit a <URL> within 24 hours in case the material can cause further harm . <URL> has listed some TFOA incidents : In August 2000 , a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing when some engine pieces plummeted to the ground and landed on a crowded Los Angeles beach On March 10 , 2005 , a couple taking a stroll through woodlands near Gatwick airport had a lucky escape when a door from a passing British Airways jet , crashed to earth . A part of the 70-pound door from a Boeing 777 had become dislodged just after take off and missed the couple by only 20 feet ! On August 11 , 2006 , a door fell off from a TAM Fokker 100 from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro . It dropped off 18 minutes after departure but the plane was able to return to Sao Paulo without incident . Nobody was injured . An engine exploded on a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo with pieces of the engine falling on a neighborhood in Jakarta . The falling debris hurt no one but 16 homes were damaged . The right wheel of a Blue Panorama Airlines Boeing 737 fell off after it departed from an airport in Spain and was forced to make an unscheduled landing amid emergency in Rome . A similar incident happened near Los Angeles where an American Airlines Boeing 757 lost its right nose gear but managed to land safely with 105 passengers on board . A landing gear door fell off a Delta Airlines Boeing 727 shortly after the plane took off from Boston * s Logan International Airport . The 30-pound metal door crashed into an empty street in a quiet residential neighborhood .
With a few exceptions ( modern aircraft engines with FADEC systems ) a " Check Engine " light on an aircraft would be essentially useless . In a modern car we have an Engine Control Unit which manages things like mixture and engine timing . The " Check Engine " lamp illuminates when the ECU has detected a fault that requires some sort of attention , but it 's not usually specific as to what the fault is or how urgent the problem is . In most light GA aircraft ( like the Cessna or Cirrus in your question ) the engines are straight out of the 1950s/1960s : There are no computers managing the engine for you , and the pilot is acting as the ECU . The pilot should be checking the engine 's health regularly ( by looking at the engine gauges ) and adjusting power , mixture , and propeller pitch as required . Since there is no computer supervising the operation of the engine in most light GA aircraft there 's no system to determine when the light should be on , so there is no " Check Engine " light . Note that some light aircraft do incorporate warning lights for system status information . For example , the status cluster on newer Piper Warriors : Top row : Low bus voltage , Pitot Heat off/inop , starter engaged . Middle row : Vacuum inop , Alternator inop , Oil Pressure . Bottom row : Not used on this aircraft . The information provided by these lights is more specific than simply " Check Engine " - directing the pilot 's attention to a specific system or condition . The lights are also not a substitute for regularly scanning the engine instruments and managing the powerplant , they 're merely a supplement to catch your attention between scans .
787 On the 787 there is no activate/deactivate button for it . Yaw damping and turn coordination are always active as long as the flight controls law is in primary mode . In secondary or direct modes , yaw damping becomes degraded . Primary being the fly-by-wire 's fully functional mode . Source : 787 FCOM . MD-11 On an older generation plane , for example the MD-11 , there are buttons for the yaw damper , 4 in fact for the 4 channels , they are rarely used ( always on ) unless there 's a fault and after troubleshooting you want to take a channel out . <URL> ( <URL> ) Four yaw damper buttons on the MD-11 's overhead panel . 737 Next Generation On a 737 , after a flight is completed and the <URL> knobs are moved to the off position , the yaw damper switch automatically goes to the off position . I suspect the rationale back then ( carried over from earlier 737 variants ) was you ca n't have the switch on the " on position " and the fault light illuminated when there was no fault . ( The yaw damper needs a functioning <URL> , which needs input from the IRS . ) <URL> <URL> ( <URL> ) Yaw damper and IRS controls on the 737 overhead panel . Autopilot and yaw damper In most ( if not all ) planes that come with a yaw damper ( YD ) , engaging the autopilot ( A/P ) is not needed to enable the YD , i.e. , you can hand fly and still have the YD on , whether there 's a switch for it ( 737 ) or not ( 787 ) . In the MD-11 if all four channels failed , the A/P can only be used in cruise . So as you can see , you need the YD for the A/P in the MD-11 , not the other way around . Source : MD-11 QRH .
In the movie Flight ( 2012 ) , Captain Whittaker ( Denzel Washington ) does not explain why he deliberately inverted his aircraft , but the obvious inference is : since the horizontal stabilizer has slipped off its jackscrew and become jammed into a descent angle beyond the authority of the elevators to correct , in inverted flight this would push the nose far above the horizon and result in either a climb or a stall . In this attitude , Whittaker would have been pulling back on the yoke to prevent the stall . In the movie , this worked . The aircraft was still not under control , but was no longer diving and overspeeding . Suddenly rolling the aircraft upright in the last seconds before contact with terrain is the unrealistic part . A hot fighter jet might accomplish this but the roll rate of a passenger jet is too slow . The movie 's flight emergency is based mostly on the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261 on January 31 , 2000 . In that incident , the pilots experienced a jammed horizontal stabilizer with uncontrollable dive , and inverted their MD-80 to arrest their descent . Unfortunately in real life neither flying officer was stuffed to the gills with booze and coke : the maneouver failed and the aircraft crashed with no survivors .
From <URL> Sec . 121.542 Flight crewmember duties . ( a ) [ I omitted this , it 's about noncritical ( company ) procedures ] ( b ) No flight crewmember may engage in , nor may any pilot in command permit , any activity during a critical phase of flight which could distract any flight crewmember from the performance of his or her duties or which could interfere in any way with the proper conduct of those duties [ ... ] such as [ ... ] engaging in nonessential conversations within the cockpit [ ... ] ( c ) For the purposes of this section , critical phases of flight includes all ground operations involving taxi , takeoff and landing , and all other flight operations conducted below 10,000 feet , except cruise flight . One could argue that waving could distract the pilot taxiing , so according to the letter of the law , yes , you would violate the rule . However , I think in the spirit of the rule it 's fine , since it just means that the pilot not taxiing is paying attention to the surroundings as well . Reading between the lines , it basically says ( a ) During critical phases of flight , all crew should focus on flying , not selling cooked cardboard ( b ) Also , do n't read the paper with a croissant while asking help with a crossword during said phases . ( c ) Critical phases of flight are when you 're likely to read the bumper sticker on another jet . I do n't think a quick wave is quite as severe a violation as e.g. reading the paper ( or , as the FAA calls it , reading publications not related to the proper conduct of the flight ) during take-off . Compare it with a bus driver waving to a fellow driver or one reading the paper while driving . But then , if you do park your plane in a ditch while trying to wave to your mom , do n't be surprised to be held fully liable .
Shoulder harnesses have been required for all aircraft manufactured since <URL> . 14 CFR 91.107 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is pretty clear : ( 2 ) No pilot may cause to be moved on the surface , take off , or land a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ( except a free balloon that incorporates a basket or gondola , or an airship type certificated before November 2 , 1987 ) unless the pilot in command of that aircraft ensures that each person on board has been notified to fasten his or her safety belt and , if installed , his or her shoulder harness . ( 3 ) Except as provided in this paragraph , each person on board a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ( except a free balloon that incorporates a basket or gondola or an airship type certificated before November 2 , 1987 ) must occupy an approved seat or berth with a safety belt and , if installed , shoulder harness , properly secured about him or her during movement on the surface , takeoff , and landing . So what I read above can be interpreted as " if it 's installed , it 's required " . Some aircraft required an STC to retrofit the belts , you 'll need to find out if that is the case ( if it is , you ca n't remove it , but if there is no STC it could possibly be removed , a call to your local FSDO can clear that up ) . However I 've been told that if the aircraft is equipped with shoulder harnesses , then they are required to be used .
An example of oil labyrinth seal use I 'm taking the bearing sumps example . There are <URL> to maintain the engine rotors and shafts centered within the core and the stators . Some may use labyrinth seals . <URL> <URL> . Pressurized cavity during operation In a bearing sump with classic dry design , oil is provided directly to the bearing , and labyrinths seals maintain oil within a first cavity ( the sump ) . There is another cavity around the first where compressed air is injected . Air is tapped for internal use from a compressor stage ( bleed air ) . <URL> <URL> . This way if oil escapes the first labyrinth of the oil seal , it is contained by the pressure of air coming from the outer cavity on the other side of the seal . Actually air , which is provided at a higher pressure than oil , will enter the inner oil cavity and mix with oil to form a mist . This is why scavenged oil must then be filtered to separate air when returning to the oil tank ( oil must also be cooled has the bearing generates a significant amount of heat ) . Oil is directed to the bearing using jet nozzles , the sump is not completely filled . Someone more knowledgeable may explain why , perhaps an oil <URL> would appear and create unnecessary friction : <URL> Source : <URL> In today 's engines , oil is circulated using pumps . There are two pumps : One to supply with oil and one to scavenge oil . To ensure oil does n't accumulate into the sump , the scavenge pump has a higher capacity . Both pumps are driven by the rotation of the engine . Non operating engine The pumps are mechanical and driven by one of the engine shafts . When the engine is not operating , the pumps stop , oil is not supplied any more and it leaves the sump by the scavenge pipe . Bleed air is n't necessary any longer . When the engine is started , the pumps also start . Oil is therefore injected again into the sump . The bearing can sustain lack of lubrication for a short time , and there can be an emergency system if oil supply from the tank is interrupted . Residual leakage As there will be some limited leakage anyway , oil is extracted by the cavity drain and disposed overboard ( or returned to the oil tank ) .
The current QNH at an airport is included in METARs so you can grab it form there . There are a few online services to retrieve the METAR automatically , such as <URL> ( using Vienna airport as an example ) . The latest METAR when I wrote this answer was : which shows a QNH of 1012 . Note that depending on the country the format may vary slightly , but in Austria ( and European countries ) you should always find a value in the report .
Motive flow is required in design of ejector pumps in fuel system . Ejector pumps ( also known as jet pumps or eductor pumps ) have no moving parts and therefore represent a highly reliable , low cost means to move fuel in an aircraft . All jet pumps contain the physical characteristics illustrated in below figure . <URL> In this pump , the motive flow comes from a high pressure source such as a primary boost pump , or the returned fuel from the engine . When the high pressure motive flow passes through the throat it creates a suction which sucks fuel from its neighborhood and the total fuel flow are sent to another location . The overall efficiency of an ejector pump is low when compared to electric motor powered pumps but they are frequently used due to their extremely long life , high reliability and low cost . The ejector pumps generally are used for two functions : Ejector pumps are often used to provide the primary fuel boost function in smaller transport aircraft applications such as business jets and regional aircraft . In order to minimize the unusable fuel , scavenge pumps are often employed to suck up fuel from the remote corners of fuel tanks and to discharge this fuel at the inlet to the main feed pump ( s ) . Ejector pumps are used for this purpose and the motive flow for these scavenge devices may be taken from the feed pump outlet if other motive sources are not available . Note : Most of above material are from : Langton , R. ( 2009 ) . Aircraft fuel systems . Chichester , U.K Wiley .
I 'm not sure if you 're asking about general export regulations , in which case <URL> is useful , or the more specific licensing question . But regarding licensing it 's clear that you may not fly a US aircraft from the US to Brazil with only a Brazilian license . <URL> says : ( a ) Required pilot certificate for operating a civil aircraft of the United States . No person may serve as a required pilot flight crewmember of a civil aircraft of the United States , unless that person : ( 1 ) Has in the person 's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft when exercising the privileges of that pilot certificate or authorization -- ( i ) A pilot certificate issued under this part and in accordance with § 61.19 ; ( ii ) A special purpose pilot authorization issued under § 61.77 ; ( iii ) A temporary certificate issued under § 61.17 ; ( iv ) A document conveying temporary authority to exercise certificate privileges issued by the Airmen Certification Branch under § 61.29 ( e ) ; or ( v ) When operating an aircraft within a foreign country , a pilot license issued by that country may be used . In other words , you can use your Brazilian license to fly a US aircraft in Brazil ( see 61.3 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( v ) above ) but otherwise you need a US license or a special authorization ( <URL> covers leasing and commercial operations so it almost certainly wo n't apply to you ) . I know very little about this , but at least in theory it looks like your options are : Get a US license yourself , perhaps a foreign-based license based on your Brazilian one ( see <URL> ) Get some special permission from the FAA Pay a <URL> company to fly or transport the aircraft to Brazil Register the aircraft as Brazilian before it leaves the US ( this may not even be possible ) And those are only the FAA/aviation issues , you have to think about customs and general import/export regulations too , both in the US and Brazil . I would look for some specialized help with this .
For the GA fleet , there is some historical precedent operating here . Years ago , engines were much less reliable than they are today . Dragging it in generally means that you can not glide it in if you have a complete power failure . This translates to saying in the event of an engine failure , you are landing off airport with limited selection of landing sites ( your altitude is low as you are now below pattern altitude ) . So if you are flying behind an old Curtis OX-5 in your Jenny , a gliding approach to landing was recommended back in the day . Engines are much more reliable today . After an analysis of landing accidents , the FAA determined that a stabilized approach to landing is less likely to result in an accident , and they changed their guidance accordingly . Stabilized approaches are partial power-on landings . Some old timers and some old time CFIs reject the FAA 's statistical analysis and still teach/fly glide-it-in landings . Properly executed , both approaches to landing are safe . It is just that the FAA thinks that stabilized approaches are safer given engines commonly in use today . It is also true that virtually all airlines require stabilized approaches in their operating specs , and that a go around is mandatory if the approach is not stabilized . With this in mind , flight schools that aspire to send their graduates to the majors will all teach stabilized approaches .

What do solo pilots do between reporting points on longer flights ?
The short answer is that you keep checking everything in the aircraft is doing what it should . For light piston GA operations , one common acronym for en route checks is FREDA . Here are some things that could be included ( pilots often use their own checklists for things like this ) : Fuel . How much have I burned ? Is my navigation log up to date ? Have I burned the amount I expected ? How much longer can I fly for before I have to land ? Which airports are within my current range ring ? Is it time to switch tanks ? Is the aircraft still within weight and balance limits ? Is the airport where I planned to refuel still the right place to go ? Radios . Do I have all my radios set to correct and useful frequencies ? How am I going to identify my next waypoint ? Do I need to tune and identify a new VOR ? Have things been suspiciously silent for a while ? Should I file a PIREP ? Do I need to tell ATC I need a deviation for weather ? What 's the latest weather information from ADS-B or another source ? Can I guess which frequency ATC is going to hand me off to next ? Did ATC ask me to report at a certain time or place ? Engine . Are all temperatures , pressures , gauges etc. showing the values I expect ? Have I leaned the mixture properly ? Are the exhaust gas temperatures correct ? Is manifold pressure correct for this altitude ? Has anything changed unexpectedly since the last time I checked them ? If the engine dies right now , where am I going to land ? DI to compass . Reset the directional indicator to match the wet compass , to avoid gyroscopic precession errors . Altitude . Is this altitude correct for my current heading ? Is this the altitude I was assigned ? If I lose comms now , what altitude should I fly at ? Do I know what terrain is below me ? What 's ADS-B showing me right now ? Any potential traffic conflicts ? If I encounter icing here , will I descend , climb , or turn around ? Is the autopilot correctly configured ? Have I entered the current altimeter setting in all the instruments ? After you 've worked through all that , it 's usually time to go back to the beginning and start again :-) Of course , there are plenty of other things that pilots are likely to be doing , like having drinks or snacks , taking pictures , admiring the view , listening to music , trying to find their spare headset batteries at the bottom of their flight bag , and so on . But an IFR flight - or any flight - is never just sitting back between waypoints and waiting for ATC to call . The point of the constant checks is to detect any problems as soon as possible . For example , if you notice the oil pressure dropping gradually , you can take action while you still have engine power ; if the first you know about it is that the engine suddenly stops then you have a big problem . Not only have you lost engine power , you 're also not mentally ' primed ' to deal with the situation and that could turn a tricky situation into a dangerous one .
Please forgive me for asking if you are a " flat earth truther " . We sometimes get those numpties passing by trying to justify their theories ( especially the one about <URL> t to make sure no-one learns the secret ) . There have been many flights over the geographic South Pole , the first documented one being in 1935 by <URL> . See also the <URL> . <URL> , using a Boeing 747SP , also flew over both poles . No scheduled commercial flights over fly the South Pole since there are <URL> . Flights from New Zealand to South Africa would fly over Antarctica but no airline currently flies that route . As to problems with the compass , modern aircraft have no problems since the primary navigation source is GPS . If you were using a compass only , as you got close to the magnetic South pole ( remember , this is not even in Antarctica ) , the compass would become increasingly unreliable . Simply maintain a straight course though , over the pole , and the compass will become increasingly reliable . However , navigating over the magnetic poles using only a compass is the preserve of explorers and the fool-hardy . <URL> regarding navigation . It talks mainly about the North magnetic pole but is applicable to both . A couple of other considerations when asking about commercial flights is the need for <URL> and the need to carry special survival equipment when flying south of latitude 72 degrees which is very considerable and would require the removal of revenue seats to carry it . There is a big difference between the nearest suitable diversion airport flying over the Arctic and flying over the Antarctic .
If the aircraft is subject to the ADS-B mandate of Europe , it will not be allowed to operate in European airspace after June 7 , 2020 if it does not have a certified EUROCAE ED-102A ( equivalent to RTCA DO-260B ) compliant ADS-B transmitter . Aircraft with a maximum take-off weight exceeding 5700 kg or maximum operating true airspeed exceeding 250 knots are subject to the mandate . The USA rule is a bit different , as it allows ADS-B on universal access transceivers ( UAT ) below 18 000 ft which is different from the 1090ES technology used in DO-260 . You can do without ADS-B in the USA after January 1 , 2020 , if you never fly higher than 10 000ft MSL ( exceeding 10 000ft MSL is allowed as long as you do n't exceed 2 500ft AGL ) , you do not enter or overfly class C airspace and keep further than 30 NM from class B airspace . If your aircraft is 1090ES ADS-B equipped it must be DO-260B compliant ; if it UAT ADS-B equipped it must be DO-282B compliant . The difference between DO-260A and DO-260B are many small changes . This list is not exhaustive : change in the way position integrity is encoded , addition of barometric pressure setting , new encoding aircraft length / width change in encoding of speed on surface Typically the update from DO-260A to DO-260B requires a firmware update and some configuration changes . However , note that the mandates include more requirements than just the ADS-B protocol version . There are requirements on the integrity of your position source ( GPS ) as well , and the maximum latency in the position transmission chain . In the worst case you are up for a rewiring of the GPS or even installing a new GPS .
Yes , for a while : Capt. Al Haynes , after <URL> on United Flight 232 . <URL> I was lucky enough to have dinner with Al Haynes a few years ago , and he told me that he had a very difficult time overcoming the guilt of the disaster . The talks he gives have been a way of coping . ( As a side note , he also donates all the money he receives from the talks to the survivors of the crash ) . Capt. Haynes has said the same thing in various interviews : The Seattle Times : Haynes said it took many sessions with a psychiatrist to overcome his survivor 's guilt . He resumed flying three months after the accident ; mandatory retirement at 60 followed two years later . <URL> NY Mag : It was very hard to get past the guilt of surviving . My job had been to get people from point A to point B safely , and I did n't do it . I felt that I had killed them . I had a lot of psychiatric help at the hospital and afterward . Finally , one psychiatrist said , " You 're not going to find an answer . You just have to accept that it happened . " <URL> AvWeb : Haynes said , at the time , that he remained troubled by the accident and constantly wondered if there was something he could have done , some overlooked decision that would have saved all aboard . <URL> Before his death , <URL> said something similar : " To find out 112 people did n't make it , that just about destroyed me , " Fitch once said . " I would have given my life for any of them . It was a really tough time . " <URL>
The crash was only one of the ( albeit an important ) reason for the grounding of Concorde . Actually , the aircraft was retired around three years after the crash . The main reason was that not enough people were flying it to keep it profitable . The Concorde as a technological marvel , but it had a number of disadvantages : The aircraft was costly - The program cost over $ 3B and produced 20 aircraft , of which 14 were used in commercial service . Maintenance costs - The small number of aircraft and technological sophistication meant that the cost of spares was high and options limited . Operating costs - The Concorde consumed nearly three times per passenger fuel when compared to the Boeing 747-100 . Still , the aircraft made operational profit due to the high cost of tickets . Recession - After 9/11 attacks exacerbated the global downturn in aviation due to recession , there was an enormous drop in first class air travel , on which Concorde was dependent on . While announcing the retirement , British Airways cited commercial reasons , with passenger revenue falling steadily against a backdrop of rising maintenance costs for the aircraft .
The U.S. Air Force ( and Navy ) still uses , and has used off and on since WWII , what are commonly referred to as " Go Pills " for instances when pilots need to be up for long periods of time - in wartime , sometimes longer than the crew rest regulation . ( These pills can also be used for altering sleep cycles , along with " no-go " pills ; for example , when changing from day to night ) . The most common go pill is <URL> , which is an amphetamine . You can find some more information in <URL> .
Well in regard to " How are these situations resolved ? " you 've already answered your own question in a way : the intended recipient responds with something like <URL> or " Calling center , say again . " ( If they are expecting to hear from a specific aircraft they 'll often respond with " N12345 , say again . " , and if the frequency congestion is really bad controllers may add " All other aircraft standby " ) . As kevin42 pointed out this is very similar to what digital <URL> systems do - they detect a collision ( " Blocked " ) , wait a while , and try their transmission again . As a practical matter , two-way voice communication over the radio is possible , but difficult : for example a discrete " uplink " and " downlink " frequency as you have with some radio systems would be impractical in the sort of mesh topology that you have with aviation radio ( you could implement it for a single air-to-ground pair trivially , but aviation radios are also used for air-to-air communication , and it 's important that pilots hear what 's going on as this enables them to build a mental picture of the airspace , as well as ensure that they 're not blocking other pilot 's transmissions ) . Regarding analog-vs-digital , the traditional AM radio used in aircraft has one major advantage over its digital counterparts : when two digital signals overlap the result is garbage -- you ca n't recover any of the information . When two analog AM signals overlap you get heterodyning ( the two signals mix , and your receiver pipes that mix into your ears ) . The resulting mixed signal sounds AWFUL , there 's an ear-bleeding squeal from the out-of-phase carriers and the voice modulations combine to a garbled mess much of the time , but with experience you can usually pick out one of the communications ( particularly if you 're close to one of the transmitters , where it will overpower the more distant signal ) . The ability to step on a transmission as described above this can be useful : Instructions have been issued over a " stuck mic " before to get other aircraft off the frequency . In a similar vein , if you have an emergency you probably are n't going to listen before you talk - you 're going to key the mic with your mayday and even if the controller misses half of what you 're saying under the heterodyne noise they 'll know there 's an emergency when they hear the other half of your transmission and tell everyone else to standby while they talk to you . In both of those situations a digital system implementing CSMA/CD would detect that the frequency was in use and not transmit ( and if were a digital system and transmitted anyway both digital signals would be garbled and unusable ) .
V1 is the calculated decision point at which takeoff must continue . Unless the aircraft is suffering a catastrophic failure , the pilot should not abort takeoff after V1 . The danger when taking off during windshear is the sudden lost of airspeed may result in the airplane settling back on the ground after it has become airborne . The technique , therefore , is aimed at gaining ground clearance in the shortest amount of time possible . In general , this involves : Apply max thrust Delay rotation Once rotation is initiated , quickly pitch up to gain altitude Below is an extract from the Boeing 777 FCOM about taking off when windshear is suspected ( my emphasis ) : Takeoff with less than full rated thrust is not recommended ( ... ) Use the longest suitable runway ( ... ) Consider increasing Vr speed to the performance limited gross weight rotation speed . ( ... ) If windshear is encountered at or beyond the actual gross weight Vr , do not attempt to accelerate to the increased Vr , but rotate without hesitation . ( ... ) Minimize reductions from the initial climb pitch attitude until terrain and obstruction clearance is assured , unless stick shaker activates . ( ... ) Stick shaker must be respected at all times .
That 's a good question , and brings up a joke that many pilots know well : " What 's going to be in the cockpit of the future ? " " A dog and a pilot . " " A dog ? Why a dog ? " " Well , the dog is there to keep the pilot from touching anything . " " Ummm , why have the pilot then ? " " Well , someone has to feed the dog ! " Technology has improved to the point where airplanes can pretty much fly and even land themselves . They are even getting pretty good at handling " normal " emergencies like engine failures and depressurizations . Where pilots really shine though are the type of abnormal and emergency situations that are n't " in the book " . <URL> , a computer will be out of options because it was never programmed to handle that ( because it was considered " virtually impossible " when it was designed ) . A pilot on the other hand can analyze and experiment until he finds enough of a solution to keep the airplane in the air as he works through other issues . During a total electrical failure , the computers wo n't be much good . Sure , you can design redundant systems and make it so that it " can never happen " , but what about when it does ? There are also all of the little things that a pilot is constantly making decisions on how to handle . Some examples could include : Can the airplane fly with a particular feature inoperative ? What about multiple features inoperative ? How do they interact with each other ? What do you do when the passengers take too long to board and you are going to miss your departure slot ? What do you do when the ground crew forgets to close a door ? What about when the tug driver does n't push you back quite far enough ? Or ATC wants to change you to a different runway ? Or you ask ATC to change you to a different runway because it might save a few minutes and that will keep you from having to deice again ? Or another airplane unexpectedly pulls out in front of you while taxiing ? A pilot can see " ugly " clouds off the end of the runway and decide that it would be better to wait a bit before taking off . What happens when a flock of birds suddenly appears during the takeoff roll ? What happens when a passenger gets sick or unruly ? When do you need to divert and when can you continue ? On a typical flight , a pilot will make hundreds of small decisions that can make a big difference in the flight . Any one of these ( or one of the tens or hundreds of thousands of other things that could happen ) could trip up a computer . The pilot is also there as the " final authority " . If a hacker were to somehow hack into the automated systems , a pilot can always disconnect them and fly the airplane manually . He can turn off systems , he can be ... Well , the pilot can be creative and a computer can only do what it was programmed to do . Right now when a drone crashes it is n't such a big deal because nobody was on board . If an airliner with a load full of paying passengers crashes it is a big deal . Even just one . Many of these problems can be overcome . Some of them already have been . Some of them may never be fully handled in an automatic way but maybe we could still do automated flights with an acceptable level of safety . Some automation is actually better than some pilots in certain areas . However , the biggest reason that we do n't have fully automated passenger airplanes is because the general public feels comforted by a person being up front who can take over and carry them to safety if needed . Even if the technology were 100 % ready for automated passenger flights , I think that the number of people willing to purchase a ticket would be so low that it would be financially unfeasible for an airline to deploy it .
The FAA provides an <URL> I would say it falls under " aviation concern " . In your description if you include tail number and time they should be able to figure out who was flying ( or in the cockpit if its a 2 man situation ) . You can also contact your <URL> and report the tail number and time of incident . Aircraft owners/renters ( the people the tail number will trace back to ) will more than likely know who was flying a given tail number at a certain time so as long as you know when it happened you should be ok its not necessarily on you to know who was flying but the tail number and incident time is key .
It depends . Some instructions are really simple and with a little practice , are very easy to remember . Other ones will be so common , they are just remembered : But this is where the danger creeps in . It is possible , and has happened , that the crew think they heard something but actually , the instruction was different today . The prudent crew will write it down . <URL> , or boards clipped to the control column on which to write taxi clearances , complex airways clearances and so on . In some large aircraft , many light aircraft and in helicopters , pilots might wear a kneeboard to write instructions on . It is a minor advantage to me that I am left handed and as a helicopter pilot , this means that my kneeboard is on my left leg where I can easily write without taking my hand off the cyclic and having it right next to the collective . <URL> Most instructions come in the same order , every flight . For example , here is a simplified list . This happens every time so the crew know what 's coming next , what it will likely contain , and how to respond : Clearance for the flight plan . Permission to start and push back . Taxi instructions . Departure instructions . Take off clearance . Hand-off from departure controller to area controller . etc etc. . Note that any instruction which will cause the aircraft to change it 's configuration or location must be repeated . The controller then also gets to check they 've got it right . This includes things like speed , direction or altitude changes , taxi and departure instructions , frequency and squawk changes etc. . There are also some words which are only ever used at certain times , e.g. " takeoff " is only ever said when an aircraft is cleared to take off . For example , " ready for departure " tells the controller that the aircraft is prepared to take off immediately . The crew should not say " ready for takeoff " . You can sometimes hear a pilot receiving a long instruction , start to read it back , pause , then ask for a repeat . Very frustrating when you are sitting there waiting to get your request in . You just know they thought they could remember it , but did n't . Write it down if it 's anything except a simple instruction or clearance . Here 's an example of a complex one . SuperAir 123 , cleared to Barcelona via vector departure , fly runway track , climb altitude 5000ft , after passing 2000ft turn right direct Hamm VOR , route as filed , squawk 1234 , information Alpha current , startup approved The crew might write it down like this . Each pilot develops their own preferred shorthand : VD RWY TRK 5000 / 2000 + RT HMM / SQ1234 ALPHA / SU Very brief since they know what each part is and the order they come in . Since it contains instructions , the crew will then read it back . Cleared Barcelona via vector departure , runway track 5000ft , after passing 2000ft right direct Hamm , squawk 1234 , Alpha on-board , startup approved . SuperAir 123 . Finally , a good reason to write stuff down is because sometimes ( and we 've all been there ) , you think you remember , then turn round to your co-pilot 2 minutes later and ask " what was that altitude ? " . Here 's a great <URL> and an approach to writing down clearances .
I can think of a few : Any delay in the flight is a waste of valuable resources - the flight , cabin and ground crew who have to be paid and the aircraft itself , which is not generating any revenue but costing money for the airline . Also , the airline may have to pay for the time the aircraft spends in the airport . There is an economic cost associated with on-time performance - for example , passengers are more likely to take airlines which have better on-time performance over others . Another case is that of customers taking connecting flights - again , on-time performance could be the difference here . This means loss of business for the lower performing airline . For airlines operating multiple trips per day , the delay and the associated costs are cumulative ; for example , if the first flight of the day is delayed , it snowballs into the day - requires replanning for the rest of the day in other airports and causes further delays . For the airline industry , the delays cost billions of dollars every year ( <URL> and <URL> ) and can reduce the operating revenues by a few percentage points ( <URL> ) . The table below , taken from the NEXTOR report on <URL> shows the cost to US airlines due to delays . <URL> As can be seen , the the costs due to delay to airlines are quite high .
Bear in mind that these tests were n't to prove the safety of the aircraft per se , just to show that it would work as an airliner . It had to be loaded up with an appropriate complement of passengers and luggage to prove this . However proving flights may not generate revenue from passengers - they are either selected through an application process or chosen at random , and take part in the proceedings free of charge . <URL> ( Page 2 , point 3 )
There is certainly a difference , but most of it definitely has a good explanation . Most of it is overhead such as taxi time that applies to both flights ( almost ) equally . This has a relative big impact on short flights . The taxi out time for both flights will be about <URL> is not exactly known for its quiet taxiways . Both flights will add about 30 nautical mile for their departure route . Both flights will fly approximately great circle routes , probably less than 2 % extra distance during cruise . The LAX flight will typically do a straight in arrival , almost no extra distance there . The DEN flight will typically do a full arrival , 30 NM extra distance there . The taxi in at <URL> on average , and <URL> . Let 's assume that both aircraft fly 460 knot true airspeed with 20 knots headwind during cruise , so 440 knots ground speed . My estimates for the total flight times are then : JFK-LAX GC distance 2150 n.m Departure detour 30 n.m Arrival detour 0 n.m ( straight in ) Cruise detour 25 n.m Total distance 2205 n.m Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 2085 n.m. @ 440 kts = 4 hour 44 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 12 minutes Total time : 5h50 minutes Margin : 10 minutes JFK-DEN GC distance 1400 n.m. Departure detour 30 n.m. Arrival detour 30 n.m. Cruise detour 15 n.m. Total distance 1475 n.m. Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 1355 n.m. @ 440 kts = 3 hour 05 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 9 minutes Total time : 4h07 minutes Margin : 33 minutes
Navigation has gotten much simpler over the years . Initially , navigation would be done by a combination of dead reckoning , looking out the window for landmarks , and for night or long-distance flights , by celestial navigation ( many old airplanes have a window at the navigator 's station specifically to let the navigator see the stars ) . This took quite a bit of time and effort , so the pilot could n't do it and also fly the airplane . In the 1920s , radio navigation was added to the navigator 's toolkit , but finding bearings to beacons and calculating a location was still an entirely manual process . Additionally , radio beacons did n't cover the entire world , so older navigation techniques were still needed for most flights . In the 1950s , fully-automatic radio direction finding systems became common and navigation beacons were available across most of Europe and North America . At this point , the workload involved in navigation dropped to the point that the pilot could also navigate : plot out the sequence of NDBs to follow ahead of time , then tune the radio and follow the navigation display . Very recently , navigation has been integrated with the autopilot to the point that the pilot can punch in a sequence of waypoints and have the airplane fly the route entirely on its own . And yes , even today if the electronic navigation system fails , the fallback is map , compass , and slide rule .
Airplanes are expected by air traffic control to turn at a " standard rate of turn " which is 3 degrees per second . This will provide a 90 degree turn in 30 seconds . A standard rate is used so that controllers can anticipate how long it takes for an airplane to turn to a heading and they can line them up easier . It also makes the turn happen in a smaller amount of airspace so that two airplanes can be flying in the same general vicinity without getting too close . Unfortunately , at the speeds that jet airplanes travel this would mean a very high angle of bank . A standard rate turn at 200 KT TAS is about 30 degrees of bank and jets can go much faster than this , which would require even higher bank angles . They actually limit it to 25 degrees of bank when using a flight director , mainly for passenger comfort . It can be impressive when looking out the window and seeing the ground , but do n't worry , the airplane is more than designed for it ! This is used mainly at lower altitudes where there are lots of airplanes . Once they are up high and airplanes are further apart ( and the turns are also usually smaller ) they can bank even less ( by using a " half-bank " mode ) which adds to passenger comfort .
On the first flight of the day , after every refueling , and if you have flown through precipitation or the plane is left in the rain , you check the fuel for water and to make sure you have the right kind of fuel . Since water is heavier than fuel , if there is just a little bit of water in the fuel it could cause the engine to stop . You ca n't pull over to the side of the road like you can in a car , so you need to immediately deal with the problem . The most likely place for this to occur is on takeoff . If you think fast and switch tanks , you might get lucky and only have water in one tank so you can continue your takeoff . If not , you may need to find a place to land . In 17 years of flying , I have only found water in the fuel once , and it was n't even my airplane . But since it was on Catalina Island , a stopped engine would not have been pretty . The other reason to check the fuel is that airplanes designed for 100LL do not burn Jet Fuel . Jet fuel is denser than 100LL so it will sink to the bottom of the tank . It is straw colored and somewhat greasy so you can tell if you plane has accidentally been filled with it , but you really have to be paying attention . It would be easy to miss if you just topped off . There have been incidents when twin-engine planes have mistakenly been filled with Jet A and have either crashed or had expensive fuel system cleaning required . In this article , <URL> describes his experiences . After the <URL> of a Cessna 421s someone did a <URL> to see how easy it is to identify a combination of Jet A and Avgas . It 's fairly hard using standard pre-flight practices . That 's why many people recommend watching the fuel truck if you have a twin-engine plane or one that prominently says " Turbo " on the side . Many aircraft have rubber bladders to hold the fuel . Most older Cessnas have them . Water can get trapped in the folds of the bladder and get into the engine later when the fuel is sloshed around . Even if the fuel source is free of water , a tank that is not full can have water condense in it . Most autogas has some ethanol in it . Water will dissolve in a gas-ethanol mixture and so a slug of water wo n't get into the engine like it will in an aircraft engine . Contamination is less of an issue and is one that is really hard for a GA pilot to determine . You really ca n't tell if the fuel is contaminated with other petroleum products just by looking at it .
As late as possible to still meet your company 's specific stabilized approach guidelines ( mine were 500 ft VMC , 1000 ft IMC ) . If you need the drag , then use them earlier . In the EMB-145 in still wind or a headwind you could cross the FAF at 250 kts and clean and be on speed and configured by 1000 ' if you dropped the gear at the FAF ( and opened the speed brakes and the first notch of flaps all at once ) . Normally though , I 'd drop the gear around 1000 ' . Acronyms : VMC = visual meteorological conditions IMC = instrument meteorological conditions FAF = final approach fix EMB-145 is the type designator for the Embraer 145 regional jet
Windshear , yes . Seismic events , no . Most major U.S. airports have a <URL> -- Low-level Windshear Alert System , which is essentially an array of anemometers around the airport which detect wind speed and direction . The values from each station are processed by a computer that uses algorithms to detect a windshear or microburst event , and it notifies controllers in the tower . As a simple example , if the anemometers around the perimeter of the airport are all pointing toward the center of the airport , that 's a strong indication that there is a microburst over the center of the airport , with air descending into the ground and then spreading out in all directions . Obviously , the algorithms can detect cases beyond just that . And , many airports supplement that system with <URL> as well . Regardless of how they 're generated ( LLWAS with anemometers , Doppler , pilot reports , visual observations of blowing dust , etc ) , the warnings are broadcast by the tower controllers , rather than by any automatic system . In the aircraft , aural warnings from the GPWS ( reactive windshear -- noting changes in groundspeed and sink ) and the EGPWS ( predictive windshear -- returns from the aircraft weather radar ) are automatic , but they do n't block a radio frequency . Automated alerts over the tower frequency might block an even more important transmission , so it 's left to the controller 's judgement when to broadcast the alerts . ( They 're usually pretty prompt ! ) No airport I 'm aware of has a system similar to what the OP described for seismic events . I would assume that the risks to a high-speed train from an imminent earthquake -- i.e. the train may derail at high speed with catastrophic results -- are far greater than the risks to aircraft . I 've never read anything about what happens when you 're landing or taking off in an earthquake , but I 'd doubt that anything other than the most severe would have much effect . And if the earth is shifting enough that you ca n't keep the aircraft on the runway , well , it 's a really bad day for pretty much everybody in that state that day !
This answer will be quite anecdotal ( I have not seen a survey on the question ) . It will answer the question for " most people I 've worked with " , and for " my " aircraft ( B737NG ) . Also , the usual disclaimer : different airlines/aircraft manufacturers may have different SOPs/instructions/limitations . Consult your manuals . In general : most pilots will leave FD on , IF it still provides useful and reliable information , without being an obstruction/nuisance ( i.e. when configuring it to give correct guidance would be more trouble than it 's worth , given that you already have visual references ) . This philosophy is also usually what you 'll find in an airline SOP , but in more formal language . I 'll try to provide some examples ( non-exhaustive ) to illustrate this depending on how you were set up before being cleared for the visual approach : ILS to straight in landing Leave the FD on until landing ( on my aircraft , B737NG , it will disappear at 50 ft RA ) , both localizer and glideslope will give usable and reliable information to the FD . ( Caveat : in visual conditions , ATC might be less strict about avoiding signal interference . They might for instance let an aircraft on the ground taxi to cross your runway while you 're on approach , which could cause localizer/glideslope interference ) . ILS to sidestep Most would turn the FD 's off . Both localizer guidance and glideslope guidance will be to the " wrong " runway . The FD is likely to be more of a nuisance than a useful tool . Non-ILS approaches with no centerline offset The Localizer/LNAV path will give good lateral guidance to the FD . The vertical guidance will depend on the approach and your equipment . If the aircraft generates a good quality vertical path , which crosses the runway threshold at a reasonable height ( 50 ft ) , there is no real good reason to turn the FD 's off . If all you have is vertical speed ( V/S ) guidance , it might be more helpful to turn FD 's off . Non-ILS approaches with centerline offset ( for example most VOR approaches ) At some point during the approach , you 'll want to abandon the approach course , and line up with the runway . Where this point occurs depends on specific approach , and how you intend to fly it . Example : A VOR approach to runway 36 ( runway heading 000 ) might use a VOR 1 nm east of the runway with inbound course 005 . You might want to stay on the inbound course of the VOR until it crosses the extended runway centerline . In this case , most people would keep the FD on until reaching this point , and then turn it off , as it wo n't give you any useful guidance afterwards .

Are remarks in the Chart Supplement ( A/FD ) " regulatory " or " advisory " ?
A required rule in the airport/facility directory is required . It is a very good idea to check the AFD entry online ( or on paper ) before you fly to a new airport . It just takes a second and you can learn important things , such as " NO DEPS AFT 2230 " or " PPR FOR TKOF ON RY 15 . CTC FBO 970-920-2016 " ( <URL> ) .
The <URL> ( section 2-4-20 ) say that the ' group form ' should be used by controllers when talking to any aircraft with an FAA authorized call sign . So you would expect to hear it with airline traffic but not private flights : Air carrier and other civil aircraft having FAA authorized call signs . State the call sign followed by the flight number in group form . NOTE - " Group form " is the pronunciation of a series of numbers as the whole number , or pairs of numbers they represent rather than pronouncing each separate digit . The use of group form may , however , be negated by four-digit identifiers or the placement of zeros in the identifier . EXAMPLE − " American Fifty − Two . " " Delta One Hundred . " " Eastern Metro One Ten . " " General Motors Thirty Fifteen . " " United One Zero One . " " Delta Zero One Zero . " " TWA Ten Zero Four . "
If you are seated behind the wings , but close , you can usually see black markings ( thick line and a number ) near the inboard side of the engine pylon which indicate their extension . Some might not be visible when the wing is in cruise configuration . Same goes for leading edge slats , only you 'd need to be seated near the overwing emergency exit to see those . I 've personally seen them on both Airbus and Embraer jets ( no recent flights on Boeing airframes so ca n't confirm if they mark them too ) . <URL> ( <URL> )
It 's not a printing error . FAA sectional charts are updated only once every six months . In order to to reduce the number of NOTAMs due to sectional changes ( which can number in the hundreds between cycles ) , the FAA provides a section in the Airport Facility Directory ( AFD ) , titled " Aeronautical Chart Bulletin " that identifies changes that have occurred since a chart 's publication . Pilots should check this section on each AFD update for changes on their intended route of flight . Once the change is posted in the AFD , the respective NOTAM is taken down . Here is an image of the applicable AFD page for Salinas , as of the date of this answer :
<URL> provides cloud tops for weather with precipitation . Cloud tops with no precip can be discerned from data provided in the Skew-t log ℗ charts that are part of this app <URL> Where the temperature and dew point on the skew-t charts are converged you can expect clouds . If the convergence extends into the freezing level indicated on the chart you can expect icing .
Either C or D controllers will likely accept your requested heading , which can be given as a rough compass point , on initial contact . This contact will be after picking up the terminal info on ATIS , when you contact ground . Your preferred direction will be passed up the chain . A class D may tell you something like " cleared for takeoff , Northbound departure approved " , in which case I would feel free to turn as soon as I deemed it safe . In a class C scenario , the same thing could happen , but they might vector you around other traffic . In all cases " resume own navigation " will be permission to take your heading . If you are still on runway heading and feel you have not been given a clearance sending you where you want to go , you may contact tower or departure control , depending on whom you are with , and say something like " Tower , Diamond two-eight bravo , request heading zero six zero " They may respond with an " approved as requested " or " heading zero six zero approved " or they may give you instructions to " fly present heading , I 'll call your turn " indicating they are not ready for you to take your heading yet . The short answer is , you can take your heading when you have been cleared to do so . Understanding when you have been cleared is a matter of becoming familiar with standard phraseology . Controllers I have worked with , especially at C and D airspaces have been accommodating . Their job is to send pilots where they want to go while keeping aircraft out of each other 's way . They have rolled along with me when I have changed my mind about landing , I can say " I changed my mind , I 'd rather depart the pattern to the south " but to be brief I 'll say " Cancel landing intention , request south departure . " As airspace gets bigger and controllers are busier ( which can vary by location and even time of day ) brevity becomes increasingly important . To get practice , you can find out when an particular airspace is less busy . Controllers have been known to be chatty when traffic volume is low , and you may even be able to ask questions about preferred phraseology .
<URL> The probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew 's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach , including the published missed approach procedure , which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain . <URL> According to released information this cargo aircraft overran the runway after the crew aborted the take-off above Vr after experiencing pitch control problems . The final report of this accident is not yet published but a preliminary report is available . The investigation focusses on the payload distribution which may have caused imbalance leading to the perceived control problems . <URL> The aircraft crashed on final approach in low visibility conditions ( 800 meters ) . During the initial approach the crew had requested and ILS approach ( precision approach ) to runway 02 but then changed their minds and asked for a VOR approach ( non-precision approach ) to runway 20 . During the approach , after deactivation of the autopilot , the aircraft deviated 340 meters to the left and the crew subsequently announced they were going around . Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit tree tops and impacted residential buildings . The final report is expected in October 2015 . To me it seems the probable cause is the failure of the flight crew to properly execute the published instrument approach including the published missed approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft impacting the trees and buildings . <URL> The investigation into this accident is still running , only some preliminary information has been published . Preliminary data indicates that about 36 seconds after takeoff the engine no. 2 auto-feathered , about 46 seconds subsequent to auto-feather the engine no. 1 was shut off by the crew , resulting in loss of all thrust . The aircraft subsequently descended , stalled and crashed into a river . ATR-42 , 16 August 2015 , Trigana Air Service Flight 257 This accident occurred just a couple of days ago so there are few facts known yet and no preliminary findings are published . I will not speculate about the probable cause of this accident . The common thread in the first four accidents seems to be the failure to comply with established procedures resulting in the loss of the aircraft . In two cases ( Lao Airlines Flight 301 and TransAsia Airways Flight 222 ) the flight crew flew a controllable aircraft into the ground . In the case of the Air Niugini crash improper loading of the aircraft is likely to be the cause , resulting in the aircraft being not trimmed correctly for take-off . The crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 235 is the only crash that involved an aircraft system malfunction ( engine 2 failure ) . However , the ATR-72 can fly on a single engine so the failure itself should not have been fatal . The crew then shut down the other engine ( number 1 ) which sealed the aircraft 's fate . It is too early to conclude that the crew did n't follow the correct procedures here ; for example there may have been ambiguous indications from the engine instruments that led them to believe that engine no. 1 had failed . However with the information currently available it seems that the crew did not follow the correct procedures for shutting down a failed engine . The high number of crashes involving an ATR aircraft seems not to be related to the model itself , but to the safety culture and lack of training within a number of airlines operating the aircraft .
As the wikipedia article clearly states , there are several types of Codeshare Agreements : Block space codeshare : A commercial ( marketing ) airline purchases a fixed number of seats from the administrating ( operating/prime ) carrier . A fixed price is typically paid , and the seats are kept away from the Administrating carrier 's own inventory . The marketing airline decides on their own which booking classes the seats are sold in ( the block of seats are optimised just like another aircraft cabin ) . Free flow codeshare : The airlines ' inventory and reservation systems communicate in real-time by messaging , commonly IATA AIRIMP/PADIS messaging ( TTY and EDIFACT ) . A booking class mapping is defined between the airlines . No seats are locked to any of the airlines , and any airline can sell any number of seats . Capped free flow : Basically the same as above , but a capping ( max number of seats ) are defined for each of the marketing airlines participating in the codeshare with the Administrating ( operating/prime ) carrier . In these cases , profitability of the Airline Marketing the other airline 's tickets is possible in any of the following ways : There might be an agreement with the Carrier Airlines where the Marketing Airline gets to sell the tickets at the same rate as being sold by the Carrier Airline , but the Carrier Airline sells the tickets to the Marketing Airline at lower prices . This helps the Marketing Airline to generate revenue and improve its indicated ( apparent ) frequency on the given route . The Carrier Airline is benefited in a way where its tickets are sold on more than one portals , so better visibility ( Marketing ) and hence the name . Now a days alliances like <URL> are being formed , where multiple carriers come together and form codeshare bases to mutually benefit each other . The Marketing Airline might even sell the tickets at a cheaper price than the original Carrier Airline , just to establish its base in the route before starting its operations , so that when it starts its operations , people already know about it . hence , without deploying planes for the route , it can already have an established consumer base .
The only formal classification of door types that I could find is in <URL> , which specifies the emergency exit requirements for transport category aircraft . It defines Type I-IV , Type A-C , ventral and tailcone exits . The doors you usually enter and leave the aircraft through are probably type I or A : Type I . This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high , with corner radii not greater than eight inches . Type A . This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 42 inches wide by 72 inches high , with corner radii not greater than seven inches . These definitions are quite generic , but Transport Canada has a handy list of <URL> that gives specific details ( often including the type ) for many common aircraft . It says this for the 767 main doors : B-767-200 / 300ER ( Doors 1L/R FWD , 2L/R AFT ) Note : Some models equipped with 2 additional type 1 exits L/R just forward of wing . H - 1.88 m ( 6 ft 2 in ) W - 1.07 m ( 3 ft 6 in ) ; Type A Equivalent force required to move door control handle from closed/locked position to open position ( Normal and Emergency ) : 12 kg ( 26 lbs ) . Approximate force required to open a door ( lift upward ) from unlocked to open : 18 kg ( 40lbs ) . " Counterbalance " opening design . Inward/upward opening doors . Manually operated except some models equipped with electrical ( normal operation ) opening/closing option ( FWD Entry Door ) . Unique arming/disarming mechanism ( lever , indicators ) . Release button must be depressed and held to move arming lever to " Slide Armed " mode . Yellow plastic " Emergency Use Only " ( bendable ) flag moves upward in front of Door Control Handle when slide is in armed mode . Double channel slides . Upward rotating Door Control Handle . " Uplatch " mechanism holds door in open position . Button must be depressed while door is lowered initial few inches , to release . You can see from that list that the details can vary a lot , even if the basic designs are very similar . Coming up with pros and cons for every variant would be tough ( especially for me , since I know nothing about it ! ) , but obviously some aircraft are larger than others and that will limit how much space is available for the door mechanism . There are also operational considerations : aircraft that frequently operate out of smaller airports without <URL> may need to have <URL> , which are usually built into the doors .
The plane was certified with US Gallons . Use those for fuel consumption . The conversion tables are there in case your FBO 's fuel pump is calibrated in L or Imp Gal .
No . The regulations that apply to a student pilot do not apply to the private pilot working on a new category or class rating . § 61.81 Applicability . This subpart prescribes the requirements for the issuance of student pilot certificates , the conditions under which those certificates are necessary , and the general operating rules and limitations for the holders of those certificates . The required endorsements for a private pilot working on a new category or class rating are also different . Student pilots are required to have endorsements for pre-solo flight training , a solo endorsement each 90 days and an endorsement for each cross country . The student pilot must also abide by all the limitations placed on those endorsements by the recommending instructor . A private / commercial / ATP pilot working on a new category or class rating is required to have one endorsement .

This depends on how the systems are plumbed , and while this is likely an exception , for some airplanes like the EMB-145 , the answer is yes . The EMB-145 has 2 hydraulic systems . System # 1 serviced the outboard brakes and system # 2 serviced the inboard brakes and the parking brake . The parking brake actuated all of the brakes and this let you transfer fluid between the systems through the outboard brakes . This is n't a normal procedure , but one maintenance would walk you through if you had low fluid in one system and more than you needed in the other to balance the systems if you were out somewhere without the ability to service the hydraulic fluid . The procedure was either Depress and hold toe brakes Set parking brake Release toe brakes Release parking brake or the opposite , depending on which way you wanted to transfer fluid . This works in flight or on the ground ( <URL> )
does a worker go to an airport and monitors all information , and choose what kind of approach/departure ( for example ) will be ? Or do airport workers advise regulators ( charts creators ) ? Yes . :) Airport/airspace procedures are mainly created by a country 's local aviation authority , so if you want an instrument approach to your private airstrip in the US you would contact <URL> , probably through someone at your local FSDO , and ask them to work with you to develop the procedure . The Procedures people will survey the approach and design a procedure that makes sure you wo n't hit anything on the ground , and ensure that your procedure wo n't conflict with other existing procedures . Once the procedure is designed they 'll test-fly it - that 's done <URL> - and if everything checks out they 'll publish charts for it . Once published the FAA will periodically re-evaluate then procedure , both through flight checks and other feedback ( if your new procedure is generating a lot of noise complaints for example the FAA will work with you to reduce the impact ) .
Dogfight is about energy management . You care less about climbing than about being able to turn your nose and weapons into the right direction as quickly as possible without falling out of the sky . Maximum climb would be required in those scenarios : Fly as efficiently as possible . Flying higher means flying faster and in colder air , so the engines are <URL> . Note that todays airliners climb as fast or faster than fighter aircraft in WW II . Evade ground threats . After delivering its ordnance , an attack aircraft would desire to get away from hostile fire as quickly as possible . Sometimes this is achieved by flying with the <URL> , though . Break off combat : If you know you can climb faster than your opponent , you can choose whether you fight or get away , a luxury the other guy does not have . Intercept : If you were ordered to intercept an unknown aircraft flying high above , maximum climb speed is helpful . If you need to be fast as well , your optimum climb profile is that of <URL> , though . I interpret minimum rate of climb as maximum descent rate . Typical scenarios are : Pressure loss in an airliner , when higher density air should be reached in order to <URL> . Dropping parachutists : If the aircraft lands ahead of the skydivers , it can fly more often and earn more revenue . Extreme case : Dive bombing . Actually , most dive bombers employed air brakes to limit the speed in a dive .
To get an idea of the maximum forces , look at the certification limits . <URL> gives the limits for GA aircraft and <URL> those for larger aircraft including airliners . If these forces would be exceeded , even when something has failed , the aircraft would not be certified . The short-term limits in pitch are : 60 lbs for stick-controlled aircraft ( only covered in FAR 23 ) , 50 lbs when only one hand is available for control , and 75 lbs when both hands can be used for control . The short-term limits in roll are : 30 lbs for stick-controlled aircraft ( only covered in FAR 23 ) , 25 lbs when only one hand is available for control , and 50 lbs when both hands can be used for control . The maximum force limits for prolonged application are much lower again .
For this we need to reference the <URL> First off this will tell us who is in charge down there ( at least for US bases ) as its not quite an ice frontier free for all , Oversight of the on-ice operations of the civil aircraft is NSF-delegated to the Dept of the Interior/OAS Office of Aviation Services ( OAS ) in accordance with the SLA between OAS/AIL . Joint use of the USAP airspace in Antarctica requires close coordination between the DoD and NSF ( and its delegations ) . It looks like if you want to fly down there you need to file <URL> 2.3.4 . Intercontinental flights between New Zealand and Antarctica will require USAP aircrew to file a DD Form 1801 ( International Flight Plan ) in Christchurch Base Operations to Christchurch Clearance Delivery . Flights utilizing the Macquarrie route will require a FIR estimate for Melbourne and Auckland boundaries . The document does not list any approach procedures for NZSP but it does list them for McMurdo Station and they are presumably similar , 2.7.2.1 . IFR . McMurdo ATC retains responsibility for all IFR aircraft . Aircraft will be USAP Inter-agency Air Operations Manual , 1 August 2012 40 instructed to contact Tower prior to entering Class E airspace . Mac 2.7.2.2 . VFR . Aircraft are normally instructed to contact tower no closer than 10 miles from the airport for landing instructions . 2.7.2.3 . Aircraft operating in Class D airspace will be in radio contact with the tower and should remain at 1,000 feet AGL or higher ( 500 feet for helicopters ) until commencing final descent . They even have reg 's for uncontrolled fields 2.8.1 . For operations at uncontrolled McMurdo area airfields , fixed/rotary wing aircraft pilots will follow uncontrolled field procedures . 2.8.1.1 . Flight plans will be filed with Mac Center and advisory service provided . 2.8.1.2 . Fifteen ( 15 ) minutes prior to departure from an uncontrolled airfield , the pilot will notify Mac Center/Tower of planned activity via landline or radio . 2.8.1.3 . Mac Center/Tower will notify Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting ( ARFF ) ( who notifies the USAP Airfield Manager ) on FM Channel 2 of intended uncontrolled airfield operations . 2.8.1.4 . Pilots will announce their intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency ( CTAF ) VHF 129.7 MHz . Interestingly it looks like McMurdo is the primary landing strip however based on the letter of 1.2.1 the South Pole Station ( which Im pretty sure is NZSP ) only accepts ski equipped aircraft so you would at least need skis . 1.2.1 . Primary airfields for the USAP are located in the McMurdo Station area and at the South Pole Station ( ski-equipped aircraft only ) . The primary heliport is located at McMurdo Station . Additional ice runways , skiways , and helicopter landing sites are established throughout the continent supporting the USAP science activities as planned by the NSF Prime Contractor 's Fixed / Rotary Wing Coordinators . According to the doc a lot of the info is published in the <URL> which looks like you may need to set up <URL> to download or " contact [ your ] affiliate National Antarctic Program " . All this in mind , I have not yet found any documentation or out right publications that seem to forbid flying there as long as procedures are followed . With that in mind you clearly need to file some flight plans and related info , I would think you would need a good reason to be going there to get approval . The reality is there may be more info on this buried in the <URL> but in practice I dont know how that sort of stuff gets enforced .
Both ! Some airlines operate simulator facilities . For example , United has a training <URL> with a number of simulators . In turn , they <URL> to others who will pay to use the facilities ( <URL> ) . They can also provide trainers , cabin crew training , ground school training , and other such services . Many airlines have similar programs . They 've even <URL> to customers willing to bid frequent flyer miles for the privilege . When an airline does n't own and operate the necessary equipment itself ( even an airline that runs its own simulators may not have a suitable quantity for every aircraft in its fleet ) , it can contract for such services from someone else . That someone else might be another airline , a company that provides simulators ( <URL> ) and may offer other training services like instructors , or a provider affiliated with the manufacturer ( <URL> ) .
Perhaps an aeronautic version of one of the Voith maritime systems ? This one appears to be electrically powered . <URL> ( watch the " installation " video ) . Also , this video explains the concept a bit ( for maritime applications ) I suppose if you could arrange a lightweight frictionless magnetic ring bearing ( possibly integrating electric drive ) , and/or peripheral drive linking system , it might be worth it if you needed to have two or three smaller fans beside each other , driven by a single core , rather than a singe large fan , in order to reduce fan/nacelle height . ( imagine a B52 nacelle with one side shortened to just a fan cowling ) I doubt that this would reduce overall drag , though , but I am intrigued by the concept of the greatest chord of the blades travelling the fastest .
In training , flight attendants are given lots of emergency training , but always with the caveat that they are under no obligation to put themselves in danger . Emergency procedures should proceed up until the time a flight attendant feels they are in danger , then they are to evacuate the airplane themselves as quickly as possible . There was a long standing joke among flight attendants when I was working , which was the most important emergency instruction you can give : Follow me ! Funny , but not really . It keeps things in perspective . Not commonly known is that any emergency responder today operates under the same conditions . You are not being paid to put yourself in danger beyond what your training will accommodate .

Why does each part of span not produce equivalent downwash ?
Why should non-elliptical wings not produce constant downwash over span ? They do at one angle of attack , given a proper twist distribution so that the circulation distribution over span is elliptical . However , once the angle of attack is different from that of the elliptical distribution , the change in local circulation varies in proportion to local chord . If the chord distribution is not elliptical , the new circulation distribution due to that angle of attack change is also not elliptical , and so is the change in local downwash angle . Sometimes it is desirable to not produce an elliptical circulation distribution rsp . have an elliptical planform . If the objective is to minimise drag , it helps to reduce weight and pure lift/drag optimization is too narrow . What should count is the best ratio of lift minus wing weight relative to drag . R. T. Jones wrote a <URL> back in 1950 in which he looked at this problem analytically . Wing weight goes up when much lift is created near the tips , because this lift will cause a disproportional root bending moment , and the wing spar , which has to carry this bending moment , is a significant part of the wing structure . Therefore , reducing lift at the tips and adding more lift at the root will create a lighter wing for a modest drag increase , resulting in an overall optimum with an almost triangular lift distribution . When compared to an elliptical wing planform , the total wing span of such an optimized wing is bigger for the same overall drag , but this wing will weigh less . Another example is wing stall . An elliptical wing without washout will have a constant lift coefficient over span , and Reynolds number effects ensure that the wing will stall at the tips first . An unsymmetrical stall will result in an accelerated roll departure : The stalled side of the wing loses lift , drops and sees an increase in angle of attack which worsens the stall condition . This effect gives an elliptical wing poor handling characteristics and is the reason why many GA aircraft have rectangular or trapezoidal planforms of little taper .
There is no restriction on the number , type of aircraft , or pilots for a " Full 135 Operator . " There are 4 levels of 135 operators : Single-Pilot Operator Single Pilot-in-Command Basic 135 Operator Full 135 Operator * Source : <URL>
If you are emitting RF , you can be seen . There are two ways to emit RF : 1 . Transmit ( or leak ) a RF signal , and 2 . Reflect a RF signal . A jamming device emits ( usually ) high amounts of RF , with the general idea that the receiver of someone 's radar unit will be desensed or otherwise overwhelmed by the signal . Like putting a multicolored sun into a small dark room . So with multiple receivers ( as in multi-static radar ) a jamming aircraft can normally be rather precisely located ( assuming omnidirectional uniformity of the jamming signal ) . When noise jamming , your aircraft may not broadcast on , near or on harmonics of a given frequency within a temporal frame of when you are emitting on that frequency , so your receiver has the opportunity to detect returns . More importantly , your noise emitter may drop power and your radar receiver may have cans ( well , cavities ) tuned to protect the sensitivity of your radar receiver when expecting a return signal . There are many books on radar technology , but I believe EW102 covers radar , deceptions , noise jammers and other techniques in a manner that most mildly technical people can read and understand . There are other books , but I use that series in an Electronic Warfare course I teach , and they are reasonably current . The open literature is rich with advances in jamming and other stealth methodologies that have advanced tremendously in the last 50 years .
All multi-engine airplanes , whether jet or prop driven have separate throttle controls for each engine . There are good reasons for this : If there is a problem with one engine you can separately control it for troubleshooting purposes If one engine is n't developing the right amount of power you can independently increase the other engine ( s ) to compensate If you have a control failure of some kind you can use differential thrust to steer the airplane , this has been done more than once , the example that comes immediately to mind is <URL>
No matter which kind of engine , you need some way to supply the engine with energy and you need some way to store that energy until you need it in flight . Short of going nuclear ( and there are some nontrivial engineering problems involved in designing a halfway safe nuclear reactor that you can put on a plane and keep it lightweight enough that flying it is n't pointless ) , chemical fuels for burning have the best available ratios of weight to energy stored . This is particularly important for aviation because more weight means more induced drag which means more thrust needed . Joule for joule , the efficiency of fuel-burning engines is not great , but the superior energy density of hydrocarbon fuel more than makes up for that and allows them to supply more useful thrust per kilogram of energy storage lifted than either batteries ( low losses , but very heavy ) or fuel cells ( medium losses , but require small-molecule fuel such as hydrogen or methane that still have markedly worse energy densities than kerosene ) . Since you speak about " exhaust gases " in the question , note that current aircraft derive at most a small fraction of their thrust from ejecting exhaust gases . Propeller planes do n't generally make use of the exhaust at all , and " jet " engines are practically always high-bypass turbofan engines where most of the energy from the combustion goes to drive the fan that blows intake air backwards without burning anything in it .
Yes , your last sentence gets it about right . Just one detail : Air does not move " forward " to flow out again once it has entered the intake - which air goes where is all settled ahead of the intake . Never forget , though , that this effect is small and spillage leaves a net drag component . When compared to a sharp-lipped intake as used on supersonic planes , subsonic intakes are more forgiving for a mismatch between capture area ( area of the stream tube which goes into the engine ) and the actual intake lip area . Below I tried to fake the flow around an intake lip using Inkscape and added blue and red shading to indicate pressure . The core flow gets compressed ahead of the intake ( blue shade , diverging streamlines ) while the outer flow is pushed to the outside of the intake lip by the increasing pressure and now has to follow the contour of the intake . Like with <URL> , the air is accelerated ( converging flow lines ) and a suction peak forms on the intake lip ( red shading ) . This suction peak sits on the forward-facing part of the intake lip and provides some suction . The sharp intake lip of a surpersonic intake would produce separated flow under the same conditions with a considerable increase in drag . <URL>

Short answer : Turbofans need supersonic speed at the fan blade tips to create their high thrust . Turbofans can tolerate supersonic speeds because the intake creates constant flow conditions irrespective of flight speed . Efficiency for propellers and fan blades is highest at subsonic flow conditions . Propellers can turn at supersonic speeds , but since flow conditions are less controlled , the penalty for doing so is much higher than the penalty for a fan . Explanation It is a bad thing to have supersonic fan blade tips , just like supersonic propeller tips are best avoided . But in turbofans it is a price worth paying , because the faster tip velocity means higher dynamic pressure , and the pressure difference between both sides of the fan blade grows with the square of their velocity . This makes the high thrust levels of modern turbofans possible . <URL> Propeller efficiency over speed ( picture <URL> ) . The plot for fan blades would look not much different . The very thin , uncambered airfoil of a supersonic propeller and the added wave drag lower the maximum efficiency , but hold efficiency up into supersonic air speeds . Note that the propeller on the <URL> did move at supersonic speed . There is nothing inherent in propellers which prevents their tips from moving faster than the speed of sound . On the other hand , the big diameter of a prop requires proportionally more torque to keep the prop rotating against the drag from the supersonic tips . Thus , a fan engine requires less torque per blade to reach supersonic tip speeds on the fan blades . Also , the <URL> to make the noise from supersonic tips manageable . The XF-84H 's noise made people literally sick . But there is more to it : @FreeMan encouraged me with his comment to dive a little deeper . A supersonic propeller will work well when the direction of flow at every station along the propeller blade is about equal to the local airfoil chord . Since the blade is uncambered , this means that the change in local flow direction at the leading edge can be minimized to the amount which is required to create the desired thrust . But to be able to fulfill this condition you need to match your propeller speed to the flight speed and twist distribution . Also , the angle of attack must be compensated for by sviveling this propeller axis into the direction of flight . It will have no <URL> , but can run at only one speed for a given flight speed . Contrast this with a turbofan : The intake makes sure that the flow speed and direction at the face of the fan is the same no matter what the flight speed is . This is done by the pressure field in and around the intake which <URL> in from the sides at low speed . In the fan you can indeed match the local angle of incidence to the airspeed so the fan will work well over its design range . Generally , a fully subsonic fan would be more efficient . But then the diameter would need to be as large as that of big turboprop engines , and the shroud would become impossibly heavy and produce too much drag . The high dynamic pressure on the fan blades is needed to produce the thrust with the relatively small diameter of a turbofan .
Normally , baggage <URL> than self-loading cargo , so your scenario is highly unlikely . In the event of a passenger missing and his/her baggage already on board , all bags need to be unloaded until the orphaned bag is found . When ULDs are used , those must be unloaded first and are then unpacked , mostly on the apron next to the aircraft . Waiting for the missing passenger is an open-ended game . At some point , you must decide on a course of action with a fixed exit so you can move on . Normally , every airline is required to unload an orphaned bag . I am sure <URL> about this than others .
The 10 hours of rest need to be uninterrupted , planned , and not spent on call . Essentially , the pilots need to have 10 hours in which they are not obligated to do any work for the company at all . Note that it does not mean " 10 hours of sleep " , and it is up to the pilot what they do with their time off . ( They can even technically fly for another 135 operator during that time , but they run the risk of being " careless and reckless " if they are n't well rested . ) NATA has <URL> that 's pretty interesting and relatively recent ( 2011 ) . Their paraphrase of the FAA 's varying interpretations is this : the FAA has said that for a " rest period " to be legal it must be : 1 ) continuous , 2 ) determined prospectively ( i.e. known in advance ) and 3 ) free from all restraint from the certificate holder , including freedom from work or freedom from the present responsibility for work should the occasion arise . Being on call is specifically mentioned as not rest . This is an interpretation that is repeated throughout a lot of articles and forum discussions . It 's also often pointed out that many ( most ? ) 135 carriers blatantly ignore these rules , as most charter operations require pilots to be on call . For example You arrive at 19:00 , and are done with paperwork / postflight / etc by 19:30 and leave the airport . The moment that you leave the airport is the beginning of your rest period ; it will need to last 10 uninterrupted hours , which means until at least 0530 the next morning ( 1930 to 0530 ) to mean anything . If you get a call from dispatch at 21:00 telling you about a flight that might take place in the morning and that you must be available for a call at 05:00 just in case - your rest ends at 05:00 . Because your rest period ended 30 minutes early ( when you were required to be available ) , you did not get the 10 hours of rest and ca n't take a flight without violating 135.267 ( d ) . Another caveat : There are no explicit limits on duty time ( the exception being 135.267 ( c ) involving a " regularly assigned duty period of no more than 14 hours " which does n't apply to most 135 operators ) . The limit is on planned flying conducted under 135 . As long as you plan on parking the airplane when you can show 10 hours of rest in the previous 24 hours ( which is why some people incorrectly assume that you are limited to 14 hours of duty : 24 - 10 = 14 ! ) , you can be kept on duty afterwards . You can even fly under Part 91 for the company . You can clean the airplane , or do office work . While none of that is rest and it is still duty , it is legal unless you get in the airplane to fly under Part 135 without getting the required rest .
The AvHerald comment is correct , you generally do not want to turn towards the dead engine . The aircraft will tend to turn ( both yaw and bank ) towards the dead engine due to asymmetric thrust , allowing it to do so at low speed will make it difficult to end the turn , possibly to the point where you lose control . If you turn away from the dead engine , you 'll have a tougher time getting into the turn , but the live engine will help you get out of it . That said , attempting low altitude turns with an engine out seems like a bad idea , you should concentrate on going straight and maintaining optimum airspeed to make sure you get some altitude There are a couple of mnemonics when dealing with engine failures , like " dead foot , dead engine " ( determining which engine failed ) and " raise the dead " ( keep bank towards the live engine ) I can only speculate as to why they chose to go right , either they wanted to avoid the populated area , or they were already unable to control the turn . The high density altitude would certainly affect the OEI performance as well , perhaps luring them into losing airspeed below Vmc . Disclaimer : I 'm not multi engine rated , and have no first hand experience . This is just what I 've read .
Winglets on wings help because they increase the volume of air on which the wing can act . <URL> , but when span is restricted or the maximum wing bending moment is limited , winglets bring a small improvement in efficiency at high lift coefficients . <URL> , however , the winglets would run through air which is already affected by the tips of the propeller . No additional air will be involved , so no efficiency increase will be possible . Please note that propulsive efficiency is increased by accelerating more air by a smaller amount . The formula for the propulsive efficiency $ \ eta_p $ of an air breathing engine is $ $ \ eta_p = \ frac { v _ { \ infty } } { v _ { \ infty } + \ frac { \ Delta v } { 2 } } $ $ where $ v _ { \ infty } $ is the speed of the inflowing air and $ \ Delta v $ the speed increase of the air affected by the propeller disc . A smaller $ \ Delta v $ acting on a higher mass flow makes the engine more efficient . This effect is most pronounced when $ v _ { \ infty } $ is low . The prop tip winglets would operate in a region of high dynamic pressure and generate more friction drag without contributing to the prop 's efficiency . By the way : Whoever tells you that winglets reduce induced drag quite a bit has something to sell to you , but I digress .
There is plenty of information on the Internet on how <URL> , however the codes are sometimes not directly assigned by ICAO , <URL> . ICAO Document 7910 - Location Identifiers contains codes allocated by national governments , on behalf of ICAO , to airports , airfields and other facilities such as ATC and weather stations . Ultimately , it is the national CAA 's or other authorities ' decision whether to assign a code and get it validated through ICAO . The decision may be based on political , historical or other reasons , there is no minimum requirements for airports to receive an ICAO code . Am I correct in assuming that airports without ICAO codes do n't have codes because of the lack of a control tower ? Or is there other reasons for this ? The availability of a control tower is not a requirement for ICAO codes , even small uncontrolled fields with grass strips can have an ICAO code , example : <URL> <URL>
how does it not immediately start spinning ? Physics , and engineering . But I guess that you would like a bit more detail , so let 's try dive in . wheel brakes They tend to have a stabilizing effect by shifting some of the weight on the front wheel and allowing the pilots to control the aircraft with more effectiveness . spoilers These are automatically controlled by the Fly-by-Wire system , so if required they would be retracted . thrust reversers If they are functioning properly , the resulting force will go through the vertical plane containing the C.o.G. ( but a bit below it ) , so they do not pose much of a problem . Another thing you have not mentioned , but I am going to add , is crabbed landings ( such as <URL> ) , since in these situations the aircraft DO tend to spin a little . In these cases , in the timeframe between touchdown and braking , 2 things help the aircraft remain on the runway : the vertical tail ( with the rudder ) , and the position of the main landing gear w.r.t. the center of gravity of the aircraft . As it can be seen in <URL> taken from the lecture notes of the course I followed ( the title translates to " Braking run in crabbed landing " ) , normal tricycle gear aircraft tend to be stabilized by their own landing gear in this situation , while the same can not be said for old school taildraggers . So , what really could cause a problem ? The answer is wind gusts ( especially if the wind is perpendicular to the runway ) , uneven conditions of the runway ( say , a puddle or a thin layer of ice on one side of the runway will cause one set of main gear to have less grip than its counterpart on the other side , causing a yawing towards the side with more grip ) , asymmetrical failures in the thrust reversers , excessive braking while also turning the aircraft to realign to the centerline ( particularly a problem if the distance between the two main gears is not sufficient ) . How does the aircraft remain on the runway despite these possible problems ? At high speeds , thanks to the vertical tail ; and at low speeds thanks to the front nose gear . At in-between speeds , the situation is slightly more complicated : the tail is not much useful anymore , while the front gear would risk breaking if used to correct too much . So , for example , a FbW system can help through the asymmetrical use of spoilers . An example of what could happen , but seen during a take-off , is illustrated <URL> ( video kindly provided by MichaelK in chat ) .

The vortex generators are used in commercial aircraft ( Boeing especially ) , for a number of reasons , which are usually not applicable to GA aircraft . For example , vortex generators are used for anything from stall alleviation to <URL> to noise reduction , some of which are not applicable for GA aircraft . Also , they are <URL> , which is much more expansive compared to the GA aircraft . That said , vortex generators are found in some aircraft , like the Piper Malibu Meridian , as shown below , <URL> . <URL> Image from www.nasa.gov Another point is the a <URL> for GA aircraft . A number of GA aircraft have been retrofitted with them . <URL> By Ahunt at English Wikipedia - I took this photo and release it to the public domain , Public Domain However , they are quite costly and require extensive tests for certification , with the result that they are not used much compared to commercial aircraft .
If your thrust reversers are operational and debris is not a concern , you 're right for an in-service rejected takeoff ( RTO ) : There 's nothing that prevents the use of reverse thrust on a dry runway for an aborted takeoff . Most in-service RTOs utilize reverse thrust if available ( see <URL> for a dry-runway example ) . However , in order to certify a transport-category airplane , one must show compliance with <URL> , which precludes the use of thrust reversers on dry runways in calculating the accelerate-stop distance . The demonstration required by paragraph ( i ) , therefore , can not be conducted with reverse thrust on a dry runway . From a certification standpoint , the accelerate-stop calculation is made the way it is because that 's what the regulations say . But why is the law written this way ? See <URL> at about 1:12 : The whole intent is to demonstrate [ that ] under [ the ] worst conditions you can safely stop the aircraft . " Worst conditions " encompasses at least inoperative thrust reversers and worn brakes .
Only if you fall under the Fractional rules ( Subpart K ) . Otherwise SIC currency requirements for turbojet airplanes are specified in 14 CFR 91.531 , which requires you to be current via 14 CFR 61.55 and has no instrument currency requirement ( although you do need your instrument rating to fly under IFR ) .
As you have intimated in the question , how hard you hit the ground is very dependent on a number of factors . When I did my training to jump using a classical tethered round chute we practiced landing from a platform of about 5 feet , so six is perhaps a hard landing . That 's , roughly , hitting the ground at 12mph . Folks like the Red Devils typically use an parafoil chute . Basically a self inflating wing . These can be steered and pitched upward to bring the trooper to a stall or even go up if they have enough forward velocity . So yes , you will often see them stop in mid-air and step down . This means this type of parachute has NO equivalent jump height . In fact if flown incorrectly you can crash into the ground at serious speeds . <URL> Regular " military style " parachutes provide no control over lift and only minor control over direction . With these your descent rate is totally dependent on size , weight and air quality . <URL> Interestingly , with a regular chute , what makes landings " harder " is not so much the effective height but the amount of horizontal velocity . You are trained to drop and roll when you hit the ground to absorb the impact . <URL> This works great if you have any horizontal velocity to help you initiate the roll . If however you are coming straight down it 's not so easy . . and your knees end up in your chest ... as I found out the one and only time I jumped out of an aging Cessna . Too much horizontal velocity and that roll gets rather violent .
It 's essentially a manual check for many airlines , performed as part of the pre-flight checks . However , the airline I have worked for recently upgraded from manual checks to RFID tags on each lifejacket ( a sticky tag kind of <URL> ) . The RFID tags can be read from the aisle by a handheld reader . So the person who does the checks simply walks down the aisle with the reader and is able to tell if a seat is missing a jacket and also if the jacket needs to be replaced due to the expiry date fast approaching . In addition to a tag on the actual life jacket there are also security RFID tags across the life jacket holster under the seat . So the scanner is able to tell if the life jacket has been tampered with as the security tag would have been broken . As for the frequency of checks , different regions have different requirements . Usually life jackets are only needed at all if flying over a large body of water . I believe the USA requires a check before any flight which passes over the USA ( as well as water ) . Europe requires less frequent checks .

How to determine the aircraft tail number on a particular flight ?
The step-to-step guide : 1 . Search for Flight Number : Get hold of the flight number , such as LH123 or AA789 for instance . This is usually found on your ticket , baggage tag or some email . Enter it on a site such as <URL> or <URL> . Note down the registration ( such as N1234A or D-ABYT ) for the flight on the day your are interested in . 2 . Search for this Registration : Try entering it on for instance <URL> which is often considered a reliable source for aircraft data . You should be able to get the aircraft history : First flight and delivery dates ( and hence aircraft age ) Previous operators and registrations . MSN ( manufacturer serial number )
Jeff , I really appreciate that you ask for safety before asking for the price . Unfortunately it takes some experience and time at a school to say if the equipment and teaching methods are safe or not , but I 'll try my best to provide you with some of my insights into flight training . I personally tend to the bigger flight schools . Having a strict training concept and standardized methods is a huge benefit in safety . If the same teachers also do more advanced training like IR or MEP your PPL training will most probably also be more intense . Your training should concentrate on learning to fly not flying the nicest routes but of course you should also enjoy your time . That 's why you should of course also have a look at the people who are there . They should not only be friendly , but also be professional and well organised . The most annoying thing during flight training is bad organization and the changing of schedules due to absolutely avoidable reasons . Good maintenance is key for safety . Here again , a big flight school that can do it 's own maintenance has a lot of advantages . Often it happens that there are minor problems which should be fixed before the next flight without being a big safety hazard . It 's better to squawk this and wait ten minutes until maintenance has fixed it , rather then flying without having it fixed , or cancelling the lesson . If the flight school has its own maintenance and they are happy with their work they will tell you and also show you around . Honestly the only thing you can do is to look if the hangar looks clean and tidy . If you decide for a smaller school without its own maintenance , it should at least be done at the same airport . Otherwise this could cause regular delays in your training . Also think of yourself . During your solos and later when having your license you are allowed to and you will fly alone without an instructor . Be motivated to learn more than you have to . Know your aircraft and ask your questions . RTFM should not be the general answer of your flight school but you should spend some time doing it . I made a list with all my questions before visiting different flight school so I do n't forget to ask them . I would sugest you to do the same before getting there . If you for example ask for some more detailed information how many flight time you have to do with an instructor before flying solo and what exercises and maybe progress checks you 'll have to do prior to it , you 'll get a good insight how structured the flight training is . Also do n't forget to ask about the theoretical part . That 's really dependent on your self if you prefer to learn with books or with a teacher in front of you .
This depends on what exactly you want the aircraft to do : Immediately depart the hold and fly directly to another fix : N1234 cleared to ' clearance limit ' via direct ' fix ' and then as previously filed . Immediately depart the hold and fly an assigned heading : N1234 Cleared to ' clearance limit ' via radar vectors . Fly heading ' heading ' . Proceed to another fix after passing the holding point inbound : N1234 After ' holding fix ' , cleared to ' clearance limit ' via direct ' fix ' and then as previously filed . Fly the published approach after passing the holding point inbound : N1234 Maintain ' altitude ' until ' holding fix ' , cleared ' approach name ' . Altitude Lastly , add the altitude to any of the above clearances if it is different than the current altitude by adding a climb/descend and maintain ' altitude ' clearance .
You do not calculate indicated airspeed : It is an indicated value , you read it from the airspeed indicator . ( I suppose you can calculate it if you really want to , but I 've got no idea why you would want to do so in the context of flight planning . ) You determine what airspeed to use for flight planning purposes using your aircraft 's performance data ( from the POH or other manufacturer documents ) : There will usually be either a chart or a table giving true airspeed as a function of power setting and density altitude . ( True Airspeed is a more useful number for planning purposes as it saves you a calculation . ) <URL> <URL> When in flight you can calculate your true airspeed based on the indicated airspeed and density altitude . You can then compare this to your planned figures from the performance charts to determine if adjustments are necessary to your flight plan ( ETA , Fuel use , etc. )
consider if you Google a flight number you can see the flight status , imagine if the number was from a past crash , you might for a moment think the one you 're looking up had crashed <URL>
The simplest thing is to ask someone local where runups are usually done : the FBO , Ground Control or another pilot . If you ca n't find out then you can do them anywhere you like as long as it 's safe . Some airports have specific runup areas but they are n't always obvious . For example , KPDK has runup areas at both ends of taxiway A , they 're shown on the <URL> as ' bulges ' in the taxiway but they are n't labelled . You might notice them when you land and taxi but you might not . I 've circled one of the runup areas in red here : <URL> If there are no runup areas , the ' default ' location is the one you remember from training : on the taxiway just before reaching the runway , angled into the wind . If the taxiway is wide enough , you can move to the edge so that other aircraft can pass you if they 're ready before you . That 's very common and it 's what many pilots will expect you to do , even if you have to block the taxiway for a couple of minutes . This is where you have to use some judgement : if you know that you need to take your time on runups - perhaps it 's an unfamiliar aircraft , or you 've just had maintenance done and you 're double-checking everything - then you might look for another spot where you wo n't be in the way . Blocking other aircraft from reaching the runway is always a possibility , but at airports with a lot of GA traffic - and especially a lot of flight training - it 's common and just something to be expected . That does n't mean you should take forever doing your checks and of course some other pilots will always get annoyed at even minor delays , but if the only safe place to do runups is the taxiway then just do them there and the others will wait . Another option is to do runups on the ramp or before entering the <URL> so that you do n't block other aircraft anywhere . That 's especially important at airports with scheduled commercial flights because they usually have very precise departure times and getting stuck behind another aircraft for even a few minutes could be an issue . If you 're in that environment , then you should definitely check with Ground Control what they want you to do . But be careful about doing runups on the ramp because of people and vehicles moving around . Also be wary about doing runups a long way from the runway : during a long taxi you might change something ( e.g. the mixture or fuel controls ) and then forget to reset it for takeoff . The one place you should never do runups is on the runway itself . Sitting there for several minutes blocking the runway for landing traffic and unable to see final approach behind you is n't a good position to put yourself in . Finally , avoiding blowing debris into other aircraft should be simple : just look around you , and do n't position the aircraft so that your prop blast is going somewhere it should n't .
Most modern jets use an Air Data Computer ( ADC ) to calculate ( among other things ) Mach Number . <URL> Air Data Computer An ADC is simply a computer which accepts measurements of atmospheric data to calculate various flight related data . A typical ADC may be connected to $ ^ 1 $ : Inputs Static System Pressure Pitot Pressure Total Air Temperature ( TAT ) Outputs ( Calculated ) Pressure Altitude Baro-Corrected Altitude Vertical Speed Mach Number Total Air Temperature Calibrated Airspeed True Airspeed Digitized Pressure Altitude ( Gillham ) Altitude Hold Airspeed Hold Mach Hold Flight Control Gain Scheduling . Each of the inputs and outputs may be analog or digital depending on the design of the system , and are used for many purposes throughout the airplane . Each output is a purely calculated value based on the various input measurements and data stored within the unit . To answer your question about the pitot source for the Mach Meter : Yes , they use the same pitot and static sources as the airspeed indicator . In the case of mechanical instruments , they are both connected directly to the pitot static system . In the case of an ADC , the pitot static system is connected directly to the ADC and then electrical signals communicate the airspeed and mach number to the electric airspeed indicator and mach meter ( or EFIS ) , which no longer require actual pitot static connections . The Math A simplified example for the Mach Number calculation $ ^ 2 $ would be based on the pressure inputs : $ $ Mach ~ number = 5 ( ( PT/PS +1 ) ^ { 0.2857 } -- 1 ) ^ \ frac12 $ $ Where : $ PT$ = Total Pressure $ PS$ = Static Pressure The actual calculation makes corrections to the pressure data to compensate for installation errors and nonlinear sensor readings . Note that it does n't actually calculate the ( local ) speed of sound ( LSS ) in order to determine the current mach number , but with the TAT input and the calculated mach number , it could calculate it by calculating the outside air temperature ( OAT/SAT ) first : $ $ SAT = \ frac { TAT } { 1 +0.2 \ times { Mach } ^ 2 } $ $ $ $ LSS = 38.945 \ sqrt { SAT } $ $ For example , let 's say that the TAT is -36 C ( 237.16 K ) and we are flying Mach 0.80 : $ $ SAT = \ frac { 237.16 } { 1 +0.2 \ times0 .8 ^ 2 } = \ frac { 237.16 } { 1.128 } = 210.25 ° K = -63 ° C$ $ $ $ LSS = 38.945 \ sqrt { 210.25 } = 38.945 \ times14 .5 = 564.70 knots $ $ Again , these are simplified formulas because the actual ones would consider sensor error , etc. . $ ^ 1 $ List of inputs and outputs obtained from <URL> . $ ^ 2 $ Formula from <URL> .
All of these methods are used . Nosewheel steering is common on most commercial aircraft using a tiller . Rudder , differential braking , differential thrust and even motors in the wheels ( experimental only as far as I know ) are also used , <URL> . Engine thrust is used to move forward but differential thrust might also be used when negotiating tight turns . <URL>
Do n't use the autopilot , use the trim , and look outside ! Fixating on the instruments will not make you better . Know the sight picture out the windshield and what wing looks like in relation to the horizon . Set 25 ' altitude brackets and 2 ° heading brackets and hold yourself to them . It 'll seem impossible but you 'll get better . Set those brackets with the intent to hold them by looking outside , not chasing needles in the cockpit . Fly using the actual horizon as your reference , which is safer anyway , and make minor adjustments based on a periodic instrument scan that should become less and less frequent as you get better ( think 10-15sec between scans to start ) . Hold heading based on distant objects , not the compass or DG . Finally , use the trim . If it takes more than two fingers to adjust pitch , you are not trimmed . If you fly a plane with a trim wheel between the seats get used to resting your hand on it . Every time you change the power setting , retrim . In an updraft ? Retrim . Down draft ? Retrim . It 'll become second nature in no time .
FAA <URL> talks a little about this ( you want Appendix 2 , " Wind Analysis " ) . Basically you start by figuring out what kind of aircraft you want to operate at the airport , and establishing some basic wind limits ( specifically , the maximum crosswind and tailwind components you want to deal with ) . Then you call up NOAA 's " National Climate Data Center " , tell them where you 're looking to build your airport , and see if they can have wind data for the location you 're looking to build on . If NOAA does n't have data you have a couple of other options -- another nearby airport 's wind analysis can be used ( if the topography does n't vary that much and the wind analysis is " recent " ) , or you may have to perform a wind survey which basically means placing a <URL> on the site to record the wind speed and direction for a year . Armed with collected wind data you tally up the number of observations in given wind speed ranges and mark them down on a " wind rose " . You then place your runway ( s ) on the wind rose so that they 're aligned with the prevailing winds and determine your " wind coverage " - the amount of time the winds at your site are within your crosswind and tailwind limits . The advisory circular I linked to shows you how to do this by hand , but there 's also software to do this which is how most folks do it . <URL> which will generate the wind rose and runway/crosswind limit bars for you . Note that this is just the wind part . As you 've alluded to there are a number of other considerations , like terrain : If the prevailing winds favor runway 36 , but runway 36 points right at a mountain a mile from the field you might have to align the runway 33 or 03 and sacrifice a perfect headwind for not having pilots fly into the mountain . Also as ratchet mentioned the airspace around your proposed site may influence your runway layout and types of operations . <URL> and a process to go through to ensure that your airport is not deemed <URL> . Also as you alluded to in your question there are other considerations like density altitude ( local temperature and humidity trends ) which will influence design factors like runway length - there 's another advisory circular ( <URL> ) that talks about runway design criteria , including length considerations . For even more than you ever wanted to know about airport design you can check out <URL> , which all deal with airports in some way ( there are ACs on design , construction , markings , lighting , ARFF , and even how to qualify for and obtain federal aid ) .
$ V _ { ne } $ is typically set to about 90 % of $ V_D $ , the maximum design dive speed . This difference provides a safety margin . Above $ V_D $ , damage may occur due to flutter or structural failure , or controllability considerations may make the aircraft unflyable . The aircraft is not guaranteed to fall apart at $ V_D $ due to additional structural and manufacturing margins . During flight test , the aircraft is flown above $ V _ { ne } $ , up to , or close to , $ V_D $ . Appropriate safety precautions are taken , e.g. parachute . Any failure below $ V_D $ indicates a design or manufacturing issue that must be resolved prior to certification . The limitation to flight below $ V _ { ne } $ ( as opposed to $ V_D $ ) during regular operations provides protection against airspeed measurement errors , pilot errors and some margin against structural degradation over the lifetime of the aircraft .
The two aircraft in question were actually only one . Apparently it was a glitch in the FR24 system . It was an Embraer ERJ-190AR , registration number N949UW on flight AA1678 from ATL to LGA . <URL> <URL> <URL> This also pretty much validates sweber 's assertion that the numbers are internal FR24 codes , because the mode-S ID is AD306E .
<URL> contains recommended crew member procedures and training for combating in-flight fires . It has information about causes , indications and procedures of in-flight fire fighting . According to the AC , Upon discovering a fire , the initial focus should be on aggressively extinguishing the fire with a readily available extinguisher ( which will likely be halon ) , but do not use water if it is believed the fire is of aircraft electrical system origin . Generally , you should consider using the first available extinguisher rather than delaying your firefighting efforts while you locate a particular extinguishing agent for a class A , B , or C fire . Airbus <URL> also says pretty much the same thing : Any fire , no matter how small , may rapidly become out of control , if not dealt with quickly.The first priority will always be to put it out . Coming to the Galaxy Note 7 issue , the AC says , h . What are the Recommended Procedures for Fighting a Lithium Battery Fire ? The following procedures are recommended for fighting a fire in a lithium-type-battery-powered PED . The procedures consist of two phases : extinguishing the fire , and cooling the remaining cells to stop thermal runaway . ( 1 ) Utilize a halon , halon replacement , or water extinguisher to extinguish the fire and prevent its spread to additional flammable materials . ( 2 ) After extinguishing the fire , douse the device with water , an aqueous-based extinguishing agent , or other nonalcoholic liquids to cool the device and prevent additional battery cells from reaching thermal runaway . Though the standard procedures in case of a fire has to be decided by the company , the FAA recommends some procedures to be followed , like : • Be aggressive ; if flames are visible , fight the fire immediately . • Someone must immediately notify the flight crew to describe the fire , smoke , smells , action being taken , etc. . • If flames are not visible , find the base or source of the smoke . • Pull circuit breakers , in applicable area . • Do not reset circuit breakers , unless instructed by flight crew . • Relocate passengers as necessary . • Locate hot spots using the back of your hand . • Don PBE ( not necessarily in this order ) . The flight crew ( who are supposed to don their oxygen masks on indication of smoke/fire ) are supposed to inform the ATC and plan for an emergency landing , if necessary .
Then It used to matter , because aircraft would sometimes approach the carrier at a lower altitude than even the flight deck before pulling up briefly and practically stalling onto the deck , allowing for a lower speed landing . Similarly , the higher flight deck would give an extra couple of metres of acceleration if over-shooting the flight deck and having to go around . As such a high-decked carrier gave a little more margin for error . Now It makes virtually no difference - modern aircraft approach at the same angle and airspeed regardless of the height of the deck ( within reason ) . They also perform approaches significantly more accurately . If anything , the higher deck could be considered a ( very ) slight disadvantage , as it may display a higher rolling moment than a low deck carrier . This is unlikely to cause any issues , however .
Flow conditions are not so different , only the reaction of the flow to an obstacle is . By <URL> , supersonic flow is handled easily , and <URL> in decelerating and compressing the flow . However , supersonic flow demands sharp intake lips which are hit by the flow at the right angle , otherwise drag rises quickly to intolerable levels . These sharp lips will cause flow separation in subsonic flow when hit by the flow at an angle , so aerodynamic tricks like <URL> need to be added to the intake to keep flow angles at the intake lips in check . Note that the intake will ensure a <URL> at the compressor face of the engine , regardless of flight speed . Therefore , the engine will not need to be optimized for supersonic flight . However , to keep its frontal area low and the <URL> , its <URL> should be low . The only troubles this causes are increased engine fuel consumption and <URL> .
The registration number painted on the aircraft is required to match the aircraft 's registration certificate ( and airworthiness certificate ) . If the numbers do n't match the aircraft 's paperwork is n't in order , and it ca n't legally be flown . <URL> which is usually used to put a " special " ( reserved ) number on an aircraft : Send the FAA a letter requesting an N number change . ( It probably helps to have a good reason - like say United Airlines buying a used jet and wanting to re-register it with a tail number from their reserved block ) . Wait for the FAA to send you paperwork authorizing the N number change . You will get 3 copies of form 8050-64 - two for the FAA , one for you . Put the new N number on the plane . Usually you 'd do this by repainting the aircraft ( or the portion of the tail where the number is ) , but you could also do vinyl stickers or something similar ) One of the copies of form 8050-64 becomes your temporary registration certificate at this time , and you must carry that along with your original registration certificate showing the old registraton number . Within 5 days of applying the new N number return one of the copies of form 8050-64 to the FAA to obtain a new registration certificate with the new N number . Within 10 days of applying the new N number return the other copy of form 8050-64 to the FAA to obtain a new airworthiness certificate with the new N number . I expected to find something stating how long you have between the time the FAA grants the request to change registration numbers and when you must apply the new one to the plane , but as far as I can tell you can take your time doing this : there does n't seem to be an expiration on the authorization to change N numbers . As long as you comply with the requirements for the registration number change the aircraft is only " grounded " for as long as it takes to apply the new registration number ( if you 're repainting this could take a while ; if you apply a large sticker with the new number on it it could be done in less than a day ) .
There is a ( relatively ) new requirement for Flight Attendants ( on aircraft with more than 20 passenger seats ) to be certified as per the FAA . This was done in the <URL> , in section 814 if you want to read it . The applicable CFR is <URL> . In summary it says : You have to have a certificate of demonstrated proficiency , this looks like a pilots license . Demonstrated compliance with the air carrier approved training program . Proficiency to read , speak , and write English Comprehend written material in English Ability to write incident reports and log entries/statements Carry out written and oral instructions Now , the actual physical requirements are up to the airline , as long as the individual can complete the training program , they are physically allowed to become a flight attendant ( physical appearance requirements aside ) . As for " legally " allowed , they need to be able to pass the same TSA background checks that pilots are subject to . So legally , almost all airlines require : U.S. Citizen or appropriate work visa Be able to enter/exit the United States without any issues ( no visa problems with other countries , although for regionals this may not apply ) Be able to pass a TSA/FBI background check No DUI or felony convictions within the past 10 years There is n't a lot more " legal " to it than that , they do n't have to demonstrate the use of safety equipment if the airline 's training program does n't require it .
At the critical mach number , some part of the aircraft ( usually the wing ) will have air flowing over it at a speed in excess of mach 1 . If the aircraft is not meant to fly at transonic or supersonic speeds , shock waves will flow over the wing . This can either cause the wing to stall , the control surfaces to become unresponsive , or the plane to go into the mach tuck , which is very dangerous . The mach tuck is a phenomenon first observed with the P-38 Lightnings and Spitfires in World War II . These planes were so clean that when dive bombing it was possible to exceed their critical mach number . When this happened the center of lift would move back on the wing . This would cause the plane to ' tuck ' ; the elevators stop functioning , and the plane 's dive becomes steeper and steeper until the aircraft is actually partially inverted . Recovery can be attempted by lowering the gear , extending the dive brakes , and lowering the flaps . In later versions of the P-38 a small ' speed bump ' flap was added for diving which caused a more even pressure distribution on the wing , and decreased the chance of entering a mach tuck .
Yes , you are correct . You need three pieces of information : airspeed true compass heading ( considering magnetic variation ) multiple absolute position fixes ( eg . from gps ) The aircraft heading has to be measured by a compass within the aircraft ( it ca n't be derived from the gps track ) , and the gps position can be used to look up the local magnetic variation . The difference between the speed/heading and the ground track ( in straight and level flight , anyway ) is attributable to winds aloft .
The fuel consumption or fuel burn rate is dependent on the aircraft type , size , engine configuration , cruise altitude , temperature , thrust setting and other factors . In general : The larger the aircraft , the less economic do short flights become due to weight/size and fuel burn on takeoff/climb . Here are some values I found for the CRJ2 , the source may not be entire citable : Approximate total burn pounds / hour Taxi : 700 ( Both engines and APU ) Takeoff : 6000-7000 ( depending on temperature , elevation , reduced/full thrust , etc ) Climb : 6000-3500 ( reducing as as altitude increases ) Cruise : 2500-3000 ( depending on altitude/weight/etc ... subtract 500 for long range , add 500 for high speed ) Holding : 1800-2400 ( depending on altitude/speed ) Normal descent : 1500 Idle descent : 600 Approach : 2000 ( fully configured ) ( Source : <URL> - Author : Flyf15 ) You can also read the following related questions to understand how altitude affects fuel efficiency : <URL> <URL>

start question
What is the typical cruising altitude for a civil airplane ?
I think there are already plenty of answers here to give you a clue : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> Normally , atitude restrictions give a top limit . A minimum altitude is hard to enforce when one engine fails - then the aircraft can only continue at a lower altitude ( typically around 15,000 ft for a two-engined jet ) or the cabin pressurization fails ( now the aircraft needs to continue below 10,000 ft ) . This is speculation , but maybe the 26,000 ft limit is caused by information that rebels in the West Sinai have gotten hold of <URL> . Those have a fairly low upper limit to their effectiveness .
An assumed temperature takeoff ( also known as " flex " on Airbus/Fokker aircraft ) is where the engine thrust is reduced to match the performance on a higher-temperature day , up to either the maximum thrust reduction allowed or the maximum assumed temperature that meets takeoff distance requirements . Unlike a derate , assumed temperature takeoffs do not reduce the minimum control speed used for calculating takeoff speeds ( $ V _ { MCG } $ for $ V_1 $ , $ V _ { MCA } $ for $ V_2 $ ) . The minimum selectable temperature is the lowest temperature beyond the flat rating temperature range ( the range of temperatures where maximum thrust is achievable , limited by an engine control unit ) , and the highest temperature is the temperature at which the maximum thrust reduction allowed will be met . Except with specific certification and approval ( such as 40 % flex on the A340 ) , such a procedure must not reduce the thrust beyond 25 % of the nominal takeoff thrust ( either full rate or a takeoff derate ) . For example , the range of assumed temperatures permitted is 30-75 ° C ( flat rated to $ ISA +15 $ , thrust at 75 ° C is 75 % of normal rating ) . The main reason for performing an assumed temperature takeoff is to conserve engine life , therefore reducing maintenance costs . According to Boeing , engine wear exponentially increases with the takeoff thrust used -- with engines costing about 10 million USD each , this has the potential to save a lot of money for airlines . If you are taking off using assumed temperature , you may ( but are not required to ) add thrust to TOGA in the case of an emergency , however if you are using a takeoff derate , you must not increase the thrust beyond the derated N1 , as this could cause a loss of control ( higher thrust = higher actual $ V _ { MCG } $ ) . Not all aircraft allow assumed temperature in conjunction with derates . For example , you can only select a derate or a flex temperature on all Airbus aircraft ( if a derate option is offered ) . NOTE : do not attempt to " copy the jet jocks " in a piston aircraft and attempt a reduced throttle takeoff : only at takeoff throttle levels is extra fuel injected for cooling and reduction beyond this point could result in CHT levels rising to unacceptable levels , increasing the risk of engine damage .
There are almost always opportunities to volunteer . However , joining CAP is a larger commitment than simply saying " I 'd like to volunteer to fly . " You will need to attend regular meetings and perform non-pilot duties such has becoming an administrative officer or participating in recruiting and fund raising activities . For some squadrons , the budgets are tight , and the ratio of pilots to flights can be high . The complaint I heard from CAP members back in Idaho was that they hardly ever got to fly . This may be less true in other areas . My suggestion to you would be to contact your local squadron . In your case , this will be a squadron within the <URL> . They have senior squadrons located in <URL> , <URL> , <URL> and elsewhere ( senior squadrons are for adults 18 + , whereas cadet squadrons are for children under 21 . There are also composite squadrons for both seniors and cadets ) . Talk to them about their mission and what the experience would be like . If you 're still interested , attend some meetings ( you 'll need to do this before they 'll let you apply anyway ) . Then , after you have a good sense of what will be expected , if you believe in their mission , and you 're willing to put in the time required , you should join . If all you 're looking for is a way to build cheap ( or free ) flight hours as a private pilot , then that is probably the wrong reason to join , and you will likely be disappointed . * Note from editor : The oddity in the ages of membership for the senior and the cadet groups should be explained . A person may join as a cadet in a squadron up to their eighteenth birthday , however , if they became a cadet before that , they may continue as such until their twenty-first birthday . Anyone joining the Civil Air Patrol after eighteen enters into the senior branch .
Yes , I have personally worked on multiple aircraft that were infested by animals . All of these aircraft were small planes , single engine Cessnas for example . A typical example would be one or two small mouse nests in the wings . I also found at least one wasp nest in an aircraft wing . The worst I ever saw was a Mooney that had extensive mouse nests throughout the airframe . That aircraft had been unairworthy for at least a year by the time I saw it . That Mooney ended up being parted out and scrapped , largely because of extensive corrosion in the wings which was either caused by , or aggravated by , the mouse nests . Urea can induce corrosion in aluminum , and finding a mouse nest or other evidence of rodent activity should prompt closer inspection . All the other instances of mouse nests that I have found in airframes were in aircraft that flew several hundred hours a year and these did not suffer any major damage . I have also heard stories from many pilots and mechanics of finding birds nests -- for example in engine intakes or the empennage -- and of rodents chewing into or through electrical wiring . There is also the classic warning to check the pitot tube in case a mud wasp has clogged the intake with a nest . I have never witnessed any of these occurrences myself . The mud dauber wasp is notorious and is suspected of being a contributing factor in at least one fatal airline accident that I am familiar with : <URL> . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA Many means of prevention are available , including typical pest prevention methods such as traps and poisons -- in my experience all reserved for use in the storage hanger . The most aviation specific forms are the various covers used to protect <URL> , <URL> , etc. . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA As far as the possibility of animals surviving , I suppose the odds are low . I have never encountered a live animal in an airplane ( pets excepted ) . For any animal stowing away on a pressurized aircraft operating at high altitude I should think the low oxygen partial pressure and temperature would both discourage survival outside the pressure vessel . Some flights , particularly international ones , apparently make a practice of spraying some form of pesticide in the cabin to kill mosquitoes and other unwanted creatures .
The size of the bomber formations ( bombers streams ) varied significantly depending on the number of bombers , the time , location and other things . The most common figure quoted figure is around 70 miles long and 5-6 miles wide ( for ~ 500-600 bombers ) . However , the formation 's footprint depended on a number of factors ranging from the navigator 's skill to the wind in that area . The figures vary wildly . For example , from the book <URL> : The stream of more than one thousand Eighth Air Force bombers , from one end to another was 360 miles long . ... on ... February 3 , 1945 , when the first flying fortresses reached Berlin , the last bomber was over the Zuiderzee in Holland . This extreme length is a consequence of the situation late in the war , where allied air armada roamed European skies without bothering much about the Luftwaffe . The time spent over the target , on the other hand was quite small - ... each Fortress crew would spend only between thirty and sixty seconds over the center of Berlin itself ... Note that there was no such thing as precision bombing in WWII ( except for some special cases ) , though the accuracy did improve over the war . Of course , some of this was due to the way the ' target ' was designated - anywhere 1000 ' of the aiming point was good enough . From <URL> : Conventionally the air forces designated as " the target area " a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack . While accuracy improved during the war , Survey studies show that , in the over-all , only about 20 % of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area . A peak accuracy of 70 % was reached for the month of February 1945 . Accuracy of RAF night bombing improved from ~ 20 % in 1942 to > 90 % in 1945 . Of course , the British target was comparatively larger - anything within a 3 miles radius of the aiming point was a ' hit ' .
It is still possible ( and in my experience not that difficult ) to get FAA tower tours ( and sometimes even TRACON or Center tours ) , though you should be reasonable in your expectations here -- You are probably NOT going to get a tour of the tower at JFK or LAX . The FAA used to actively encourage pilots with an instrument rating ( or pursuing instrument training ) to sign up for ATC facility tours under a program called <URL> -- This program is still running , though it 's been substantially scaled back ( Poke around on the FAA Safety Team 's <URL> , or sign up for notices in your area and keep a sharp eye out . <URL> ) . ( As an example of how quickly the slots fill up , when N90 ( New York TRACON ) last had a Raincheck event it was full within a few hours of being announced . No , I did n't get a slot . ) At towered GA airports - particularly ones with a lot of flight training - you can also contact the tower directly . <URL> but that 's a little out of date . You can also get the phone number from Flight Service , the local FSDO , or ask the tower/ground controller for the number if they 're not too busy . When you call the facility explain that you 're a pilot/student pilot and would like to arrange to tour the facility ( and if possible shadow a controller ) . They will usually ask for your name , address , airman certificate number , and a few other things to run a check and get approval to let you in to the facility . You will also be expected to have government issued photo ID with you when you show up . My experience arranging a tour of our local tower was extremely pleasant - they are happy to do the tours and let you shadow a controller , and I even got to pick their brains about some peculiarities in local procedures . It 's a great educational experience , and I would recommend it for any pilot/student pilot .
Actually , a commercial airliner can do almost any set of legs , assuming those are technically possible ( range/payload/laws like ETOPS ... ) But the main fact that make it possible is demand . If you run an airline , you wo n't make routes that do n't have demand to make profit . Aviation is a complex world . To make profit , you have to consider a massive load of parameters . You ca n't for example position complete set of crew in every city/airport hotel of your airline routes then decide to create fantasy flights " a la carte " . Crews ca n't fly continuously aswell , so you ca n't put crew in a 737 and make them non-stop flights around the country an entire week . One main thing you have to keep in mind : It 's not one or several persons who decide " I want to build an airline with X aircraft on Y routes " . It 's one A-B route that decide how many passengers are available on , then , an airline has the opportunity to operate that route ( and struggle to negociate all the authorizations ) Here are some hints about how airliners deals with their environment around the world : What kind of flights does the airliner , and what airframes does it have in its fleet ? An airliner can start with one single aircraft , says a DHC6 Twin Otter , and makes regular flights between two airports in the middle of the ocean . You can have 10 , 15 , maybe 20 round trip a day , some well after sunset . An airliner can have half a dozen ATR or Dash 8 , and a set of routes with the proper demand . You can have routes like hub-A-hub , hub-B-hub , when the demand is enough to make each flight profitable . Sometimes , you ca n't have enough passenger a day on each route , so the airliner makes hub-A-B-C-D-hub the day one , then hub-D-C-B-A-hub on day two , and cycle the sets ... An airliner with dozens of ( the same ) aircraft ( 737 or A32x ) can either have the same round trip hub-X-hub destinations every day , several times a day , airlines like Air France , Southwest , Lufthansa , Air China ... or the same fleet , but much more destinations operated two or three times a week : hub-A-B-hub , hub-C-D-E-hub , hub-F-G-H-nightstop-G-F-hub ... like Angola Airlines ( domestic and regional ) Long range flights ( 7 hours or more ) requires the appropriate aircraft . If your airline can buy/lease such an airliner , the route hub-destination-hub can be operated in the limits of the demand . When the demand is enough to fill the plane along the week , then go ahead . Otherwise , the airline has to decide wether a ) leave the plane on the tarmac , b ) find a nearby complementary route : hub-A-B-hub , hub-B-A-hub , c ) use a smaller and cheaper aircraft ( if the crew is qualified on ) d ) combine destination A with a complementary destination B that fills schedules along the week ( or bi-week ) hub-A-hub-B-hub , e ) replace the route with one better , f ) negociate with one or several airliners to sell seats to them to fill the aircraft , g ) negociate with one or several airliners operating on the destination airport to take advantage of the hubbing : make your airline land at the destination during rush hours . Very long range flights ca n't be operated every day with one single aircraft . And very long range flights are a niche : the hours spent in that closed tube discourage passengers from taking such flights . And very long range flights are a hell to schedule : the aircraft does 3 or 4 flights a week , and stays on the tarmac the rest of the time . The size of the airline : If your airline is a big one , like British Airways or Japan Airlines or United , your reputation and historical operation is enough to get demand on most usual routes ( and your staff has the expertise to select profitable ones ) Most of your flights will be the type " hub-X-hub " , either domestic , regional , or international . If your airline is above average ( like Kenya Airways , Aeromexico , Air India ) you 'll have a mix of " hub-X-hub " flights and some complementary legs to fix schedules and aircraft operation ratio : hub-A-B ( - C ) - Hub If your airline is below average ( Blue Panorama , Air Kazakstan , Belavia ) chances are great to have charter flights , multiple flight shifts . . Timetables greatly vary from one year to another . Small airlines like Air Austral , Republic Express ( Indonesia ) , Insel Air will have historical regular flights , but most of them will be of type " hub-A-B-hub " and/or " hub-A-C-E-C-B-hub " . Timetables also vary from one year to another , but at a less rate than above because the airline do n't have enough aircraft to think of new or better routes to operate , as the ones available can not be closed or replaced . The region of operation - the airport statistics ( passenger volume per year ) : There are regions of high frequency of flights : Western Europe , United States , Japan , South-East Asia , Eastern Australia , the Dubai-Europe axis ... In those regions , you have several hundreds of round trip routes that can be operated ten times a day using a Boeing 747 . Cheap flights , historical demand , dynamic business . You can operate flights of type " hu
Radar systems have 2 aspects , the primary and secondary systems , or the Radar and the interrogator . The radar sends out a RF signal and receives everything that is returned on that same frequency , and performs calculations to determine the azimuth and range of everything it receives . The interrogator sends out radio pulses which transponders in aircraft receive and decode . The transponders then transmit data on a different frequency than what was received . The interrogator then receives that signal and decodes it and correlates it with the primary radar data to tell the operator that ' yes , that is definitely a valid target ' and gives the info on the flight to the operator . You can turn off the transponder , but all that will do is make it so that the ATC wo n't be able to see a correlated flight , ( one that is definitely an aircraft and not just noise coming through the primary radar ) . The screen would still show a blip where the radar picks up a signature though . If the plane has radar absorbent material or is close enough to the ground , that would get filtered out as noise . An ATC , who is used to only working with aircraft who want to be seen , and thus keep their transponders on , might be fooled by this . But a military radar operator might not be so easily fooled by this .
The pressure differential between the boiler and the cabin would be very large . I fear that this would result in the espresso machine being compromised . The pressure in the espresso machine is 9 bars , 14 in a good one . The difference in outside pressure is 0.3 bars . That is comparably tiny value that does not make any practical difference . Water would boil at a much lower temperature ( 198 ° F / 92 ° C ) resulting in the machinery not working correctly . Coffee should not be made with boiling water anyway . 198 ° F / 92 ° C is sufficient for making coffee . Besides , if the boiler was pressurized , the water would not boil until way higher temperature ( it is n't , but it does not heat the water above boiling point at that pressure ) . A sudden depressurization of the vessel could certainly result in a dangerous pressure differential resulting in explosive decompression . The pressurized content is water , not vapour , so it would not significantly expand if the machine cracked . After all , its pressure is relieved as part of normal operation ( when the coffee drips to the pot ) and it does not expand . And its amount is tiny compared to the total volume of the aircraft anyway . Very tiny , because the pressure is only in the pipe from the pump to the ground coffee . But that all assumes the coffee machine is espresso , which most of them are not . Usually they will be just filter machines where the water flows by gravity at ambient pressure or perhaps at some pressure , but much lower than in a real espresso machine . I believe some airlines do advertise they serve true espresso though .
It depends on the strength of the tornado and other variables , but in most cases , a plane Vs tornado will end very very badly for the aircraft and its occupants in a low altitude high speed scenario . A good example would be the <URL> , a <URL> that flew into a thunderstorm 8 minutes into takeoff and crashed after the wing was torn off . From the <URL> : At 17:12 the aircraft entered a tornado , which resulted in loads on the airframe increasing to +6.8 G and -3,2 G . The right wing was bent upwards followed by a severe downward sweep . This compromised the structural integrity of the wing , causing a large portion of the outer wing to separate in an upward and rearward motion . Control was lost and the aircraft impacted a railway bridge inverted . Everyone abroad the aircraft perished . FAA is <URL> : Pilots should observe the following rules for any flight routed even potentially near actual or possible thunderstorm activity : • Avoid all thunderstorms . And also , Although pilots have flown through limited state thunderstorms with little or no damage to the aircraft or passengers , these pilots should consider themselves extremely fortunate to be alive . ( emphasis original ) . Note : I 've used both thunderstorms and tornadoes here . <URL> defines them as : Thunderstorm : A storm ( produced by a cumulonimbus cloud ) that includes rain showers , lightning , and thunder . Tornado : A violently rotating column of air that extends down from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground .
You did n't say which country you 're asking about , but in the US it 's legal . Your definition of service ceiling <URL> , and there 's no regulation that I know of that requires you remain below it . The only clear case I can think of would be if the POH says that the service ceiling is an actual limitation and you should n't operate above it . Exceeding limitations in the POH is a violation of <URL> : Except as provided in paragraph ( d ) of this section , no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating limitations specified in the approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual , markings , and placards The <URL> requires you to report to ATC if you ca n't maintain a 500ft/min climb rate , so I suppose that not doing that could get you in trouble somehow . But there 's no actual regulation , as far as I can see . There are other , contrived scenarios that you could invent . If exceeding the service ceiling would require specific equipment or training that you do n't have , then you could be in violation of various regulations , but that is n't because of the service ceiling itself . And finally , there 's the catch-all <URL> : No person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another . If you do operate above the service ceiling and something goes wrong , then the FAA could bust you on that . Trying to get over mountains at or close to your service ceiling could be an example .
The maximum altitude you can operate your RC plane or copter vertically without any clearance from ATC or another government body is the upper limit of class G airspace in Germany , which is the first available airspace from to the lower vertical limit of controlled airspace C/D/E , which can be 1 , or , depending on surrounding airspace and airports in the vicinity . You can register at the website of the <URL> to obtain the ICAO charts for your area and take a look at the airspace structure near you . The actual ceiling of airspace G can be significantly lower in the vicinity of larger airports , where the controlled airspace C/D/E has been lowered . The below picture shows how the dark green section around Frankfurt Airport has an airspace C with the vertical limits . The airspace E in that area ( not visible in this picture ) has a vertical limit of . Some areas within that section already have an elevation of , which leaves less than of airspace G before the overlying airspace C begins . If you want to get your RC plane or copter into class C/D/E airspace , which is controlled airspace , you will need to obtain a clearance through the ATC unit in control of the sector or the FIS sector responsible , as postulated in <URL> § 16a LuftVO Besondere Benutzung des kontrollierten Luftraums ( 1 ) Bei Inanspruchnahme des kontrollierten Luftraums ist von der zuständigen Flugverkehrskontrollstelle eine Flugverkehrskontrollfreigabe einzuholen für 1 . Fallschirmsprünge und den Abwurf von Gegenständen an Fallschirmen ; 2 . Aufstiege von Flugmodellen und anderen fern - oder ungesteuerten Flugkörpern mit Eigenantrieb ; 3 . Aufstiege von unbemannten Freiballonen mit einer Gesamtmasse von Ballonhülle und Ballast von mehr als 0,5 kg sowie Aufstiege von gebündelten unbemannten Freiballonen und Massenaufstiege von unbemannten Freiballonen . Please also mind <URL> , which dictactes that any RC plane or UAV needs to remain within the visbility range of the controller , so the maximum altitude can vary depending on the size of your RC plane or copter , the weather minima at your location and your own eyesight : ( 3 ) Der Betrieb von unbemannten Luftfahrtsystemen ist verboten , wenn 1 . er außerhalb der Sichtweite des Steuerers erfolgt oder 2 . die Gesamtmasse des Geräts mehr als 25 Kilogramm beträgt . 1 : AGL = Above Ground Level 2 : MSL = Mean Sea Level
You do n't brace -- you 're still operating the aircraft ! The pilot seats have shoulder harnesses ; in many cases you can lock them , plus they also have inertial reels that keep you from slamming forward at an impact . Additionally , the pilots can presumably see the moment of impact coming , and tense for exactly that moment in a way that passengers can not .
The ADS-B signal used by FR24 is transmitted on 1090 MHz . Signals at that frequency do not follow the curvature of the earth very well . They work best in line of sight . Aircraft far away from the receiver must be at high altitude to be above the horizon . At 1000ft , the horizon is about 33 nautical mile away . Aircraft further away will be shielded below the horizon . For 40000ft , the horizon is about 220 nautical mile away . Due to a slight refraction of the signal the practical range is about 15 % further .
The pressure inside the cabin is usually more than the outside pressure at the cruise altitude . The pressure altitude ( ISA altitude with the same pressure ) inside the cabin of civil aircraft is called the equivalent effective cabin altitude or normally cabin altitude . As the aircraft climbs , the cabin altitude is gradually raised so that it reaches around 8000 ft for the aircraft cruising altitude of ~ 40000 ft. This level is maintained at flight ceiling too . <URL> Source : www.flyertalk.com The pressure is around 0.75 bar inside the cabin . The outside pressure at this point is around 0.2 bar , resulting in a pressure differential of 0.56 bar . This pressure differential causes stresses on the aircraft body . <URL> Source : ecnmag.com In addition to the stresses , pressurization - de-pressurizatoin cycle can cause fatigue in the windows . As reducing the cabin altitude will improve the passenger comfort , newer aircraft tend to have lower cabin altitudes . For example , the Boeing 787 has a pressure altitude of around 6000 ft and the Bombardier Global Express jet has a cabin altitude of around 4500 ft. This is achieved by the use of advanced composite materials , which allow a higher pressure differential have excellent fatigue properties compared to the metals . As a result , the windows of newer aircrafts are considerably larger than their predecessors . <URL> Image : Boeing
There are a lot of good reasons not to roll such an airplane . If the plane has gyroscopic instruments , you might tumble them ( cause the spinning gyro to hit the inside of the instrument ) . This can be expensive . You might easily over-stress the air frame . <URL> . ( That 's for a new aircraft ) A botched roll can easily hit 4.5 or higher . If you over stress the air frame , you might just put a lot of very expensive " wrinkles " in the skin that would be very hard to explain to the FBO , your boss , or the insurance company . Trashing the gyros would be cheaper . If you 're not lucky , the wings fold up and you fall out of the sky . It 's a stupid way to die . Non-aerobatic aircraft typically have limited elevator authority ; once upside down , you might find it very difficult to keep the nose pushed up high enough to keep the roll going . Turning a botched roll into a " split-S " is one of the worst " recovery " mistakes you can make , and you 're setting yourself up for it . Non-aerobatic aircraft often have gravity-feed fuel systems . A little bit of 0 or negative " G " and it will get very very quiet in the plane . Some people consider this silence detrimental to the continued safety of the flight . Non-aerobatic aircraft rarely have inverted oil systems . As the engine gets quiet , it also loses most of its lubrication . Bare metal on metal friction can be detrimental to achieving <URL> . Having said all that , in the hands of an expert , it is technically possible to barrel roll most aircraft . A good way to tell if you 're an expert is to call your insurance company and tell them exactly what you plan to do . If they 'll quote you affordable coverage , you might be an expert . Obligatory links because if I do n't include them someone else will : <URL> . I 'm pretty sure he 'd never get away with this today . <URL> . Bob Hoover is beyond expert . Way , way , beyond expert . If you want to roll an airplane , contact your local aerobatic club . In the US and some countries , it 's the <URL> . Get some competent dual instruction in a suitably rated airplane .
There are two factors which limit the possible speed of piston engines : <URL> , and relative speed of moving parts , here the pistons in their cylinder barrels . If the engine runs too fast , the flame front originating from the spark plug will not have traveled far enough to have burnt most of the fuel by the time the piston moves down again . This puts a fundamental limit to the growth in power output over speed in piston engines . Also , if the relative speed between moving parts is too high , the lubrication will fail and the parts will overheat quickly . In order to run at the highest possible speed , <URL> used castor oil , which in turn motivated early aviators to wear long scarves over their mouth so their digestive system would not be compromised by sitting right in the exhaust stream of their engine . Today , lubricants have improved but still set a clear limit to the maximum speed at which a piston engine can be run . Cooling can be managed by pressurizing the cooling system and improving radiator and pump performance while inertial loads on the engine components can be dealt with by lightweight , high-strength materials . Reducing the <URL> will allow a higher speed before the ignition limit bites while reducing the <URL> will reduce piston speeds , again allowing a higher engine speed before lubrication fails . An optimimized engine will balance both so that the possible speed can be fully exploited . For the IO-360 and IO-540 , those dimensions are 5 ⅛ " and 4 ⅜ " , respectively . This places them below the <URL> and closer to the typical <URL> . I could not find reliable data on the engine speed of <URL> , which should come close to the maximum sensible engine speed at that size class . The best I could find was the 3,700 RPM of the <URL> , an engine with 5.9 " bore and 6.5 " stroke , so I would guess by using good fuel and lubrication , the Lycoming might end up somewhere between 4000 and 4500 RPM . I 'm sceptical that much useful power can be extracted at 5000 RPM and am sure that the lifetime at this speed will be measured in minutes , not hours .
The obvious answer you mentioned should be reiterated : Avoid thunderstorms whenever possible ! Just because there are " best penetrating altitudes " does n't change the fact that thunderstorms are extremely hazardous to aircraft and should be avoided in the first place . With that said , the FAA 's <URL> mentions that , if unable to avoid penetrating a thunderstorm : To avoid the most critical icing , establish a penetration altitude below the freezing level or above the level of -15 ºC . This is to help minimize rapid accumulation of clear ice : Supercooled water freezes on impact with an aircraft . Clear icing can occur at any altitude above the freezing level but at high levels , icing from smaller droplets may be rime or mixed rime and clear . The abundance of large , supercooled water droplets makes clear icing very rapid between 0ºC and -15 ºC , and encounters can be frequent in a cluster of cells . Thunderstorm icing can be extremely hazardous . Another point to mention is that , regardless of there being a recommended " penetration altitude , " it is important to maintain a constant attitude , not altitude : It is almost impossible to hold a constant altitude in a thunderstorm , and maneuvering in an attempt to do so greatly increases stress on the aircraft . Stresses are least if the aircraft is held in a constant attitude . But again , emphasizing the dangers of thunderstorms , the circular states : Never regard any thunderstorm lightly , even when radar observers report the echoes are of light intensity . Avoiding thunderstorms is the best policy . and Weather recognizable as a thunderstorm should be considered hazardous , as penetration of any thunderstorm can lead to an aircraft accident and fatalities to those on board .
The optimum altitude depends on your aircraft , the engines and the weather . But most important is to decide what you are trying to achieve . If you would like to optimize your fuel consumption per distance travelled , the altitude you will fly at will be higher than if you try to optimize your fuel consumption per time unit . Fuel per distance travelled is usually better at altitude , while fuel flow per time unit is lower at lower altitudes . In other words , if you want to go far , fly high . If you want to keep flying long , fly low . Winds play an important role as well . If you have a strong headwind high up , you might go further staying low . There is quite some difference between reciprocating engines and jet / turbine engines here . The former perform better at lower altitudes , while the latter do just fine until much higher .
Lets take the EU for example . In the EU , <URL> . The majority of these ( 228 ) are banned because the EU CAA has determined that the country in which these carriers operate do not have enough oversight to ensure the safe operation , regulation , and maintenance of the airlines . Two of the air carriers are banned specifically because of poor maintenance standards , obsolete aircraft , or other reasons . Similarly the US has the <URL> although a much shorter list because it really only evaluates airlines that are codeshare or operated by companies that serve flights to/from the US . For the EU , this is a larger list because it does not require crossing an ocean to get there ... Typically you 'll find on these lists quite a few airlines that operate out of developing countries like the Congo or Angola . Its reasonable to draw the conclusion that countries that do not have regulatory oversight for much outside of running the government itself leaves the standards of safety to the operators themselves . This is n't to say that the operators are automatically unsafe , they just lack government regulation and observation of safety standards . So to mirror what vortaq7 said in his comment above , quantifying this is going to be difficult since the types of operations vary highly between countries . For example the US has a high accident rate looking at pure fatalities over the last 25 years compared to any other country , but this is because the US is biggest aviation market . Looking at it in the context of incidents per million flight hours may be available , but it also groups a lot of different types of flights like cargo and commuter . I 'm sure this type of data is available for more developed countries with reporting systems and formal accident investigations but may be difficult for countries that do n't have that . And now for a personal note ... I know you 're not interested in the personal aspect but Angola 's air carriers are banned in the EU , so it gives a little credibility to what I say above , plus its a good story . :) A part of my job is travelling the world and being flown out to oil rigs for work on the automation and safety systems . About 8 or 9 years ago I had to fly out to Luanda , Angola to be flown out to a rig a few hours off the Angolan coast . The flight there ( and back ) was on the <URL> , a direct flight from Houston to Angola . Upon arrival at the Luanda airport , I was taken to the heli-terminal for the flight out to the rig . Now understand that in the US Gulf of Mexico people travelling by helicopter to an oil rig are required to have egress training . In the EU , travelling out into the North Sea also must include cold water survival . In Luanda however , there were zero requirements ( I know this because I did not have egress training , nor was I asked to prove I did ) . After 3 or 4 equipment delays we were finally boarded on the helicopter , I sat across from the flight engineer and 3 or 4 other rig hands were on board . After take-off and after we flew over the coast , here is pretty much the actual words I spoke : ME - > Flight Engineer : What is dripping on the back of my neck ? Smells like fuel . FE - > ME : It is fuel . ME - > FE : Should I be concerned ? FE - > ME : Only if it stops dripping , that means we are out of fuel . Be sure I spent the remainder of the flight studying very carefully how to pop out the egress window ... When we got back to Luanda the aircraft we were supposed to take back to Houston had " mechanical problems " which delayed my return by 3 days . I could see the aircraft on the tarmac and it was sitting on cinder blocks without any tires , literally like you would imagine leaving a nice car in a bad neighborhood overnight . I spent those 3 days in a compound run by the oil company that had 16 foot tall walls with barbed wire and a very hefty front gate .

Are passive or active headsets preferable in an open cockpit ?
First we should see how active noise reduction works . The simplest definition would be : The following picture on <URL> depicts it in a simple manner : <URL> Then we can see what unwanted sounds ANR can actually reduce . As mentioned in <URL> : ANR headsets work best at frequencies below about 400-450 Hertz . This represents the normal frequency range for speech , and also much propeller and exhaust noise is in this region . ANR headsets are therefore a significant advantage where intelligibility of transmissions is affected by engine and propeller noise . In general , ANR Headsets offer greater hearing protection in high-noise environments but will do little to reduce noise at higher frequencies such as wind or airflow noise . In a flying airplane ( even in a slow flight ) , wind flow would be quite high . This <URL> states : The wind noise spectrum is dominated by the lower frequencies ( < 500 Hz ) , although at 27 mph when saturation is present , the wind noise level can be greater than 60 dB SPL at 8 kHz . Since passive noise control is sound reduction by noise-isolating materials such as insulation , sound-absorbing tiles , or a muffler rather than a power source , in an open cockpit , passive NR headsets work better than active NR headsets .

This <URL> states : The wind noise spectrum is dominated by the lower frequencies ( < 500 Hz ) , although at 27 mph when saturation is present , the wind noise level can be greater than 60 dB SPL at 8 kHz . Since passive noise control is sound reduction by noise-isolating materials such as insulation , sound-absorbing tiles , or a muffler rather than a power source , in an open cockpit , passive NR headsets work better than active NR headsets .

How does the canard plan of the Dassault Rafale work ?
The answer is in two parts . First , at higher speeds , control surfaces have more air moving over them and so they do n't have to angle as much to provide the same force necessary to move the jet as they do at slower speeds . In fact , a thin control surface like this canard will stall at lower angles of attack than a thicker profile would ( the thinner profile reduces drag which is why it 's used here ) , and a stalled surface ca n't do its job . Second , modern jets like the Rafale have fly-by-wire systems with flight limiters , to avoid the pilot overstressing the airframe at high speeds . The first video shows the Rafale in landing configuration , approaching a carrier at maybe 150kts . The second video shows high-G maneuvers at probably between 300 and 400kts . The forces at play on the canard are , in general , related to the square of the speed of the air moving past them , so if the system allowed the canards to present the same angle to a 300-knot flow as a 150-knot flow , all other things being equal the canard would be under 4 times the stress . At 450 knots that canard would be under 9 times the stress . Very quickly you would exceed the mechanical strength of that canard surface entirely , and then you would n't have a canard surface at all . So instead , the canards are moved at a shallower angle , with the difference in pitch rate , up to what the flight limiter will allow the entire aircraft to do , is made up using the elevons on the wings .
Here 's how the PAPI lights work : Depending on the angle of the viewer , a different color is seen : Then each light is calibrated to an angle : The good thing about this is that it 's dead simple technology where very few things can go wrong : The lights have to be on and calibrated for the correct angle . The downside is that its usefulness decreases with lower visibility . Some new systems appear to have solar panels as an off grid ( and alternative/backup ) power source which is sensible . Many systems today also have LED lights . If two airplanes with two different altitudes approach , do they see different number of white and red lights ? Or are the lights set for the closer airplane ? The system is independent and passive , in the sense that it never makes contact or note of the aircraft approaching . It lights up all to all aircraft in the beam . Hence , it ' works ' for all aircraft at the same time . Some new systems feature <URL> ( Final Approach Runway Occupancy Signal ) giving an indication that the runway may be occupied by another aircraft by flashing the lights . For a little information on differences between similar systems to PAPI , see <URL> .
Not a real example , but this comes from the <URL> , including some nice drawings around page 13-20 : The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails . There are numerous ways in which this is done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft . Some aircraft have an emergency release handle in the flight deck that is connected through a mechanical linkage to the gear uplocks . When the handle is operated , it releases the uplocks and allows the gear to free-fall to the extended position under the force created by gravity acting upon the gear . Other aircraft use a non-mechanical back-up , such as pneumatic power , to unlatch the gear . The popular small aircraft retraction system ... uses a free-fall valve for emergency gear extension . Activated from the flight deck , when the free-fall valve is opened , hydraulic fluid is allowed to flow from the gear-up side of the actuators to the gear-down side of the actuators , independent of the power pack . Pressure holding the gear up is relieved , and the gear extends due to its weight . Air moving past the gear aids in the extension and helps push the gear into the down-and-locked position . Large and high performance aircraft are equipped with redundant hydraulic systems . This makes emergency extension less common since a different source of hydraulic power can be selected if the gear does not function normally . In some small aircraft , the design configuration makes emergency extension of the gear by gravity and air loads alone impossible or impractical . Force of some kind must therefore be applied . Manual extension systems , wherein the pilot mechanically cranks the gear into position , are common . Consult the aircraft maintenance manual for all emergency landing gear extension system descriptions of operation , performance standards , and emergency extension tests as required .
Regarding the Specified IMU The referenced document describes the output protocol . SAEJ1939 CAN 29 bit identifier communication output -- the standard for the transportation segment -- allows more data to be transmitted than an RS-485 output You would need to use <URL> to decode the actual meaning of the output data . It is possible that Honeywell could provide you more information as part of purchasing the product . To use this to develop an AHRS solution you would still need pitot &amp; static inputs to derive pressure altitude and airspeed , as you wo n't be able to get those from the provided sensors . acceleration range up to ± 6 g , rotation rates up to ± 75 deg/s , inclination angles up to ± 50 deg and a sensor update rate from 1 Hz to 100 Hz I think the biggest hurdle you have here is that it will only measure inclination angles up to 50 deg . Aircraft can find themselves in > 50 deg pitch attitudes , which wo n't be registered by the IMU . This particular product ( Honeywell 6DF-1N6-C2-HWL ) seems to be designed for ground vehicle applications rather than aviation .
You have 3 questions here ( Or maybe 2 because the first and second are very similar ) 1 and 2 : Flares are some sort of burning compound that generates a significant amount of heat to distract ( hopefully ) an Infra-Red guided missile . They attract the IR missiles because the amount of IR energy created by them may be greater than that of the exhaust , which is what IR missiles follow . 3 The flares are deployed when the plane detects the presence of an IR missile . ( <URL> ) Once the presence of a " live " IR missile is indicated , flares are released by the aircraft in an attempt to decoy the missile ; some systems are automatic , while others require manual jettisoning of the flares . They also <URL> too .
The autopilot controls hydraulic actuator that is connected to the control link at some point . Since power transfer in the link is bidirectional , the control column moves when autopilot operates it . The same goes for thrust levers operated by autothrust . If the pilot fights it , the autopilot will increase the force applied up to some limit at which it will disconnect . It ca n't really recognize whether the force is from the pilot or due to aerodynamic forces , but that 's all right , because it should disconnect both if the pilot tries to yank the controls and when keeping the plane in the selected attitude requires too large control input ( e.g. hard up elevator because the plane is too slow ) . Boeing aircraft maintains this behaviour even on models with fly-by-wire ( B777 and B787 ) . Airbus did remove the feedback , because the command given does not directly correspond to control surface position anyway . So far I believe the only other civilian aircraft without feedback is Sukhoi Su-100 .
I read once that Mach speed decreases as altitude increases . The speed of sound is solely dependant on temperature . $ $ M = \ sqrt { \ gamma RT } $ $ where $ \ gamma $ is the ratio of specific heats , $ R$ is the molar gas constant and $ T$ is the temprature in Kelvin . For Earth 's athmosphere at 15 ° Celsius , $ $ M = \ sqrt { 1.4 \ times 287 \ times 288.15 } = 340 \ , \ text { m } / \ text { s } $ $ Does temprature decrease with altitude ? Well , not always as can be seen by the international standard atmosphere : <URL> ... are the pressure waves made at high altitude lesser than the ones at low altitude because of the difference in air pressure ? There is no simple answer to this . <URL> 's NASA 's opinion : Altitude determines the distance shock waves travel before reaching the ground , and this has the most significant effect on intensity . As the shock cone gets wider , and it moves outward and downward , its strength is reduced . Generally , the higher the aircraft , the greater the distance the shock wave must travel , reducing the intensity of the sonic boom . Of all the factors influencing sonic booms , increasing altitude is the most effective method of reducing sonic boom intensity .
the aircraft I worked on in the army were deadlined whenever 1 % of total aircraft weight was removed , requiring either the part to be reinstalled or a total reweigh prior to next flight . That 's for internal equipment , which will affect the empty CG data . All aircraft lose weight during a trip . Aircraft designed to lose a lot of weight all of a sudden ( C-5 airdrops , B-52 carpet bombing ) have the details and limits calculated during the design . In the case of bombers , the ordinance will be hanging near the wings and will have a specific release order , usually back to front . A tailgate aircraft dropping something will also have very specific procedures based on the weight of the pallet going out the back door . If it 's delivering pizzas the procedure is along the lines of " whenever , dude " . If it 's a tank , it has to be positioned and locked down until the moment of release . The above is very noticeable by the flight crew . If the load stays ( or gets stuck ) on the back ramp , you 're usually done . I used to skydive - 10 people on the back end of a smaller tailgate like a Casa can and do cause the plane to stall . The rules were stay at the front until it 's your turn , then position and exit in a prompt manner . If the buzzer goes , let go NOW . Unlike a cargo plane , jump planes have 12,000 feet to recover from the stall .
Indeed , the aspect ratio is defined as you describe . It is a way to define how slender the wing is for a given wing area , which is the main parameter in determining how to generate enough lift to keep the aircraft aloft . An area is two-dimensional , and a broadly rectangular shape like a wing area is defined by the length and the breadth of it : span and chord . Aspect ratio describes the proportions of span and chord : a short stubby wing , or a long and slender one ? This is one of the main parameters in how much drag the wing creates : a long slender wing minimises one particular form of aerodynamic drag , called induced drag . <URL> <URL> But a wing is a cantilever beam , subjected to aerodynamic lift . The lift forces bend the wing upwards , and the wing structure must produce internal forces that cancel out the aerodynamic lift . In a hollow cantilever beam like a wing , the skin mainly does that : the upper skin resists compression , and the lower skin resists tension . The further away the upper and lower skin are , the lower the stresses . A structural engineer wants to give as much distance between the plates as possible : he wants the wing to be very thick , in order for it to be light in weight . But again aerodynamics puts a limit to this : a very thick wing would create too much form drag , so the structures people are given the maximum distance that the aerodynamics can support . Wing thickness affects aspect ratio in defining the maximum AR that can be achieved . The wing thickness is not part of the induced drag , and does not appear in the definition of the aspect ratio . It is an important defining parameter in wing weight and other forms of drag .
You do not calculate indicated airspeed : It is an indicated value , you read it from the airspeed indicator . ( I suppose you can calculate it if you really want to , but I 've got no idea why you would want to do so in the context of flight planning . ) You determine what airspeed to use for flight planning purposes using your aircraft 's performance data ( from the POH or other manufacturer documents ) : There will usually be either a chart or a table giving true airspeed as a function of power setting and density altitude . ( True Airspeed is a more useful number for planning purposes as it saves you a calculation . ) <URL> <URL> When in flight you can calculate your true airspeed based on the indicated airspeed and density altitude . You can then compare this to your planned figures from the performance charts to determine if adjustments are necessary to your flight plan ( ETA , Fuel use , etc. )
" The wing lift formula shows that lift of a wing is proportional to its area " . That 's absolutely true . However a wing generates both lift and drag . Drag is of two natures : <URL> and <URL> . The sum of all drag is the total drag : <URL> Source : <URL> Induced drag decreases with speed , and has its origin in wing tip vortices . Vortices actually increase the velocity of the downwash , and changes the effective angle of attack . Which in turn changes the direction of the aerodynamic force , creating a force opposing to the direction of flight : <URL> Induced drag , source : <URL> Induced drag being due to tip vortices , if we can make vortices less efficient , then we also reduce induced drag . The way to do that is to have long wings , so the the downwash from the vortices affects only a part of the wing : <URL> Tip vortices , source : <URL> Research demonstrated that the induced drag is dependent on the wing <URL> , not only on the wing span . This can be understood easily : The quantity of air in a tip vortex is larger when the chord is large . So the answer to your question is : Yes lift is proportional to the wing area , but the <URL> is proportional to the wing aspect ratio . That 's why longer wings are preferred , they minimize energy lost in fighting drag . " Why are most conventional wings shaped the same ( swept back rectangles ) ? " Longer wings are better for fuel efficiency , but we have other problems in the designer queue , and some can be solved by selecting the <URL> , e.g. : We want to prevent the stall to be abrupt ( at the expense of creating less lift though ) : <URL> We want to delay the creation of a local supersonic flow in <URL> used in commercial airliners . When flying at M 0.8 , airflow is accelerated to produce lift , some areas of the wing reach supersonic speed ( Mach > 1 ) . The associated shock wave creates an additional drag . By sweeping the wing we add a spanwise component to the airflow which decreases the chordwise velocity , so the shock wave appears only to a higher aircraft airspeed : <URL> On the other hand , the sweptback wing tends to stall at the tip first , which is not good at all , as when a stall appears we need ailerons to prevent it from worsening , and ailerons are located at the tips to increase their effectiveness . So swept wings are also twisted so that the tip angle of attack is smaller than the root one , forcing the stall to start at wing root . Wings planforms are multiple , each type of wing , or sometimes subcomponent , can improve a particular issue ( possibly creating another that will be less important for the designer ) . See this very interesting article on Wikipedia : <URL>
In a constant speed prop , the prop control lever basically changes the speed of the prop ( it is not always running at the same speed as you indicate in your question , but rather once the speed is changed by the prop control lever , the governor keeps it at that speed ) . If power ( or airspeed ) is changed , the blade angle will automatically change in order to keep the prop turning at the same speed ( within the limits that it is designed for ) . Since adding power would normally increase the speed of the prop , the governor automatically changes the blade angle in order to keep it at the same speed . The same is true when power is reduced or airspeed is changed . Thrust is changed by engine power because , even though the prop is turning at the same speed , the angle of attack of the prop has been changed , which changes the amount of thrust . For more general information about how a constant speed prop works , see this question and answers : <URL>
Basically , dihedral effect is that during banking , the ' lower ' wing will experience a higher angle of attack compared to the ' higher ' wing , and a result , a greater lift . The resulting net force and moment reduces the banking angle , reducing stability . Consider a wing with a dihedral angle $ \ Gamma $ with a forward airspeed of $ u $ . If the sideslip angle is $ \ beta $ , the wind due to sideslip is $ u \ cdot sin \ beta $ . From geometry , the normal velocity induced due to dihedral , $ v _ { n } $ becomes $ u \ cdot sin \ beta \ cdot sin \ Gamma $ . <URL> Image from <URL> Note : The notations are different in the figure ; but the principle is the same . For our purposes , we can take the sideslip velocity ( $ u \ cdot sin \ beta $ ) as $ v _ { y } $ . Now , consider two sections from the wing - one each from the ' lower ' and ' higher ' sides . The induced velocity is of the same magnitude in both the sides , while the direction differs , as can be seen from the above figure . <URL> Image from <URL> <URL> Image from <URL> For small angles , $ v _ { y } $ is nearly equal to $ u \ beta $ . The induced angle can be given as , $ \ Delta \ alpha = \ frac { v _ { n } } { u } $ . From the earlier relations , we have , $ \ Delta \ alpha _ { 1 } = \ beta \ cdot sin \ Gamma $ , and $ \ Delta \ alpha _ { 2 } = - \ beta \ cdot sin \ Gamma $ . Because of these induced angles , the lift on the downgoing wing increases by $ \ Delta L$ , while of the other one decreases by $ \ Delta L$ . The net result is that the ' lower ' wing experiences an increases lift , causing a rolling moment , which causes the banking angle to reduce . <URL> Image from <URL>

As far as I read in various documents about A320 and remember them correctly : There are three systems handling different parts of the primary flight control : ELAC ( elevator &amp; aileron computer ) controls pitch with elevators + trim and roll with ailerons . SEC ( spoiler &amp; elevator computer ) roll with spoilers and if ELACs fail , pitch with elevators + trim . FAC ( flight augmentation computer ) implements yaw damper . It 's command is added to the rudder command . In A320 rudder pedals have direct mechanical ( hydraulic ) link . The ELAC and FAC are composed of two identical units each , the SEC of three identical units ( but only two of the units are used as backup for ELAC ) . Each unit is composed of two dissimilar computer boards . One used i386 CPU , the other m86k CPU and each has independently developed software ( to minimize risk of the same software bug in both ) . One of the boards in each pair calculates the output and the other one verifies it . If the verification fails , that unit declares fault and disconnects . This is the primary way of detecting faults . I found no reference to comparing outputs of the identical units . Except for spoiler control there are only two output and the check board is more reliable way of detecting faults anyway . If the FAC fails , the aircraft wo n't maintain coordinated flight well and will tend to dutch roll , but pilots can compensate it with rudder input . If the SEC fails , the ELAC can handle control alone . Just spoilers wo n't be available . If the ELAC fails , the SEC can take over too . Turning with spoilers may cause some more drag , but not a big problem . If both ELAC and SEC fail , the pitch trim wheels have direct mechanical ( hydraulic ) link and roll can be controlled by rudder by taking advantage of the yaw stability . I do n't think it was ever needed in practice . Note , that is for A320 family ; which controls are available in case of failure of all flight computers is different in each Airbus type . As for data input , there are three ADIRUs ( air data and inertial reference unit ) and each flight computer takes input from all three and compares them . It needs two matching ( similar within some limit ) values to consider it trustworthy . If either more than one unit fails or no two agree , the flight computers degrade to alternate law or direct law . In alternate law , the system stops providing alpha protection ( stall ) , overspeed protection and , depending on what failed , other flight envelope protection ( there are two kinds , with different protections lost ) . In direct law it reverts to directly mapping the stick position to control surface position similar to mechanical controls . But most faults only result in alternate law except if all inertial references were lost ( that would be very difficult to handle as it would mean unreliable attitude indicators too , but I do n't think that ever happened either ; the inertial systems are very reliable ) . Alternate or direct law can also be entered if some control surface ( or it 's actuator ) fails and somewhere in the computer failure sequence , but I do n't remember the exact condition ( FACs calculate the limits , so if FACs fail , it will certainly degrade ) .
The purpose of the roll posts is to let the pilot have some control authority in hover and stabilization , along with controlling aircraft attitude . Basically , the <URL> used in the VTOL F-35 has three components connected by drive shaft ( along with the engine ) : The LiftFan at the front Three-bearing swivel module ( 3BSM ) , which turns the nozzle through 95 $ ^ \ circ $ , and Two Roll posts on either side of the fuselage . <URL> F-35 Liftfan system ; image from <URL> Basically , some bypass air is directed towards the ( individually adjustable ) roll post ducts to ensure stability during hover , which is done by the onboard computer . In this image , you can see the roll post doors opening on outboard sides of the MLG doors . <URL> F-35 roll post doors opening ; image from <URL> The 3-Bearing Swivel Module ( 3BSM ) has three segments driven by two actuators ( the first one drives the first segment , while the second one drives the second segment directly and the third one through an angle gearbox ) . The three segments are cut at an angle , so that when transferring from forward flight to hover , the central segment ends up with its longer edge at the top ( so that their sections with maximum length are on the same side ) , thus ' summing ' the bearing offset angles to give a 95 $ ^ \ circ $ deflection of the jetpipe nozzle in the downward direction . From <URL> : The three-bearing swivel nozzle , 3BSN , design uses three segments of the engine exhaust duct cut on an angle and joined by two airtight circular bearings . External motors drive geared teeth in these segments to rotate them to create the deflected thrust . The forward and aft segments always stay aligned with one another in the rotational axis . The center segment rotates through 180 degrees relative to them . The third bearing is on the back of the engine aft of the turbine stage and provides the ability to swivel the nozzle thrust axis in yaw at any pitch angle . <URL> Three bearing swivel module , from <URL>
<URL> to assist Harriers in getting airborne . The Harrier can not take-off vertically when fully loaded . <URL> . Therefore , they need to do a " short take-off " where the thrust nozzles are angled rearwards to provide thrust , then partially angled downwards as speed is gained to produce enough lift from the wings , and thrust angled downwards , to climb away . Watch the nozzles closely at about 17 and 36 seconds in <URL> . Try not to watch the poor chaps forehead too closely at 20 seconds . Also watch <URL> . At about 16 seconds , you can see the pilots left hand pull back on the <URL> as he passes the end of the deck . Now imagine a flat deck on an aircraft carrier . Operations must be able to carry on in rough seas . You accelerate down the deck and fly off the end , just as the deck dips downwards as the carrier rides a large wave . You are pointed straight at the sea . In order to avoid flying into the sea , you need to climb , which means pulling G and a lot of power at low speed which the Harrier just did n't have . Now consider the ski jump . There are two effects . The jump is angled so that even in the worst seas in which operations will continue , the bow pitching down will not point an aircaft leaving the end of the jump towards the sea . The aircraft will always be pitched upwards . Imagine driving a fast car up the jump and off the end . It will be thrown up and forward in a <URL> . Even a car , which can not fly , will be pointing up for a few seconds , then level for few seconds before falling into the sea . But instead of a car , you are driving a jet which can fly and has thrust . The aircraft will angle the nozzles rearwards for maximum acceleration until it leaves the jump . The wings are now generating significant lift , let 's say 50 % of that required to climb away . As you leave the end of the jump , you angle the nozzles downwards so that you have the momentum of the aircraft and some rearward thrust maintaining lift on the wings whilst adding lift from the thrust vector having a downward component . Those seconds of pointing up , then level , enable the aircraft to continue to accelerate until all of the lift required can be gained from the wing when the nozzles can now be angled rearward again to continue the acceleration . Take-off speed is therefore reduced and take-off distance is about halved meaning smaller , cheaper carriers . That 's how Harriers do it . I imagine it 's the same story for any other VSTOL aircraft .
This thread should be a great source of tips and tricks :) The way to think about this is to think about the purpose of being asked to divert during your checkride . What the examiner will be looking for is not that you have all of the information for every possible airport you might be asked to fly to . The examiner is wanting to see that if you had to divert unexpectedly for whatever reason , that you are able to do this safely . That 's the bottom line . In order to do this , you should start working on the problem during your ground planning , and for the purposes of your checkride , this will be no different to planning any other flight . Plan for your alternate . You should have charts , frequencies etc and of course , enough fuel . Your examiner is not going to ask you to divert to somewhere when you reach your destination , it 's going to be somewhere en-route . As part of any good plan , you are going to familiarise yourself with possible diversions along the route . If you had an urgent situation ( not a dire emergency where nearest available is the only choice ) requiring you to divert when you were flying solo after you gained your license , where would you go ? This does n't mean that you need every possible piece of information for every possible airport but it does mean : Do I have enough fuel to make possible diversions ? Do I have charts on board covering the areas to the left and right of my plan ? - Have I folded my charts so that it 's easy to see what possible diversions there are easily ? Do I have Jeppesen ( or whatever ) on board and is it up to date ? Have I checked the METARs and NOTAMs for anything significant for those likely diversions . Do I have my E6B or other planning tool and do I know how to use it fully ? Do I know what ATC agencies I would talk to along the route if I need assistance , even if flying in uncontrolled airspace ? In your notebook for the planned flight , write down the likely diversion airfields with their key details . The list above should be part of any plan , not just for your checkride . One of the key things you 're going to need to figure out is " how long will it take me to get to the diversion " ? In order to know this , you 're going to need to know the wind at the altitude you are going to be flying at . The way I handled this was to draw a circle on my chart , marked with the wind at altitude , then the corresponding ground speed already worked out on my E6B and written into the circle for each cardinal and mid-cardinal point on the compass rose . You can glance at this little chart to instantly see that if , for example , the requested diversion needs me to fly a heading of 320 , I will be doing 86 kts for an airspeed of 100 kts . This saves you having to actually use your E6B in the cockpit to do this . Mark off 0 , 45 , 90 , 135 etc. . If you think about it , doing this in planning will prepare you for any * sensible " diversion you might be asked to make . When it comes to the time of the diversion , the primary thing your examiner is looking for is do you get " aviate , navigate , communicate " ? The second thing the examiner is looking for is " can you safely divert from en-route " ? If you have planned thoroughly , and you follow aviate , navigate , communicate , then almost by definition , you will safely divert . So your examiner suddenly says , OK , see that completely unexpected giant sandstorm ahead , you need to get down soon . Please divert to " Mark Watney - Space Pirate " airport . Avoid the single , most important thing in this whole exercise at this point . Do no go into heads down mode . It 's easy to do if you are unprepared . Your head should be down for at most 15 seconds . Do each thing one step at a time , then scan and lookout . If you are well prepared and planned , then not going heads down will be easy . You now need 3 things immediately - everything else can come later . What heading do I need to fly ? How long will it take me to get there ? Can I make it ? For the heading , grab your chart , find the airport , then take a rough heading you need . You do n't , at this stage , need to be super accurate . Within 10 or 15 degrees will be good . The important thing is to begin flying to towards the diversion . You can get the ruler out and refine your heading once you 've got the initial diversion sorted out . Do n't forget to aviate . Keep your head moving , keep your scan and lookout going . When you set up for the new heading and turn on to it , remember the gross error check as you roll out . How long will it take ? Again , you do n't need to be super accurate . Grab a quick measure of the distance from the chart and your ruler . Then look at that wind chart you prepared earlier . Get your estimated ground speed . Can I get there ? You should know the aircrafts ' fuels consumption numbers so do the quick calculation in your head . During all of this , remember to aviate at all times . Also , remember to conduct your normal en-route and turn check lists . Now it 's time to communicate .
Horizontal displacement : Tilt the rotor With the rotor blades rotating around a vertical mast , the total lift vector of the rotor is vertical and the helicopter hovers . If a translation is desired , this vector must be tilted so that an horizontal component can appear . This is done by tilting the rotor disc . The rotor disc is the plane of rotation of the blades . <URL> Rotor tilted forward : The helicopter moves forward . Rotor tilt : Change blades pitch The rotor disc is tilted using the lift difference between individual blades . For instance to tilt the rotor forward , each blade creates more lift when it is aft of the mast , less when it is forward of the mast , and the change is progressive between these two positions . The lift difference creates a torque moment on the mast , tilting the mast and the helicopter with it , at least this is our intuition . As you mentioned , the force does n't produce its effect instantaneously due to the gyroscopic precession . It is effective only 90 ° later . So the lift variation must have an advance of phase of 90 ° . For a forward translation , the lift is maximum when the blade is on the left , and minimum when it is on the right . The momentum is stored into the blade and released 90 ° later . <URL> The variation of lift is done 90 ° in advance . Lift depends on the angle of attack of the blade . Varying the amount of lift according to the position around the mast leads to varying the AoA around the mast : Increased AoA on the left , decreased on the right . <URL> Pitch varies according to the radial position of the blade . Change blades pitch with the swashplate Changing the pitch of a blade is done using a system of swashplates . A stationary plate is oriented in space by the pilot using the cyclic stick . Another plate is maintained in contact with the first one , but can turn freely with the rotor . This second plate is forced to rotate in the plane of the stationary plate , thus it oscillates constantly as it rotates . In turn , it creates an oscillation of the vertical rods ( horn links ) . Each horn converts the rod oscillation into a pitch oscillation on the blade . The blade is now pitched according to its instantaneous radial position relative to the mast , and according to the cyclic stick command . <URL> MBB Bo105 , based on photo by <URL> ( <URL> ) Horns are linked to different angular sectors of the swashplate The vertical rod transmits the stationary swashplate height at its current axial position . By locating the rod 90 ° ahead of the blade , the link takes care of the rotor precession . The mechanism is so that when the pilot pushes the cyclic forward : The swashplate is tilted forward . When a blade moves left of the mast , its horn link measures the height of the stationary swashplate in its aft sector , where the plate is the highest . The horn is pushed by the link to the maximum , and the blade in turn gets the largest pitch angle . The situation is reversed when the blade arrives on the right . The link is in contact with the forward sector of the swashplate , where the latter is at the lowest position . The blade gets a low pitch angle . <URL> ( Redrawn from <URL> ) Advance for pitch order can be adjusted as required By adjusting the offset of the horn link which interfaces the horn and the plate , one can adjust to the exact amount of advance required for a given blade .
For a basic True Airspeed Indicator ( TAS Meter ) like the one shown below , you simply dial your pressure altitude into the top window using the knob ( aligning it with the appropriate temperature mark at the bottom of that window ) , and then read your true airspeed in the other window at the bottom . <URL> Your pressure altitude can be obtained by setting your altimeter to 29.92 and reading the indication , the air temperature can be obtained from an outside air temperature ( OAT ) gauge ( or you can use one from the Winds Aloft forecast if your aircraft does not have an OAT gauge ) , and the combination of the two gives you your density altitude . The meter itself is simply a mechanical slide rule , performing the same functions as you could do manually on an E6B flight computer . The indicator above is showing a true airspeed of about 202 MPH , at a pressure altitude of 10,000 feet and a temperature of -15 degrees . For a nice video tutorial <URL> .

How do commercial airlines prepare for pilots falling sick during the flight ?
do they fly in a pilot ( like mid-air refuel ) ? No , that is n't really feasible ! See answers to <URL> do they leave it to the co-pilot to take care of such situations ? Yes . In both normal and emergency situations , the co-pilot is able to fly the aircraft , navigate to a nearby airport and land the aircraft without the assistance of the senior pilot . From <URL> Here are some lines of defense : The remaining pilot must assume or maintain control Establish a safe flight profile and engage the autopilot ; use all possible automation Obtain cabin crew assistance Inform ATC If on an extended-range twin-engine operations ( ETOPS ) flight , the remaining pilot or PIC must assess whether to continue the flight , return to the departure airport or divert . The decision is based on : Weather conditions at the destination or alternate Reduction of flight time if diverting Workload involved in single-pilot operation Familiarity with the alternate Condition of the incapacitated pilot Availability of medical assistance Overall safety of the flight Arrange medical assistance upon arrival Brief a cabin crew member to assist if required Complete the approach and landing using the autopilot as much as possible A partially incapacitated pilot should not be allowed to participate in the subsequent operation of the aircraft , as judgment may be impaired After landing , seek immediate medical assistance See also <URL> The remaining pilot must first assume command and maintain control of the aircraft . Furthermore the position of essential controls and switches should be checked , and in nearly all cases , use of the autopilot should be made and an emergency be declared . Use of the autopilot and priority of air traffic service are two obvious and effective ways of maintaining a tolerable level of workload . The second step is to take care of the incapacitated flight crew member . The grounds for this are not entirely humanitarian ; if left unattended an incapacitated pilot can become a major problem and in any case is a major distraction to the remaining crew . Thus the incapacitated pilot must be moved out of the range of flight controls . In all cases , the advisability of removing a pilot ( perhaps unconscious ) from the seat must be dictated by consideration of the phase of the flight , the crew available , and the contours of the flight deck . Note : Consideration of the restraint and care of an incapacitated pilot dictates that cabin attendants are at least familiar with the operation of harness and seat controls Finally , and after the incapacitated flight crew member has been taken care of , the remaining flight crew should re-organise the cockpit work and prepare for landing . Details will depend on many variables including such considerations as the type of aircraft being flown , phase of flight , en route and terminal weather , and many others . How does commercial airlines prepare themselves for these kind of situations . I imagine that it involves the usual measures make pilots take regular medical tests . make pilots responsible for reporting own or crew illness , fatigue etc. prevent pilots eating the same meals in-flight . write procedures for pilot incapacitation in-flight . train flight crew to perform those procedures review and revise the above based on experience of relevant events . From what I 've read , non-pilot flight-crew are often given very basic training so that they understand the basics of flight . For example <URL> requires flight attendants initial training to include a pilot-incapacitation drill , an understanding of aircraft parts including rudder , ailerons etc , principles of flight , etc etc. . Do they specifically check if there are any pilots in the passenger manifest I believe the airline staff would often be aware of any airline pilots onboard ( e.g. <URL> ) but not of GA or military pilots flying as normal passengers .
1 : Do pilots eat during flight or they wait until they are back on the ground ? As pilots happen to be humans , their metabolism works in a similar fashion as yours or mine work . So they eat when they are hungry . On a long flight , they can eat during the flight , but on short flights ( e.g. 30 minutes - 2 hours ) , they might not get enough free time to have a meal . On busy days , pilots may not get enough time to have proper meals , so they try to eat small meals containing more nutrition . This is detailed in an article on <URL> . They also avoid heavy meals before a flight . 2 : Do they get the same food that is served to the passengers or do they bring their own meal ? Most of the time , food served to the passengers is the same which is served to the pilots , although they do n't <URL> . An airline <URL> that : ... the pilot gets the first class meal and the copilot the business class meal .
The EMB-145 used a combination of <URL> settings and the thrust levers to select the desired thrust and to signify the need for additional thrust . The thrust levers had a detent that selected " 100 % " thrust for the given mode the FADEC is operating in . If you pushed the thrust levers past the detent to " max " this would give you extra thrust . The mode the FADEC is operating in is selected by a button in the cockpit that cycles through the available modes . For takeoff power the modes were " ALT T/O " , " T/O " and " E-T/O " which gave you 90 % , 100 % and 107 % thrust for takeoff when the thrust levers were in the detent . If advanced past the detent this would put the mode into a reserve mode and depending on model would give you up to 110 % or 117 % thrust . Setting the exact amount of thrust needed was up to the engine FADEC units , our job was just to tell it what thrust mode it was in and it scaled the output of the thrust levels to that mode . Flying a 90 % thrust takeoff , a normal rated climb and then reducing to cruise levels only required initially setting the thrust levers into the detent and adjusting the FADEC mode .
Unlike passengers in economy who are trying to sleep in sitting position in seat that can be only partially reclined , the pilots sleep lying in a bed . Long range aircraft have a crew rest area . They are often above or below the main cabin and therefore low , now allowing standing up , but they always have beds or fully convertible chairs . The flight crew rest area is most commonly for 3 and separate cabin crew rest area for whatever is the usual number of flight attendants in given plane .
On the first flight of the day , after every refueling , and if you have flown through precipitation or the plane is left in the rain , you check the fuel for water and to make sure you have the right kind of fuel . Since water is heavier than fuel , if there is just a little bit of water in the fuel it could cause the engine to stop . You ca n't pull over to the side of the road like you can in a car , so you need to immediately deal with the problem . The most likely place for this to occur is on takeoff . If you think fast and switch tanks , you might get lucky and only have water in one tank so you can continue your takeoff . If not , you may need to find a place to land . In 17 years of flying , I have only found water in the fuel once , and it was n't even my airplane . But since it was on Catalina Island , a stopped engine would not have been pretty . The other reason to check the fuel is that airplanes designed for 100LL do not burn Jet Fuel . Jet fuel is denser than 100LL so it will sink to the bottom of the tank . It is straw colored and somewhat greasy so you can tell if you plane has accidentally been filled with it , but you really have to be paying attention . It would be easy to miss if you just topped off . There have been incidents when twin-engine planes have mistakenly been filled with Jet A and have either crashed or had expensive fuel system cleaning required . In this article , <URL> describes his experiences . After the <URL> of a Cessna 421s someone did a <URL> to see how easy it is to identify a combination of Jet A and Avgas . It 's fairly hard using standard pre-flight practices . That 's why many people recommend watching the fuel truck if you have a twin-engine plane or one that prominently says " Turbo " on the side . Many aircraft have rubber bladders to hold the fuel . Most older Cessnas have them . Water can get trapped in the folds of the bladder and get into the engine later when the fuel is sloshed around . Even if the fuel source is free of water , a tank that is not full can have water condense in it . Most autogas has some ethanol in it . Water will dissolve in a gas-ethanol mixture and so a slug of water wo n't get into the engine like it will in an aircraft engine . Contamination is less of an issue and is one that is really hard for a GA pilot to determine . You really ca n't tell if the fuel is contaminated with other petroleum products just by looking at it .
Most de-icers are run by the airport FBO so the people who work on de-icing in the winter work on other FBO duties such as refueling and the like when there is no de-icing to do . Some de-icers are just hired permanently for winter times .
There are three common ways to send a distress signal ( roughly in order of preference ) : Over the radio , to whoever you are currently talking to . Key the microphone and announce to the world , the flight 's callsign , and a description of the emergency . This is generally the way an emergency is declared , particularly for commercial ( airline ) service , as they 're generally always in contact with an ATC facility Over the radio , to anyone monitoring the " emergency " frequency . The VHF frequency 121.5 MHz is reserved for aircraft emergency communication . It is monitored at most air traffic control facilities , as well as by many airliners and other pilots with multiple radios in their aircraft . If you 're not able to make contact with the facility you 're currently talking to in ( 1 ) above ( or if you 're not currently talking to an ATC facility ) . Using the aircraft 's transponder . Three transponder codes are reserved for unusual/emergency situations : for general emergencies for loss of communication ( radio failure ) for hijacking or other unlawful interference All of these transponder codes alter the way the aircraft 's radar target is displayed , to alert the controller to the possible problem ( exactly how the display is modified depends on the radar equipment the controller has , and can range from additional text in the data block , like ( RaDiO Failure ) for code to changing the color of the displayed block on newer systems . <URL> , and more information is available <URL> , though you 'll have to dig through a few referenced documents to put it all together . Note that sometimes the order of preference changes - For example if a pilot is being threatened by a hijacker they may quietly set their transponder code to 7500 without saying anything on the radio to alert the hijacker .
The short answer is , no , generally only large aircraft have purpose-built fuel dumping systems . Such a system may be helpful in reducing aircraft gross weight to a safe landing weight in the case of a precautionary landing . The approved landing weight of smaller aircraft , such as the C172 , is generally the same as the approved takeoff weight . The longer answer is , yes , it would be possible to " dump " fuel from an aircraft such as a C172 , though not by means of a purpose built mechanism . The " dumping " would be more of a slow to moderately fast drain , depending on the means used . If I wanted to drain the fuel from one of the wing tanks in a C172 while in flight I could use a pen , screw or other such device to drain fuel from the wing tank sump . A faster dumping/draining method -- though requiring considerably more work -- would be to unscrew and remove the fuel drain valve , thereby releasing all the fuel in the wing . Obviously , this later method would hamper the possibility of draining only a portion of the fuel from the wing tank . <URL> I can not think of any reason why I would want to drain the fuel in flight apart from reducing the risk of fire in the event of an emergency landing . And in that case , my prefered method of reducing the risk of a post-landing fire would be to concentrate my efforts on the landing , not on eliminating a fuel source . Generally , I prefer to have more rather than less fuel in the tanks when I fly .
The correct answer is , habit patterns . If your habit , as a pilot , is to ALWAYS select reverse thrust , you 'll do so reliably even when the weather is bad , you 're fighting gusty crosswinds , and there is whatever else going on . On the other hand , if you sometimes do &amp; sometimes do n't select reverse thrust , that habit pattern is n't there to back you up when you have the proverbial " dark &amp; stormy night " and getting into reverse thrust right away may be the difference between staying on the runway or running off the end . For example , if I 'm landing a fairly light aircraft on a 12,000 ' dry runway in DEN with a little headwind , it is entirely possible to leave the thrust reversers stowed , roll out with the speed brakes deployed , tap the brakes slightly , and exit on the last high speed taxiway at a normal taxi speed . And I 'd burn less fuel and make less noise doing that . But at my carrier , I 'm not allowed to , because it 's considered that the habit pattern of always deploying the T/R is so important that it 's worth it to burn that extra gas even when it is n't strictly necessary , so that on the day when it 's vital , the habit pattern to grab the T/R 's right after touchdown is strong . I do n't think that this is an OpSpec ( i.e. FAA ) requirement , at least for the aircraft that I fly , but I 'm quite certain that it is a requirement in our books , so my supposition is that it 's a company requirement . If that assumption is correct , then other companies might choose to do differently ( and I recall one early morning arrival into Frankfort on a Lufthansa A-320 that used NO reverse thrust , but some heavy braking instead -- presumably to reduce noise at that hour of the morning ) . The fact that safety is so important , though , probably drives plenty of operators to make the same choice that our carrier does : build the habit of ALWAYS using reverse thrust -- even though that means sometimes using it when it is n't necessary .
Before the turn of the century ( I ca n't believe I 'm using that phrase , as I retired in 1999 ) and especially back when all 3 engine and 4 engine airliners had a flight engineer , the usual career path at many airlines was to hire in as an Flight Engineer , or FE ( two stripes ) , progress to an First Officer , or FO ( three stripes ) , and then become a captain ( four stripes ) . This all began to change , of course , with the advent of large 2-man cockpit aircraft . The change was not without controversy and some pain . For example , at least one initial operator of the 737 ran a 3-man cockpit for a time . The 3rd guy was , as I remember , referred to as the GIB ( guy in back ) . He sat in the jumpseat and read the checklists , which was one of the tasks an FE typically had in 3-man cockpits . As it happened , the two jet carriers I worked for hired pilots into the FO seat and used professional FEs . I spent a couple of years on the 727 and then 10 years on the 747 . During that time , every FE save one that I flew with was ex-military , and with few exceptions all were A&amp;P s . That was desirable in case a maintenance sign off was needed when you were someplace where maintenance was not otherwise available . Occasionally you would encounter an FE who had been a captain . The pilots were required to retire at 60 back then , but FEs were n't . I only knew one such individual , and I always liked flying with him . The more expertise you have in the cockpit , the better . In the two 747 carriers I worked for , an FE would sometimes transition to the FO seat , but that was relatively rare , and the costs were typically the individual 's to bear . Interestingly , when I retired in 1999 , I had flown with an ex-military FE who years later became the chief pilot of the airline involved .
None of four airlines I worked for ( two commuters , two Part 121 ) had specific guidance as to the max number of go-arounds . However , as mentioned in the other answers , 2 or 3 was believed to be a good rule . The only time I did multiple go-arounds , all missed approaches , was trying to get into Pullman , WA during a snowstorm in the late 1980s in an SA-227 Metroliner . I tried the VOR approach 3 times . Each time when we got down to the MDA , we did not have the forward visibility to descend further . Each of the 3 times the station personnel saw us pass over , and each time passengers looking out the windows saw the runway below us when we were overhead . That , of course , resulted in our being criticized when we arrived at our alternate by some passengers for not having landed at Pullman . I had explained en route to the alternate the problem with forward visibility , but when you 've disrupted people 's travel plans , they do n't want to listen . I briefly considered the feasibility , when we were over the runway , of entering a tight left turn to see if I could keep the runway in sight , but I rejected that . And , yes , I considered descending below the MDA before catching sight of the runway . That would have been doable as I was very familiar with the airport and knew that the gently rolling fields around the airport topped out well below the MDA . The problem was that with all the snow on the ground and the snow in the air , we could n't determine our altitude above the ground visually until we were actually over the runway . The fields around the airport had no trees , they were wheat fields in season . Even if I had chosen to bust the MDA , I still would have been too high for any kind of a normal landing when I caught sight of the runway end . If getting down was an emergency , we could have done it . It was n't technically legal , but you could go into beta with the props and really drop out of the sky , then as you flared come out of beta . But it was n't an emergency , so we went to our alternate , which was actually our next stop anyway , so all of the passengers were n't unhappy . The advantage of multiple approaches is that conditions might get better while you 're doing them , and you can get in . The disadvantage is that the nervous energy you 're expending is telling . Our SA-227s had no-autopilots , no radar altimeters , and , of course , no GPS . I imagine that these days that airport has one or more GPS approaches that would make landing in those conditions a piece of cake .
The first airplane with a cabin big enough for walking around was indeed a Sikorsky . This was the <URL> , also sometimes named " Le Grand " , a name which was given to an earlier , two-engined version . Oh , and the cabin included a washroom , too ! <URL> Sikorsky Russky Vityas ( picture <URL> ) It was the first four-engined airplane in the world and the biggest airplane of its time . It flew first on May 10 ( or 13 , depending on the source ) , 1913 . Quote from Wikipedia : After the Russky Vityaz 's first test flights between 10 and 27 May 1913 ( Old Style dates ) , it was established that a passenger could even walk around the cabins without causing any problems to stability . <URL> Early Le Grand version with two engines ( <URL> )
In addition to repaints , aircraft are also periodically washed and treated to maintain the paint quality and reduce the build up of dust/grime/salt and other particulates . There are automated systems installed at some airports to clean airplanes as they taxi over these areas . Think of it as a drive through car wash , but for airplanes . The very first applications of these were actually for the US Navy because they have a requirement to wash aircraft due to their proximity to seawater . A company called tammermatic developed a system for the navy to clean airplanes directly on the field using a set of powerful jets . Images from the <URL> <URL> <URL> Then there is the <URL> ( PDF brochure ) , developed by PMW ( a company that makes concrete pumps ) to wash aircraft automatically . It was first used by Lufthansa in 1997 ( image cc : ARNE DEDERT / AFP ) : <URL>
You presume that they flew back the very same day ... but that is an incorrect presumption . For long flights over about 8 hours , strict rest limits apply so they can not fly again for 8-10 hours at a bare minimum . Typically , a crew from a long-haul flight will stay in a hotel in the destination city for anywhere from 12 to 48 hours , depending on the flight length , timezone changes , airline schedules , union contracts , and so on . Yes the hotels and travel bonuses costs the airline a pretty penny but that 's the cost of doing business . So at this very moment there will be 1 or maybe 2 LX crews , resting ( or touristing ... ) in San Francisco , waiting to fly a return service . For more information you can google or ask a new question on Fatigue Risk Management Systems .
From Finnair 's Facebook page , it looks like Flight Attendancts wear gloves for safety reasons during takeoff/landing and galley preparation . Also it seems they do remove them when greeting passengers . <URL> <URL>
Most of the time the turbulence we experience is termed " chop " , which is akin to what you experience on a boat on the lake -- bumps but no real altitude deviations . With altitude deviations we 'll call it " turbulence " . Within these broad categories we 'll qualify them with " light " , " moderate " , " severe " and " extreme " in reports to ATC and other aircraft . These reports do suffer from a fair bit of subjectivity with respect to aircraft type ( wing stiffness ) and pilot experience . If it is light chop , I 'll generally just ride it out and turn the seatbelt signs on . The first thing I 'll do if encountering moderate chop or turbulence is to query ATC and get ride reports from aircraft ahead of us and at different altitudes than us . From this information I 'll make a determination to ride it out or to request a climb/descent . If the turbulence was particularly bad , slowing down was an option , but I only came across that need a few times . Our ability to descend would often be limited by route length and fuel and major lateral deviations also depended on contingency fuel , so in some cases we had no choice but to stay in the chop . If the turbulent areas were well forecast or had lots of PIREPS , our dispatchers would sometimes route us differently . As for power adjustments , if we were n't slowing down due to aircraft limitations I would just adjust power so that maximum airspeed deviations stayed below Mmo .
1 . Money Meals are available at different prices . Most US airlines know you are n't choosing them on the basis of cuisine and pick the lowest priced meal they can get away with . Other airlines eg Emirates , Singapore compete by offering high customer services and so invest more money in better food and service . 2 . Culture Airlines which are mostly flying a home market will adapt the food to the traditions of the country . EL-AL are n't going to be serving bacon cheese-burgers and Air India used to do very good veggie curries .
The 25m tall asymmetrical pylons used in Red bull air races are made of 9 different sections , which are connected with zippers for easy removal and installation . In this image , you can see the multiple sections that make up the pylon . <URL> Interior of redbull air race pylons ; image from <URL> Airgators Team Captain , Holger Leprich , who is responsible for replacing the pylons after a hit , explains the procedure <URL> . The pylons are held up using air pressure - electronically controlled equipment at the bottom of the pylon creates a positive air pressure so that the pylon stands upright . For each competition , there are three five member pylon replacement teams ( called Airgators ) to ensure quick replacement - their current record being 67 sec . The pylon is designed to tear off in case of a hit . Once the pylon is hit , the team moves to the damaged pylons location on clearance from the race director . Once the team reaches there , a couple of guys control the electronic equipment ( and deflate the pylon , if required ) at the bottom of the pylon , while another two replace the damaged parts - they simply unzip the damaged part and zip in the new one , while the last one checks the pylon . Once the replacement is completed , the team inflates the pylon . Mission accomplished .

I 'll answer for the US . As long as there 's no official slot program , airlines can schedule however much they want to an airport , beyond what it should be capable of handling . Now that does n't mean ATC lets a free-for all happen . Hopefully , various traffic management units are on it and aware of how much demand is scheduled and already airborne into the airport/region/area that there 's too much demand , and will implement various flow control programs to moderate the volume to what can be accepted into a specific sector ( Certain airways can get super busy and require these types of actions ) , or airport . These control programs will either slow aircraft farther out from their destination , hold , or give small to longer delays on the ground , depending on how over scheduled or limitations of weather at the destination . [ Begin edit poriton ] Since the other part of the question was n't there when I first answered , I 'll answer now . Slot controls vary heavily from airport to airport . In the US , LGA , LGB , DCA , SNA , and at times JFK are slot controlled , with a few others threatened to go to slots due to how many delays they impact the system ( SFO , EWR , and ORD ) . How each airport deals with the slot allocation is different due to how they got slot controls . DCA is controlled partly through congress , LGA and SNA are restricted due to noise controls . In the US , once an airline gets a slot , often times it 's considered transferable property , so airlines can sell them to each other if needed . Now if a slot is n't used and goes back to the airport , the airport can put it up for bid , or allow applications for it , again depending on how their program is structured . AT DCA , some slots are transferable , some require an act of congress to change or modify , and some can only be used for certain routes or types of cities .

Nice question . There are several ways how to get these information . <URL> : free to use , no registration needed . World database of the airports and waypoints . From these information you could easily make DB for waypoints . EUROCONTROL EAD ( <URL> ) : free to use , registration needed . Big advantage - real and up to date information for all ECTL countries . But a bit difficult navigation . JeppView ( <URL> ) : very expensive SW , but the best in this time . You will find there all information which pilot needs . But it is not real database . Garmin for pilots ( <URL> ) : another not free SW , very similair to JeppView but lightweighted . NAVIGRAPH ( <URL> ) : Great DB of all things which you need in FMC . But I guess that they have it just for flight simulator . OpenFlights ( <URL> ) : free DB of airports , airlines and routes .

The test was carried out by the Sandia National Laboratories under terms of a contract with the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics , Inc. , of Tokyo . The <URL> : ... was to determine the impact force , versus time , due to the impact , of a complete F-4 Phantom -- including both engines -- onto a massive , essentially rigid reinforced concrete target ( 3.66 meters thick ) . The reports on the tests can be found in these places : <URL> by von Rieseman , W. A. et al.and <URL> by K. Muto et . al. . Interestingly , the aircraft used in the tests were flyable . The report notes : A flyable F4D aircraft was acquired by Sandia . The aircraft was modified slightly in order to support the aircraft at four locations with a special carriage structure . ... the aircraft weighed 12.7 tonnes ( with some avionics removed ) . The impact weight was 19 tonnes , which included ... 4.8 tonnes of water that was added to simulate the fuel weight ... The target consisted of a block of reinforced concrete 7m square and 3.66 m thick ... with a combined weight of 469 tonnes . The aircraft was crashed with the engines and <URL> : A fully functional F4 was used in the impact test.Only the gears and flaps at the main wings were partly removed and replaced by a carriage structure and sleds . This can also been in the following mass distribution diagram for the aircraft used in the test . <URL> Image from <URL> by von Rieseman , W. A. et al. . Finally , the test was for measuring the impact forces , not the strength of the wall , <URL> : At Sandia , a spokesman , John German , said the point of the test was to move the wall , as a way to measure the impact forces . ... as a preliminary step in building a computer model of such impacts , ... Mr. German said : " That test was designed to measure the impact force of a fighter jet . But the wall was not being tested . No structure was being tested . "
No , there 's no way an airliner can glide 1000km , this is because its wing is designed for fast cruising speeds , and it 's much heavier compared to the lift generated than a glider . Gliders are light and have huge wings for their weight , which means they can get lifted by powerful air currents . An airliner is not going to be able to do that . The longest glide of an airliner I know of was <URL> , which glided about 98 miles ( almost 160km ) from cruising altitude to the Azores after it ran out of fuel . The captain was an experience glider pilot . That is really about the limit . Keep in mind that there 's nothing ordinary about 1000km in a glider ! 1000km is a very long distance and you 'd need a very good glider and a very experienced pilot in just the right conditions .
There is a huge demand for aviation professionals . However , how that demand is looks like is very difficult to answer , since it 's a pretty fragmented market and getting an overview is very difficult . As such , you 're best chances of understanding it are : Going to recruitment fairs that major airlines attend . Attending events that airlines hold themselves . Trying to get in touch with human resources in an appropriate way directly . From this you should be to gauge how interesting a candidate you will be . As with most things , this is hardly an exact science . Getting a program with a placement/internship as part of the course for instance might be quite beneficial . As for the no previous experience , I think this is the case for most people heading into this area .
Based on the country you are looking for the certification , rules may be slightly changed . For India following syllabus is applicable ( Source : atcguild.com ) At present it is a year-long ab-initio training ( Under revision to make it in two sections of six months each ) Modules : Air Traffic Services Aerodromes and Ground Aids Air Legislation Meteorology Communication Procedures Technical Search and Rescue Air Navigation The selection shall be made on the basis of a Written test 50 % questions on subjects relating to educational qualifications prescribed 50 % on General Knowledge , General Intelligence , General Aptitude , English etc. . Voice test Personal Interview Medical fitness as per ICAO Annex-1 I Googled for the subject , but did n't find much information on the paper patterns or example papers .
They are searchable at FNS NOTAM search : <URL> A link is provided to a PDF , containing a link to the actual LTA . ( Filter by LTA , remember the agreement might not be with the airport , but with the ATSU , like the local TRACON/ARTCC , try searching by airport name + radius ) . Expiry date is shown in the details view .
For US ( N-reg aircraft ) , this is defined in <URL> , Operations of civil aircraft of U.S. registry outside of the United States . It says : ( a ) Each person operating a civil aircraft of U.S. registry outside of the United States shall -- ( 1 ) When over the high seas , comply with annex 2 ( Rules of the Air ) to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and with § § 91.117 ( c ) , 91.127 , 91.129 , and 91.131 ; ( 2 ) When within a foreign country , comply with the regulations relating to the flight and maneuver of aircraft there in force ; ( 3 ) Except for § § 91.117 ( a ) , 91.307 ( b ) , 91.309 , 91.323 , and 91.711 , comply with this part so far as it is not inconsistent with applicable regulations of the foreign country where the aircraft is operated or annex 2 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation ; [ ... ] That suggests that in most cases the pilot should follow the foreign ( Italian ) regulations : 91.703 ( a ) ( 2 ) says you have to follow foreign regulations on " flight and maneuver " 703 ( a ) ( 3 ) says you should ( mostly ) follow part 91 unless it 's " inconsistent " with the foreign regulations It all seems a bit vague to me , and what " inconsistent " means is probably the kind of thing that keeps lawyers busy . But also note that there are specific rules applying to operating foreign aircraft in the US . <URL> , Special rules for foreign civil aircraft , begins : ( a ) General . In addition to the other applicable regulations of this part , each person operating a foreign civil aircraft within the United States shall comply with this section . So foreign aircraft in the US are expected to follow US regulations as far as possible , which is consistent with 91.703 : an N-reg aircraft abroad follows the foreign rules as far as possible , and a foreign aircraft in the US follows US rules as far as possible . Since both the US and Italy are <URL> , I would expect Italian law to roughly mirror US law on this , although that may be a dangerous assumption . For an authoritative answer , I would ask both the FAA and the <URL> .
The FAA 's <URL> contains broad statistical information on activity in the national airspace system which can be used to get an idea of how " busy " a particular Center , TRACON , or Tower facility is . The caveat is this data only encompasses aircraft talking to Air Traffic Control , so it wo n't be able to tell you anything about uncontrolled fields except possibly what you can glean from Center/TRACON activity information for the greater area . I 'm not sure where they get their data from , but <URL> has annual reported data for each airport in their Airports &amp; FBO 's database : For example , this is for KBRY ( which is uncontrolled ) :
Per <URL> , yes . That said , you ca n't just find an open field-there may be local/state regulations regarding helicopter operations . 14 CFR 91.119 : ( 1 ) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in paragraph ( b ) or ( c ) of this section , provided each person operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA
Spoofing GPS means broadcasting a false GPS signal - This is harder than jamming GPS which can be done relatively easily by broadcasting a strong random signal at the relevent carrier frequencies . GPS receivers use GPS ephemeris tables which tell them where exactly they should expect each satellite to be . So the false GPS signal has to look enough like a real GPS signal that the receiver will accept it and use it 's transmitted data in it 's calculations . Of course , if , for example , the expansionist president of a country with advanced avionics capability decided to supply sophisticated equipment and the associated personnel to a separatist group in a neighbouring country , it might be possible for them to bring about this kind of result . There have been <URL> of this kind of spoofing actually happening , so it appears to be possible . The U of Texas students built a GPS spoofing device for about $ 3,000 . A pair of students , the " attackers , " then sat aboard the upper deck of the White Rose , where their GPS spoofer emitted a counterfeit signal slightly stronger than the real GPS signal . This was a yacht at sea , presumably out of sight of land on a featureless ocean . It may be more difficult to achieve this with an airliner , which have a variety of navigational instruments , including radio navigation beacon receivers . Inconsistent indications may alert the pilot to a problem . Non-GPS navigational instruments/systems that may be found in an aircraft include : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>
In the specific case of Canada , AOPA and COPA have a lot of information aimed at US pilots . AOPA has a <URL> on documents , customs etc. and COPA has <URL> with more information , which includes this remark : The flying rules are almost indistinguishable - reading the COPA guide should keep you legal and out of trouble . Make sure you get a Canada Flight Supplement ( CFS ) and some VNCs ( Canadian equivalent to your US sectionals ) , that will allow you to navigate VFR safely . IFR plates are available from Nav Canada as a subscription or the ( sample list of ) vendors included below . ( by mail order ) The guide is free but available to AOPA/COPA members only .
Wing sweep , incidence , and airfoil geometry will all have to be adjusted to achieve the best performance at a certain air speed , density , and Reynolds number . The software that <URL> is a good place to start . While studying aerospace in college , XFOIL was used for basic airfoil analysis in our classes . Another program used was <URL> . This analyzes the aircraft as a whole and can model other things such as dynamic stability . I 'm glad that XPlane was also mentioned , even though I would n't consider it the most scientific tool for testing wing geometry . It is an interesting way to test configurations since it does use the airplane geometry to simulate the performance characteristics . In order to consider more variables such as sweep , dihedral , and different airfoils over the wingspan , computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) software is used . ANSYS Fluent is one example . There are many other packages out there , and anyone doing serious commercial airfoil design will have proprietary software and methods for this . Of course , even in the days of supercomputers and CFD , wind tunnel testing is still very important . Scale models can be tested to validate the computer models and demonstrate performance . As far as requirements , they can get very complicated . For aircraft , of course , the primary goal is to provide the lowest drag at cruise conditions . However , many other factors include : Preventing <URL> Provide room for sufficient supporting structure Provide room for fuel Methods to manufacture the shape Good stall characteristics No bad aerodynamics with fuselage and engines Enough lift with flaps for low landing speed Able to accommodate flaps , slats , spoilers , and ailerons Tip treatment like winglets/raked tips Wingspan must fit into available space ( airport , hangar , aircraft carrier , etc. ) And probably many more . Of course , the air speed and conditions will also affect the fuselage , empennage ( tail ) and its control surfaces , and engines , so this will also be taken into account .
Yes . <URL> To be eligible for a flight instructor certificate with a sport pilot rating you must : ( a ) Be at least 18 years old . ( b ) Be able to read , speak , write , and understand English . If you can not read , speak , write , and understand English because of medical reasons , the FAA may place limits on your certificate as are necessary for the safe operation of light-sport aircraft . ( c ) Hold at least a sport pilot certificate with category and class ratings or privileges , as applicable , that are appropriate to the flight instructor privileges sought . A CFI never needs a medical certificate . It is not required for the operation of that certificate . A medical certificate may be required if the CFI has additional roles . For example , the CFI also is acting as the legal pilot in command . A sport pilot acting as the legal pilot in command does not need a medical . <URL> ( b ) Operations not requiring a medical certificate . A person is not required to hold a medical certificate -- ( 1 ) When exercising the privileges of a student pilot certificate while seeking -- ( i ) A sport pilot certificate with glider or balloon privileges ; or ( ii ) A pilot certificate with a glider category rating or balloon class rating ; ( 2 ) When exercising the privileges of a sport pilot certificate with privileges in a glider or balloon ; ( 3 ) When exercising the privileges of a pilot certificate with a glider category rating or balloon class rating in a glider or a balloon , as appropriate ; ( 4 ) When exercising the privileges of a flight instructor certificate with -- ( i ) A sport pilot rating in a glider or balloon ; or ( ii ) A glider category rating ; ( 5 ) When exercising the privileges of a flight instructor certificate if the person is not acting as pilot in command or serving as a required pilot flight crewmember ; ( 6 ) When exercising the privileges of a ground instructor certificate ; To answer your questions . A sport pilot or CFI will never need a medical because the operation does not require a medical but a valid driver 's license . A glider pilot or CFI never needs a medical or drivers license , if I am reading the regulation correctly . A sport CFI does not require a CPL as does a regular CFI . The CPL requirement is found under part 61 subpart H Subpart H -- Flight Instructors Other than Flight Instructors With a Sport Pilot Rating § 61.183 Eligibility requirements . To be eligible for a flight instructor certificate or rating a person must : ( c ) Hold either a commercial pilot certificate or airline transport pilot certificate with : But subpart H specifies Other than Flight Instructors With a Sport Pilot Rating . The rules for sport CFI are found in subpart K where no such requirement is found . ( see 61.403 above ) It does not relieve the pilot or CFI from adhering to <URL> though .
Heathrow is somewhat of a standout when it comes to volume . Your wording , that LHR " gets by " with 2 runways is apt . By movements , it is the busiest 2-runway airport in the world . By passenger volume it is second only to Dubai Intl. ( Note , though , that DXB is home to Emirates , who has the world 's largest fleet of A380 's . They are the only airport that averages over 200 passengers per movement ! ) Aircraft movement is the best way to look at it from a runway usage standpoint . The following chart is sorted by aircraft movement . * <URL> As you can see , the top 3 all have 5 or more runways . There are 7 large airports with 5 or more rwys and they all fall in the top 16 . The top 16 is rounded out by 5 airports with 4 runways , one with 3 runways and ... LHR . The next 2-rwy airport on the list is Benito Juarez Intl. in Mexico City clear down at 21st on the list . Any busy airport with 2 runways has to make those runways work as tightly as possible with little room for error . Otherwise they end up with delays . If I sort the list by movements per rwy , all of those with 2 rwys rise to the top . 10 of the top 15 have 2 rwys . <URL> So , how does LHR pull it off ? How do they manage to pack all those flights in to just two runways?There 's a downside to handling that kind of volume with so few runways . The following collage gives a clue as to what that is . <URL> Those are just a random pick of arrivals at a couple of random times yesterday morning at LHR . There was no significant weather at the times . As you can see , you just do n't arrive at LHR without being put in a holding stack . Every single flight I could find had to do at least one racetrack . At any point during the day , in places like Chesham , Effingham and Brentwood , if you look up there will be as many as 6 or 7 aircraft doing racetracks waiting to be cleared into Heathrow . That makes for very efficient runway usage when there are 20 planes waiting in line , but it 's terribly inefficient for the airlines and passengers to have to spend so much time burning fuel circling around London . On the flip side , building more runways has a down side too . It will get the planes out of the air quicker , but , as happens at Schipol - which has 6 runways - you can end up with a long taxi back to the terminal . All data was taken from Wikipedia .
You can find much of this sort of information at <URL> For example , searching for <URL> lists their fleet , and clicking the number of active for a model ( eg <URL> ) will list the tail number and other interesting information . From there you can click a <URL> for all the information along with a picture .
What you are proposing is called a " tandem wing " , and it 's been done before . A brief search should produce more than enough research papers about the advantages and disadvantages of this particular design . The near-complete absence of multiple-wing designs in modern aviation should be a hint that the design has issues . Unless you particularly need the advantages of the design more than the drawbacks , there 's no particular reason to use it .
I have both US and Australian PPLs , and having flown VFR in both countries , there are some real differences in the VFR charts and supplemental data available . Mostly the contents are fairly evident but if you are unfamiliar with a specific type of VFR chart , it is important to look over the chart in detail to make sure you understand it . The US publishes VFR charts known as <URL> . These cover the entire country , including non-continental areas like Hawaii . IMHO these are excellent although in busy airspace , the 1:500,000 scale can become complex . So pilots learning to fly in the US usually become familiar with the sectional covering their base field , and then with that understanding , can look at sectionals for anywhere else in the US . Printed sectionals can also be used for long range VFR flight planning as they can be laid out in sequence and routes plotted across adjoining chart boundaries . For online chart examination , <URL> publishes all US sectionals online , which is a great resource . Australia does not publish sectionals covering the whole country . It 's a good question as to why but essentially the centre of the country is a big desert where few people live . So from a historical perspective , the inner part of the country has been regarded as " remote " and thus less in need of highly detailed maps . In addition , the word ' sectional ' is n't even in Australian pilot lexicon , so use the word ' chart ' instead . Australia publishes Visual Terminal Charts ( VTC ) for each large metropolitan area which are a Mercator projection at 1:250,000 . And there are Visual Navigational Charts ( VNC ) which mostly encapsulate the VTCs and are at 1:500,000 ( same as sectionals ) . The image below is an example of the Brisbane VTC . <URL> As VTC/VNCs cover only largely populated areas , for printed chart long VFR route planning , you will need to revert to the World Aeronautical Charts ( WACs ) , pronounced ' whacks ' . <URL> WACs started as an ICAO project after WW2 to transition from the existing US-based international wartime series and so all Allied nations were effectively asked to harmonize their maps with a US design . But in 2015 , the FAA <URL> and thus a recently US-trained VFR PPL would never have heard of them ( ! ) The US WAC coverage looked like this : <URL> WACs are a Lambert projection at 1:1,000,000 and in Australia , printed chart VFR route planning would be done over sequential WAC 's , with likely a supplemental VNC chart for the populated areas to be crossed . WAC 's do not contain airspace ( although supposedly an aeronautical chart ! ) . They are essentially a topo map with features that are easy to spot from the air . <URL> So , to answer the OP 's question - no , there are no free online sources for Australian government produced charts . SkyVector shows a very data sparse US Sectional-like view of Australia but I would n't use it for anything other than simple distance/leg planning . However , all of the previously mentioned chart types for Australia are now encapsulated and adjoined in a single app known as OzRunways . I have no association with them , other than being a customer . Another answer has also referred to this as well . OzRunways works on both iOS and Android and in my experience seems very widely used amongst Australian VFR pilots . For VFR use , they provide a so-called ' Hybrid VFR Map ' which simply uses the most detailed chart available . Price at time of writing is about AUD $ 100 and chart-wise also has New Zealand and Papua New Guinea . But also of value to pilots flying in Australia , there is comprehensive airfield information available in the ERSA ( EnRoute Supplement Australia ) , which is a <URL> . It lists technical aspects/refueling contacts/etc . for every sizeable airfield in Australia . In addition to this , AOPA also publish a pilot guide for various airfields . OzRunways contains the ERSA and for an extra amount , they also will bundle the pilot 's guide . I would value any other comments about VFR chart sources for Australia but hopefully this is a good overview .

What are the experience requirements and process for becoming an FAA Designated Pilot Examiner ?
You can start with the FAA 's reference page for <URL> . It will point you to the FAA <URL> General Aviation Airman Designee Handbook . It 's all there . You 'll need to talk to your local Flight Standards District Office ( FSDO ) as they are responsible for administering the program . The general eligibility requirements are : General Eligibility Requirements . The managing office must carefully consider all of the requirements before designating an applicant or renewing a designee . The general requirements for appointment , which are reviewed by the NEB , are : a. Minimum Age . Minimum age of 23 years for all designees . b. Personality Traits . Must exhibit integrity , professionalism , and sound judgment . c. Training Requirement . Must have satisfactorily completed the applicable training requirement before appointment/renewal as a designee . d. Knowledge of Guidance Materials . Must have access to , and adequate knowledge of , the current regulations , policies , directives , and related guidance material appropriate to authorized functions . e. Command of English Language . Must be able to fluently read , write , speak , and understand the English language . f. Objectivity . Must maintain the highest degree of objectivity while performing authorized functions . g. Good Record . Must have a good record in the aviation industry . h. Technology Access . Must have internet access , as well as access to a computer and printer with hardware/software sufficient to support the required activities . Note : A designee is not required to be a U.S. citizen . Note : Additional eligibility requirements for specific designee types are included in the applicable designee type specific chapters ( Chapters 6 and 7 ) of this order . As to what the FAA is looking for ( this from a DPE , I used to work with ) , the FAA is looking for someone they can trust to perform the job to standards . They expect a DPE candidate to be an experienced instructor . They 'll look at the the history of students signed off for check rides by that person . If any significant number of recommended students are n't passing check rides or ' just squeak by ' , it wo n't reflect favorably on the applicant . OTOH , if the recommended students are well prepared and almost always pass , that 's a good indication . That shows the instructor 's standards are the same as the FAA 's . ' Openings ' for DPE positions are driven by supply and demand . The purpose of any Designee is to help manage the workload imposed on the FAA 's office . If the office can handle the number of applicant 's , they wo n't add a DPE . And if an existing DPE is n't performing a minimum of examinations , they 'll lose the Designation . Most of the DPEs I 've known worked for flight schools where there was a steady stream of students .
My experience transitioning from airplanes to helicopters and then to gliders is that I never forget what I 'm flying . I know that sounds obvious , but its no different than the difference between driving a car with automatic transmission and manual , riding a motorcycle which has all the controls in a different place than a car and <URL> , and flying an airplane . I do n't reach for the throttle when I want to slow down in a car , and I do n't turn the wheel in the direction of the turn when I 'm riding a motorcycle . Similarly , when taking off in an airplane , I know I have to add power and pull back a bit to get it off the ground , and in a helicopter I inch the nose forward to gain <URL> . The reason I do n't act/react improperly when flying different aircraft is that it 's all been trained into my muscle memory to do the right thing depending on the circumstances . I do n't think of the horn in a helicopter as a stall horn , just like the buzzer in my alarm clock and smoke alarm are not stall horns . The horn in the heli is a low-rpm horn , and I ease the stick back not forward . Another complication is instrument flight . Although I am an instrument rated airplane pilot , I have a little hood time in a helicopter . I 'm so used to flying pitch and power against the AI that all my instincts under the hood in the heli were completely wrong . Nevertheless , I do n't think I 'll ultimately have any trouble flying instruments well in a heli .
The following includes the changes you allude to ( which were proposed in <URL> on June 30 , 2011 ) . Commercial Flights Per ICAO Annex 6 , Part I , section 4.3.6 " Fuel Requirements , " airplanes should calculate their required fuel quantity as follows ( summary ; see below for actual ICAO text ) : Taxi fuel Trip fuel ( to reach intended destination ) Contingency fuel ( higher of 5 % of " trip fuel " or 5 minutes of holding flight ) Destination alternate fuel ( to fly a missed and reach an alternate ) Final reserve fuel ( 45 minutes of holding flight for reciprocating engines , 30 minutes for jets ) Additional fuel ( if needed to guarantee ability to reach an alternate with an engine failure or at lower altitude due to a pressurization loss ) Discretionary fuel ( if the pilot in command wants it ) General Aviation For general aviation , ICAO Annex 6 Part II , section 2.2.3.6 " Fuel and oil supply " requires : For IFR , enough fuel to reach destination , then alternate ( if required ) , plus 45 minutes For day VFR , enough fuel to reach destination plus 30 minutes For night VFR , enough fuel to reach destination plus 45 minutes ICAO Annex 6 Part I From the <URL> : 4.3.6.3 The pre-flight calculation of usable fuel required shall include : a ) taxi fuel , which shall be the amount of fuel expected to be consumed before take-off ; b ) trip fuel , which shall be the amount of fuel required to enable the aeroplane to fly from take-off , or the point of in-flight re-planning , until landing at the destination aerodrome taking into account the operating conditions of 4.3.6.2 b ) ; c ) contingency fuel , which shall be the amount of fuel required to compensate for unforeseen factors . It shall be five per cent of the planned trip fuel or of the fuel required from the point of in-flight re-planning based on the consumption rate used to plan the trip fuel but , in any case , shall not be lower than the amount required to fly for five minutes at holding speed at 450 m ( 1 500 ft ) above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions ; Note . -- Unforeseen factors are those which could have an influence on the fuel consumption to the destination aerodrome , such as deviations of an individual aeroplane from the expected fuel consumption data , deviations from forecast meteorological conditions , extended taxi times before take-off , and deviations from planned routings and/or cruising levels . d ) destination alternate fuel , which shall be : where a destination alternate aerodrome is required , the amount of fuel required to enable the aeroplane to : i ) perform a missed approach at the destination aerodrome ; ii ) climb to the expected cruising altitude ; iii ) fly the expected routing ; iv ) descend to the point where the expected approach is initiated ; and v ) conduct the approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome ; or where two destination alternate aerodromes are required , the amount of fuel , as calculated in 4.3.6.3 d ) 1 ) , required to enable the aeroplane to proceed to the destination alternate aerodrome which requires the greater amount of alternate fuel ; or where a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome , the amount of fuel required to enable the aeroplane to fly for 15 minutes at holding speed at 450 m ( 1 500 ft ) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions ; or where the aerodrome of intended landing is an isolated aerodrome : i ) for a reciprocating engine aeroplane , the amount of fuel required to fly for 45 minutes plus 15 per cent of the flight time planned to be spent at cruising level , including final reserve fuel , or two hours , whichever is less ; or ii ) for a turbine-engined aeroplane , the amount of fuel required to fly for two hours at normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome , including final reserve fuel ; e ) final reserve fuel , which shall be the amount of fuel calculated using the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome , or the destination aerodrome when no destination alternate aerodrome is required : for a reciprocating engine aeroplane , the amount of fuel required to fly for 45 minutes , under speed and altitude conditions specified by the State of the Operator ; or for a turbine-engined aeroplane , the amount of fuel required to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 450 m ( 1 500 ft ) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions ; f ) additional fuel , which shall be the supplementary amount of fuel required if the minimum fuel calculated in accordance with 4.3.6.3 b ) , c ) , d ) and e ) is not sufficient to : allow the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurization , whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route ; i ) fly for 15 minutes at holding speed at 450 m ( 1 50
The differences are surprisingly small , and the implications of two versus four engines are not very great as far as design of the wing is concerned . Weight implications The wing is an immensely strong structure - after all , it 's able to bear the weight of the entire aircraft , including of course the engines . Engines are heavy , but only a small fraction of the weight of the whole aircraft . A similar aircraft with four engines rather than two will have smaller engines , so the total weight difference will not be large . Space implications You need more space to fit two engines on each side , but not a vast amount . For example , the <URL> has four remarkably small <URL> engines . What 's more , four small engines can be easier to mount , because they need less ground clearance . Same wings , more engines In practice , it 's not very difficult to add engines to a wing ( for aircraft companies , that is ; I do n't think I 'd be able to do it without seeing someone do it first at least once ) . For example , <URL> - obviously , this engine is just being carried , not used , but it shows that simply placing the engine there does n't present insurmountable aerodynamic or other engineering difficulties . And then we have the Airbus <URL> / <URL> , designed and built in parallel , which are essentially the same aircraft - same fuselage and same wing - one with two engines and one with four . ( Actually the -500 and -600 A340 variants do have slightly longer wings , but that 's because they are heavier , and nothing to do with the additional engines . ) That 's not to say that there are no implications in having additional engines . In this case , wing flutter caused by the outboard engines of the A340 required some stiffening . And of course , additional engines will require additional fuel and control lines . However , these are n't part of the structure of the wing itself , and are not in themselves likely to have implications for it .
There are plenty of great $ 20,000 aircraft out there - the hard part is finding them . " What to look for " is an incredibly broad question , and varies substantially between different types of aircraft : You would not look for the same things on a Piper Comanche as you would on a Cessna 182 . Accordingly the first thing you want to do is find a mechanic who is an expert in the particular type of aircraft to help you check it out and do a " pre-purchase inspection " . Finding those mechanics is actually pretty easy : Look for a " type club " that supports the aircraft you 're considering and ask them for recommendations ( e.g. for a Cessna <URL> , for a Cirrus <URL> , for most Piper aircraft <URL> , for Beechcraft <URL> , etc. . Talk to folks on those forums ( and to your mechanic ) about what you , as a buyer , should be looking at before you get the mechanic involved for the more detailed inspection . There are lots of things you as a pilot ( even a student pilot ) can determine just by looking at a plane ( and/or the logbooks ) . Some key items to look at before you go see the plane : NTSB Records <URL> go to the NTSB site ( or the equivalent if you 're not in the USA ) and search for accident records . Not every accident will show up in the database , but sometimes you 'll find out that the cream puff aircraft being advertised has actually been " substantially damaged " in an accident . The NTSB database search is free and there 's no reason not to do it . Logbooks All aircraft have logs , so if possible get a copy of them before you even go to look at the plane . Read through the logs ( yes , all of them ) : You 'll find all sorts of interesting things in there , but what you 're mainly looking for is good , consistent maintenance and regular use of the aircraft . As a secondary concern you 're looking for major repairs ( or significant minor ones ) that you might want to ask your mechanic about . FAA Records You can <URL> online for a small fee . This includes registration information and any records of major repairs/alterations ( " Form 337 " ) filed for the aircraft . It is generally an " interesting subset " of the logs . This is something you 'll want to have handy when your mechanic looks at the plane , though it 's not something you need to have before you go look at it yourself . Theoretically the owner should have all the documents that this record contains as part of their records/logbooks , but in practice paperwork sometimes gets " lost " . If all that looks good it 's time to look at the plane : How is the overall condition of the aircraft ? Cosmetics can lie , so do n't be dazzled by a shiny coat of paint and a nice interior : Is the on-board paperwork ( ARROW ) all in order ? Are the tires , hoses , and other rubber components in good condition ? Is the engine bay ( relatively ) clean ? Are there any leaks , drips , or other items of concern ? Are there obvious signs of damage ( skin patches , dents , fabric tears , etc. ) ? Are there obvious signs of corrosion ( bubbles under the paint , etc. ) ? Is the paint in overall good condition ( no major chips , no cracks , no flaking ) ? Is the aircraft itself clean ? ( As much as cosmetics lie , a plane that looks like it 's been neglected probably has been ... ) Does the aircraft pass a very thorough preflight ? Go through the preflight checklist with an eye for anything abnormal -- ask yourself " Would I fly this aircraft today ? " . If the answer is no , think carefully about why . If the answer is yes it may be time to test-fly with the current owner . Does the aircraft operate correctly on the test flight ? Do the engine and propeller operate properly ? Do all the instruments and avionics function correctly ? Does the aircraft fly well ? Can you trim for hands-off straight and level flight ? If the aircraft passes all your checks it 's time to turn your mechanic loose on it - they will inspect the aircraft for problems ( major and minor ) that you as a pilot might not notice which can wind up costing you a lot of money . This pre-purchase inspection ( and the ensuing negotiation based on what the mechanic finds ) is usually the last stop before handing over your money and taking the keys .
Why more experience is required to fly the airliner above I assume 6096 meters ? I would expect , taking off and flying close to terrain should need more experience . I 'm unaware of any regulation that requires a minimum number of hours to be a captain or first officer above FL200 . That does n't mean there are n't such , just that I do n't know of them . It 's not that that taking off and flying close to terrain requires more or less experience , but that safely operating at high altitude typically involves a different set of knowledge and experience than operating at low altitude . A seasoned bush pilot who does only that would be ill equipped to suddenly become the captain of a 747 at 35,000 feet , just as the 747 captain who had never been a bush pilot would be ill equipped to scud run through a valley to land on a remote airstrip . Part of the difference between two such pilots is , of course , a matter of a propeller airplane versus a jet , a slow airplane versus a fast , and the differing complexities of their aircraft . In addition to those differences , though , the environment that they typically operate in and indeed the altitude itself makes things different . The nature of the emergencies they can possibly face are also different . Offhand I can think of three things the typical low altitude pilot does n't have to contend with that the high altitude pilot does . There are certainly more . Oxygen considerations , in other words what you need to do if you suddenly do n't have it at a breathable pressure . Probably never going to happen , but the high altitude pilot trains for it . Regular operation in or close to the coffin corner . If you 're unfamiliar with the term , <URL> has a reasonable explanation as well as <URL> . A whole different situational awareness environment than the low altitude pilot . For example , I used to do a flight from Sao Paulo to Miami . Two other carriers had flights scheduled that went out immediately before us , also 747s . Everybody was always heavy , which meant the first guy out got the highest cruise altitude available for the weight we were all at approximately , the second guy 2,000 feet below that , and then us sucking fuel 4,000 feet lower than the first . However , I knew that if I could open up the distance between myself and the second guy , I could get a clearance through the second guy 's altitude to the first guy 's altitude since there was enough time/distance between us . So what I would do was to climb at best angle rather than best rate . Then , if the weather was good ( i.e. no turbulence ) and I had the engines for it , it took very little fuel burn before I would able to get 2,000 feet higher if I was willing to accept slightly lesser protection from the top of the coffin corner . Sometimes that would work out , sometimes not , but it always got us at least up to the first guy 's altitude . And on rare occasions , it meant we reached Miami before either of the other two .
Typically , the checklists in normal operations are : External walk around and preflight Before start Before taxi Before take-off After take-off Cruise Descent Approach Landing Shutdown Secure This list is pretty much the same for all aircraft . Normally , each checklist is only used once at the appropriate time but a wise pilot would re-run a checklist if interrrupted . For example , you are cleared to start and complete the before start checklist but there is then an unexpected delay before you actually start . You wait for 30 minutes . No need to redo the before start checklist because you did it earlier ? No , do it again . Something might have changed .
The FAA <URL> contains the guidance for Aviation Training Devices , including the BATD 's . The AC states that as long as the system has been FAA approved by the manufacturer ( and in your case you say that it " meets the FAA requirements " ) , that no specific approval is required for training conducted under 14 CFR 61 . For use under 14 CFR 141 however , you would need specific FAA approval ( see below ) . 14 CFR 61 Approval You must simply follow the conditions specified in the AC : 5 . APPROVAL OF BATD FOR USE UNDER PART 61 . To be approved for use for pilot training and certification under part 61 , a BATD should : a. Be capable of providing procedural training in all elements for which it is to be used . Those elements should be specified in an acceptable training curriculum or as specifically authorized by the FAA and meet the description and suggested criteria outlined in this appendix . b. Have the following documents available for inspection by the student and instructor : The list of ATD components as required by paragraph 3c , A copy of AFS-800 's letter of approval and authorized use of the ATD , and A copy of the QAG for the ATD being used . c. Successfully pass the start-up self-test described in paragraph 8c ( 2 ) . If the device is being used in a course of training for a pilot certificate or rating , a person authorized by the FAA to provide ground or flight instruction should observe this test . After the ATD self-test is complete , no other software of any kind may be started on the computer running the ATD software . d. Remain in the approved configuration during the training session . Authorized ATD instruction may not proceed after a malfunction of the ATD system has occurred . The operator must correct the ATD malfunction and repeat the start-up test described in paragraph c of this section before resuming authorized instruction . In addition , a BATD may be used in a training curriculum that provides for : A similar scope and content of a syllabus that is used under part 141 ; Instructional materials for flight events ; A means of showing progress , such as an outline of stage ( phase ) checks and criterion levels of performance ; and The authorized use as approved in the AFS-800 letter of approval . 14 CFR 141 Approval 141 Approval is almost the same , but must be approved by the school 's POI ( principle operations inspector ) : 6 . APPROVAL OF BATD FOR USE UNDER PART 141 . Local FSDO may approve BATDs as part of an overall part 141 curriculum approval and certification process . Pilot schools that want to use a BATD as part of their training curriculum must notify their principal operations inspector ( POI ) . The POI is responsible for approving how the BATD is to be used in the certificate holder 's part 141 curriculum . To be approved for use under part 141 , a BATD should : a. Be capable of providing training in all elements in which it will be used , as specified in the syllabus , and meet the description and suggested criteria outlined in this appendix . b. Have the following documents available for inspection by the student and instructor : The list of ATD components required in paragraph 3c , A copy of AFS-800 's letter of approval and authorized use of the ATD , and A copy of the QAG for the ATD being used . c. Successfully pass the start-up self-test described in paragraph 8c of this appendix . A person authorized by the FAA to provide ground or flight instruction should observe this test . After the ATD self-test is complete , no other software of any kind may be started on the computer running the ATD software . d. Remain in the approved configuration during the training session . Authorized ATD instruction may not proceed after a malfunction of the ATD system has occurred . The operator must correct the ATD malfunction and repeat the start-up test described in paragraph c of this section before resuming authorized instruction . e. Be used in an integrated ground and flight training curriculum which provides for : The scope and content of a curriculum in compliance with part 141 , The authorized use as approved in the AFS-800 letter of approval , Instructional materials for flight events , and An outline of stage ( phase ) checks and criterion levels of performance .
There are no major differences between a turboprop used on an airplane and a turboshaft used on an helicopter . All power is collected by the turbine shaft which rotates the blades through a gearbox . An example of a gas turbine used in helicopter , airplane , train , and even snowplow is the well-known <URL> . It has different versions . The two versions shown below are the PT6A for a propeller ( top ) , and the PT6B for an helicopter ( bottom , with a large gearbox ) . Each sub-family has variant for different powers . ( <URL> ) ( <URL> ) On the two images , from right to left : The accessory box powered by the compressor section , the air intake recognizable by its filter , the compressor ( not visible ) , the combustion chamber ( yellow color on the bottom image ) with its circle of igniters , the turbine ( not visible ) , the exhaust ( the big hole , best visible on the bottom image ) , the power gearbox with different output shafts . There are different types for aero-engines , including turbojet , turbofan , turboprop and turboshaft ( I exclude the ramjet which is not used in civilian aviation ) . All types are based on a <URL> , but the way the turbine participates to the motion is different . ( <URL> ) While airplanes use all types , helicopters can not use the jet action/reaction principle ( tip jet excluded for simplification ) . The gas turbine can be the same for turboshaft and turboprop engines , but will be fitted with appropriate elements : The rotational speed of the shaft will be adjusted to accommodate the rotor or the propeller . This is done using a gear reduction system . An helicopter rotor turns slower than an airplane propeller . Air intake and exhaust are adapted . It rather common to have the air intake on the opposite side of the power output shaft . For a pulling propeller , this means the intake will be aft , and air must be collected forward and ducted to the engine intake . The power output shaft is usually used to bear the propeller tension caused by the lift , while on an helicopter , the rotor tension is borne by the frame . The accessory box is usually powered by the compressor side of the engine . A turboshaft do n't provide the bleed air extraction , there is no cabin pressurization required . ( <URL> ) Gas turbines used in both cases are frequently <URL> , where the compressor section and the turbine ( power ) section rotate independently of each other . This allows to produce electricity or hydraulic power on the ground without turning the blades .
If you 're asking whether you can pay for one with an HSA or FSA , then yes , <URL> , though consult with your insurance provider first if they are covered by your plan . Physical Examination You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for an annual physical examination and diagnostic tests by a physician . You do not have to be ill at the time of the examination . If you 're looking to add it to a list of itemized deductions , as Pondlife explained , it generally has to be <URL> . If you are a professional pilot , then this is deductible . What Can I Deduct ? To be deductible , a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary . An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry . A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business . An expense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary .
As @Pondlife states , this will depend on each member state 's implementation of the EASA rules but I would expect that the implementations would be similar -- otherwise what is the point of EASA ? ( That would be a good question except it would no doubt be closed as being too " opinion based " . ) I 've added a link to the relevant UK documentation and marked this as a Community Wiki answer so that hopefully others can expand on this for other states and perhaps add personal experiences . UK <URL> Section 4 , Part Q deals with " Validation and Conversion of Non-EASA licences issued by States other than the UK " .
Two things : <URL> . This can be alleviated by carefully touching down , but you never know what exactly will happen in the next landing , so better do n't count on it to be smooth Deceleration distance : The higher mass requires a higher approach and touch down speed ( higher by the square root of the mass ratio between your actual mass and the maximum certified landing mass ) . Now you have more mass and more speed , but the landing strip and the airliner 's brakes are still the same . The risk is that you overshoot the runway with an airplane full of fuel or that you overheat the brakes ( which will result in their failure , and again an overshoot ) . Since the kinetic energy is proportional to mass times speed squared , the energy which needs to be absorbed by the brake goes up with the square of the mass increase . If the selected runway for your overweight landing is long enough and the weather is calm ( so a smooth landing is easier ) , an overweight landing is not such a problem . Now let 's look at the 777-300ER in detail . I use the figures from <URL> , because the <URL> is trying much harder to hide the relevant data . The MTOW ( maximum take-off weight , which is actually a mass ) is 351,534 kg , and the maximum landing weight is 251,290 kg , about 100 tons less . Now let 's assume that <URL> and returning to the airfield uses 5 tons of fuel , so the mass ratio is 1.379 . Therefore , the approach speed has to be 17.4 % higher and the total kinetic energy at touchdown is higher by a factor of 1.9 compared to the case at maximum allowable landing weight . If we now assume that speed is reduced linearly during the landing run and that the wheel brakes will just absorb as much energy over time as in the case at maximum landing weight , the deceleration needs to be lower by the mass ratio , so the aircraft decelerates with only 72.5 % of the deceleration at maximum landing weight . To shed its kinetic energy , the landing run will take longer by the increase in kinetic energy , i.e. 1.9 . Since the average speed is also higher by 17.4 % , the landing distance will be higher by a factor of 2.233 or 223 % of the landing distance at maximum landing weight . This neglects that the heating of the brakes is an instationary process , so you can not simply brake with the same intensity for more than twice the time they were designed for . But this little estimation should illuminate what impact a higher landing mass has on the energy and distance involved .
The FAA Hierarchy is your typical government bureaucracy - you can escalate your way through it like most others : Local Level Your point of contact for all things FAA will typically be a local <URL> -- for most things you would start with the Flight Standards District Office ( FSDO ) unless you know specifically that your issue falls into the domain of another office ( like Aircraft Certification or Manufacturing ) . If you ca n't work out the issue with the local folks at your FSDO you can try moving laterally and contacting someone from the FAA Safety Team at the FSDO ( they may not be able to change anything , but they may be able to help get you a better explanation of why things are being interpreted the way they are , and give you a voice on the inside ) . Regional Level Each district office is contained within a region , and each region has a regional administrator . The regional administrator 's office would be your next point of escalation . As with the District Offices <URL> , and if you are able to convince the regional administrator 's office that the district office has made an error and their interpretation is inconsistent with published FAA guidance you may be able to get the local interpretation overruled . National Level Your next step would be the appropriate <URL> -- for most stuff it would be the Aviation Safety office ( AVS ) , and <URL> you probably want to avail yourself of the <URL> which exists to bring some standardization to what has traditionally been the the inside joke of " There 's nothing standard about Flight Standards ! " -- If a local FSDO is operating contrary to published guidance in <URL> or an Advisory Circular these folks can set them right . There are separate national offices that deal with Air Traffic and Airports which may also be useful contacts if you have incidents with those divisions . The Big Legal Hammer When all else fails and you need a legal interpretation to tell the entire FAA " This is what the language in 14CFR means , and this is how it must be interpreted . " your point of contact is <URL> . These are the folks you contact if you have a specific question about how to interpret the FARs that you ca n't answer concretely from an Advisory Circular , or when you have contradictory interpretations from different parts of the FAA ( dueling FSDOs ) that you ca n't resolve through the other channels . An interpretation by the counsel 's office is binding on the entire FAA organization , and as you climb the ladder there 's an increasing chance that the folks you talk to will involve the lawyers at the counsel 's office . In practice the regional level is often skipped - particularly given the Consistency and Standardization Initiative at the national level : It is often more efficient to escalate directly to a group solely charged with making sure the national standards are consistently applied . As you climb the bureaucratic ladder the chances of someone involving the FAA 's lawyers for a final legal interpretation increases : a motivated employee who thinks they 're right may refer the matter to the counsel 's office and copy you on the request ( or you could get fed up and do the same ) . Once you reach the point of an interpretation from the Office of the Chief Counsel you 've climbed as high in the bureaucracy as you can - an unfavorable interpretation by the FAA lawyers can only be challenged by bringing in lawyers of your own and hashing it out in court . Because the US court system has <URL> the chances of winning such a case are not good unless the interpretation of the agency is entirely unreasonable or the application can be proven " arbitrary and capricious " based on other similar cases .
This is a marketing distinction -- generally applied to a major GA reliever airport designed to serve light/business jets in <URL> B-II and C-II or perhaps C-III . This is distinguished from general purpose GA relievers as a light GA reliever may be designed to service a maximum design category of A-II , B-I , or B-II ; it is also distinguished from County , Municipal , or Regional airports as while they are similarly sized in terms of design category , a County , Municipal , or Regional airport is the primary airport for that area as opposed to being a reliever for a larger scheduled service airport .
Day and Night for Pilots As pilots we often talk about night flying and daytime flying meaning when it is dark or light , but for logging time and for currency there are specific definitions that we must pay attention to . FAR 1.1 General Definitions Night means the time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight , as published by the American Air Almanac , converted to local time . Day is not defined in the FARs but the definition of night implies that it is the time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight . The Air Almanac is published annually on CD-ROM but you can find sunset , sunrise , and civil twilight times for specific locations at the US Naval Observatory website . The time between sunrise/sunset and twilight is 26-30 minutes depending on the time of year . Since you can easily find sunrise/sunset information in newspapers , the weather channel , etc. you can estimate twilight fairly easily . Currency § 61.57 ( b ) ( 1 ) ... no person may act as pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise , unless within the preceding 90 days that person has made at least three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise , and ... VFR Weather Minimums Only Class G airspace has different minimums depending on night and day and they use the standard night definition -- end of evening twilight to the beginning of morning twilight . Aircraft Lights Aircraft lighting is required between sunset and sunrise . § 91.209 During the period between sunset and sunrise no person may 1 . operate an aircraft unless it has lighted position lights , 2 . park or move an aircraft in an area of an airport where night operations are being conducted unless it is clearly illuminated , has position lights , or is in an area marked by obstruction lights . Aeronautical Experience Requirement In order to obtain a private pilot certificate night training is required . The commercial pilot certificate requires solo night flights . In these cases the standard night definition -- end of evening twilight to the beginning of morning twilight -- applies . Special VFR AIM 4-4-6 g. Special VFR operations are prohibited between sunset and sunrise unless the pilot is instrument rated and the aircraft equipped for IFR flight . Logging Night Flying Time Logging of night flight should be made in accordance with Part 1 definitions , which is from the end of evening civil twilight to the start of morning civil twilight . This differs from the definition used for night currency . Summary Position lights -- sunset to sunrise Special VFR -- sunrise to sunset unless instrument rated Carry Passengers -- 1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before Everything else -- twilight to twilight
Where can the requirements for US aircraft registration be found ? The registration procedure is outlined in <URL> . See also the <URL> . 3 . The owner of an aircraft must apply to the Aircraft Registration Branch , P.O. Box 25504 , Oklahoma City , Oklahoma 73125-0504 , to obtain a certificate of registration . The applicant must submit an Aircraft Registration Application , AC Form 8050-1 , accompanied by evidence of ownership and a $ 5 registration fee . Requirements for registration of aircraft are contained in the <URL> ( For sale by the Superintendent of Documents , U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , DC 20402 . ) Basically , the registrant ( whether an individual or a corporation , trustee , etc. , all of which are defined in Part 47 ) must be able to prove legal ownership of the airplane . What is the penalty for flying an aircraft without a valid registration ? The violator would be subject to any of the <URL> : administrative action ( a " Warning Notice " or " Letter of Correction " which goes on your record ) , reexamination ( " 709 ride " ) , certification action ( suspension or revocation ) , or civil/criminal penalties . The exact penalty would likely depend on the circumstances : whether the violation was intentional and the degree of the pilot 's negligence under the FARs . What should someone do if they believe an aircraft to be operating without valid registration , and how could they determine this ? The <URL> reporting FAR violations by calling the FAA 's toll-free telephone number , 1-866-TELL-FAA .
Sweden currently has a surplus of controllers , so you are unlikely to find open positions . However , since you are a qualified controller and speak Swedish , you should be qualified to apply for any position that might come up . I suggest you have a look at LFV , which is the largest Swedish ANSP : www.lfv.se/en
I went poking around the FAA <URL> until I found <URL> , which states : Sec . 139.307 Unpaved areas . ( a ) In a manner authorized by the Administrator , each certificate holder [ must ] maintain and promptly repair the surface of each gravel , turf , or other unpaved runway , taxiway , or loading ramp and parking area on the airport that is available for air carrier use as follows : ... ( b ) FAA Advisory Circulars contain methods and procedures for the maintenance and configuration of unpaved areas that are acceptable to the Administrator . So I went looking for those advisory circulars . There are probably more that I have n't found , but <URL> beginning at page 82 seems to have the sort of thing you 're looking for .
Update with relevant info from <URL> ( I 'm skipping the FTD portions as not relevant to the question , and including the simulated parts but italicizing them as they 're useful but also not relevant ) . Translated , you can log an approach when : it is flown solely by reference to instruments , and it is flown in IMC , and Actual Instrument time is logged , or the PF is using a view-limiting device , and Simulated Instrument time is logged ; you must fly the complete approach from a feeder or the IAP ( or Vectors to Final ) and remain established the whole time . This means you fly initial , intermediate , and final segments , unless you 're on vectors . if flying the approach in IMC , you may log an approach that : continues to DA/DH or MDA in actual , or becomes VMC before DA/DH or MDA , provided you are inside the FAF . if simulating the approach , you must continue to the DA/DH or MDA under the hood ( or other VLD ) ; That 's pretty much it . Here 's the source text : A pilot may log an IAP for currency or training when the pilot accomplishes the IAP in accordance with the following conditions : When conducted in an aircraft , flight simulator , flight training device , or aviation training device , the pilot must operate that aircraft or authorized training device solely by reference to instruments [ § 61.51 ( g ) ( 1 ) ] ; When conducted in an aircraft , flight simulator , flight training device , or aviation training device , the pilot must be established on each required segment of the IAP to the minimum descent altitude ( MDA ) or decision altitude/decision height ( DA/DH ) ; When conducted in an aircraft simulating instrument flight conditions , a flight simulator , a flight training device , or an aviation training device , the simulated instrument meteorological conditions ( IMC ) must continue to MDA or DA/DH ; and When conducted in an aircraft , the flight must be conducted under actual or simulated instrument flight conditions [ § 61.51 ( g ) ( 1 ) ] . When conducted in an aircraft maneuvering in IMC , and the aircraft transitions from IMC to visual flight conditions on the final approach segment of the IAP prior to or upon reaching MDA or DA/DH . Previously , I linked to Rod Machado , who cites the FAA in an <URL> to this that I quite like , and which was pretty frequently referred to when I was instructing at a flight school : Once you have been cleared for and have initiated an instrument approach in IMC , you may log that approach for instrument currency , regardless of the altitude at which you break out of the clouds . ... but this is not the latest knowledge anymore . It 's functionally pretty close to the InFo rules for IMC approaches , though !
There is a description of this route page <URL> . <URL> The scan is not good , you may get the textual content <URL> . It says terrain following activities may take place , as well as visual contours ( which I assume to be navigating without radar , looking at the outdoor and searching in a catalog the same relief contour to know where you are ) . As you commented , taking into account the local relief : For terrain following should be for newbies . For visual contours navigation should be for top-guns only . There are different routes like this , starting from nowhere and ending in the Smoky MOA . They seem to be routes avoiding nearby airfields . On the image below , I 've emphasized the area without airfields , including MOAs . It looks like IR-504 is drawn along the centerline . <URL> Based on <URL> Other possible selection criteria : Unpopulated areas ( noise from low flying jets ) Low radio noise areas . Flat terrain for UAV training .

What are the reliability statistics for modern jet engines ?
What is the actual numerical reliability statistics of the modern , large-aircraft , commercial turbofan engines available today ? e.g. . How many running hours can we expect a failure after ? Are there empirical or projected MTBF statistics ? Buried in <URL> is the comment that the GE90 has ' only one engine IFSD per one million engine flight-hours ' . <URL> has a lot more info , including these threshholds for ETOPS IFSD rates : Propulsion system should achieve an in-flight shutdown ( IFSD ) rate of : 0.05 / 1000 engine hours for EDTO 120 min 0.02 / 1000 engine hours for EDTO 180 min 0.01 / 1000 engine hours for EDTO beyond 180 min Rate computed based on world fleet data , on a 12-month rolling average This strongly implies that the reliability targets are empirical , not based on theoretical numbers . Is there a significant difference in the failure rate between engine models or manufacturers ? Page 56 of the presentation above has some data , but IMHO not enough to draw any conclusions . How rapidly has engine reliability improved ? Do we have a time trend of reliability numbers ? All I can say is it 's definitely improved massively , but I 'm not sure where to find the info .
Usually , they are . In case of the JT8D engine , the N1 tach generator ( inside the nose bullet ) , atleast is a LRU . The AMT Society even has a <URL> .
According to the <URL> you can operate an amphibious airplane on hard-surface runways with a land class rating but need a seaplane class rating to take off or land on water , and vice versa . As far as the regs , it seems that the airplane can simply be considered either land or seaplane class depending on how you are operating it .
To start you off there 's these two : <URL> - Certification of Airports and <URL> - Notice of Construction , Alteration , Activation and Deactivation of Airports . Part 139.311 covers all the lighting related requirements . Part 157 is there just so you can inform the FAA about the changes you 're going to make in the airport . for specifics about LED lights , I would suggest looking for Advisory Circulars with LED lighting for airports in particular .
Short answer The reverser is not installed on the outer engines . As the linked question mentions : This allows to lighten the engines , this also prevents any unwanted and hazardous opening in flight as well as the costly check time for an unused feature . The reverser used on the A380 is a cold flow type . It is merely part of the engine by itself . It is actually integrated in the nacelle structure channeling the bypass cold flow . Principle Thrust reversal on this aircraft type consists in opening the bypass duct sideways , interrupting the bypass flow in the duct and redirecting it through the opening . The opening is created by sliding the aft section of the nacelle case to expose a set of vanes . The blocked flow now escapes sideways and is guided forward by the vanes : <URL> Principle of cold flow thrust reverser ( <URL> ) <URL> Thrust reverser on the A380 ( <URL> ) Engine , reverser , nacelle The A380 is equipped with Trent 900 from Rolls-Royce or GP7200 from Engine Alliance . The thrust reversers are made by a different provider , <URL> ( formerly Hurel-Hispano , now part of Safran ) , which also manufactures the nacelles . This is because the thrust reverser is really integrated in the nacelle rather than linked to the engine . Trent 900 The reverser is in the cold / bypass flow behind the fan section which is the engine section with the largest diameter ( in the Trent 900 , about 3m ! ) . <URL> Hot flow , cold flow and reversed flow in a Trend 1000 ( similar to 900 ) . Based on <URL> by Gandoza , on <URL> . The cold flow duct is similar in both versions of the nacelles . The duct is fenced by two semi-annular walls , where the flow is rushed by the fan and the LP compressor . The reverser features are just added or not at the end of the duct , just behind the <URL> . <URL> Not the A380 , but similar : Front panels can raise like petals and block the flow when the sleeve move aft ( <URL> ) Cold flow duct with reverser The inner wall prevents all the flow to reach the core and the components and pipes around it , in order to not create damage or drag and heat . However a limited quantity of air is still directed toward the core for cooling . <URL> Trent 900 duct and reverser . Based on <URL> models . Top image from the <URL> by BlueGreen .

The primary advance in the transistor era is the <URL> . It 's essentially a fly-by-wire throttle , incorporating rate limiters to key engine inputs such as fuel flow rate , and performing automated monitoring tasks to reduce flight crew workload . Prior to the FADEC system , sufficiently complex jet aircraft required a crew member , the flight engineer , whose primary task was monitoring and maintaining engine performance in flight . Additionally , jets without a FADEC require particular attention paid by the pilot ( s ) to the rate at which the throttle is adjusted ; you ca n't just firewall it for a takeoff as that will cause a compressor stall .
That buzzing sound is from the tips of the fan blades breaking the sound barrier . When you 're sitting farther back in the airplane , that sound is overpowered by the sound of the exhaust , which is the roaring part of a jet engine 's sound . So in general , sit forward of the wing , you 'll hear the fan sound ( the buzz ) , sit aft of the wing and you 'll hear the exhaust sound ( roar ) . It 'll vary from airplane to airplane of course , and when thrust is reduced and the fan speed slows , the buzz will subside .
To avoid shock waves on the compressor blades which would make the engine unusable both because of the very large pressure fluctuations that would cause fatigue and failure of blades , and because of the high level of drag that is developed in supersonic flows that would have the effect of slowing the blades down as they rotated . In fact the engine just would n't run with a supersonic flow going into it . Also the flow needs to be slowed down as much as possible to allow enough time in the combustion chamber for the fuel to burn completely . So ... a cone or ramp shape at the inlet is used to create a little shockwave in front of the engine slowing down the oncoming air to subsonic speeds and allowing the jet engine to operate efficiently . A ramjet is able to use the compressed air because it is designed to do so . An excellent case study is the SR-71 Blackbird , which had engine cones that moved forward and backward based on speed/altitude , to transition from a turbine to a ramjet mission profile . ( Fun fact : That plane is so darned fast that the limit to it 's speed comes not from engine power , but from MELTING THE PLANE because it is going so fast . ) The SR-71 had " Bypass doors " to close of the main turbine of the engine when operating on a ramjet profile . A ramjet , sometimes referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd , is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine 's forward motion to compress incoming air without a rotary compressor . Ramjets can not produce thrust at zero airspeed ; they can not move an aircraft from a standstill . A ramjet powered vehicle , therefore , requires an assisted take off like a JATO to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust . Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around Mach 3 . This type of engine can operate up to speeds of Mach 6 . A scramjet is a variant of a ramjet airbreathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow . As in ramjets , a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress the incoming air before combustion , but a ramjet decelerates the air to subsonic velocities before combustion , while airflow in a scramjet is supersonic throughout the entire engine . This allows the scramjet to operate efficiently at extremely high speeds : theoretical projections place the top speed of a scramjet between Mach 12 and Mach 24 .
Like anything else a <URL> except the engine is bolted directly to it ( <URL> ) . In a car a rolling road is simply a way to couple the tires to the dyno without having to have any custom fittings . For what its worth cars lose a bit of horse power in the transmission/drive shaft/differential so shaft horse power and wheel horsepower are not always the same . However in a plane the prop is bolted more or less to the end of the crank ( with the exception of some planes with stepper gear boxes ) . In any case shaft horsepower on a plane engine is more or less whats available at the prop . Here is a lycoming engine on a dyno <URL> ( <URL> )
Like everything in aviation its a trade off of a few factors . Efficiency : A non-running engine is pretty quiet but that 's of little use to a pilot who needs thrust to actually go anywhere . Now you can have lots of sound suppression in an engine and alter the airflow and what not but in the end of the day jets work on Newton 's third law so you still need to throw a hot mass out the back . Any attempt to baffle this will take a toll on efficiency . ( Side note , car exhausts have a similar effect on car engines these days ) . Weight : The generally accepted way to reduce noise is to insulate against it . What you are really doing is adding material to absorb the mechanical energy that is the sound wave and dissipate it . Generally this is <URL> of some kind ( there is a variety of styles ) . But like anything this takes a toll on weight and will reduce what you can carry . Cost : Insulation does wear out and break down over time ( its usually some kind of foam ) , so the more you have the more you need to replace . Also of importance is the fact that most of it gets removed during check to inspect the airframe so having a lot of insulation will add to your down time during checks ( this costs the airline money in terms of hours ) . If you take a look at some custom-built private planes you will see some of the things they can do in terms of added noise reduction and what those implementations look like . On the other hand <URL> is becoming a cheaper and more efficient technology in headphones which makes a case for not needing to improve insulation ( it will eventually be cheaper to have a pair of ANR headphones for everyone than maintain a lot of insulation ) . A lot of the GA community has moved to ANR headsets which are much nicer than their traditional counterparts .
Well , first let 's clear up a few terms . When you say " rotary " engine I 'm assuming you 're referring to <URL> , a type of piston engine that used to be pretty common on aircraft . ( These days <URL> are what you typically find on piston-powered aircraft , <URL> are yet another design , but their usage died out around the end of World War I. ) The TU-95 is not actually a piston-powered aircraft - it 's a <URL> -- basically a turbine engine similar to what you 'd find in a jet , only rigged up to turn a propeller rather than produce " jet thrust " directly . From an efficiency standpoint , turbine engines are usually more fuel efficient than their piston counterparts , and jet fuel is produced in greater volume than aviation gasoline and is consequently cheaper for operators to procure . Turbine engines also offer more reliability than piston engines , and the maintenance on a turboprop engine is also largely similar to a jet engine with a few extra components , which is an advantage for a company operating a fleet of jet and propeller driven aircraft . The differences in operating efficiency and reliability are the major reason why gasoline-powered piston engines have basically disappeared from scheduled airline service . So why do n't we see more turboprops ? Actually we see a lot of them , if you look in the right places . Jets and Turboprops are good at different things -- broadly simplifying , a turboprop is more efficient at lower altitudes and airspeeds while a jet engine is more efficient at higher altitudes and airspeeds . As a result we see turboprop aircraft like <URL> in use for short-haul " commuter " service , but for trans-continental or trans-oceanic flights where they spend a long time cruising at high altitude jets dominate the sky . Since most people are flying to go relatively long distances there are comparatively more jets in scheduled airline service than turboprops . Noise is probably also a factor - fast turboprops like the Bear are LOUD not due to the engine , but due to the propeller . The tips of the spinning propeller on a TU-95 can approach supersonic speeds , which causes quite a bit of noise . The TU-95 's <URL> ( which help produce thrust more efficiently ) also contribute to a louder noise footprint . In the case of the TU-95 this does n't matter - it 's a military plane , and the Russian air force does n't care if people complain as the aircraft has a mission to complete and that 's more important than a few noise complaints . If United Airlines were to operate a TU-95 out of Kennedy departing over people 's houses I suspect they would quickly reconsider their choice of equipment when the noise complaints started coming in ...
All commercial aircraft have some form of redundancy in their instrumentation , but it 's not always in the form of " analog " instruments . The backup is often electronic itself . But the overall system is designed with a very high level of redundancy . A typical modern jet aircraft has an <URL> ( EFIS ) , which is the large screen Primary Flight Display ( PFD ) you see in front of both pilots . There are usually also one or more Multifunction Displays ( MFDs ) in the middle between the pilots . These displays form the primary instrumentation . The EFIS itself is designed with a very high level of redundancy between the pilot 's and copilot 's side displays . Both are on independent electrical circuits and receive information from independent input computers ( <URL> [ ADC ] , <URL> [ AHRS ] , etc. ) . Both can usually also be switched over to the other set of input computers . Usually , the MFD can also be configured in a " reversionary " mode where it looks and acts like a PFD . If the entire EFIS system should fail , there is also a backup set of instruments . In modern times this backup is usually one or two <URL> ( ESIS ) . These are essentially smaller , condensed " PFDs " that display critical information . They usually either contain their own miniature AHRS/ADCs or are connected to isolated computers . They are also powered on a totally independent electrical circuit and often have their own dedicated battery as well , separate from the main aircraft battery . Modern engines are controlled by completely different computers called <URL> or FADECs . Two or more FADEC channels are provided for each engine , so that if either channel fails , the other can take over . FADECs are also considered flight-critical items , and are designed with fail-passive capability : even if both FADEC channels fail , the engines can still run and be controlled more primitively and less efficiently . Electronic pressurization controllers do n't always have redundant computer modules , but a manual pressurization control mode is always provided . In the worst case , the pilot has the ability to manually open or close the cabin outflow valve to control cabin pressure . And redundant pressurized air sources are available from each engine .
Not yet . To look at a medium-range aircraft , let 's base the engine on the <URL> or the <URL> . Those engines produce between 100 and 150 kN static thrust . In cruise , their thrust is <URL> due to the low density in cruise altitude and due to them moving at Mach 0.8 . Let 's use a value of 25 kN - this is enough so that two of them will comfortably push an <URL> class airframe through the thin air at altitude . The power to produce such an amount of thrust is force times speed . The speed when flying with Mach 0.8 in <URL> is 240 m/s , so the power produced by one engine is 6.0 MW . Now <URL> an electric motor has to be to produce 6 MW continuously . As you can see from the linked Wikipedia page , the results are all over the place . Big , industrial motors come in at less than 1 kW/kg , so our motor would weigh more than 6 tons . The smaller motors for electric airplanes are pushing 10 kW/kg , the power-to-weight ratio of the <URL> , but will lose some of that when scaled up to size . Remember , even at 98 % efficiency the motor will generate 120 kW of heat - this needs to be removed , and operating in thin air does n't make this easy . With current technology the motor could achieve maybe 2 to 3 kW/kg - this means the motor driving our hypothetical engine comes in at 2 to 3 tons . Add to this the fan and the fairing of the jet engine ( we will not need the high-pressure part and all the turbines ) , but double the fan weight because we need to compensate for the missing high-energy core flow . This will maybe weigh 50 % of the CFM56 / V2500 , so we need to add another 1.2 tons . The electric motor will be twice as heavy as the parts it replaces . There is still some work to do before it can gain an advantage over current jet engines , but it has some potential because it does not dump half of the energy supplied to it overboard in a hot , fast-moving , noisy gas stream . EDIT : Since so many people get excited about me omitting the energy density aspect of electric propulsion , even though the question did expressly desire to leave this out , here are two things to consider . Energy density is only half of the problem of electric storage . The <URL> of jet fuel is around 43 MJ/kg , while Lithium polymer batteries achieve not even one MJ/kg . But this comparison is linear thinking - realistically , the current will be produced either by a high-efficiency turbine-generator combination , or by fuel cells , burning hydrogen at twice the efficiency of a conventional jet engine . Since hydrogen packs 142 MJ per kilogram , at twice the efficiency the electric airliner would need only 162 kg of hydrogen for every ton of kerosene in a conventional jet . Yes , I know , even then its volume will still be a problem . If any form of batteries is used , the fact that empty batteries weigh as much as full ones is the final nail in the coffin of battery-powered flight . While your average long-range jet <URL> , the battery-powered jet would need to schlepp those heavy batteries all the way to the final destination . To be competitive , those hypothetical batteries would need to have twice the energy density of kerosene .
<URL> claims to have exceeded Mach 1 in a dive , but the conditions are disputed due to compressibility and later tests that find the aircraft uncontrollable above Mach .84 . The first U.S. fighter plane to exceed Mach 1 in level flight is the <URL> . For research on how the sound barrier was broken as it results to aircraft design is to read <URL> . Wikipedia also has a good read on <URL> that lists aircraft by manufacture date . As for technological innovations , I would suggest reading about the <URL> , specifically <URL> since the air must be slowed sub-sonic before entering the compressor stages .
I 'll give the answer from an ATC perspective . A visual approach is the most preferred approach , since we can get aircraft to follow each other , and do n't have to worry as greatly about aircraft getting too close . The rules say we can compress under certain conditions to 2.5 miles on ILS or radar separation approaches , but timing wise , for the runway to be clear , you can often need less separation between aircraft to maximize its usage . With the visual approach , you 're vectoring to keep aircraft closer so they can see each other and follow in closely to each other to the runway . In most ATC facilities , the Tower decides what runway to use , and the approach control calls the type of approach generally on offer ( this can vary depending on facilities and how they agree to run things ) . A pilot can always request a different approach ... they might be delayed , sometimes significantly if they insist on something way out of the loop .
You can basically log SIC time if you are a required crewmember and are not able to log PIC time . So , generally in an airplane like a C-182 which is certified for only one pilot , you ca n't log SIC time because you are n't a required crewmember . There are a few exceptions though , like being a safety pilot for the PIC while they are using a view limiting device ( like an IFR hood ) , etc. . SIC time is not pointless because it still adds to your total time ! As far as landings , you can log them only if you are the sole manipulator of the flight controls , in which case you are allowed to log PIC time ( even though you are n't allowed to act as the PIC since you do n't have your high performance endorsement ) . Oddly enough , in this situation the pilot who is acting as PIC is n't allowed to log it because they do n't meet any of the requirements for doing so . It 's one of the only situations where the PIC is n't allowed to log it as such .
On light aircraft , polycarbonate windshields have been the norm . On higher speed aircraft , glass is used , particularly with heated windshields . Glass is actually a " plastic " but the polycarbonate plastics and glass have very different properties . Polycarbonate tends to be pretty shatter resistant , although I know a turkey vulture which proved otherwise ( grin ) . It really depends upon the type of aircraft and the design criteria , which include the operations , temperature , heat requirements ( ie hot windshield for de ice ) , weight considerations , EMI considerations ( coatings , etc. ) and so on . Both materials have been in sure for a long time . So what kind of aircraft are you talking about ?
The thrust of a propeller is proportional to the inverse of airspeed , while the thrust of a pure turbojet is roughly constant over airspeed in the subsonic region . This means that two airplanes with the same static thrust , one propeller-powered and the other jet-powered , will reach very different top speeds . And , <URL> , piston engines are <URL> . A piston engine produces a constant <URL> $ \ tau $ , independent of speed . This torque drives the propeller which produces work $ W$ per unit of time on the air passing through it . This work per unit of time is power $ P$ and proportional to the product of torque and propeller speed $ \ omega $ , which is again constant over airspeed $ v $ . The power to propel the aircraft is the product of thrust and airspeed and equals engine power times propeller efficiency $ \ eta _ { Prop } $ . When airspeed goes up , thrust must go down proportionally for power to stay constant . $ $ P = \ tau \ cdot \ omega = T \ cdot v \ cdot \ eta _ { Prop } $ $ $ $ \ Rightarrow T \ varpropto \ frac { 1 } { v } $ $ Turbojets , on the other hand , profit from flight speed because the intake pre-compresses the air when it slows down ahead of and in the intake . This pre-compression lifts the pressure level of the whole engine , so it sees an increased mass flow with increasing speed , producing higher thrust . This effect by itself would increase thrust in proportion with the square of flight speed , but the same effect which reduces the thrust of a propeller acts on a turbojet as well . This effect , however , is less pronounced because the jet <URL> , and both cancel each other , roughly . Turbofans are more similar to propeller engines , so here the thrust goes down over airspeed , and <URL> . Turboprops are even closer to piston-powered propellers , so their thrust drops even more with increasing speed . This means that the speed at which drag equals thrust drops when you move from turbojets to turbofans , and further to turboprops and is lowest for piston-powered propeller aircraft .
There are lots of problems . Sight is just generally important when flying . Even in airliners , most approaches are still flown manually and often visually . Any significant degradation of sight is going to be a problem when flying any type of airplane . Red/Green/White <URL> are used by air traffic control in the event of a radio failure . The inability to differentiate red from green in this case would be an enormous safety hazard ( e.g. did tower just clear me to land or tell me to keep circling ? ) <URL> / <URL> lights use colors to indicate whether you 're above , below , or on the proper glide slope for a runway . While it 's possible to land without them , it 's a significant reduction in safety . Lights at airports are color-coded to indicate whether a particular road is a runway or taxiway , how close you are to the end of the runway , that a runway is in use , etc. . Landing on a taxiway is usually a bad idea , so it 's best if you can tell the difference . The navigation lights on airplanes themselves are color-coded . The right wingtip has a green light , the left wingtip has a red light , and the back has a white light . This lets other pilots easily determine which way you 're going and , in case of conflict , who should yield ( seeing a red light on another aircraft means that they 're to your right and , therefore , you should yield to [ i.e. divert around ] them . ) Colors are used on aviation charts to indicate all kinds of things , including class of airspace , type of special-use airspace , whether a field is controlled or not , type of route , elevation of terrain , where you should expect to see city lights at night , etc. . You need to be able to distinguish these things quickly and accurately , even in low-light conditions . Some cockpit instruments use colors to indicate various things . These include color bands on airspeed indicators , color of annunciator lights or their on-screen equivalents ( i.e. red for warning , amber for caution , green for gear down , etc. , ) echo intensity on a weather radar display , etc. .
Yes , absolutely . The skin transfers shear stresses between the <URL> which run lengthwise along the fuselage and transmit tensile or compressive stress . Cutouts and openings ( for doors and windows ) need special local reinforcements , so the reduced structure can still withstand the loads . Equally , the wing skin is the main element for the transmission of torsional loads . In today 's airliners , the spar is part of the skin , but the wing skin ahead and aft of it is also a part of the primary structure . Generally , stress follows stiffness . When a structure is loaded , it will deform , and those parts which withstand deformation most will carry most of the load . In the end , all parts which have similar stiffness will carry loads in proportion to their cross section . Since most of an airliner 's structure is made from aluminum , it has the same stiffness . See <URL> for one example clearly showing fuselage skin deformation .

start question
Are Air Traffic Flow Management Algorithms mostly based on linear programming techniques ?
Linear programming ( LP ) is an optimization method that finds the highest ( or lowest ) possible value of a set of linear equations given a number of linear constraints . There are a number of objectives in Air Traffic Management that may be described by linear equations . Runway throughput for example : twice as many aircraft can be seen as " twice as good " . Or delay : one minute of delay of a passenger aircraft with 400 passengers is as bad as 2 minutes of delay for a passenger aircraft with 200 passengers ( both have 400 passenger-minutes-of-delay ) . Mathematical models based on these linear relationship can help to make decisions for air traffic controllers/planners . There are obvious limitations to linear programming . Not everything can be modeled as a linear relationship . Often the relations are more complex and linear models will be a poor fit because the relationship is not linear at all . In ATFM modelling , usually binary integer variables are used that can only take values of zero or one , thus a Binary Integer Linear Program is solved ( BIP ) . And is 40 minutes of delay of a 10 passenger aircraft as bad as 1 minute of delay of a 400 passenger aircraft ? These kind of relationships tend to prevent the small aircraft from ever taking off : it always pays off to let a bigger aircraft jump the queue . Perhaps a quadratic component in the ' cost-function ' would bring a solution here . Therefore more advanced models are needed . Methods like Integer Linear Programming ( ILP ) , Mixed Integer Linear Programming , Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming and more advance optimization algorithms are used as well . Another problem is that while these optimization methods may be able to find a best possible strategy , they are not necessarily easy to understand . Air traffic controllers do n't like to be just told what to do , they need to understand why a strategy is proposed so they can think ahead and create what-if scenarios . It is impossible to program every what-if scenario in the optimization model , so at times the controller will need to deviate from the proposed solution . Without understanding what the algorithm had planned , it is difficult for a controller to predict the knock-on effects of his deviation from the proposed plan . Early arrival management software worked reasonably well when the weather was nicely playing along , but gave hopelessly wrong suggestions when a couple of thunderstorms would render the normal approach routes unusable . Flexibility and two way communication between the system and the controller is essential to make a good product , there is much more to it than choosing the right optimization algorithm .
You almost have the answer in your question ; bleed air is hot , compressed air taken from the engine compressors . Bypass bleed air here refers to some of that air which is bled off the engine , but not routed through the air cycle machine ( pack ) . When the air comes out of the pack , its really cold . The pilot has a knob which blends the cold air from the pack with the hot bypass air to adjust the temperature that comes through the actual ductwork ; this is similar to the blender box in a car . For example , in this image taken from <URL> , the bleed air from the engine comes in at the top right corner , and you can see the line for bypass bleed air along the top of the diagram in the pipe labelled " hot air " .
The ARTCC are centers with authority on the US territory only . However there are equivalent control areas in the international airspace ( e.g. airspace used when flying over the seas ) . International rules are proposed by <URL> . The foundations of the laws used in civil aviation have been agreed in 1944 <URL> , in particular <URL> . From <URL> on ICAO airspace classification : ICAO has divided the airspace in the world into Flight Information Regions , or FIRS . These regions identify which country controls the airspace and determines which procedures are to be used . Normally , one major ATC facility is identified with each FIR . These facilities are called Area Control Centers ( ACC ) . They are equivalent to ARTCC 's in the U.S. ACC are managed by countries who received a delegation from ICAO . ACC usually provide clearances for flights over water areas and are as such Oceanic Control Areas or OCAs . For North Atlantic : <URL> North Atlantic OCAs ( <URL> ) There are 6 OCAs managed by different ICAO member States : UK ( Shanwick ) , Iceland ( Reykjavik ) , Canada ( Gander ) , Norway ( BODO ) , USA ( NY ) and Portugal ( Santa Maria ) . A common route for the flight you mention will cross <URL> and <URL> FIR/OCA . This region is very crowded ( due to the <URL> reduced volume and the transoceanic flights in general ) . Example : <URL> ( source <URL> ) FIRs and their boundaries worldwide can be displayed with this <URL> : <URL> ( source : <URL> ) See full <URL> on IVAO ( simulation ) . This will be for the other direction , because the NAT system is based on jet streams blowing from west to east .
No , " in sight " or " visual contact " means seeing the actual traffic visually , with your eyes . When you report " traffic in sight , " then the controllers are allowed to issue a clearance such as " maintain visual separation " or " follow that traffic , cleared visual approach ... " . They ca n't issue those clearances when you only see the traffic on TCAS . In fact , having the traffic on your TCAS display does n't really help them . The only time that I 'll even mention that I have the called traffic on TCAS is in a situation where it may save the controller extra transmissions pointing out the traffic " now at 2 oclock moving to 1 oclock " etc. . If he knows that I 'm getting bearing from TCAS &amp; will call it when I see it , that may save some radio congestion , but until I see the traffic and report it in sight , he ca n't clear me for anything based on visual contact . TCAS is a great tool for collision avoidance &amp; for awareness , but it is n't designed as a " follow that traffic " tool .
The answer is yes . One example was on April 2 , 2012 . Helen Collins , an 80-year old Grandmother was forced to take the controls of her husband 's CE-414 and land it at Door Country Cherryland Airport ( KSUE ) after her husband had a massive heart attack at the controls and died . She managed to circle the airfield and call 911 on a cell phone . The emergency dispatcher contacted the FAA who got in touch with ATC . A KSUE based private pilot named Robert Yuksonavich took off and joined her in formation , talking her through what was about to happen and flew her wing on several practice approaches prior to the landing attempt . On landing the Cessna 414 skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the grass , breaking the nose gear off . Helen survived with only minor injuries ; her husband was pronounced dead on the scene . A brief piece by the CBS morning news featuring commentary by Capt Chesly Sullenberger about the incident . This is the full ATC of the accident
The facility under duress will declare " ATC Zero " and all traffic will be handed off to other controllers while that facility is offline . In the case of a control tower , this means the airport either acts as a non-towered field or as a closed field ( depending on the nature of the emergency ) . If it is a TRACON , then the ARTCC will assume control of the TRACONs airpsace . If it is an ARTCC , that might present bigger problems as continuity of radio communications may be impacted and I 'm not sure exactly how this would be handled but assume it would be re-routes around the ARTCC . I 've been inbound to IAH when their tower decided to close ( I forget why ) , and the response was to put everyone inbound to IAH into holds and handle diverts when fuel became an issue .
No because aircraft are categorized by their <URL> ( 1.3 times stall speed ) . <URL> VAT -- Speed at threshold used by ICAO ( 1.3 times stall speed in the landing configuration at maximum certificated landing mass ) By knowing the category , ATC is able to use appropriate speeds . The category is not actually listed anywhere , so the controller will have to know the approach category by heart for each aircraft type . E.g. if the controller sees " B738 " as the aircraft type in the flightplan , they have to know that the corresponding approach category is C. More : <URL> <URL> ( for the US )
The aircraft 's Flight Management System ( FMS ) can be loaded with software that periodically sends position reports and flight tracking data to ground stations via ACARS . If the particular software in use sends the full flight plan or at least the next few fixes periodically with estimated times , this would expose any changes in the flight plan to the dispatch office . The incident flight in question had its ACARS turned off at some point and the " 12 minute " figure is probably derived from the time between the last ACARS message being received and the radar observed turn off course initiated . They would not be able to know exactly when the buttons on the FMS were pressed , but they could narrow the time down to a range when information changed between two automated reports sent via ACARS . Relevant chronology : Interval : 12 minutes .
The airspace around the world is divided into sectors within a <URL> ( FIR ) / Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) / <URL> ( ACC ) , which range from very small and tight airspace pieces to larger combinations or enroute sectors . Enroute sectors will usually be larger than <URL> ( TMA ) . During peak-hours , these sectors will be handled by one controller responsible for each sector . If capacity and traffic flow permit , these sectors can be combined and two sectors will be handled by the same controller . Below is a picture of the Paderborn Lower Sector , ranging from GND to FL135 . This is usually a stand-alone sector which only covers approaches to Paderborn ( EDLP ) and Dortmund Airports ( EDLW ) . ( Image Source : Own Work - Author : SentryRaven ) If traffic permits , the adjacent sector Hamm Lower from GND to FL115 , handling arrivals and departures to Münster ( EDDG ) , will be handed over to the controller responsible for Paderborn Lower . This can also be done vice-versa , where the Hamm Lower controller becomes responsible for the Paderborn Lower sector . ( Image Source : Own Work - Author : SentryRaven ) TMA controllers not only handle IFR aircraft approaching or departing from airfields within their sector , but also any enroute traffic crossing the sector , VFR traffic requesting to cross airspaces which require prior permission and other tasks . <URL> , controllers take breaks between working their sectors and sometimes often switch sectors during a shift . A controller working Paderborn Lower during the beginning of his shift can end up working Hamm Lower towards the end of his shift with adequate breaks in between their sessions . See this related question : <URL>
No . Unlike the United States where the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is both the operator and regulator of the air navigation system ( ANS ) , these roles are separated in Canada and performed by two different parties . They are : The regulator : <URL> The operator : <URL> The Government of Canada passed the <URL> , which effectively sold the ANS to a newly-formed corporation , " NAV CANADA " for the price of $ 1.5 billion dollars . Since 1996 , Transport Canada 's role has changed to regulation and enforcement ; they introduce , amend , revoke , and enforce the Canadian Aviation Regulations . NAV CANADA become the sole operator of the civil ANS and is a private company whose revenues come from aviation customers and technology sales , not Government of Canada . NAV CANADA operates the civil ANS using 7 Area Control Centres , 41 Control Towers , 56 Flight Service Stations , and 8 Flight Information Centres ; military aerodromes and terminal control areas remained the responsibility of the Department of National Defence .
Well " any " is an awfully broad statement , but the answer is " Theoretically yes . " -- You would just need floats that displace enough water to provide buoyancy for the aircraft at its maximum gross weight . For a 747 that would be impractical : We 're talking about a plane with a maximum takeoff weight in the neighborhood of 700,000-900 ,000 pounds depending on model and variant , and that would be an ENORMOUS set of pontoons . The form drag alone would be prohibitive , nevermind the structural work required to attach the pontoons in such a way that they wo n't be ripped off at takeoff speed in the water or blow off the plane in cruise flight . For smaller aircraft it 's certainly do-able : You can take a Piper Cherokee 180 , remove the landing gear , and install floats ( Piper kit # 756-746 ) to make it into a seaplane : <URL> <URL> Note the structural bracing for the floats , which attach both at the main landing gear point and the nose landing gear point to enable them to take the loads imposed by taxiing through water . There are also <URL> to prevent the aircraft from taking on water . Note however that just because something is possible does n't mean it 's a good idea , and the PA-28S is an example of that : The low-wing design of the Cherokee coupled with its single door on the right side makes the seaplane version an exercise in impracticality .
Short answer : For clarification : Equivalence between biplane and monoplane means than both have the same wing area and the same engine . Then the main differences in maneuvering are : The biplane has better roll acceleration than an equivalent monoplane . The biplane has a higher roll rate than an equivalent monoplane at the same speeds . All biplane flying takes place at lower speeds , resulting in a lower space requirement for all maneuvers . This also means that inertial effects are less pronounced : When pulling up , there is less kinetic energy available for climbing , so ( for example ) hammerhead turns will end with less altitude gain . Differences in handling : The biplane has lower aileron forces for the same roll rate at the same speed lighter control forces overall due to lower flight speed Differences in performance : shorter take-off and landing distances a lower stall speed a much lower maximum speed a lower optimum cruise speed and range a lower power requirement due to the lower flying speeds , or if both use the same engine , a better power-to-weight ratio when compared to an equivalent monoplane . These differences are most pronounced if the airplane carries just the pilot and not much payload . Flying techniques are the same as for monoplanes . Indirectly , differences are likely due to differences in design . Example : Few biplanes profit from having a retractable landing gear while gear retraction makes sense for monoplanes with higher power loading ( installed power relative to wing area ) . Explanation Biplanes have two major differences : Smaller wing span at the same wing area , and Wire bracing results in very lightweight biplane wings . The smaller span reduces roll damping and roll inertia , so a biplane will accelerate into a roll more quickly than an equivalent monoplane and will reach a higher roll rate . This is the main difference in maneuvering . The smaller wing span results in more induced drag if both have the same mass and the same speed . With wire bracing , this condition is unrealistic , and an equivalent biplane will be much lighter . If the structure is a substantial part of the aircraft 's mass ( this is typical for aerobatic airplanes ) , the result can easily be less induced drag , despite the lower span , and also lower wing loading . This in turn means that both fly at different speeds : The biplane will be able to fly much slower , but the aerodynamic drag of the bracing will restrict it to low speeds . This also means inertial effects are less pronounced : The lower mass and lower speed of the biplane combine for a marked difference to the equivalent monoplane . For aerobatic displays this is ideal : All action takes place close to the audience , and the biplane will need a much smaller area for all maneuvers than an equivalent , but heavier monoplane . The downside are low maximum speed and low range . Another difference in performance are much shorter take-off and landing distances due to the lower wing loading , which results in a lower stall speed . The optimum endurance and optimum range speeds are lower than those of an equivalent monoplane as well , so all biplane flying happens at lower speeds , which is beneficial for training aircraft . Since control forces are proportional to dynamic pressure , a biplane will have lower control forces than an equivalent monoplane . Here equivalence also means that the relative chord of all control surfaces is the same . In reality , a good designer will select a higher relative chord for the biplane 's control surfaces to ensure that control forces are above their required minimum . The heavy , unreliable engines of the early years made biplanes the ideal way of taking to the air . Once engines became more powerful and allowed higher payloads , the monoplane became better suited to carrying passengers and freight at higher speeds and over longer distances .
Latest FCOM , after revision 24 of section 3.01.21 , contain the explanation : AIR CONDITIONING WITH LP GROUND UNIT Do not use conditioned air simultaneously from packs and LP ground unit ( to avoid chattering of the non return valves ) . The non-return valves prevent air in the mixer unit to return into any source in the case this source delivers air at a lower pressure , or does n't deliver air . Valves are the one-way separation between the air generation section and the air distribution section : <URL> <URL> If the LP ground connection is used while the packs are ON , pressure will be comparable on both sides of the valves . Valves can start chattering instead of being stable in the open position . While pressures compete , air from the mixer unit can return to the packs . Damage can occur , as described in this <URL> ( air conditioning duct and non-return valve damaged ) .
One thing to note is that ' pure ' air dominance fighter or ground attack aircraft is not being developed anymore . Most of the combat aircraft developed recently/under development are multirole ( or ' omnirole ' ) aircraft . In case of air dominance ( or air superiority ) fighters , which have the task of eliminating enemy air defense system especially fighters and securing aerial control for operation of friendly forces without harassment , the following are important design objectives : High thrust to weight ratio , as it helps in maneuvers . Stealth , as the enemy ca n't shoot what he/she ca n't see . High maneuverability , for close combat situations and evasion . High weapons load , as it enables engagement of a large number of enemy aircraft at once . A good range , as it is better to engage enemy aircraft in their area rather than in friendly territory . A powerful radar to track and engage enemy aircraft , as it enables them to shoot first . Communication links to transfer data between the aircraft and between the AEWACS aircraft , as most of the aircraft today operate in an integrated battlefield . Speed is also a very important parameter . In case of ground support ( or attack ) aircraft , whose primary task is the destruction of enemy logistics and/or support for ground troops under fire , the designers look for similar yet a bit different set of characteristics . Ruggedness , as the aircraft should be able take some amount of punishment and return home . High endurance and Time on Target , as the ground troops may require support for an extended period of time , with corresponding weapons load . Communication links between aircraft and ground troops for obvious reasons . Precision targeting systems for situations where friendlies are in close contact with the enemy troops . Ability to operate from forward operating bases is desirable . Most of the present generation aircraft carry out their ground support duties using precision weaponry rather than any fundamental design decisions . Though there are still trade-offs , as in any aircraft design . The weapon load of stealth aircraft is lesser their non-stealthy counterparts as external weapons carriage increases the radar signature of the aircraft . For ground attack aircraft , a high subsonic speed is more than enough unlike the supersonic air dominance fighters . Low altitude maneuverability is important for ground attack aircraft for quick ingress and egress from the combat area . One aspect of aircraft design is that combat aircraft optimized for high altitude operations can face higher stresses when operating in lower altitudes ( i.e. near ground ) . For example , when USAF switched B-52s from high altitude bombing role to low altitude penetration tactics , it caused increased stress in the airframe .
The noise within the engine will make all flow turbulent . There is not much liberty for the engine designer to choose the type of boundary layer . Generally , a laminar boundary layer is preferable as long as the flow is accelerated , because viscous drag will be lower , and a turbulent one is better when it is decelerated , so <URL> . Outside of boundary layer phenomena , turbulence is helpful for keeping the <URL> going in the combustor and especially in the afterburner . Ahead of the combustor all engines have a diffusor to <URL> , so it has time to mix with the fuel and burn as much of it as possible . Note that the diffusor only slows down the axial movement of the air , so radial velocities will not be affected and be relatively larger relative to the axial flow at the entry of the combustion chamber . This makes the flow more turbulent , which is helpful for better fuel-air mixing . In the afterburner , flame holders are needed to produce pockets of slow-moving , hot gas which can ignite the fuel-air mixture . Again , they cause more turbulence . <URL> Flame holder ( 10 ) with annular selectors ( 9 ) of an afterburner ( picture <URL> ) At the nozzle , turbulent mixing of the hot core flow and the bypass flow reduces noise . Engine nozzles use a <URL> to speed up the mixing process .
This is a very tricky topic . Basically , you need a clear definition of what is part of the engine-related drag and what is counted towards airframe drag . Splitting up drag between components will always produce an arbitrary result . An intake can generate thrust as well as drag . In case of the SR-71 at Mach 3 , the intake <URL> , if you just look at the pressure distribution over the intake walls . Generally , the job of the intake is to feed air to the engine compressor at just the right speed and as homogeneously as possible . This requires it to suck in air when at rest from all around the aircraft , and to ingest only the core of the stream of air flowing towards it at high speed . What is not ingested needs to flow around the intake lips and the engine fairing , and the drag caused by this process even has its own name , being called <URL> . At high speed the intake needs to slow down the oncoming air and does so already ahead of the intake lip at subsonic speed . At supersonic speed this slowing down is <URL> , which adds another source of drag . This can be easily counted as part of the airframe drag , but done right this slowing down will compress the air , which in turn will increase thrust . Apart from viscous losses , this compression pays for itself and is almost drag-neutral in a good design and at ideal conditions . Next is the flow around the intake . Just throttling the engine will change the airflow through it and thus the flow pattern around the intake . You can imagine that some configurations show marked changes in aerodynamic drag depending on the throttle setting . In case of the Eurofighter , the vicinity of the canard will even cause throttle changes to result in notable pitch moment changes . To answer your question : Yes , the intake will produce drag , and how much it does depends on how you define drag . It is certainly wrong to think that the stream tube hitting the intake will just disappear into it and not add any drag .
After some searching , I found a <URL> from November 19th , 2009 , that reads in part : ( SBU ) SUMMARY : Miami and Havana air traffic controllers signed a letter of agreement ( LOA ) on November 12 updating procedures for the coordination of flights between Cuban and U.S. controlled airspace . Both sides stressed the excellent working relationship between the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) and the Havana Area Control Center ( ACC ) . The U.S. delegation agreed to review information to be provided by the Cuban delegation regarding flights operating under the rules of " due regard " that could pose a safety risk . Both sides also agreed to discuss switching from verbal to electronic flight data sharing , on the margins of a regional aviation meeting in Miami in May 2010 . END SUMMARY Apparently handoff procedures have been a regular occurrence for a long time , and are cooperated on extensively .
Yes , there are runways numbered on only one side . For example , the third runway in the Frankfurt Airport ( 18 , Runway west ) is used only for takeoffs ( to the south ) and not for landings . Hence only number 18 is used . The other runways are used for both takeoffs and landings and are numbered 07C/25C , 07R/25L and 07L/25R . <URL> Thomas Römer / OpenStreetMap data [ <URL> ] , <URL> This restriction is due to the fact that it will interfere with the traffic in other runways . <URL> Number 36 is not painted .
Yes , this is the system used on the Boeing 737 . As the document mentions , it is similar to the system design on the Boeing 757 and 767 models .
When you are not restricted by the size of a cargo hold , your cargo can become much bigger . See below how a <URL> lifts the fuselage and wing root of a Tu-134 . I have not checked whether this is a record , but I would expect that the world record will involve the Mil-26 somehow . Mil-26 lifting a Tu-134 carcass , seen from below ( <URL> )

Why does n't a single engine airplane rotate along the longitudinal axis ?
First , it 's about torque , not power . A helicopter rotor has a large amount of torque at a relatively low RPM . A single engine airplane has much less torque at a higher RPM ( Power = Torque X RPM ) . On top of that , for a craft of similar size , the helicopter will have much more power ( it has to lift the copter directly . ) So the helicopter has to deal with torque levels several multiples higher than that of a single engine aircraft . As to the solution , most single engine aircraft have the vertical stab offset by a small amount to generate a counter force to the torque . If you look at some high power aircraft such as the P-51 , it 's a noticeable offset . And that 's set for cruise power . Takeoff power requires additional rudder input . It should also be noted that for smaller aircraft , P-factor is a bigger turning force during climb than engine torque .

Because the fuel-air mixture in a turbine is <URL> than what it would be for a <URL> combustion . It needs to stay lean to restrict the maximum gas temperature inside the engine - higher temperatures lead to exponentially shorter lives of the turbine components .
Most of the airline doors are <URL> - i.e. they are wedge shaped , so that the pressure differential pushes it against the fuselage and prevents opening . For example , the following image shows the Boeing 737 door . <URL> Image from <URL> Note that the door is bigger on the inside , so that when it is locked in position , the pressure will push it against the fusealge , preventing it from opening . For opening the door , it has to be swung inwards before moving out .
Aviation is very energy-hungry . While hydrogen is quite efficient in terms of energy per mass ( <URL> ) , it is awful in terms of energy per volume . Aircraft today use their wings for fuel storage , which helps to reduce bending loads and uses a volume unsuitable to transport payload . This will not work for hydrogen . The biggest problem is <URL> , and none of the solutions is really attractive : Kryogenic : Storing the hydrogen at a temperature where it is liquid ( below 20 ° K ) greatly reduces volume demands , but now you need to add insulation , and even then the energy per volume is only a quarter compared to hydrocarbons . This is used in rockets , because they can rely on extensive ground support before launch and use up the stuff in a few minutes . Airliners , however , need to store their fuel over tens of hours , so their hydrogen tanks will be much heavier and bulkier than those of rockets . Compressed : This avoids the energy input for liquefaction , but now you need a strong and heavy pressure vessel . Current <URL> uses up to 700 bar pressure , but even then the volume demand is higher than that of kerosene for the same energy content . Hydrides : Some metals like magnesium or <URL> can bind hydrogen and release it when heated . However , even in the most efficient compounds like sodium tetrahydroaluminate , only 7.4 % of mass is useable hydrogen , making this exquisitely unsuitable for mass-critical applications like aviation . Currently a <URL> looks the most attractive and has been tested widely . The first ( partially ) hydrogen powered aircraft was the LZ-127 Zeppelin which used a mixture of gasses of equal mass per volume as air ( <URL> ) to power its engines . Tupolev designed and flew the <URL> , the first hydrogen-powered heavier-than-air aircraft , in 1988 . The results showed that the principle worked , but could not compete with kerosene . Currently , <URL> , but none with the hope of widespread application - as it stands , binding hydrogen chemically to carbon will still give the best way of storage ( liquid and unpressurized ) for aviation . Hydrogen becomes the best source of energy only when combustion speed is critical , such as in supersonic combustion ramjets ( <URL> ) .
I find it hard to make a general answer since the fuel systems could be different between various aircraft , but , according to Jan Roskam 's Aircraft Design series ( I just had to return the book , but I think it 's Part IV in the series ) some model of the F/A -18 utilizes the following system which , in sustained inverted flight ( or any sustained flight condition wherein the aircraft does not experience a positive load factor ) , would eventually starve the engine of fuel . Keep in mind too that fuel is n't the only factor for sustaining this flight condition : oil flow through the engine is typically gravity fed ( reference for that is an engineer from Bell Helicopter who worked on the V-22 powerplant ) . Suction is used to scavenge the oil out of the engine/gearboxes/etc , but the flow of the oil up to a point where suction will pull it out is via gravity ( or whatever acceleration the aircraft is experiencing ) . Hence , not only do we need to provide fuel , but we also need to provide for proper oil flow as well . Anyhow , the F/A -18 fuel system . Again , I wish I had the image from the text to show you , but the basic idea is this : if you had a flop tube capable of scavenging from the entire fuel tank , it would engender more problems than it solved . Hence , inside of the primary fuel tank there 's a second , smaller tank . This tank has a series of poppet valves that allow fuel to flow into the inset tank during coordinated ( i.e. , positive load factor ) flight . When the aircraft is not experiencing a positive load factor , the pressure of the fuel on these valves holds them closed and the fuel stays within the inset tank . A short flop tube within this space provides fuel to the engines for the duration of the maneuver . However , as noted , this inset tank is only a portion of the larger main tank , so its capacity would be some fraction of the main tank , limiting the duration of the maneuver . So , to answer your question ( how does fuel starvation happen and why is n't it solved via a pump ) it 's a design problem that , per the printing of that text , could not be solved by adding capacity to the pump . There just simply was n't fuel present at the fuel sump to be scavenged . The real design problem would lie in the design of flop tubes capable of scavenging from the entire tank without creating more design problems ( an assumed point on my part ) . Examples , I think , would crop up if you decided to make a multiplicity of flop tubes ( larger pumps required , more parts , more complex plumbing , etc. ) , or longer flop tubes ( potential risk for damage to the tube head/tank with increased " flopping " inertia , larger pump required for greater head losses , etc. ) ... but I also do n't know what the current standard is .
The ones I know of <URL> ( out of production ) <URL> ( they claim its the only pressurized piston single on the market ) <URL> ( out of production ) <URL> ( falls under experimental but is in " production " none the less ) For what its worth this is a pretty small category of plane to begin with . The M22 was not very successful ( although it was ahead of its time ) and there are not that many left flying ( less than 20 I think ) . The P210N saw some better success and the Mirage seems to be selling but in the end of the day extra maintenance and complexity of the plane its self does not lend to a very practical plane considering there size and performance numbers . If we are talking about the less produced or experimental designs we can add , <URL> - One of the early test beds for pressurization <URL> - Altitude record plane <URL> - Another early frame used for testing
It is actually not that simple to ensure the proper gas speed in a gas turbine . In the compressor you want to limit the flow speed over the compressor vanes to the high subsonic range , so the <URL> down to approx . Mach 0.4 - 0.5 . Less would mean less throughput and consequently less thrust . This speed , however , is far too high for ignition . The <URL> , and if flow speed is high , your combustion chamber becomes very long and the engine becomes heavier than necessary . Therefore , the cross section leading from the compressor to the combustion chamber is carefully widened to slow down the airflow without separation ( see the section below named " diffusor " ) . Around the fuel injectors you will find the lowest gas speed in the whole engine . Now the combustion heats the gas up , and makes it expand . The highest pressure in the whole engine is right at the last compressor stage - from there on pressure only drops the farther you progress . This ensures that no backflow into the compressor is possible . However , when the <URL> s ( this is quite like a wing stalling - the compressor vanes are little wings and have the same limitations ) , it can not maintain the high pressure and you get reverse flow . This is called a <URL> . The graph below shows typical values of flow speed , temperature and pressure in a jet engine . Getting these right is the task of the engine designer . Plot of engine flow parameters over the length of a turbojet ( picture taken from <URL> publication ) The rear part of the engine must block the flow of the expanding gas less than the forward part to make sure it continues to flow in the right direction . By keeping the cross section of the combustor constant , the engine designer ensures that the expanding gas will accelerate , converting thermal energy to kinetic energy , without losing its pressure ( the small pressure drop in the combustor is caused by friction ) . Now the accelerated flow hits the turbine , and the pressure of the gas drops in each of its stages , which again makes sure that no backflow occurs . The turbine has to take as much energy from the flow as needed to run the compressor and the attached pumps and generators without blocking the flow too much . The remaining pressure is again converted to speed <URL> . Now the gas is still much hotter than ambient air , and even though the flow at the end of the nozzle is still subsonic in modern airliner engines , the actual flow speed is much higher than the flight speed . The speed difference between flight speed and the exit speed of the gas in the nozzle is what produces <URL> . Fighter engines usually have supersonic flow at the end of the nozzle , which requires careful shaping and adjustment of the nozzle contour . Read all about it <URL> .
Radar systems have 2 aspects , the primary and secondary systems , or the Radar and the interrogator . The radar sends out a RF signal and receives everything that is returned on that same frequency , and performs calculations to determine the azimuth and range of everything it receives . The interrogator sends out radio pulses which transponders in aircraft receive and decode . The transponders then transmit data on a different frequency than what was received . The interrogator then receives that signal and decodes it and correlates it with the primary radar data to tell the operator that ' yes , that is definitely a valid target ' and gives the info on the flight to the operator . You can turn off the transponder , but all that will do is make it so that the ATC wo n't be able to see a correlated flight , ( one that is definitely an aircraft and not just noise coming through the primary radar ) . The screen would still show a blip where the radar picks up a signature though . If the plane has radar absorbent material or is close enough to the ground , that would get filtered out as noise . An ATC , who is used to only working with aircraft who want to be seen , and thus keep their transponders on , might be fooled by this . But a military radar operator might not be so easily fooled by this .
The term " fast ailerons " is an informal term that generally refers to the response of the plane relative to the pilot 's input to the aileron controls on the stick or yolk . The faster the plane responds , the faster the ailerons ( or other controls ) . The roll rate is the speed at which a plane can complete a roll . This depends on a number of factors , including aileron size , maximum aileron deflection , wing length , and speed . Ailerons that can deflect a lot of air without disrupting the airflow over the wing too much are desirable in an aerobatic plane , so the roll rate can be increased and so the plane will have better roll control at lower speeds . While larger ailerons are desirable on an aerobatic plane , they are also more susceptible to flutter at high speeds , which is not desirable because it tends to rip them off the wing . There are several design techniques that can be used to mitigate this , such as gap seals , counterweights , countersurfaces , etc. .
There is an aircraft with a single engine in the middle of fuselage - the <URL> - and it has the wingspan of a 737 . <URL> Global Hawk and B737 ; image from reddit . For the engine to power an airliner the size of 737 , it would have to be more powerful and huge . This leads to a few issues : It is going to eat up cabin space . In an age where airlines are finding creative ways to squeeze more people into the available space , this is a no-go . The large engine means that there should be sufficient clearance between the engine and the fuselage - else , it would result in more drag and reduced thrust , thereby reducing efficiency . Increasing clearance is quite difficult for fuselage mounted high bypass engine due to weight implications . Passengers in rear seats may not have a pleasant journey due to engine noise . Mounting the engine in rear incurs weight penalty through various ways - you have to strengthen the rear fuselage and at the same time , you lose wing bending relief , requiring strengthening and you have cg issues . Mounting engines above the fuselage is a not maintenance friendly either . Just to note , redundancy and safety are significant issues , especially in a commercial airliner .
I 've heard it said that the break-even point for owning vs renting is 200 hours/year . I fly a lot less than that , but I do n't like sharing my toys , so I own anyway . I make it a point to not actually count my cost of ownership , because it would n't be fun any more , but I 'll give you some rough numbers . I bought a 1962 Mooney for \ $ 30,000 . That 's about as cheap as it gets , and this was reflected in the condition of the plane and the high-time engine . In the first year had it , I spent \ $ 18,000 on an engine rebuild , new prop , new carb , new magnetos , new oil pump , and all the other firewall-forward upgrades that were required when I got the new engine . Five years later , I spent \ $ 14,000 on new paint . It still needs a new interior , but that can wait . I spent about \ $ 3000 at West Texas Aero installing speed upgrades . Budget \ $ 10/hour for your next engine rebuild . Annual inspection typically runs \ $ 3000 to \ $ 6000 depending on what they find wrong . I 'm getting a tank resealed this year , so it 's going to be an expensive one . Parking runs typically \ $ 50 - \ $ 100/month , depending on where you are . Insurance for my old crate runs \ $ 750/year . Expect to pay more for a nicer plane or if you have less experience . Note : get a commercial license ; it will pay for itself in reduced insurance in the long run . I think gas will typically run \ $ 5-6 / gallon , depending on a lot of factors . My Mooney burns around 9.5 gph , and flies 142 kts so it 's really economical in that respect ( and the main reason I do n't upgrade ) . Light twins are cheap to buy , but that 's because their cost of ownership is through the roof . A low-time pilot can expect to pay \ $ 12,000 / year for insurance and the annual inspection will also be a back-breaker . I used to have money . Now I have an airplane .
Most modern helicopters use two engines for added safety . This reduces the field of competing designs . Also , a good engineer will always leave proven details unchanged and focus on improving flawed designs . So it is hard to prove that a new design from an established helicopter company will truly be a clean-sheet design . The possible new designs from 1976 could be : <URL> : First flight 1974 , introduced 1975 . Note that the AS-355 is a two-turbine variant of the single-turbine AS-350 . <URL> : First flight 1975 , introduced 1979 . It has a single reciprocating engine and was indeed a clean-sheet design by Frank Robinson who started the <URL> in 1973 . He had worked previously at Bell Helicopter and Hughes Helicopters .
I think there are already plenty of answers here to give you a clue : <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL> Normally , atitude restrictions give a top limit . A minimum altitude is hard to enforce when one engine fails - then the aircraft can only continue at a lower altitude ( typically around 15,000 ft for a two-engined jet ) or the cabin pressurization fails ( now the aircraft needs to continue below 10,000 ft ) . This is speculation , but maybe the 26,000 ft limit is caused by information that rebels in the West Sinai have gotten hold of <URL> . Those have a fairly low upper limit to their effectiveness .
There are a few ways the aircraft engines can be mounted on the centerline , each with its advantages and disadvantages . <URL> Photo courtesy <URL> . One way is to mount them as in DC10 , with engine above the fuselage ; another one is to use a 'S ' shaped inlet and put the engine at the aft of the fuselage like <URL> . The main advantage of mounting the engine as in DC10 is that the inlet distortion is minimized and there is no need to cut a hole through the fuselage for putting engine . The main disadvantages are that it increases drag ( slightly ) and engine maintenance is a mess . Apparently , the DC10 engineers <URL> to put all three engines in the wing during design , but were not successful . Engines mounted in high thrust line like DC10 and <URL> are highly stabilizing as increase in engine thrust causes a pitch down motion as the thrust is increased . This is usually disconcerting to the pilots , who expect the aircraft to pitch up while engine power is increased . Finally they ended up adding <URL> to correct this in PA47 ( to make it pitch neutral ) . In DC10 , a combination of underwing and high thrust line engines would 've most probably caused no pitch changes at all . So I guess the main advantage is reducing inlet distortion . As MD11 was developed from DC10 , it simply inherited this design . Note : As for the pitch down moment being disconcerting to the pilots , it is better if someone corroborates it . It is simply that most aircraft do n't do this .
This is a community-wiki mashup of the other answers - I thought a table would be useful
Do n't know what you mean by real temperature . You will certainly experience a change of static temperature in an adiabatic flow if the velocity changes . Stagnation enthalpy describes the total energy contained in the fluid which comprises inner ( thermal ) energy , kinetic energy ( and potential energy which is often neglected ) . Stagnation enthalpy is constant for an adiabatic flow with no energy exchange . Thus , thermal and kinetic energy are antagonistic in the sense that increases of the kinetic energy need to be countered by reducing thermal energy in order to keep a constant value of total i.e. stagnation enthalpy , and vice versa . The stagnation temperature of a fluid is a virtual entity , temperature entities that are observable i.e. measurable are static temperatures . However , in a stagnating point the static temperature ideally features the value of the stagnation temperature . Back to your question : If you measure temperatures in an adiabatic flow at points of different flow velocities , you will experience different temperature readings . Your measurement setup has to ensure that your readings are not falsified by slowing down the fluid at the points of measurement .
First ; let 's be honest . No one really knows what the exact probability is . But we do have a design certification system that requires developers to apply various development assurance processes to meet specific safety standards for the design . The primary requirement is covered by <URL> That has a lot of words about identifying potential faults and mitigating the associated hazards . But there are no numbers . As with most rules , the FAA conveniently provides an Advisory Circular to help you show compliance with the rule . In this case , its <URL> . The acceptable standard for critical faults ( those with a potential catastrophic result ) is found at the bottom of para 10 . ( 3 ) Extremely Improbable failure conditions are those having a probability on the order of 1 X 10 ^ -9 or less . So , if the developers do their job to the standard and the standard ( and the methods used to evaluate it ) are accurate the answer to the question is : The probability is less than once in every 1 billion hours of operation . As a point of statistics , that number applies to the cumulative hours of all aircraft of that design .
Avoid rotating the propeller through a compression of one of the cylinders . You can easily rotate the propeller in either direction safely about 45 degrees before you feel a cylinder in compression . If you want to pull the propeller completely through a compression stroke you must be prepared for it to snap around after reaching the top of the compression stroke and that is how you must have whacked your knee . Normally after an engine shutdown the mixture is pulled to idle cutoff which would prevent fuel reaching the cylinders . Also if procedures are followed the magnetos that generate ignition sparks should be off after the end of a flight . So in theory it should be safe to pull the propeller thru during preflight . But still you need to consider that it is not completely without some small risk that the engine could start simply because humans make errors and machines can need maintenance .
There are several reasons , mostly historical , or theories behind this : After World War I , most airplanes had rotary engines with left turning tendencies because it followed the torque of the engine . Therefore , turning left was easier than turning right . Because of this , pilots considered left turns as more convenient maneuver , and thus more experienced pilot started sitting on the left . Since the early days of aviation , the fact that pilot was sitting on the left , they keep the airplane on the right side along the airway . At that time , pilots often navigate visually following roads and railways . Opposite traffic following the same path then pass each other on the left . Because captain sits on the left , left-hand traffic patterns are more common . In order to avoid a head-on collision , each airplane must turn right . Since the captain sits on the left , they will have an unrestricted view of the other airplane , and therefore can assess the situation easily . In modern times , almost all airplanes ( other than single-pilot airplanes or where one pilot sits behind the other ) , both seats have full controls to fly the airplane . Regulations do not specify which seat should be occupied by the pilot-in-command ( PIC ) or the Pilot Flying ( PF ) . Please note that <URL> . Bibliography : <URL> <URL> <URL>

Feathering The collective pitch control , or collective lever , is normally located on the left side of the pilot 's seat with an adjustable friction control to prevent inadvertent movement . The collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively ( i.e. , all at the same time ) and independent of their position . That 's what you referred to as feathering , notice it says " independent of their position " . It 's for collectively increasing or decreasing of the lift on all blades -- the engine will keep the RPM constant . Using the collective in level flight would cause a climb or descent , while with the helicopter pitched forward an increase in total lift would produce an acceleration together with a given amount of ascent . -- <URL> Flapping Flapping is position dependent as <URL> .

Yes , the required obstacle clearance is based on this minimum performance : Cross the departure end of the runway ( DER ) at at least 35ft AGL ( that 's above the DER , not above the airport reference elevation ) Climb to 400ft above the DER before turning Maintain a climb of at least 200ft per nautical mile ( FPNM ) until reaching minimum IFR altitude The minimum IFR altitude is 1000ft above obstacles , or 2000ft in mountainous areas . This is explained in detail in <URL> ( starting on page 1-14 ) . The FAA carries out an assessment to see if the airport needs a specific procedure ( ODP or SID ) and if it does n't then the standard clearance performance above applies : If an aircraft may turn in any direction from a runway within the limits of the assessment area and remain clear of obstacles that runway passes what is called a diverse departure assessment , and no ODP is published .
Holding procedures are defined by each country for their own airspace . With that said , member countries of the International Civil Avation Organization ( ICAO ) generally follow the guidance of Part I , Section 6 , Chapter 1 in <URL> , Aircraft Operations , Volume I , Flight Procedures : Section 1.1.3 - The procedures described in this chapter are related to right turn holding patterns . For left turn holding patterns , the corresponding entry and holding procedures are symmetrical with respect to the inbound holding track . While the document does not explicitly state that right-hand holding patterns are the default , it is implied . Section 1.4.9 - The still air time for flying the outbound entry heading should not exceed : a ) one minute if at or below 4 250 m ( 14 000 ft ) ; or b ) one and one-half minutes if above 4 250 m ( 14 000 ft ) . Where DME is available , the length of the outbound leg may be specified in terms of distance instead of time . Member countries can deviate from these standards , but if they do , they are supposed to notify ICAO and publish these differences in their respective Aeronautical Information Publication .

There are exceptions to these requirements , but these exceptions will not generally apply to the modern airliners referenced in your question . While the regulations do not prohibit it , I think it would be unusual for the registration to be displayed in more than one location on a given side of the aircraft -- for example , on both the tail and the fuselage . Under ICAO requirements , these items are described under <URL> . Annex 7 , paragraph 3.3.1 includes the additional requirement for heavier-than-air aircraft that the registration markings should be displayed on the lower surface of the wing structure . 3.3.1 Wings . On heavier-than-air aircraft the marks shall appear once on the lower surface of the wing structure . They shall be located on the left half of the lower surface of the wing structure unless they extend across the whole of the lower surface of the wing structure . So far as is possible the marks shall be located equidistant from the leading and trailing edges of the wings . The tops of the letters and numbers shall be toward the leading edge of the wing . The FAA has no such requirement , but other jurisdictions do , such as the <URL> , which is effectively identical to the ICAO guidance . The ICAO size requirements for heavier-than-air aircraft are similar to FAA requirements , with the obvious exception of the wing markings . These requirements are found in Annex 7 , paragraph 4.2 : 4.2.1 Wings . The height of the marks on the wings of heavier-than-air aircraft shall be at least 50 centimetres . 4.2.2 Fuselage ( or equivalent structure ) and vertical tail surfaces . The height of the marks on the fuselage ( or equivalent structure ) and on the vertical tail surfaces of heavier-than-air aircraft shall be at least 30 centimetres . Note that 30 centimetres is approximately equivelant to 12 inches , and 50 centimetres is approximately equivelant to 20 inches .
Some of the old flying boats had a seemingly haphazard arrangement <URL> <URL> <URL> But maybe all flying boat passengers were effectively first class ?
That is up to the civil aviation authority , which in most countries is distinct agency from the investigation board ( in USA this is FAA ) , to decide . They will take into consideration how likely the problem is to repeat , how big risk it would be if it does ¹ and as secondary criteria how much work the fix is and how much it will cost . What must be done will be published in an <URL> . If the problem is serious , they will prohibit any further flights except for testing purposes until fix is installed . And remember the fix may not be known yet . For example after the 787 battery fires , FAA published airworthiness directive that prohibited operations until " approved fix is installed " couple of days after the third incident when they just started to discuss what the fix should be with Boeing and whole fleet remained grounded for almost half a year until the modified batteries were ready . On the other end of the scale a problem may not necessarily result in mandatory change at all . Many issues simply result in mandating additional inspections , shortening intervals between inspections or shortening maximum service life of some component , which may be relaxed again if the manufacturer develops an improved version of the component and the operator installs it , neither of which is mandatory . Even quite severe problems may just be solved with inspections , because most components have inherently limited life and the problem just indicated higher wear then originally anticipated . ¹ It is important to remember that the investigators do n't only investigate crashes , but they get reports of all incidents , which means any failure where there was elevated risk . They then investigate those where they consider the risk significant or that are more common then expected . So often things are investigated where the probability of fatal outcome is low . In such cases the investigators will only consider safety and will publish a safety recommendation , but the aviation authority has to also consider other practical aspects and may choose not to enforce it .
From a totally practical standpoint , let 's say you 're in a small tricycle gear aircraft with a freely castoring nose wheel ( or a tail dragger ) and you 're starting your takeoff roll in a calm wind . When you bring the power up , the aircraft is going to want to turn left ( <URL> ) , in other words to yaw about its vertical axis in a counter-clockwise direction , and head for the grass off the left side of the runway . You counteract that adverse yaw by using right rudder to keep the airplane straight . Initially you might have to use some right brake as well until there 's sufficient air moving past the rudder . If you had a steerable nose gear , you would n't need the right brake . You reach flying speed , apply up elevator , and lift off . As the airplane rotates about its lateral axis , there 'll be some additional adverse yaw as a result of that rotation ( again another question ) . Even if you had a steerable nose gear , that would now be useless as the nose gear is no longer on the ground . Your means of continuing to fly straight ahead is to counter the adverse yaw with rudder , and you would continue to use right rudder as you climb out . If you do n't , you 'll start turning left . You reach the altitude you want , level off , and trim for level flight straight ahead . Then you decide you want to turn left . You start the turn briskly with left aileron , but you forgot to use any rudder . If you were looking at the ball on the bottom of the turn and bank indicator , you would see it shoot left . If you had used left rudder while initiating the turn , that would n't have happened . You would have started a coordinated turn . Now you 're coming back to the airport , and there 's a crosswind from the left . You decide you want to counter that crosswind by slipping into it . In other words , you want the airplane to travel sideways at a speed that matches the crosswind while still having your nose pointing straight down the runway . So , you lower the left wing and to keep the airplane from turning , you use right rudder to keep the airplane aligned with the runway . You match the crosswind by adding or decreasing your bank . There are other uses of rudder , and especially in aerobatics . I once flew a few loads of skydivers . The jumpmaster sat behind me , and to help him in positioning for the drop zone , he wanted flat turns . In other words , he wanted the airplane turned while keeping the wings level . So , if he wanted a left turn , that meant left rudder and right aileron . Uncomfortable from a pilot 's standpoint . Finally , back in the 1960s when I was working on my instrument rating , I had an instructor who taught that the best way to track a localizer in close was to use rudder only for small corrections . Personally , I do n't like that method , but it 's one way of doing things . A useful thing , the rudder . You need to be able to directly control movement about all three aircraft axes .
The short answer is no but it really depends on what kind of " pilot " is on board . " Is there a pilot on board " If the pilot in question is a Private Pilot as per FAA licensing ( although its often similar elsewhere in the world ) . They would be legally prevented from receiving compensation for flight time as per the FAR 's . <URL> ( a ) Except as provided in paragraphs ( b ) through ( h ) of this section , no person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire ; nor may that person , for compensation or hire , act as pilot in command of an aircraft ... If the pilot in question was a commercial rated pilot they could in theory receive compensation for the flight time but as far as I know there is no aviation law like the maritime law . Furthermore maritime law generally allows you a portion or all of the recovered cargo value ( think treasure salvage ) in the case of a hull loss . Here in the US if an aircraft were to go down be it over land or water it becomes an accident scene which the NTSB would have jurisdiction over and is generally in charge of finding and salvaging for their investigation . If you were to recover a piece of an aircraft that was part of an ongoing investigation you may be required to turn it over to the authorities . The closest scenario that I know of like this , <URL> . However he was not pilot in command and was only providing support . All things considered you will probably get a book deal out of the whole thing if it were to happen ...
I find climbing into the aircraft a good first step ;) Sorry , could n't resist ! The best way to start is to find and visit a local airfield near where you live . Most local airfields have some level of training taking place , and if the closest to you does not then another , perhaps slightly farther afield , will do . Visit one of these flying schools and ask to speak to an instructor , a CFI , or an examiner . They will give you more details such as the aircraft they fly , the typical syllabus and the expected costs . From there , you might like to start with a " trial flight " - typically 30-45 minute flight where you get to take controls and get a feel for piloting an aircraft . Good luck .
Yes , and it is exactly the same : Say again . Station calling Georgetown Ground say again your callsign Lufthansa 123 say again speed Scandinavian 123 say again all after ' good morning ' Or simply United 345 say again
To my knowledge the M2 uses a Williams FJ-44 engine which has a starter generator on it . My recollection is that it is a 200A 28VDC starter-generator ( SG ) which is directly connected to the accessory drive ( along with the oil pump ) . If 24-28VDC is applied to it , it will start turning the turbine , for starting the engine . At a certain point , once the engine starts , it is switched so that no power goes into it , and instead power is derived from it to charge the battery and provide gen power to the bus . <URL> A typical engine starter configuration is shown above , and is common in smaller turbine engines . Note that the starter generator functions as an electric motor , and also as a power source . ( Ignore the circuitry for ignition , throttle relays , etc. ) The SG is NOT an AC generator as is common on transport sized aircraft . It is also NOT an alternator , as is common to piston engine aircraft . You may find the descriptions in this manual <URL> . helpful in general understanding of SG operation . Some of the terms vary from SG vendor to SG vendor , but in general , they are DC motors , and when electric power is removed from them , and they are spinning , they will produce power . Some are self excited with residual magnetism and others utilize an internal circuit to take the small power created by residual magnetism to create a stronger field to create a larger output power from the generator . Having said all of this , normally a field excitation coil , is the name attributed to an alternator field , which is a magnetic field created by current ( not residual magnetism , and not a permanent magnet ) . An alternator creates AC internally ( not DC like a SG ) and is then rectified by diodes which are almost always integral to the alternator . The alternator is usually a three phase device and will have 3 or 6 diodes for rectification . Alternators tend to be less than 150 amps , where SGs are typically 200 to 300 amp devices . If the SG model is provided , perhaps a refined response is possible .
In general , no , you ca n't . Public ( Governmental ) Use The FAA maintains a page on <URL> . There are a couple of ways governmental organizations ( excluding the armed forces ) can fly a UAS : It can fly in accordance with the limitations set out in <URL> , which are that the FAA will : ( C ) allow a government public safety agency to operate unmanned aircraft weighing 4.4 pounds or less , if operated -- ( i ) within the line of sight of the operator ; ( ii ) less than 400 feet above the ground ; ( iii ) during daylight conditions ; ( iv ) within Class G airspace ; and ( v ) outside of 5 statute miles from any airport , heliport , seaplane base , spaceport , or other location with aviation activities . So , obviously , that 's a no-go for Bravo . It can apply for a <URL> from the FAA , which <URL> , The FAA works with these organizations to develop conditions and limitations for UAS operations to ensure they do not jeopardize the safety of other aviation operations . The objective is to issue a COA with parameters that ensure a level of safety equivalent to manned aircraft . Usually , this entails making sure that the UAS does not operate in a populated area and that the aircraft is observed , either by someone in a manned aircraft or someone on the ground to ensure separation from other aircraft in accordance with right-of-way rules . Common public uses today include law enforcement , firefighting , border patrol , disaster relief , search and rescue , military training , and other government operational missions . So , unless you have a really convincing argument , it sounds like the FAA is very unlikely to include in your COA authorization for your UAS to enter Class B ( or get anywhere near it , for that matter . ) Civil , Non-Hobbyist Operation The FAA also maintains a page on <URL> . That page summarizes how civil UAS operations can be approved as follows : There are presently two methods of gaining FAA authorization to fly civil ( non-governmental ) UAS : <URL> -- a grant of exemption in accordance with Section 333 AND a civil Certificate of Waiver or Authorization ( COA ) ; this process may be used to perform commercial operations in low-risk , controlled environments . Instructions for filing a petition for exemption are available <URL> . Surely , operating in Class B is n't " low risk " ( though I suppose you could argue it 's " controlled , " ) so this certainly seems like a no-go . <URL> -- applicants must be able to describe how their system is designed , constructed , and manufactured , including engineering processes , software development and control , configuration management , and quality assurance procedures used , along with how and where they intend to fly . a . <URL> -- may be used for civil aircraft to perform research and development , crew training , and market surveys ; however , carrying persons or property for compensation or hire is prohibited . <URL> is used by FAA inspectors to issue experimental airworthiness certificates and special flight permits to UAS . For more information , please contact the Airworthiness Certification Service , AIR-113 , at 202-267-1575 . If the FAA determines the project does not present an unreasonable safety risk , the local FAA Manufacturing Inspection District Office will issue a Special Airworthiness Certificate in the Experimental Category with operating limitations applicable to the particular UAS . b . A UAS <URL> ( 14 CFR § 21.25 ( a ) ( 2 ) and § 21.185 ) for a special purpose or a type certificate for production of the UAS under 14 CFR § 21.25 ( a ) ( 1 ) or § 21.17 . For more information , please contact the Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office at 562-627-5200 . ( Bold emphasis is mine , italics emphasis is from the FAA . ) For UASs with a Special Airworthiness Certificate , <URL> specifies in Chapter 3 , Section 1.3 ( Flight Test and Operating Area ) that : All proposed flight test and operating areas outside of restricted airspace must be approved by the FAA . Flight test and operating areas will be coordinated with the air traffic component of AFS-80 . and that : The flight test area and operating area must be over open water , or sparsely populated areas , having light air traffic . The FAA is required to evaluate each application to determine that the proposed flight area does not exceed that which is reasonably required to accomplish the program . Certainly , Class B does n't qualify as " sparsely populated areas , having light air traffic , " so this , too , seems to be a no-go .
The bank angle ( $ \ phi $ ) in a stationary turn is limited by the maximal load factor of the aircraft ( or the pilot - whichever is less ) : $ $ \ phi _ { max } = \ arccos ( \ frac { 1 } { n _ { max } } ) $ $ Utility category gliders ( $ n _ { max } = 5.3 $ ) have a maximum bank angle of 79 ° . Aerobatic gliders with $ n _ { max } $ between 7 and 10 can fly only slightly steeper turns ( 82 ° -84 ° ) . If you 're flying with an airspeed slower than design manoeuvring speed $ V_A $ the limiting factor is the maximum lift coefficient . In that case , the formula gets $ $ \ phi _ { max } = \ arccos ( \ left ( \ frac { V_S } { V } \ right ) ^ 2 ) $ $ $ V_S $ is the stalling speed in the current configuration , $ V$ the airspeed of the glider . <URL> ( own work ) Then , how do you get the tightest turn radius ? With high speed and high bank angle or with low speed and low bank angle ? Without the structural limitation the radius could become 0 . With it , however , your best option to get a minimal turn radius is to fly with maneuvring speed and maximum load factor . You can use the following diagram to calculate the minimum turn radius at any speed ( just multiply the ordinate with the squared stall speed of your aircraft ) . <URL> As stated in many comments , during aerobatics/dynamic manuevers you can get any bank angle for a certain ( sometimes really short ) period of time : <URL> 0 ° / 180 ° bank angle <URL> <URL> 90 ° bank angle <URL>
Here is a plot of cabin pressure on one flight . You can see a small increase in pressure right before takeoff . The decrease and increase in pressure is fairly constant during climb and descent . The pressure will change based on the aircraft 's altitude , and will not reach a minimum limit until closer to the aircraft 's service ceiling . This keeps pressure changes as slow as possible while giving a lower cabin altitude when below the service ceiling . <URL>
We all know the saying " From High to Low , Look out below " Some were taught that this only applied to pressure differences and thus were instructed to get a new altimeter setting every 100NM or so . This is a good recommendation . Temperature differences from standard also causes errors with the altimeter . The same saying above holds true with temperature variations . An altimeter setting is defined as : ( ref . Pilot/Controller Glossary ) The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for variations in existing atmospheric pressure or to the standard altimeter setting ( 29.92 ) . We also know there is a direct correlation between pressure and temperature and thus an altimeter setting is corrected for both pressure and temperature . This means one thing , the altimeter error is zero at the field elevation . As the aircraft gets climbs higher above the field , the altimeter error will increase . There is a table in the Aeronautical Information Manual ( 7-2-8 ) that lists altimeter error due to temperature as a function of altitude ( AGL ) and temperature . Here is the formula that will give you this table . The formula can be found in <URL> . The United States Air Force has a <URL> that discusses this topic . The FAA has recently come out with <URL> which requires pilots ( after 9/17/2015 ) who fly into " Cold Temperature Restricted Airports " to correct their altitudes for colder than standard temperatures . To determine if your airport is part of this program you must go to the <URL> and search for Cold Temperature Restricted Airports . There should be a link at the bottom of the page . Here is a graphic showing all the airports in the United States that were part of the program in February 2015 . Because Lnafziger wanted Alaska . Not only is the pilot required to correct for the segment but they are also required to inform ATC of the new altitudes they will fly . This is to ensure traffic separation with other airplanes who are not temperature correcting their altimeters . Pictures taken with permission from <URL> . All rights reserved .
Yes there is a distinction , pitch , roll and heading are angles [ unit = radian ] and latitude , longitude and altitude are linear distances [ unit = meter ] . Together , these six parameters define the six Degrees of Freedom that define the momentary state of a rigid object with reference to the earth . All six are defined relative to earth axes . For the linear dimensions this is clear , we just need to define a suitable zero point . For the angles : Pitch is the nose up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Roll is the wingtip up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Heading is the angle relative to a suitable earth reference , usually magnetic north or geographical north . Conversion of aircraft axes into earth axes is a non-trivial matter and the cause of much confusion , for instance in questions comparing lift to weight : lift is always coupled to aircraft axes , weight to earth axes . The axes sets are defined as follows : Aircraft axes Origin : Centre of Gravity of aircraft X-axis : in the symmetry plane of the aircraft , + = forward to the aircraft nose Y-axis : in the span wise direction of the aircraft , + = to the right wingtip Z-axis : perpendicular to the XOY-plane , + = down into the floor . Earth axes Origin : Centre of Gravity at the start of the response X-axis : In the horizontal plane ( relative to gravity ) , + = pointing north . Y-axis : Perpendicular to XOZ-plane , + = pointing east . Z-axis : Pointing to the centre of the earth = + Edit Yes navigation lat/lon is given in [ degrees ] - the INS sensor ultimately converts displacement into proper navigational definitions of course . But for measuring 3-D aircraft inertial effects the SI system is used , and displacement is internally treated as a linear motion , units [ metres ] .
As one of my instructors was fond of pointing out , there 's pretty much a regulation for everything -- <URL> which is pretty short and to the point as far as government regulations go . The big rules regarding kites/balloons kick in for a kite " over 5 pounds " or a balloon " over 6 feet in diameter / 115 cubic feet of gas capacity " , and are : You have to keep them at least 500 feet below any clouds . You have to keep them less than 500 feet above the ground . You must be at least 5 miles from the boundary of any airport . If your kite/balloon is going to be more than 150 feet above the surface you 're also supposed to coordinate with the closest ATC facility ( who would theoretically put out a NOTAM saying " John Doe is going to be flying a kite/balloon/thingy here , between these hours . Please try not to hit it . " ) There are also some lighting requirements ( if you fly the balloon/kite at night ) , and visibility requirements ( but really , who wants to fly a kite in less than 3 miles visibility ? That seems like pretty lousy kite weather . ) As a favor to your local pilot community ( and to prevent having your wayward kite dragged off by a Cessna on short final ) it 's probably best to observe the three " big rules " above regardless of the size of your kite - a 6-ounce piece of balsa and cellophane can still make a lot of people 's days more interesting if it appears in an unexpected location .
The size of an aircraft plays no role in identifying who has right of way . The general rule is that for same-class/type ( powered or non-powered ) aircraft , the aircraft coming from the right has right-of-way and should be yielded to . This is irrespective of the size within the same type , but a question of manoeuvrability . For different types of aircraft , a powered aircraft will have to yield to non-powered aircraft . For more details see the related question below , <URL> , <URL> or another explanation in the <URL> . Technically , this means that where separation between IFR and VFR traffic is not provided and aircraft on both flight rules can operate , a Boeing 737 would have to yield to any powered or non-powered aircraft coming from the right . In most jurisdictions you will find a passage that also details that aircraft should give way to other aircraft that are established on final approach , so a strong situational awareness in the vicinity of airports and airfields is required . Whether separation is provided between IFR and VFR within a traffic pattern , is based on the jurisdiction and the airspace class . In most cases of smaller general aviation aircraft and larger/faster general aviation or commercial aircraft operating at uncontrolled airfields , the smaller aircraft will yield to the faster traffic already on the final approach path out of courtesy or due to good airmanship . It is easier and also cheaper for a smaller general aviation aircraft to perform a 360 ° turn than for e.g. a Learjet on final approach . See related question : <URL> .

Are there any electric ultralight aircraft ?
<URL> offers a Part 103 legal trike , and at least as of two years ago , had a flying prototype of a more conventional designed single-seat Part 103 legal ultralight . Realistically , given the weights of engines and batteries compared to the weights of the Rotax or similar engines usually used on ultralights , it 's possible to turn many Part 103 designs into electric power , provided you 're willing to do the engineering work yourself . For a fairly extreme example , see <URL> , a twin electric motor conversion of the Lazair ultralight that retains its Part 103 status .
<URL> has a list of historical routes both by <URL> and ( a few ) <URL> . Though it is not complete , it has a lot of data .
Yes , there are runways numbered on only one side . For example , the third runway in the Frankfurt Airport ( 18 , Runway west ) is used only for takeoffs ( to the south ) and not for landings . Hence only number 18 is used . The other runways are used for both takeoffs and landings and are numbered 07C/25C , 07R/25L and 07L/25R . <URL> Thomas Römer / OpenStreetMap data [ <URL> ] , <URL> This restriction is due to the fact that it will interfere with the traffic in other runways . <URL> Number 36 is not painted .
<URL> Four sets of measured data can be seen in this plot , the difference caused by different Reynolds numbers during measurement . The figure is from Helicopter Performance , Stability and Control by Raymond Prouty . The book is still for sale and is a treasure cove of knowledge on all things sub-sonic . From page 426 onwards it has a section on representing airfoil data with equations , using NACA 0012 as example . <URL> This graph is from Theory Of Wing Sections by Abbott &amp; Von Doenhoff . Contains a chapter of compressibility effects . $ C_L $ and $ C_M $ are more extensively represented in the reference books than $ C_D $ , which is more generally lumped into considerations of Mach divergence number . The same two books will help you further . The NACA technical report server can be of help as well , a starting point there would be NACA TR 832 .
All wings warp . The extent of warping is one restriction which limits the fast side of the <URL> . Once aircraft designers realized that thick wings have less drag , they tried to build their wings as stiff as possible . Stiff wings allow to use airfoils with rear loading , will have <URL> and keep their shape even when operating at high dynamic pressure . Since the center of pressure moves chordwise on cambered airfoils depending on the angle of attack , any cambered wing will suffer from pitching moments around its axis of elasticity . This moment will <URL> and change the incidence of the outer wing sections . A stiff wing will suffer less twisting and stay closer to its ideal aerodynamic shape . Add an aileron , and another twisting moment is added on top . Now the wing twists opposite to the aileron deflection ! This can become so bad that most of the aileron 's effectiveness is lost as the wing is warped in a way which counteracts the lift change of the aileron . The <URL> uses this effect with an array of leading and trailing edge devices to actively warp the wing in the desired direction . Using computer-controlled deflections of small but very effective control surfaces , it creates a desired deformation of the wing for roll control . This can be compared to the effect a <URL> has on an aileron . The Flettner tab is a small control surface at the trailing edge of a larger control surface and is deflected by the pilot such that it moves the big control surface in opposite direction . It slightly reduces the effectiveness of the big control surface , but needs only a fraction of the stick force , thus helping to manually control big aircraft . Since the active wing warping of the X-53 depends on the proper functioning of the FCS and an array of movable devices , each with its own failure mode , I would hesitate to see this as a clear advantage . It allows , however , to control the aircraft at high dynamic pressure with minimal drag penalties .
<URL> provides cloud tops for weather with precipitation . Cloud tops with no precip can be discerned from data provided in the Skew-t log ℗ charts that are part of this app <URL> Where the temperature and dew point on the skew-t charts are converged you can expect clouds . If the convergence extends into the freezing level indicated on the chart you can expect icing .
For larger aircraft , likely no . Worst case they can carry enough fuel to return to their origin . If range does became an issue ( e.g. Atlanta - > Anchorage ) you would just schedule a technical stop somewhere like Yellowknife . Alaska has a ton of small airfields so short-range aircraft would have many alternatives . Wether the alternate has any services is another question . As the question asks about US airports only , mainland - > Hawaii would be a possibility . Hawaiian Air 's 717 planes already need extra tanks in the fuselage to get to the mainland , so a return flight would be weather-dependent . If you take off from Seattle and several airports close for bad weather after you pass the no-return point your options are rather limited . If the weather is bad enough to close every airport in the islands then channeling Sullenberger wo n't help much . Unlikely any sane pilot would take off with that kind of forecast , and Hawaii 's weather is usually pretty good .
Yes , there are several systems . The simplest are REALLY BIG WINDOWS ( and binoculars ) : <URL> When the entire wall in front of you is an big expanse of glass looking out over the runway there 's a good chance you 'll notice something trying to roll onto the runway . Many runway incursions are detected visually . Really big windows do n't work as well when you have multiple runways and larger airport complexes though , so we have some technological solutions too . The most common is Automated Surface Detection Equipment ( ASDE ) , the one being deployed today is <URL> . This is basically " radar on the ground " which interrogates aircraft transponders and shows the controllers which aircraft are where on the airport surface : <URL> There are also systems on the ground designed to prevent incursions , but those are mainly for use by pilots . These include <URL> , <URL> ( which include " stop bars " that light up on hold-short lines ) , and " runway guard lights " ( which may be mounted either in the pavement or <URL> ) . Many of these systems can be controlled from the tower , either by automatic systems or manually by the controllers .
The regulatory bodies are <URL> in defining a regulation for that . Because there are first officers who do not hold an <URL> . The airlines would need to add an extra flight member for that rare situation . Instead , it 's up to each airline 's SOP when it comes to <URL> . There are various assertiveness training models , <URL> are PACE , and CUS . Probe-Alert-Challenge-Emergency Concerned-Uncomfortable-Safety Facing battery depletion following an electrical failure , here 's <URL> for what the last step of PACE could have been like on <URL> : Captain , if you do n't immediately reverse course and get back to night VFR conditions , I must take over control of the airplane . I can not allow you to subject the passengers to such an unnecessary and high risk of certain death . Under these conditions , it is my duty and responsibility to relieve you of your command . Or , it can be much shorter when there 's no time , such as yelling , " I have control , " and pressing the TO/GA to initiate a go-around , for example . Some airlines <URL> , i.e. , " I 've mentioned my concern once , this will be the second and final time , <URL> . "
The <URL> says : The system uses power from the engines , thus reducing their maximum performance . With the anti-ice system on , the highest altitude at which the overloaded aircraft could fly -- without stalling -- was reduced to 31,900 feet ( 9,700 m ) . The de-icing system on most turbine aircraft ( including MD-82 involved in that accident ) uses bleed air from the engines , that is it extracts some air from behind the ( low pressure stage of the ) compressor . This air is therefore not ejected from the nozzle and not producing thrust , so the thrust is reduced . Or fuel flow rate increased if thrust levers are advanced to compensate , provided the engines are still below their maximum permitted thrust setting . Either way fuel consumption per mile increases . Compressing air increases it 's temperature , so this pressurized air is simply blown through tubes under the critical surfaces . There are other uses of bleed air , mainly pressurization and air-conditioning , but turning on deicing increases it 's consumption significantly . And note that this switching de-icing off and on was part of the accident sequence . It was only because they turned de-icing off that they were able to climb to FL330 in the first place . It is also often not allowed to use de-icing when outside temperature is higher than some value because the heated surfaces could overheat .
It depends on the aircraft , but in general the answer is that there are no regulatory age limitations , and indeed we have many aircraft flying that are 50 + years old . A notable exception is the Robinson line of piston helicopters . <URL> , whichever comes first , at which point the entire airframe must be completely overhauled . Some of the airframes are indeed rebuilt , but some are also scrapped , depending on level of wear and corrosion . Since the airframe lifetime is in the LIMITATIONS section of the POH , it is governed by : § 91.9 Civil aircraft flight manual , marking , and placard requirements . ( a ) Except as provided in paragraph ( d ) of this section , no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating limitations specified in the approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual , markings , and placards , or as otherwise prescribed by the certificating authority of the country of registry .
Some years ago there were a couple of flight schools on Malta , I 'm not sure if they are still operating , DuckDuckGo could probably tell you The most common way of getting a JAR ( pre-EASA ) PPL ( for UK trainees ) outside the UK used to be to go to a JAR accredited school in the USA . Florida was very popular . I expect there are schools in the US that are allowed to train to the EASA syllabus these days . I think you need to travel on a training visa to do this and I 'm not sure what is involved in getting one I think I 'm right in saying your flight test can be taken by an EASA examiner anywhere , no need to come home to do it ( and anyway you 'd want to do it over familiar territory ) A big warning to anyone learning to fly is not to pay upfront . Pay lesson by lesson . Flying schools can go bust very quickly , many students have lost a lot of money this way Personally , I would be wary of training outside the UK , the weather conditions and procedures will be very different from what you are used to , and a low-hours pilot could easily get caught out . Marginal conditions can go bad on you very quickly . If you do do this , try to get some supplementary lessons in poorish weather and get some time fly through UK CAS to get used to ATC procedures
In the United States moored balloons ( or kites ) are governed under <URL> ( a much neglected and very short corner of the regulations that also covers amateur rocketry and " unmanned free balloons " -- looking at your profile it 's probably a section you 'd find very interesting ! ) . In this particular case you 're probably looking for <URL> . The FAA is mum on the specific engineering requirements of mooring systems - I expect they anticipate you will work with structural and mechanical engineers to design a tethering system that can safely hold the loads your moored object will place on it ( or just tie it to the biggest , most structurally secure thing you can find , with a nice heavy rope and a proper knot ) . There are a few things they ARE pretty specific about though . Some operating limitations ( altitude , size , location , visibility ) . The fact that you have to tell them about it in advance ( At least if it 's more than 150 feet AGL , per ) Lighting and marking requirements for the tether ( s ) ( , which basically says the mooring line must have pennants ( daytime ) and/or lights ( nighttime ) to ensure visibility ) What happens to Balloons if the tether breaks ( , which basically says if the balloon breaks free of its moorings you need a " rapid deflation device " that gets it down in a hurry so it 's not just wandering around up there ) . Interestingly they do n't seem to care so much if a kite escapes its moorings .
What are the requirements for radio systems in aircraft ? Generally there are n't any , at least as far as " being required to have radios " . It is perfectly legal to fly around in most of the United States in a Piper Cub with no radios of any kind . Indeed , unless it 's been retrofitted with one a Piper Cub would have no electrical system at all - so you would only be able to fly under " daytime VFR conditions " in airspace not requiring communication with air traffic control ( absent special arrangements ) . If you elect to fly an aircraft equipped with radios ( as most of us do ) there are specific requirements those radios must meet , which are described in <URL> . This is not a comprehensive list , but : For Communication radios these are outlined in <URL> and TSO C-169a . Transponders must meet specific TSO performance criteria per <URL> Navigation Radios ( VOR/ILS/ADF ) must meet specific TSO performance criteria if used under instrument flight rules . The TSO number for these escape me at the moment but I 'm sure you can look them up . GPS systems must meet TSO C145c / TSO C146c requirements ( if used for IFR navigation ) . The Emergency Locator Transmitter ( ELT ) must meet specific TSO criteria . The requirements obviously vary based on the type of radio , and typically reference other industry standards ( for example <URL> for VHF communication radios sends you over to RTCA/DO -186 B for the actual performance criteria ) .
Why would you fly with a <URL> when you can have a clean aircraft ? Sure , there are many canard kit plane designs , but when you look closer at their performance , its is not improved by the location of the elevator . <URL> would always choose a higher wing loading than required to fulfill the <URL> , so his designs could cruise faster . When asked about this , his usual response was " ** ck the FAA ! " . When you look closely , canards will give you : With natural pitch stability a higher lift coefficient on the forward wing which also needs to have some margin for control surface deflections . Consequently , the big , rear wing is operating at a fraction of its potential when the aircraft stalls . The vorticity from the front wing creates a <URL> at the mid section of the rear wing and an upwash at the outer sections . The strength of these induced speeds varies with speed , so the main wing can produce an elliptic circulation at only one angle of attack . At other angles , its induced drag is higher than what is possible with a conventional configuration . The center of gravity is ahead of the main wing , so the landing gear needs to retract into the fuselage , taking space away from the cockpit . To move the wing center section forward , so it can accommodate the landing gear , the wing needs to be swept ( <URL> ) . There is no good position to put a vertical surface , so again sweep is used to shift some part of the airframe backwards and combine the vertical with winglets . Those need to point upwards , so they do not hit the ground during take-off and landing when the <URL> . Canards start to make sense when they are <URL> , but this is not a good approach for a GA aircraft .
Best is to contact your FAA regional office as the details of the procedures seem to vary a bit depending on your region , and the use of the airport . <URL> gives guidance the lighting and lighting of obstructions that may affect the airspace . The first paragraph reads : A sponsor proposing any type of construction or alteration of a structure that may affect the National Airspace System ( NAS ) is required under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations ( 14 CFR part 77 ) to notify the FAA by completing the Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration form ( FAA Form 7460-1 ) . The form should be sent to the Obstruction Evaluation service ( OES ) . Copies of FAA Form 7460-1 may be obtained from OES , Airports District Office or FAA Website at <URL> . More information can be found here <URL> . The reporting requirements are laid down in <URL>
Height is not the barrier . People have flown off Mount Everest - see <URL> as one example - though not when the jet stream is blowing over/around the mountain . The problem is at the boundary layer between jet stream and none jet stream air when the aircraft only have air speeds of 20-50mph . The mixing of air , and the sudden hit of jet stream air speed will be well in excess of the gliders max air speed . It has however been done in a hot air balloon . <URL>
A warm up apron is a portion of the airfield close to the runway entry , where the engine can be warmed up before taking off . It seems to be more frequently used in military documentation . There are such aprons at Cairns Army Airfield : <URL> <URL> Found in FAA regulations , e.g. <URL> : PAPI LHAs must not be located closer than 50 ft from a crossing runway , taxiway , or warm-up apron or within the ILS critical area . But also in other not regulatory documents , here for synonymous of hardstand : ... construction of the RMP test section and warm-up apron ( hardstand ) at the east end of Runway 04-22 . The RMP warm-up apron was successfully constructed and has been opened for traffic since October 1992 . Source : <URL> A vintage post-card : <URL> Source : <URL>
As in anything in aviation design , the use of wingtips has both advantages and disadvantages . In the end , the decision to use ( or not ) a winglet is based on the cost-benefit analysis of the winglet to be used in that particular aircraft . All winglets incur a drag and weight penalty - the question is whether they conserve fuel more than they increase it in the first place . One problem in winglet addition is that they are prone to flutter . Also , an <URL> is sometimes more effective and is less risky . Another thing to add is that most of the present aircraft using winglets ( A320s and B737s ) were not designed with winglets to begin with . They were retrofits . Most of the new aircraft are designed with plenty of aerodynamic experience and the engineers can take a call based on the data available as to whether to have ' conventional ' winglet or not ( See A350XWB Vs B787 ) . Coming to B777 , it should be noted that they have wingtip devices after all - raked wingtips . These act in the same manner as the winglets to reduce drag . <URL> Boeing 777 raked wingtip ; image from <URL> According to Boeing , Each wing on the Boeing 777-300ER ( extended range ) is being extended by 6.5 feet , and raked wingtips are being added to improve the overall aerodynamic efficiency . The raked wingtips help reduce takeoff field length , increase climb performance and reduce fuel burn . So basically , these act in the same manner as the conventional wingtips . Also , it is crucial to consider the tradeoff . B777 was designed when the advantages of the wingtips were well known , yet they decided to go without one anyway . From <URL> : Because winglets are a tradeoff : In the highly visible case of the 777 , an airplane with exceptionally long range , the wings grew so long that folding wingtips were offered to get into tight airport gates . Finally <URL> when they were first ordered , though that has not stopped Boeing from trying . Note that one main reason for offering folding wings is to fit into existing gates - else the wingspan would 've become too great . Boeing considered all the options before deciding to go with this option : Dave Akiyama , manager of aerodynamics engineering in Boeing product development , points out that designing winglets can be tricky-they have a tendency to flutter , for example . " We find that it really does n't matter what kind of wingtip device you use-they 're all like span , " he says . " The devil is in the details . Span extensions are the easiest and least risky . " And finally , <URL> , especially for the earlier versions , though nothing came out of that - so most probably they were of not much use in improving fuel burn . Note that 787 also has a similar ' raked ' wingtip instead of winglet . Note : The fuel burn can be reduced by other means than wingtip devices - Boeing <URL> for the Boeing 777 , <URL> by 1 % : ... for long-range 777s , with United , Continental , and Delta investing in modifying the outboard aileron droop and the environmental control system , making ram air improvements , and installing smaller wing vortex generators to yield a total of 1 percent fuel burn improvement .
Any yahoo can wash a plane ... even a pilot . The only regulation of which I am aware concerning washes involves maintenance . A maintainer must clean the aircraft in order to determine servicability of a component . The regulation does not specify who must do the cleaning , however . I doubt a FSDO ( in the US ) would read that as " A&amp;P must clean it . "

Why do pilots sample the fuel before a flight ?
On the first flight of the day , after every refueling , and if you have flown through precipitation or the plane is left in the rain , you check the fuel for water and to make sure you have the right kind of fuel . Since water is heavier than fuel , if there is just a little bit of water in the fuel it could cause the engine to stop . You ca n't pull over to the side of the road like you can in a car , so you need to immediately deal with the problem . The most likely place for this to occur is on takeoff . If you think fast and switch tanks , you might get lucky and only have water in one tank so you can continue your takeoff . If not , you may need to find a place to land . In 17 years of flying , I have only found water in the fuel once , and it was n't even my airplane . But since it was on Catalina Island , a stopped engine would not have been pretty . The other reason to check the fuel is that airplanes designed for 100LL do not burn Jet Fuel . Jet fuel is denser than 100LL so it will sink to the bottom of the tank . It is straw colored and somewhat greasy so you can tell if you plane has accidentally been filled with it , but you really have to be paying attention . It would be easy to miss if you just topped off . There have been incidents when twin-engine planes have mistakenly been filled with Jet A and have either crashed or had expensive fuel system cleaning required . In this article , <URL> describes his experiences . After the <URL> of a Cessna 421s someone did a <URL> to see how easy it is to identify a combination of Jet A and Avgas . It 's fairly hard using standard pre-flight practices . That 's why many people recommend watching the fuel truck if you have a twin-engine plane or one that prominently says " Turbo " on the side . Many aircraft have rubber bladders to hold the fuel . Most older Cessnas have them . Water can get trapped in the folds of the bladder and get into the engine later when the fuel is sloshed around . Even if the fuel source is free of water , a tank that is not full can have water condense in it . Most autogas has some ethanol in it . Water will dissolve in a gas-ethanol mixture and so a slug of water wo n't get into the engine like it will in an aircraft engine . Contamination is less of an issue and is one that is really hard for a GA pilot to determine . You really ca n't tell if the fuel is contaminated with other petroleum products just by looking at it .
The 737-900ER has ( two ) axillary fuel tanks in the aft cargo compartment , behind the wing ( and center of gravity ) with ~ 3400l capacity for increasing range ( from 2800nm to 3,200 nm ) . In usual conditions , unloading of passengers would n't be a problem as the fuel would 've been used up ; However , as this was an overweight landing with full fuel tanks ( the auxiliary fuel tanks weigh ~ 3t ) , the crew are just being cautious to prevent any incidents .
The short answer is that at negative 2 G , the airframe limit for the A7-E , it took little effort to keep your feet on the rudder pedals . In controlled flight there are aircraft limitations on both positive and negative G. I flew the A7-E for the US Navy and have some operational experience that might offer some context to the question . I believe the positive G was limited to somewhere between 7-9 G. Ca n't quite remember the exact number , and it did depend on the external store configuration as well . Newer aircraft have higher G loading capabilities , although the human body has its own limit . Fitness and training can extend the pilots envelope to high G . As mentioned negative G in the A7-E was limited to -2 . There was no issue at these sorts of values keeping your feet on the rudder pedals . It is worth mentioning that the rudder is controlled by the AFCS ( Automatic Flight Control System ) system and so there is no real need to keep your feet on the pedals , although I did use them at times . Negative 2 G 's was hard on the body , and a pilot would come back to the ship with bloodshot eyes after undergoing maneuvers that required this sort of thing . I can think of 3 times that a pilot would find themselves in a negative G environment . I am not including standard acrobatic maneuvers , but more tactical situations . One , and this was n't typical , was during training . At a high altitude you unloaded the aircraft to -2 G 's and set a 45 degree dive . As the airspeed increased it entered an area on the IAS instrument that was no longer valid , and this was close to Mach . The goal was to observe the characteristics of the aircraft when it went supersonic . There was a gentle pitch down as you broke the sound barrier . I did this maneuver once , although I commonly practiced 45 degree dive bombing deliveries . The second , and quite common , situation was a maneuver called a bug out . A bug out was used by a flight to engage other aircraft in air-to-air combat . It was at once a defensive and offensive maneuver . The lead called " Bug out . Bug out , " and the flight went to -2 G 's , unloading the aircraft , and giving up altitude for airspeed . As your adversary turned towards your 6-o'clock the flight would " Pitch back , " and pulling positive G 's , gaining altitude . Trading airspeed for altitude got the aircraft into slower flight where its turn rate could be maximized . The bug out placed the aircraft immediately in free fall with military thrust applied . Rolling inverted and applying positive G 's is like being in a turn in the sense that the positive G bleeds energy . The third situation was a defensive maneuver . At low airspeed and with someone directly on your 6 o'clock the pilot might try to " jink . " Jinking was a last ditch maneuver where the pilot randomly pulled maximum G , and then went full negative G. I used this against an F-14 in a fight , and afterwards the pilot came and told me he could n't get a firing solution . As for uncontrolled flight there is the flat spin which can exert substantial negative G on the pilot . If I remember correctly a flat spin had never been positively observed in an A7-E . It was postulated , however , that given asymmetric wing loading it might be possible . On the other hand the F-14 could enter a flat spin . Talking with pilots who had knowledge about this sort of flight I was told that the negative G could be large enough where it would not be possible to get your hands on the ejection handle , either low or high . Not sure about the feet :) An interesting side note . At times a pilot will find themselves in a high g turn , grunting against the inflated g-suit , and fighting the encroaching tunnel vision . When I found myself here I would pull on the stick a bit more and watch my peripheral vision go dark ( tunnel vision ) . A bit more g and the tunnel got even narrower , until it was like I was looking through a hole . Then I would ease the stick and watch the hole get bigger . Pull back and smaller . Kind of interesting .
Speaking of fighters in their basic role , there are 2 . Interception and escort . A single seat fighter would be superior in both scenarios because the space occupied by the second seater , plus the life support systems double the weight which can be put to fuel , countermeasures or weapons , and the extra weight and space will affect handling in air to air combat . When the role is ground attack , 2 seat versions can be an advantage , such as SAM suppression mission , bombing and other types of strikes . All of the above applies to modern aircraft . Previously , say the 1970s and before , 2 seat fighters were sometimes necessary due to the technology available at that time . The F-4 and F-14 for example , the 2nd seater operated the radar because the pilot really could n't keep his head in the cockpit when engaging multiple enemy contacts or when the fight was close in . Head up displays were n't available so the aircraft systems available to the pilot by necessity was kept limited in order to limit pilot overload .
Fuel systems are in general fed by gravity , at least until the fuel leaves the tank , where sometimes ( always if the tank is lower than the engine ) a pump pushes it toward the engine . This means that fuel is generally extracted from the bottom of the tank ( or slightly above the very bottom to avoid having small particles from the bottom of the tank clogging up the fuel filter , incidentally this also introduces the concept of , as the stuff remaining at the bottom of the tank , although there are a lot more factors to this ) . Fuel is less dense than water , meaning it 'll float on top of the water . Or if you want to think of it the other way around , water is heavier and will sink to the bottom , right where you 're trying to get your fuel to feed to the engine . Water does n't burn very well and the engine will stop . Avgas is generally 0.72 kg/l and Jetfuel around 0.82 kg/l ( water being 1 kg/l , see have <URL> units work well that way ? ) . A tiny amount of water probably mix with the fuel and simply reduce the power output slightly , whereas anything more will be drained from the tank first , and it 'll be very hard to restart the engine . You 'd have to pump all the water through the cylinder and out the exhaust , and I do n't think this is generally possible in flight , especially right after takeoff which is generally the case when you have water in the fuel ( could be right after switching tanks too though ) . I do n't know much about turbine engines , but I suspect they 're less susceptible as the water will not prevent relighting the engine ( the pumps will simply push the water out , there 's no cylinder that could fill up with water ) , and you 'll generally be using up more fuel on the ground making the problem readily apparent . This is pure speculation though .
Yes it is correct that helicopters use more fuel when hovering : the engine needs to apply more power to overcome drag . Here is a graph of the engine power required for different airspeeds , from J. Gordon Leishman , Principles Of Helicopter Aerodynamics : <URL> The line for total power goes down between 0 - 70 kts with increasing airspeed , this is caused by the line for induced power : power required to overcome the induced drag of the helicopter blade . The total required engine power is the summation of : Induced power . The power required to overcome the induced drag of lift creation , further detailed below . Propulsive power relates to the engine exhaust velocity now being helpful , and to the rise in induced power at higher speeds due to compressibility drag . Profile power , required for the blade profile drag . Parasitic power , for the drag caused by the air frame , rotor hub etc. . Zero in the hover , very dominant at top speed . Helicopters have shapes that are way less aerodynamic than fixed wing planes , and this source of drag becomes very significant at higher speeds . Tail rotor power . Up to 20 % of the main rotor power both in the hover and at top speed , very low in the middle due to the helpful vertical tail . At top speed the torque of the main rotor is high and the tail rotor must do more work , unless the vertical tail can be adjusted . <URL> Induced power is dominant in the hover . Induced drag is caused by the backwards tilt of the lift vector : the higher the angle between blade and free stream , the more the vector is tilted backwards , which causes both loss of lift and increase of drag . The equation for lift L is : $ $ L = C_L \ cdot \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ cdot \ rho \ cdot V ^ 2 \ cdot S$ $ and at a given altitude , the two variables here are $ C_L $ ( lift coefficient ) and $ V$ ( airspeed at the blade ) . $ C_L $ is an approximately linear function of angle of attack at the blade , so lift increases linearly with blade tilt-back and quadratically with increasing airspeed over the blade . <URL> Above graph from Leishman shows the velocity distribution over the blades when hovering , and at airspeed . Quite a complicated situation - when hovering , the airspeed reaching the blade is only the rotational speed of the rotor , at forward speed the blade going forward has rotational speed plus airspeed . The helicopter does not roll over and both forward blade and retreating blade deliver the same amount of lift , with the rearward going blade tilted back more than it was in the hover . But the forward going blade is tilted back a lot less : airspeed has a quadratic influence . Note that the circle in the plot at fwd airspeed is not stalled flow , but reverse flow : the air streams in at the back of the blade . So drag is now negative , the airstream helps to propel the blade ! However there is loss of lift in the reverse flow area . Induced power reduces with airspeed at first according to the simple 1-D impulse consideration ( more air mass through the disk ) , and later increases as the disk is increasingly tilted forward and must do more work to overcome losses from rotor profile drag , airframe parasitic drag , and compressibility drag . There is also an interference effect of the downwash over the fuselage : in the hover the air streams straight down , while in forward flight the rotor wash is more aligned with the fuselage , catching more of a streamline shape . Parasitic drag is of course dominant at top speed , while offloading the rotor by using fixed wing surfaces reduces the induced power at high speeds - but from hover to moderate forward speeds it is purely the reduction in lift induced power that creates translational lift . <URL>
So if you are well rested and not ill , but still feeling tired , there has to be something else wrong . From your description , it appears to be <URL> . The common signs for fatigue are : Falling asleep Yawning Poor visual acuity Feeling " sluggish " or " drowsy " Decreased reaction time Decreased concentration Although , the most commonly known reason for fatigue is lack of sleep , but any or all of the following can cause fatigue : Lack of quality sleep Sleep disturbances Interruption of circadian rhythm Mental or emotional stress Physical exertion , such as heavy exercise Poor health , including dehydration or poor diet Pilots can assess their own fitness to fly by the <URL> mnemonic . FAA has a small <URL> about fatigue . Now what pilots ( and generalizing , people ) can do and actually do are two very different aspects . A <URL> about European pilots mention : ... many are afraid their fatigue reports could have negative consequences for their professional future ( i.e. reprisals by management ) ... FAA has <URL> which states : The FAA expects pilots and airlines to take joint responsibility when considering if a pilot is fit for duty , including fatigue resulting from pre-duty activities such as commuting . At the beginning of each flight segment , a pilot is required to affirmatively state his or her fitness for duty . If a pilot reports he or she is fatigued and unfit for duty , the airline must remove that pilot from duty immediately . The answer to your question is : Yes , they can !
I 'm not in the military , so you could say I 'm talking out my rear end here , but based on my experience as a pilot : yes , military pilots use the autopilot all the time . Here 's my reasoning , in order of most to least convincing evidence : Punching the autopilot off takes about a fifth of a second . The button is right there on the yoke , for crying out loud . The time it takes to turn it off is not a good reason not to have it on . The autopilot is a labor-saving device . When you 're in an aircraft ( and particularly when you 're solo in one ) there are times when you 'd rather be paying attention to your chart or setting up the FMS or stretching or eating a candy bar instead of actually flying the plane . Also , when Air Force pilots fly long repositoning flights , the autopilot reduces fatigue between in-flight refuelings ( the Navy uses carriers ) . Times when you might have to leave the designated path for a mission happen a lot less than you think . Again , not in the military , I 'm just basing this on the realities of fuel and the number of military aircraft out there . Maybe if you 're flying close air support for teams on the ground or something , but remember that the military is first and foremost a logistics organization - it 's a machine for moving people and things from one place to another . Most of the time , military aircraft are n't on a hair-trigger moment 's notice ready-to-engage posture , they 're going from one airfield to another for training or maintenance or something . In most aircraft , you can override the autopilot if you need to anyway . Again , never flown a military fighter aircraft , but based on what I know about flying in general , even if you 're chilling in your F-22 ( with the autopilot on ) if you grab the stick and yank , the airplane will move . ( I would be interested to know whether this is true of Airbus aircraft . )
1 : Do pilots eat during flight or they wait until they are back on the ground ? As pilots happen to be humans , their metabolism works in a similar fashion as yours or mine work . So they eat when they are hungry . On a long flight , they can eat during the flight , but on short flights ( e.g. 30 minutes - 2 hours ) , they might not get enough free time to have a meal . On busy days , pilots may not get enough time to have proper meals , so they try to eat small meals containing more nutrition . This is detailed in an article on <URL> . They also avoid heavy meals before a flight . 2 : Do they get the same food that is served to the passengers or do they bring their own meal ? Most of the time , food served to the passengers is the same which is served to the pilots , although they do n't <URL> . An airline <URL> that : ... the pilot gets the first class meal and the copilot the business class meal .
Much like water , exposing fuel to below freezing temperatures does not instantly make it freeze . It takes some amount of time , and as long as the fuel is not exposed to below freezing temperatures long enough to make it freeze , it wo n't be a problem . How much time ? That depends on a number of factors like : Type of fuel Jet A ( common in the US ) has a freezing point of -40 C Jet A1 ( common outside the US ) has a freezing point of -47 C Jet B ( common for some military aircraft and very cold airports ) has a freezing point of -60 C Initial fuel temperature If you fuel in the middle east during the middle of summer , the fuel will be a lot warmer than when you fuel in Siberia in the middle of winter . Warmer fuel will take longer to freeze . Outside air temperature Much like trying to freeze water to form an ice cube , the colder the air around it , the faster that it will freeze . Aircraft speed The faster that the airplane goes , the more friction there is as the air flows over the wing . This heats up the air close to the wing and makes it take longer for the fuel to freeze ( see previous point ) . The temperature at the wing is known as TAT : For example , at an actual temperature of -56.5 C ( SAT ) and Mach 0.72 the TAT is -34 C , but at Mach 0.80 the TAT is -29 C. For more information about SAT - vs - TAT , see my answer about <URL> . Quantity of fuel Much like a small pond will freeze before a large lake , in order to get fuel to freeze you need to lower the temperature of all of it . The more that there is , the longer it will take . Aircraft design Some aircraft run hydraulic lines close to the fuel so that the heat will help slow down the freezing . Some aircraft constantly pump fuel to keep it moving and mixing if it tends to freeze in one part of the tank before the rest Some aircraft use fuel to cool the engine oil using a heat exchanger , and return the warmed fuel to the tanks Many other design factors In general , fuel will not freeze in the typical amount of time that an aircraft is aloft . If particular routes pose a problem , there are several options that the operator and pilot have : Use a fuel with a lower freezing point Fly at a lower altitude where it is not as cold Choose a route with warmer temperatures Increase the speed of the airplane Carry extra fuel Transfer fuel in a way to keep fuel warmer . Typically this is done by transferring fuel from the relatively warm fuselage tanks to the wing tanks which are exposed to more of the cold air .
Honestly ? It 's probably because they heard someone else do it , and thought it sounded cool ( or otherwise just got it stuck in their head ) . You 're 100 % right - saying the runway name is , if slightly longer , certainly a bit more informative . It 's the kind of thing that can help arriving pilots know which runway is in use , keeping later radio clutter ( " Um , uhh , Jeffco Traffic , um , say runway in use ? " ) to a minimum for pilots already on frequency . Even a ' one runway airport ' still has two runways ( 09/27 , for example ) , and it 's nice to know which one you should set up for when winds are light . The preferred terminology is more like " Jeffco Traffic , 3AC , clear 29 " .
Try to search " Before Takeoff Checklist " . Manufacturer will provide standard checklist but airlines can modify it .
In the US most General Aviation rentals are " Wet Hobbs Time " -- You are billed based on the actual clock time the engine was running ( in tenths of an hour ) , and fuel/oil are included in the rental price . This is attractive to renters because of the simplicity : You do n't have to pay the FBO separately for the fuel , oil , and aircraft , and you 're basically paying for the amount of " clock time " you spent in the plane . It 's easy to understand , especially for new students who may not quite grasp the concept of how the recording tachometer measures " time " . Hobbs billing is attractive to the FBO as well , for different reasons : Rentals are typically blocked out by clock hours ( " 10 AM to 2 PM " ) . Since booking is clock time billing based on clock time ( Hobbs hours ) makes sense . In practice the two numbers are usually close ( and when they 're not the error tends to favor the FBO ) . Let 's look at your " Tach vs. Hobbs " scenarios ( for the sake of simplicity let 's assume both flights are three " clock hours " chock-to-chock ) : Pattern Work Pattern work consists of three basic phases : Takeoff ( full throttle , high RPM - Tach runs faster than Hobbs ) Circuit ( low power , low RPM - Tach runs slower than Hobbs ) Descent &amp; Landing ( near idle power , very low RPM - Tach runs MUCH slower than Hobbs ) There might be a taxi in there for full-stop practice , but you 'll be close to idle there too . If we average this out over three hours of pattern work ( and assuming you and your instructor do n't commit suicide to break the monotony ) the Tach hour meter will be reading a number much lower than the Hobbs meter . In this scenario you might have 2.25 tach hours for your 3 Hobbs / Clock hours . 3-hour Cross Country A cross country consists of 5 phases : Takeoff/Climb ( full throttle , high RPM - Tach runs faster than Hobbs ) Cruise ( moderate throttle , moderate RPM - Tach and Hobbs run about the same speed ) Descent ( moderate-low throttle , moderate-low RPM - Tach may be a bit slower than Hobbs ) Circuit/Approach ( low power , low RPM - Tach runs slower than Hobbs ) Landing ( near idle power , very low RPM - Tach runs MUCH slower than Hobbs ) If we assume Phases 1 and 3 take about the same time they roughly cancel each other out . Phase 2 ( Cruise ) is a wash too , so we 're left with two brief periods where the tach is running noticeably slower than the Hobbs ( the pattern and landing at the destination ) . In this scenario you might have 2.85 Tach Hours for your 3 Hobbs / Clock hours . In both of these scenarios the FBO comes out ahead of the game -- they 're billing you for 3 hours of time , but their maintenance cycle is based on the tach . This might be enough to squeeze another day or two of profitable flying out of an airframe before it 's next annual or 100-hour inspection . There are scenarios where you can " beat " the Tach clock , but most of them involve being downright abusive to the aircraft/engine . For example if you flew that 3 hour cross country at low altitude and full throttle ( very high RPM ) you might rack up 3.3 tach hours for your 3 Hobbs hours . The FBO is basically stuck eating that maintenance expense . Along similar lines when renter pilots abuse an engine ( for example by leaving the mixture knob full rich for the whole flight ) the tach time does n't always tell the whole maintenance story - the mechanic 's time cleaning the plugs because the next renter could n't get through a runup has to be paid for somehow .
Crew members each have their own approach to this but in general on the long haul routes , as a pilot you have at least 24h layover , so you can catchup on some sleep , walk outside for a bit ( depending on the local time ) and then sleep some more so you 're fit for the next flight back home . At home you have a couple of days off to recover from the trip . On the very long flights 13h + the pilots are with at least 4 so you can do a quick nap on board as well . As a passenger I cope with the jetlag by looking at the arrival time , do I arrive in the morning I will try to sleep on the plane , will I arrive in the afternoon the I will try to stay awake and go to bed early . By doing so I wake up easily next morning and do not feel jetlagged .
The indicator must be calibrated to read zero when that tank is actually empty of all usable fuel ( in level flight ) . Bouncing is fine as long as they do not bounce when the tank is actually empty . See regs : <URL> <URL>
The " packs " ( or A/C on the aircraft ) are powered by engine bleed air . When bleed air is extracted from the engines , less thrust can be produced . This may be a problem if the airplane is taking off at a high elevation airport or the departure path requires a certain climb gradient to clear obstacles . This action does create some discomfort in the cabin so it 's usually not preferred unless required for safety . Some newer airplanes are manufactured with an " APU to pack " configuration - i.e. the pilots leave the APU running during takeoff , which provides bleed air to power the packs . The workload on the engines are now reduced .
If the front seat ejected first , the drag would probably bring him too close in the trajectory of the rear seat , thus making a collision of both probable . Since the rear seat is ejected first , it experiences drag earlier than the front seat and will thus not have an increased probability of hitting it .
A quick look at the <URL> makes it sound like , in the USA , they can enter any sort of airspace provided they can do it safely . So , theoretically , they could file a flight plan or at least alert local ATC to their activities . All of that being said , having been involved in hot air balloon operations before , I think it would not be terribly feasible . Firstly , flying a hot air balloon outside of Visual Flight Rule conditions ( being able to see several miles ) would be extremely dangerous , so you would n't need to file a flight plan for that . Secondly , you generally only want to fly a hot air balloon in very sparsely populated areas ( Class G airspace ) , and while you could have a flight plan there really is n't a need . A more congested area ( Class B or Class A ) would be extremely dangerous to navigate in a hot air balloon . It 's pretty hard to get out of the way , since controlling where you are going is ... iffy sometimes . So , in summary , yes it could be done , but in the vast majority of cases there 's little need to do it . Other than to just alert local ATC that you will be in the area .
This is generally not standard practice . For one pilot training is particularly costly ( even just in small planes ) and would simply not be worth it to the airline , which is why there are two flight capable people in the cockpit to begin with . Historically speaking there is evidence to the fact that it would not alter the outcome of the scenario . The closest instance of this occurring was possibly <URL> which lost cabin pressure at altitude incapacitating the crew and most aboard . Flight attendant Andreas Prodromou who held a UK Commercial Pilot License ( but was not trained on the B737 ) was able to remain conscious via a portable air pack and make his way to the cockpit and into the captains seat . However he was un-able to take positive ( meaningful ) control of the aircraft due to lack of experience investigators eventually concluded after the crash . <URL> FWIW , most modern airliners are sophisticated enough and <URL> that they can be flown single handedly in a manageable fashion .
( Answer completely rewritten based on new information ) Does the TSA plan to implement rules that require every prospective student to seek pre-approval from a government agent ( not just a flight school ) prior to beginning flight training ? Not exactly . US citizens can still start flight training whenever they want . But from April 1 , 2016 pre-approval from " a government agent " ( the TSA ) is required prior to soloing . Foreigners will still need TSA approval before starting flight training . The final rule on this has now been <URL> and the TSA will indeed vet all student pilots , as of 1 April 2016 ( my emphasis ) : This action requires applicants to apply for a student pilot certificate through a Flight Standards District Office , designated pilot examiner , airman certification representative associated with a pilot school , or certified flight instructor . Aviation Medical Examiners will no longer issue a combination medical certificate and student pilot certificate . Student pilot certificates will be issued on the same medium as other pilot certificates and will have no expiration date . All student pilot certificates issued before the effective date of this final rule will expire according to their terms unless they are replaced by another pilot certificate . This final rule responds to section 4012 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and facilitates security vetting by the Transportation Security Administration of student pilot applicants prior to certificate issuance . This action withdraws the proposal for pilot certificates to include a photograph of the individual pilot . But note that a student pilot 's license is still not required in order to start training , it 's only required in order to solo . So under this new rule , a US citizen can start flight training as usual , but ca n't solo until he gets TSA approval for his student pilot application : IRTPA [ the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ] required that security vetting of all individuals , including pilots , must be successfully completed by TSA before the FAA issues a certificate . Therefore , applicants for student pilot certificates must be vetted to receive their certificates and operate an aircraft as pilot in command . This also means that AMEs will no longer issue student certs , only medical certificates . The FAA expects that processing will take several weeks , which may be an issue for accelerated training programs that aim to get you a full pilot 's license in a month or less : The FAA estimates that the turnaround time for student pilot certificates can be reduced to an average of 3 weeks or less , provided that initial security vetting by TSA indicates that the applicant is eligible for the certificate . There was also some concern that it would n't be possible for pilots to solo on their 16th birthday any more because of the processing time , but the FAA <URL> , essentially by asking students to submit their application well in advance . On the ' plus ' side , the new regulation specifically says that pilots licenses will still not have a photograph ( at least for now ) , which would have added more time and costs to the whole process . And the new student certificates will be plastic , not paper .

Having flight training has no effect at all on your visa status . It 's actually the other way around : your visa status can determine <URL> . But you can definitely get flight training with an H1B . And flying has no special impact on your job : how you choose to spend your free time is none of your employer 's business . There could be some very specific scenarios where flight training and work intersect , e.g. if your company is in the aviation sector you might be able to get them to pay for training . Or if you 're a very senior executive at a very large company then the Board of Directors might have concerns about you spending your time on ' risky ' activities . But otherwise , flying has nothing at all to do with your work .
The directional gyro ( DG ) does not know about heading . Its gyroscope will hold its position ( e.g. the heading you set from the magnetic compass ) in space . The plane is turning " around it " , but DG is holding its position , so you can read the heading from the scale fixed to the airplane while the gyroscope holds its position in space . Only friction and other forces ( acceleration forced upon the aircraft ) force the gyroscope to wander from its position . E.g. the gyro shows a magnetic heading if set using a magnetic compass and it shows a true heading if set using a GPS ( or some map feature like a road with a heading visible on a map ) .
The short answer is to use color in some way . I could n't find anything very detailed on this : there 's plenty of general checklist information out there from the FAA , NASA , universities and so on , but nothing that goes into specific details on how to use colors , fonts or the other things that you mentioned . There is <URL> called The Use and Design of Flightcrew Checklists and Manuals that was part of the response to the <URL> . Unfortunately it 's from 1991 so some content is already dated , and it 's aimed at part 121 and 135 operators with multiple crew members , but it 's an interesting report anyway . Their main recommendation on memory items was simply to reduce them as much as possible because memory is very unreliable compared to checklists , but again that 's in the context of multi-member crews . As for design , layout , formatting etc. , they did make some specific recommendations ( see section 4.1 and Appendix A ) and the most applicable one to your question seems to be the use of color-coding . They strongly recommended the use of color as a general method , e.g. headings in yellow for " abnormal " items and in red for " emergency " items . Interestingly , the report says that at that time ( 1991 ) airlines resisted using color because of the costs of printing , but today it <URL> to highlight critical checklists and items . However , each checklist provider has their own approach to coloring headers , text , blocks or even entire pages . I do n't think there 's any such thing as a standard ' style guide ' for checklists , so if you 're making your own then you can obviously do whatever you want that works for you . But the 1991 report noted that most checklist problems were caused by missing or inaccurate items , so make sure you get the content right before you break out your paintbrushes :-)
Since he does n't manage to make it back to the runway from his 2000 ft engine flameout run I was wondering if not deploying the RAT would make any difference due to reduced drag ? No , because it deploys automatically . Note that in the video in the first attempt the step is not done because there is less time . It is probably included in the checklist just in case the automation did n't do it 's job . Nevertheless , let 's try to estimate the drag . All I could quickly find about the RAT is that the attached electric generator provides 5 kW , but that should be enough . We need to take into account the hydraulic pump and power losses , but the generator would n't be insignificant part of the load , so we could guess that the turbine does not have more than 50 kW of drag . Now potential energy is $ E_p = mhg $ , differentiating by time we get $ P = v _ { vert } mg $ and solving for vertical speed $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { P } { mg } $ . Taking some " median " weight of 60 t ( A320 has MZFW 62.5 t and MLW 66 t ) and substituting we get : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 50 \ \ mathrm { kW } } { 6 \ cdot10 ^ 4 \ \ mathrm { kg } \ cdot 9.8 \ \ mathrm { ms } ^ { -2 } } \ approx 0.085 \ \ mathrm { ms } ^ { -1 } \ approx 17 \ \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ So the deployed RAT increases the rate of descent by less than 20 ft/min . Now the video mentions the best glide speed would be 205 knots ( I suppose it is for the 1 + F configuration ; for clean it sounds too low , though I do n't have a reference for this ) . Since the L/D ratio is around 18 , that would give the total descent rate about : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 205 \ mathrm { knot } } { 18 } \ approx 11 \ mathrm { knot } \ approx 1150 \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ Except , well , 18 is clean L/D . The L/D at 1 + F is a bit lower . I do n't have reference for that either , but something like 10 -- 12 sounds right , so : $ $ v _ { vert } = \ frac { 205 \ mathrm { knot } } { 12 } \ approx 17 \ mathrm { knot } \ approx 1730 \ mathrm { ft/min } $ $ . That is about 100 times more . So the RAT might increase drag by 1 % . It was very rough estimate , so it may be 2 % or 0.5 % , but it definitely is n't that significant . Would the on-board batteries and windmilling engines be able to provide sufficient power for control surfaces ? The training manual mentions that If engine wind milling is sufficient , additional hydraulic power may be recovered . without saying at what speeds that would be , but generally the speed for wind milling engine restart are significantly higher that the best glide speed . I 'd say the necessary speed would be more than 250 knots . Also , are there real life incidents of a 2000 ft ( or lower ) dual engine failure that made a safe return to the runway ? Sully Sullenberger 's A320 had reached approx . 3,000 ft , yet he was forced to ditch rather than return . I ca n't find any other incidents involving dual engine failure on A320-family aircraft besides US Airways 1549 . And I am not aware of any incidents on any other aircraft that would fit that criteria either . It should however be noted , that flight 1549 likely had enough altitude to return to the runway -- if the manoeuvre was executed perfectly . A small mistake and they 'd crash into populated area since the airport is in the middle of a city . The Sullenberger 's great airmanship was in that he chose the worse option that he was certain he can make over the better option where he was not . Does the energy management differ drastically from type to type ? i.e. Among dual engined aircraft would some be easier to land from a 2000 ft dual engine failure than others ? Principally it 's the same for any type . But since turn radius increases drastically with speed , slower aircraft can turn faster and thus could return from lower altitude . Here 's a related question that discusses the manoeuvre ; and it 's dangers : <URL>
Check out <URL> published by the FAA which seems to be recent and some notes <URL> on the same topics . The full rules can be found in the FAR at <URL> They are required to do a preflight risk analysis as per § 135.617 but this is not really any different than what anyone should be doing before any flight however for them it is very specifically outlined . ( a ) Each certificate holder conducting helicopter air ambulance operations must establish , and document in its operations manual , an FAA-approved preflight risk analysis that includes at least the following -- ( 1 ) Flight considerations , to include obstacles and terrain along the planned route of flight , landing zone conditions , and fuel requirements ; ( 2 ) Human factors , such as crew fatigue , life events , and other stressors ; ( 3 ) Weather , including departure , en route , destination , and forecasted ; ( 4 ) A procedure for determining whether another helicopter air ambulance operator has refused or rejected a flight request ; and ( 5 ) Strategies and procedures for mitigating identified risks , including procedures for obtaining and documenting approval of the certificate holder 's management personnel to release a flight when a risk exceeds a level predetermined by the certificate holder . ( b ) Each certificate holder must develop a preflight risk analysis worksheet to include , at a minimum , the items in paragraph ( a ) of this section . ( c ) Prior to the first leg of each helicopter air ambulance operation , the pilot in command must conduct a preflight risk analysis and complete the preflight risk analysis worksheet in accordance with the certificate holder 's FAA-approved procedures . The pilot in command must sign the preflight risk analysis worksheet and specify the date and time it was completed . ( d ) The certificate holder must retain the original or a copy of each completed preflight risk analysis worksheet at a location specified in its operations manual for at least 90 days from the date of the operation .
I am going to assume that by " critical " , you mean survivable . I will also assume that the engine failure occurs at a height which will kill you . It 's not so much critical steps , it 's critical outcomes . The single most critical outcome is to preserve , or regain , rotor RPM . What steps are needed to do this will depend on what the aircraft is doing when the engine quits and , to a lesser extent , the type of the helicopter . I will generalise for an " average " helicopter in straight and level flight . The immediate action that is drilled into everyone from the very earliest hours as a student is to lower the collective . Doing this has three effects . It removes the positive pitch from the blades which removes most of the drag , it aligns the rotor thrust vector with the axis of rotor rotation therefore not using rotor energy for anything except lift and it causes a clutch to disengage the rotor from the engine allowing it to freewheel . From this point onwards , you are heading back towards earth . The second immediate action at the same time as lowering the collective ( assuming forward flight ) is to pull back on the cyclic to flare . This loads the disc which causes it to " cone " upwards which reduces the disc diameter . Therefore , the centre of gravity of the disc moves inwards and due to conservation of angular momentum , the rotor RPM increases . For quite complex reasons , the nose of the helicopter will also pitch down when the collective is lowered so pulling back counters that tendency . The third immediate action is to push in the pedal on the opposite side to the rotation of the blades . If the blades rotate counter clockwise ( to the left as the pilot sees it ) you push in right pedal to reduce the thrust which is produced by the tail rotor which is no longer countering the yaw caused by the drag from the powered rotor . This is less critical than the first two and although it can be dangerous and get you into an uncomfortable attitude , it is usually possible to recover from not pushing the pedal in immediately . If you 've got rotor RPM , then you can sort it out . Now you have successfully entered autorotation . From here , fly more or less normally to the next critical point which is about 50 ' off the ground . What you 've done is to ensure that the rotor has flying RPM and that you are managing energy by trading potential energy ( height ) for kinetic energy ( rotor RPM ) . The conversion is done by the airflow which now comes from under the disc and " drives " the rotor to maintain RPM . The pitch is neutral , or maybe even negative but , the relative airflow is now upwards through the disc and therefore , the blades have a positive angle of attack and generate some lift . This stops the helicopter from falling . There is some drag generated as a consequence of generating that lift , but it is easily overcome by the power which is now driving the rotor from that upward airflow . As long as you are descending , that conversion will happen and your RPM will be maintained . The controls are rigged such that with the collective fully down , RPM will remain in the normal range . Sometimes you have to tweak it a little with small amounts of collective , flares and turns but in general , you just fly towards your landing spot . The allowed RPM range is greater in autorotation . For example ( and from memory ) , the R22 has a range of 97-103 % in normal flight and 90-110 % in autorotation . You are now descending with a high rate of descent and usually , significant forward speed . You need to reduce both of those to get to a safe arrival . To do this , there are three more critical steps . Starting at about 50 feet ( depending on lots of factors but let 's stick with the average helicopter which entered autorotation from straight and level with significant altitude ) , you flare the aircraft by pulling back on the cyclic . This will immediately begin to slow the aircraft . It will also begin to increase RPM ( you are now converting speed into rotor kinetic energy ) . At the same time , you increase collective to reduce the rate of descent by increasing the lift generated . This will rapidly increase the drag , but now the energy needed to maintain the RPM is coming from the flare which is converting speed into RPM . You also need to put in pedal to stop the aircraft from yawing as the drag increases on the rotor . Providing you get the entry right and your flare reduces the speed and rate of descent to something survivable , then you will walk away . You might wreck the helicopter and break some bones , but arrive at 10 feet with only 20 knots and 150 feet per minute rate and you 'll get away with it . If you are well trained and in practice , then you will land safely and smoothly with no damage to machine or people . In summary , critical steps : Entry . Lever down , cyclic back , pedal in . Arrival . Cyclic back , lever up , pedal in .
The worst case depends on the kind of bullet . If a tracer bullet hits an empty fuel tank which contains a mixture of air and fuel vapor , an explosion will follow . A regular bullet will just punch a hole into the tank , but will not be hot enough to start combustion . On today 's airliners and combat aircraft the fuel tanks will be filled with an inert gas , so there is not enough oxidizer present to support combustion . Even the tracer bullet will have no effect . Now the tank will have a hole , however , and if it is below the fuel level , some of it will leak out and could be ignited by a hot object . This will be the main source of fire , but will not lead to an explosion . Since WWII , most military aircraft used <URL> , to much the same effect . This was a double-skinned tank with a rubber middle layer which would swell when wetted with fuel and close the hole .
@Ron Beyer 's comment is correct . Here 's a little more information . Generally speaking , in narrow-body aircraft , it 's sufficient to calculate the CG only along the longitudinal axis . There may be limits along the lateral axis but which would only be exceeded with severely imbalanced wing fuel loads , and that is often handled by specifying a maximum fuel load imbalance . Wide body aircraft typically require looking at the lateral CG as well as the longitudinal CG . However , the allowed lateral moment about the longitudinal axis may be high enough that the limitation comes into play only when carrying cargo . That 's the case with 747-100/200 / 400 aircraft . As I remember , the max lateral imbalance for a 747-400 is 10,000,000 inch-lbs . There are some fixed-wing aircraft that require looking at the vertical CG . The 767-300 does . I do n't know about other 767 models . It 's not an issue for 747s . If you 're interested in playing with CG movement on 747-400 and 767-300 aircraft , you can go to <URL> and look at worked examples or do your own .
I 'll tackle the " How " first - you call up Flight Service ( either on the radio or on the phone after you land ) and tell them you have a pilot report . There 's a <URL> , and if you give all the information in the order it appears on that form it 's faster for you and the person taking the report . If you 're filing a pilot report on the ground for conditions you encountered enroute you need to specify the ( Zulu ) time of your observation ( or tell the briefer " 20 minutes ago " ) . In the air it 's generally assumed your report is for " now " . Pilots are requested to provide pilot reports for significant deviations from the forecast weather , or for hazardous conditions . Basically we provide them as a courtesy and service to our fellow pilots ( like flashing your lights at other cars on the highway if you know there 's a speed trap ) . Some pilot reports you may want to file in flight are if the Winds Aloft differ from the forecast . If the forecast told you you should have a 10 knot tailwind and you actually have a 5 knot headwind that 's pretty significant , and if you tell Flight Service they will pass it along to the weather forecasters and they 'll factor it in to their next Winds Aloft calculation . It will also appear in the next pilot 's briefing so they 'll know the winds in the forecast are n't correct . Another example is turbulence : If you 're encountering continuous moderate chop at 7,000 feet but smooth air at 9,000 feet providing that information could be useful to the next pilot flying through the same area . A classic example of a PIREP you file after you 're on the ground is icing : If there was no icing in the forecast but you 've encountered some you should report these conditions . If you 're under ATC control you 'll obviously tell them , but when you 're on the ground you should call Flight Service and file a formal pilot report . Again , the information will be passed to the weather forecasters and the icing AIRMET will be updated , and your PIREP will be passed along to other folks in their briefings to keep them out of the ice .
You need 2 things before you can start flight training in the U.S. : An appropriate visa . A tourist visa ( B2 ) , business visa ( B1 ) or VWP ( Visa Waiver Program ) is not accepted TSA clearance through the <URL> The <URL> is documented at the AOPA website . In a nutshell , this is what you need to do : Make sure you have a proper visa or permanent resident card ( green card ) . A visa that allows you to live in the U.S. is fine ( you do n't need a specific visa for flight training ) . Examples of appropriate visas : H1B , H4 , L1 , L2 but there are many others If you do n't have one of the visas mentioned above , you need to apply for a student visa ( M-1 ) . You need to contact a flight school that will assist you with the visa application . Contact a flight school if you have n't already done so in the previous step . They will register your " case " and provide you with information you need when applying for TSA clearance . Apply for the AFSP program on the TSA website Wait for approval by the TSA ( is a multistep process that could take a while . It includes having your fingerprints scanned , among other things ) Start your training
<URL> , Appendix B lists violations and the civil penalties ( fines ) and certificate actions which are to be imposed by the FAA . The rest of the document also discusses how investigations of certain violations are undertaken and thresholds . That order gives much more detail than you 'd ever want to know . A common theme is revocation is called for when the action is intentional . These are what are the FAA initially charges you with , so they are higher than what actually happens . A certificate action is either negotiated as a settlement , or if it ca n't , it goes before an administrative law judge , then <URL> , then appealed to the Federal court system .
An airplane can slow down and reduce its speed while in flight . The easiest way to do so is to reduce the amount of thrust that the engines are producing . This will produce an almost immediate reduction of the airspeed , especially if the plane is maintaining the same altitude . There are also devices called <URL> and <URL> that can be further used to reduce speed . These , however , are never1 used in normal , level flight by passenger2 aircraft and are normally only used to reduce speed during the descent and landing phases of the aircraft3 . If an airplane reduces its speed too much , it will of course stall and start dropping precipitously , at which time the airspeed usually also increases again . The slowest speed an aircraft can maintain at a given altitude without stalling is listed in its <URL> However in the scenario you mentioned ( obstacles ahead ) , it 's usually easiest to simply fly around the obstacle . 1 : <URL> 2 : The situation is different in military aircrafts , you can see the approaching Su-27 using its airbrake in <URL> 3 : The wheels of most aircraft also have brakes , similar to those found on automobiles . Obviously these can only be used when the plane is touching the ground . Lowering retracted landing gear will also increase drag . There are also <URL> on some aircraft that are used in the final stages of landing . Use of thrust reversers during flight can be <URL> although some older aircraft ( including the C-17A ) were designed to use thrust reversal to scrub speed in-flight . Finally , some gliders and larger aircraft have <URL> to help slow them down , for example for use on short runways .

Adverse Yaw created by the propellor will vary based on aircraft and design . Lots of modern single engine aircraft do things to counter act adverse yaw but if we take a pretty neutral aircraft design and apply the tabs you reference all you will see is a slightly more aggressive rudder . Since there is a tab in each direction in a centered situation they will cancel each other out however they will cause the rudder to have a more drastic impact at smaller angles of deflection . What actually happens ? Does the neutral position of the rudder change at different power settings when flying straight and level ? Does this arrangement reduce your foot workload compared to other aircraft ? The neutral position of the rudder will always change a bit as the power settings vary . For this you have <URL> . Generally speaking a lot of GA planes have a bit of left rudder trim always in to counteract <URL> some even have permanent design features to do so . It should also be noted that <URL> is most prominent at high angles of attack and high power settings ( takeoff and climb out ) generally this also means lower airspeeds . Once you settle into cruise its effects are decreased . I have never felt that it adds to my work load when flying but <URL> may have a different opinion on that ... The design you mention does not really reduce workload , for that you would need something like a <URL> some new planes like the <URL> .
Well , the 3 points you make are easily demonstrable to be true , and also a fairly unique feature of all three if looked at side-by-side . The 747 is the only one with an obvious hump towards the front of the aircraft . This upper row of windows is unlike either of the other two Photo Aldo Bidini : : source : <URL> The A380 has an entire upper row of windows - it does indeed have 2 full decks . Richard Vandervord source : <URL> If it has 4 engines , but neither a half upper deck and hump or a full upper deck ( and it 's an airbus ! ) then yes it is an A340 Aero Icarus source : <URL> However , that is not all the 4 engine passenger aircraft . The BAe 146 is a 4 engine regional airliner , and you could add to your distinguishing features " has a T-tail , must be a 146 " Adrian Pingstone source : <URL> And then we 're into the Ilyushins . The Il-96 , is easily distinguishable from the similar ( ish ) A340 as it is considerably smaller - hard to tell from a close-in photo , but in real life if one were parked next to the other the IL-96 is smaller . Anna Zvereva source : <URL> The Il-86 has 4 engines but does not fit your criteria , as it only remains in service with the Russian Military , but the Il-62 is still in commercial service . It 's very easy to distinguish by having its 4 engines mounted on the tail Tim Rees source : <URL>
Yes , this is allowed , subject to certain conditions . See <URL> ( the ATC " bible " ) , section 5-5-7 , for the full details . ... all other approved separation may be discontinued and passing or diverging separation applied when ... Aircraft are on opposite/reciprocal courses and you have observed that they have passed each other ; or aircraft are on same or crossing courses/assigned radar vectors and one aircraft has crossed the projected course of the other , and the angular difference between their courses/assigned radar vectors is at least 15 degrees . That 's in the terminal environment ; it 's still possible in the enroute environment but a bit more restrictive due to the greater aircraft speeds and poorer radar accuracy .
Yes , your last sentence gets it about right . Just one detail : Air does not move " forward " to flow out again once it has entered the intake - which air goes where is all settled ahead of the intake . Never forget , though , that this effect is small and spillage leaves a net drag component . When compared to a sharp-lipped intake as used on supersonic planes , subsonic intakes are more forgiving for a mismatch between capture area ( area of the stream tube which goes into the engine ) and the actual intake lip area . Below I tried to fake the flow around an intake lip using Inkscape and added blue and red shading to indicate pressure . The core flow gets compressed ahead of the intake ( blue shade , diverging streamlines ) while the outer flow is pushed to the outside of the intake lip by the increasing pressure and now has to follow the contour of the intake . Like with <URL> , the air is accelerated ( converging flow lines ) and a suction peak forms on the intake lip ( red shading ) . This suction peak sits on the forward-facing part of the intake lip and provides some suction . The sharp intake lip of a surpersonic intake would produce separated flow under the same conditions with a considerable increase in drag . <URL>
Induced drag is caused by the backward inclination of the lift vector . Lift is defined as the aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction , and since lift is created by <URL> , the resulting force is slightly inclined backwards . The formula for the deflection angle ( called <URL> ) $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ To arrive at the drag , you now need to multiply the local lift with this angle . For small $ \ alpha_w $ s the arcus tangens can be neglected , and we get this familiar looking equation for the backwards-pointing component of the aerodynamic force : $ $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ cdot AR } = \ frac { \ alpha_w ^ 2 \ cdot \ pi \ cdot AR } { 4 } $ $ Now consider a wing which will do this unevenly over the wingspan . Some parts create a lot of lift and , therefore , a lot of downward deflection . Others produce less lift and less deflection . Due to the quadratic dependency of induced drag with downwash angle , the sum of all parts will always be higher when there are variations in the local downwash angle over span . Only the wing with a <URL> will have the minimum induced drag for a given lift . This is not necessarily an elliptic wing . By selecting the right twist ( incidence variation over wingspan ) , any planform can be made to produce a constant downwash angle , albeit at only one angle of attack . Only the elliptic wing will combine the constant downwash angle over span with a constant lift coefficient over span such that variations in angle of attack still result in a constant downwash angle . This is strictly true only in inviscid flow and when elastic deformation and the weight of the wing ( which contributes to the need for lift and hence induced drag ) are not considered . Also , an elliptic wing will produce nasty stall characteristics . Adding handling , friction and structural weight will shift the optimum to wings which produce more lift near the center . The exact optimum also will depend on the absolute size of the wing because the structural mass fraction goes up with size due to <URL> .

Octane rating is a measure of how well a fuel resists detonation , which is the premature explosion of fuel in an engine cylinder before the spark is applied . This is relevant for spark ignition engines which use gasoline type fuels like avgas . Kerosene has a very low octane rating , somewhere around 15 , and is n't a good fuel for spark ignition engines as it would detonate on compression . This is why kerosene and diesel are used in diesel cycle engines which rely on the spontaneous detonation of fuel under pressure . Kerosene is not typically used in internal combustion engines , however in aviation there are turbo-diesel piston engines which run on Jet-A1 .

What are the effects of adding winglets to an aircraft not designed with winglets originally ?
Aircraft wings are designed for specific weight and cruise speed . When later the manufacturer wants to create a new variant with higher maximum weight , it should get longer wings for optimal efficiency . However , redesigning the wing is a lot of work , because extending the wing means the root bending moment increases , which requires stronger spar , which means heavier and all the calculations have to be redone . Here is where winglets get useful . They increase the effective wingspan , but while they are somewhat less efficient than extending the wing , they also cause lower increase of the root bending moment . Often , this smaller increase fits in the original extra margin , so winglets can be simply bolted on without having to redesign the wing , making the process much cheaper . That 's why we often see winglets on next generation of anything and rarely on the first generation . On first generation , they are designing the wing from scratch anyway , so they just make it appropriate length for minimum drag . The main reason to use winglets from the start is if the emerging design just slightly exceeds some size category for airport gates . Then it makes sense to reduce the span to fit and add winglets so the aircraft can be used at smaller -- and therefore cheaper and more common -- gates . You can read how winglets work in <URL> .

No . The Boeing 747 was not designed for supersonic flight , though during testing , it was <URL> : Tom Cole , a spokesman at Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. , said original flight tests of 747s conducted in 1969 and 1970 took 747-100 models to speeds of Mach 0.99 . However , the aircraft is not built for sustained supersonic speeds : ... Boeing and the FAA said the 747 is not built for sustained flight at the speed of sound . Its engines are n't powerful enough nor is it designed to deal with a destabilizing shock wave that develops around the speed of sound . However , it is just possible that the airframe and wings can cope up with the supersonic flight , at least for a little while , though any sustained flight is not possible . There have been cases where the 747 has gone quite near the speed of sound and lived to tell the tale . <URL> went into a dive and went near supersonic speeds before the captain could recover it . As a result the horizontal stabilizers were ripped off and the wing bent permanently upwards . <URL> Damage to China Airlines Flight 006 empennage . By NTSB - China Airlines Boeing 747-SP Accident Report by NTSB , <URL> , Public Domain , <URL> In 1991 , a <URL> entered a steep right wing bank and approached sonic speed before recovery was completed . <URL> : ... the airplane was in a steep right-wing-down bank . The flight lost approximately 10,000 feet of altitude , and the airplane approached supersonic speeds ( 0.98 Mach ) before the recovery could be completed . Later , the <URL> . In these cases , parts of the aircraft certainly experienced local supersonic flow ; however , the airframe and wings are not designed for supersonic flow nor are the engines powerful enough . In one case , the aircraft suffered extensive damage ( though it was repaired and returned to service ) .
In case of air to air refueling , the ' receiver ' ( the aircraft being refueled ) should be careful about not getting into the wake of the tanker , which is usually much larger and heavy . For example , the NATO air-to-air refueling manual , <URL> : The area of extreme turbulence directly behind and slightly to the right of the tanker should be avoided . Blade stall and uncontrolled settling may be encountered if this area is entered . The receiving plane is usually flown below the wake turbulence of the tanker , in both the hose &amp; drogue and flying boom methods . Usually , the receiver is directly behind and around 10 ' below the tanker . For example , see <URL> In addition to turbulence , in case of close formation flying , there are other things to contend with , as explained in <URL> : In addition to the trailing air vortices the receiving aircraft must contend with downwash of airﬂow from the tanker . The affected local airﬂow typically exhibits a nose-down pitching moment on the receiver which , in turn , affects its speed and approach rate . Not only the receiver , the tanker should also be careful about flow disturbances . ... mostly between large transport aircraft , the lead aircraft experiences a change in its airﬂow caused by the bow wave , or upwash , from the receiver . This increases the angle of attack around the tanker 's tail which also results in a pitch-down motion . Under-running the tanker is particularly dangerous since the downwash effect will dissipate , resulting in the receiver pitching up . At the same time a tanker on altitude hold may instigate a nose-down pitch due to a perceived climb due to the decrease in pressure in the surrounding air , potentially leading to collision . The figure below shows some regions where disturbances would be encountered aft of a tanker . <URL> Typical spanwise airﬂow disturbances from a trailing tanker wake. ; image from <URL> by Peter . R. Thomas et . al. . In addition , the trailing aircraft should also be careful about the jet exhaust .
As in anything in aviation design , the use of wingtips has both advantages and disadvantages . In the end , the decision to use ( or not ) a winglet is based on the cost-benefit analysis of the winglet to be used in that particular aircraft . All winglets incur a drag and weight penalty - the question is whether they conserve fuel more than they increase it in the first place . One problem in winglet addition is that they are prone to flutter . Also , an <URL> is sometimes more effective and is less risky . Another thing to add is that most of the present aircraft using winglets ( A320s and B737s ) were not designed with winglets to begin with . They were retrofits . Most of the new aircraft are designed with plenty of aerodynamic experience and the engineers can take a call based on the data available as to whether to have ' conventional ' winglet or not ( See A350XWB Vs B787 ) . Coming to B777 , it should be noted that they have wingtip devices after all - raked wingtips . These act in the same manner as the winglets to reduce drag . <URL> Boeing 777 raked wingtip ; image from <URL> According to Boeing , Each wing on the Boeing 777-300ER ( extended range ) is being extended by 6.5 feet , and raked wingtips are being added to improve the overall aerodynamic efficiency . The raked wingtips help reduce takeoff field length , increase climb performance and reduce fuel burn . So basically , these act in the same manner as the conventional wingtips . Also , it is crucial to consider the tradeoff . B777 was designed when the advantages of the wingtips were well known , yet they decided to go without one anyway . From <URL> : Because winglets are a tradeoff : In the highly visible case of the 777 , an airplane with exceptionally long range , the wings grew so long that folding wingtips were offered to get into tight airport gates . Finally <URL> when they were first ordered , though that has not stopped Boeing from trying . Note that one main reason for offering folding wings is to fit into existing gates - else the wingspan would 've become too great . Boeing considered all the options before deciding to go with this option : Dave Akiyama , manager of aerodynamics engineering in Boeing product development , points out that designing winglets can be tricky-they have a tendency to flutter , for example . " We find that it really does n't matter what kind of wingtip device you use-they 're all like span , " he says . " The devil is in the details . Span extensions are the easiest and least risky . " And finally , <URL> , especially for the earlier versions , though nothing came out of that - so most probably they were of not much use in improving fuel burn . Note that 787 also has a similar ' raked ' wingtip instead of winglet . Note : The fuel burn can be reduced by other means than wingtip devices - Boeing <URL> for the Boeing 777 , <URL> by 1 % : ... for long-range 777s , with United , Continental , and Delta investing in modifying the outboard aileron droop and the environmental control system , making ram air improvements , and installing smaller wing vortex generators to yield a total of 1 percent fuel burn improvement .
The aircraft 's Flight Management System ( FMS ) can be loaded with software that periodically sends position reports and flight tracking data to ground stations via ACARS . If the particular software in use sends the full flight plan or at least the next few fixes periodically with estimated times , this would expose any changes in the flight plan to the dispatch office . The incident flight in question had its ACARS turned off at some point and the " 12 minute " figure is probably derived from the time between the last ACARS message being received and the radar observed turn off course initiated . They would not be able to know exactly when the buttons on the FMS were pressed , but they could narrow the time down to a range when information changed between two automated reports sent via ACARS . Relevant chronology : Interval : 12 minutes .
This is a very dated answer now , but for what it 's worth , prior to my retirement in 1999 from a U.S. airline , we did ditching scenarios in 747-100/200 sims during initial training and then occasionally during recurrent training . Proper execution included being on-speed for your weight , nose attitude at touchdown ( 5 degrees up as I remember ) , aircraft configuration ( gear up but I do n't remember the flap setting ) , determination of wave direction if possible , and landing parallel to the wave action . It was a relatively easy scenario for the pilots but a busy scenario for the flight engineer . He had to position valves properly at the right time , including making sure the pressurization outflow valves were closed to prevent fuselage flooding .
You almost have the answer in your question ; bleed air is hot , compressed air taken from the engine compressors . Bypass bleed air here refers to some of that air which is bled off the engine , but not routed through the air cycle machine ( pack ) . When the air comes out of the pack , its really cold . The pilot has a knob which blends the cold air from the pack with the hot bypass air to adjust the temperature that comes through the actual ductwork ; this is similar to the blender box in a car . For example , in this image taken from <URL> , the bleed air from the engine comes in at the top right corner , and you can see the line for bypass bleed air along the top of the diagram in the pipe labelled " hot air " .
Yes , a hot air balloon would change class , if you are adding an engine and propeller to provide thrust . With powered flight comes the need to provide some form of flight control ; at this point , you have an airship , albeit a <URL> . According to the FAA 's <URL> , and much like @voretaq7 's citation in another answer : An airship is an engine-driven , lighter-than-air aircraft , that can be steered . The FAA has a whole section on <URL> , for further reading .
I will answer this for the US as that is the jurisdiction I know best . There are no airspace or ATC usage fees here in the US . The airspace and its resources are free for any plane of any size that conforms to the <URL> and is legal to fly in a given airspace . The <URL> for aircraft that fly through our airspace but neither land nor depart from the US . The only fee ( somewhat indirectly related but not a component of the airspace its self ) is for planes coming in from abroad who will need to pay <URL> . Strictly speaking you may be required to carry IFR charts or VFR charts on board to conduct the flight in question in US airspace . These must be <URL> . The FAA maintains them but the Pilot must pay for them . <URL> and they were purchased directly from them but this is no longer the case . If you extend the question to include airports the answer will drastically change for the US .
There are quite a few 727 that actually had nose wheel braking , however they utilized it only for maximum braking power . ( Also they were proven to be ineffective and unreliable , so a service bulletin was written to remove the system ) . Saab Gripens use nose wheel brakes to stop as well , the main gear sits farther aft than most planes , so there is quite a bit of weight on the nose gear , which makes it effective for stopping .
Then It used to matter , because aircraft would sometimes approach the carrier at a lower altitude than even the flight deck before pulling up briefly and practically stalling onto the deck , allowing for a lower speed landing . Similarly , the higher flight deck would give an extra couple of metres of acceleration if over-shooting the flight deck and having to go around . As such a high-decked carrier gave a little more margin for error . Now It makes virtually no difference - modern aircraft approach at the same angle and airspeed regardless of the height of the deck ( within reason ) . They also perform approaches significantly more accurately . If anything , the higher deck could be considered a ( very ) slight disadvantage , as it may display a higher rolling moment than a low deck carrier . This is unlikely to cause any issues , however .
For the US , this is covered in <URL> , or in a more human-interpretable way from an <URL> . When are you required to use your aircraft registration By default unless you have a callsign Can anyone use whatever call sign they want or is it limited to airlines only ? What you use must be registered . For international flights if you fly frequently enough you can get a 3 letter ICAO designator ( SWA , DAL , UAL , etc. ) There are national callsigns which are detailed in that letter , and local callsigns which may apply only to your tower , TRACON , or center depending on who you talk to and what their own rules for issuing a letter of agreement to use it are .
Generally speaking , pilots do n't like it when a computer interprets or limits their actions . They want final control . They do n't always get their way on this but that 's their preference . If I recall correctly , Boeing tends to stick with the philosophy that " the pilot is the final arbiter . " Airbus is more likely to preempt pilot inputs and modify them . Although the majority of crashes and incidents wind up being pilot error , there is a serious flaw to modifying pilot inputs . That flaw is in the case of systems failure . By definition , failure modes involve things going wrong . When things go wrong it 's effectively impossible to plan , in automation , for all contingencies . People are much better at responding to the unknown than automation systems are . Take for instance the rule that " bank angles > 45 degrees are dangerous , and are therefore prohibited " . How does the plane know that the bank angle is > 45 degrees ? Well it 's a sensor of course , but what if the sensor has failed ? A failed sensor will either signal to take action when none is needed or fail to signal when action is called for . What if the control surfaces have failed and the plane can not correct the bank angle ? The usual answer to that is redundant systems , high reliability parts and design , etc. . All those are great of course and certainly help a lot . However we still have incidents and accidents . In the end the question is : Who do you trust more ? A pilot or a machine ? And statistics and science only help you part-way here . A person 's experience , biases and feelings will have a lot to say about how they answer . And by " person " , understand that I 'm including the customers , the paying public .
The Ju-87 Stuka did undergo engine change during its life . The initial Ju-87A version used the <URL> A engine , which produced 602 hp . This was almost immediately replaced with Jumo 210D , which produced around 661 hp . The first production version , the Junkers Ju-87 B-1 used a <URL> D generating 1,184 hp . Note this version had the fuselage and landing gear redesigned from 87A . The next major version , the Ju-87D , used a Jumo 211J delivering 1,401 hp , after briefly dabbling with Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines . The final operational version of Stuka , the Ju-87G , used the Jumo 211J engine . This is more or less the same path followed by other combat aircraft of the era . For example the Hawker Hurricane MkI used a Merlin III engine producing 1,310 hp , while the last major version , the MkIV used the Merlin 24 ( or 27 ) engines , producing 1,620 hp . However , the main thrust in engine change in Ju-87 was increasing the payload , rather than increased speed or maneuverability like the Hurricanes . For example , Bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled from 500 kg in the B-version to 1,800 kg ( max load ) in the D-version . Another reason was the aircraft design itself . It was designed to be a rigged dive bomber , and increase in speed would 've done it no good ( it is to be noted that the fixed landing gear added a lot of drag , though it was study enough to mount a cannon ) and it had limited maneuverability at the best of times when loaded ( though it had good turn performance at low altitudes ) . The airframe had reached its limit . The only reason the Stuka served till the end of the war though its limitations had become apparent by the Battle of Britan was simply because no better replacements were avilable ( though the process started in early 1940 's ) , though the <URL> took over some of the duties of Ju-87 .
It describes what the velocity vector of the aircraft centre of gravity is in relation to the surface of the earth . Ground speed is the 2-D projection of your speed on the ground , climb speed is the vertical component . Both ground speed and climb speed are very useful parameters as such : ground speed to figure out when the aircraft arrives , climb speed to adjust engine settings etc for reaching cruise altitude with a minimum amount of fuel used . The 3-D vector sum of the two has little practical use , that is probably why it has no separate name as far as I know . The integrated signal is of more use : what is the position in 3D of the centre of gravity of the aircraft relative to earth ? Pretty useful for navigation .
The only real answer here is to <URL> . I searched on the AOPA forums ( members only ) and the information was n't encouraging : all current ( as of 2014 , which was the more recent relevant post I found ) neuropathy drugs are disqualifying . AOPA 's <URL> does show some approved drugs for pain relief , but it looks like it 's all OTC stuff . But , the usual medical disclaimer applies here : every case is different so the above may be irrelevant to you personally ; I 'm not a doctor and I do n't know what I 'm talking about anyway ; only an AME can give you meaningful information .
Broadly speaking , there are three families of motor fuel that you 're probably interested in : Diesels , Kerosenes , and Gasolines . The difference between the families mainly has to do with the molecular weight ( and thus boiling point / vapor pressure ) of the fuel components - in order above from heaviest to lightest . The differences within each family are related to refining , blending , and additives , as well as process controls imposed on the fuel . The Diesel Family In the diesel family we have things like Highway Diesel and the various grades of home heating oil . For transportation purposes these fuels are used in compression-ignition engines ( " diesel engines " ) , where a high temperature and pressure will cause the fuel to ignite and burn , producing power . For other purposes ( like heating ) we basically light the stuff on fire and are happy it burns . The Kerosene Family The Kerosene family are close cousins of the Diesels , including K-1 and K-2 Kerosene ( obviously ) and Jet-A . Jet-A is a high-purity kerosene based fuel manufactured under a specific ASTM standard ( D1655 ) , with specific physical properties , and is used in jet turbine engines . Fuel not meeting the Jet-A specification is generally recycled in the production chain for other purposes ( for example it may be used in blending kerosene for heating , or blended into highway diesel ) . Jet-A is suited for turbine engines , but can also be burned in other compression-ignition piston engines like diesel can ( there are a wide variety of <URL> available from several manufacturers ) . Other grades of Kerosene are used for motor fuels , cooking fuel ( " camp stove fuel " is typically kerosene ) heating , lighting , etc. depending on their refining and purity . The Gasoline Family In the gasoline family we have Avgas , Autogas , and " Gasohol " , all designed for use in spark-ignition engines . Aviation Gasoline ( Avgas ) Avgas actually comes in several grades , all manufactured to an ASTM standard ( D910 ) , with specific physical properties and specific permitted and required additives ( such as Tetra-Ethyl Lead - TEL ) . The grade ( octane rating ) of aviation gasoline is identified by colored dyes added to the blend . The colors used in the US are : Green : AvGas 100 ( 100/130 Octane ) Blue : AvGas 100LL ( 100/130 Octane ) ( This was formulated as a replacement for AvGas 100 , with half the lead - hence 100LL - Low Lead ) Red : AvGas 80 ( 80/87 Octane ) Generally 100LL is the most widely available aviation fuel because it works in the widest range of engines . Autogas ( automotive gasoline ) Automotive gasoline comes in multiple octane grades , but generally it 's all varying blends of " regular " ( 87 octane ) and " premium " ( 93 octane or higher ) . Automotive gasoline is manufactured under a different ASTM standard from Aviation gasoline ( there are several applicable standards , D4814 is commonly used ) , which permits different additives including ethanol ( usually up to 10 % ) . " Gasohol " Gasohol is a slang term for automotive gasoline with any amount of ethanol blended into it , but these days it 's often used to refer to blends like E85 ( 85 % Ethanol , 15 % gasoline stock ) . Flex-fuel car engines and a few other specialty engines are designed to burn this fuel . So what 's the difference ? Why do n't we burn highway diesel or heating kerosene in a 747 ? In a word , purity . The additional controls imposed on Jet-A fuel by the associated standard produce a product with well-known properties . When you fuel a plane with Jet-A you can be confident that fuel wo n't freeze in the tanks at altitude ( at least not unless you cold-soak it below -40 degrees ) . You also know the fuel will be " clean " and wo n't gunk up fuel filters or leave deposits inside the combustion core of the engine that can cause problems later . On the other hand we do n't burn Jet-A in a Mack Truck because it would be prohibitively expensive : Highway diesel does n't have to meet the same strict tolerances as jet fuel , and theres no reason to burn a more tightly specified ( and thus more expensive ) fuel when a less expensive one is readily available . The difference between Aviation Gasoline and Automotive Gasoline is a bit more subtle : the core blend stocks are extremely similar , but the additive packages are very different . The biggest concern for aviation users is usually the ethanol commonly blended into automotive gasoline : Rubber components in aircraft fuel systems were not designed to handle alcohols , and can be damaged/degraded by ethanol . For cars the concern is the lead found in aviation gasoline . Any " modern " car ( with a catalytic converter and oxygen sensors in the exhaust system ) ca n't burn leaded fuel as the lead byproducts in the exhaust will foul both the catalyst matrix and the oxygen sensors ( though a <URL> would have no trouble burning the stuff ) . <URL> - theoretically the fuel that comes out of that process could be equally suitable as a road fuel and an aviation fuel , however the chances of it making its way t
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau did a report titled : <URL> This report specifically covers this and found that the accident rate was three times higher in kit built - vs - similar factory build aircraft : What did this report do The ATSB investigated the safety history of amateur-built aircraft in Australia through analysis of accident data held in the ATSB 's occurrence database from 1988 to 2010 . Comparisons were made between accidents involving amateur-built aircraft and those involving similar factory-built aircraft to help identify whether the rate and types of accidents differed between these two groups of aircraft . What the ATSB found Amateur-built aircraft had an accident rate three times higher than comparable factory-built certified aircraft conducting similar flight operations between 1988 and 2010 . The fatal and serious injury accident rate was over five times higher in amateur-built aircraft , in particular due to relatively more serious injury accidents . The pilots of amateur-built aircraft involved in accidents were significantly more experienced overall than factory-built aircraft accident pilots . However , they were significantly less experienced on the aircraft type that they were flying at the time of the accident . Over half of the accidents were precipitated by mechanical events , which were mainly complete or partial engine failures . Following the amateur-built phase one test period , mechanical failures were still significantly more common when compared with factory-built aircraft . A quarter of accidents were from loss of aircraft control . Structural failures were not common precursors in amateur-built aircraft . Collision with terrain and forced landing accidents were more frequent in amateur-built aircraft . Collisions with terrain , hard landings , and runway excursions were more likely to result in a serious injury from an amateur-built aircraft accident than for factory-built accidents . On the other hand , the EAA says that homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate of less than 1 % higher than the general aviation fleet in their <URL> , but this did n't compare homebuilt to factory built in similar models : How Safe Are Amateur-Built/Homebuilt Aircraft ? Studies by FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) show that Amateur-Built/Homebuilt aircraft have an accident rate less than one percentage point higher than the general aviation fleet . In fact , the accident rate for Amateur-Built/homebuilt aircraft is dropping . The total number of registered homebuilt aircraft is increasing by about 1,000 per year , while the total number of accidents has stayed virtually the same . Another good barometer of safety is insurance rates . Companies that insure both homebuilts and production aircraft charge about the same rates for owners of either type of airplane . That indicates a similar level of risk .
The answer can be found in Annex 16 of the ICAO , a copy including the noise limits can be found <URL> . Below a little excerpt from the annex : ( a ) For acoustical changes to Stage 1 airplanes , regardless of the number of engines , the noise levels prescribed under § 36.7 ( c ) of this part . What are the ' Chapter 2 ' and ' Chapter 3 ' aircraft noise classifications ? Certificated noise levels for larger aircraft are classified by the ICAO ' Standards and Recommended Practices -- Aircraft Noise : Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation ' into a ) Chapter 2 types , characterised by the noisier , low bypass turbofan aircraft and early high bypass turbofan aircraft , and b ) Chapter 3 types , characterised by the modern , quieter , high bypass turbofan aircraft . Under European legislation , since 2002 , ' Chapter 2 ' aircraft ( of over 34 tonnes maximum take-off weight or with more than 19 seats ) have no longer been allowed to operate at European airports . There are separate noise certification schemes for small propeller aircraft and for helicopters . ( b ) For any Stage 2 airplane regardless of the number of engines : ( 1 ) Flyover : 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more ; for each halving of maximum weight ( from 600,000 pounds ) , reduce the limit by 5 EPNdB ; the limit is 93 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less .

Why does the yoke " stick " in a turning position ?
I think it 's a little bit of both -- for most aircraft , how they behave in a turn is a byproduct of their designed aerodynamic properties . This question is actually quite complex to answer . Let 's assume you 're talking about a simple light aircraft , where control surfaces are mechanically linked to the controls that move them -- this ensures that anything you feel is related to what 's happening to the plane , and not necessarily to anything more complex ( like a fly-by-wire computer , or a hydraulic linkage with some degree of hysteresis ) . Aircraft turns are divided , by the CAA &amp; FAA at least ( see the FAA 's Airplane Flying Handbook , <URL> ) into three main categories : Shallow turns ( roughly speaking , < 20º angle of bank ) . These tend to become shallower if left alone . Medium turns ( roughly speaking , 20º < $ \ theta $ < 45º angle of bank ) . These turns tend to be stable without further pilot input . Steep turns ( $ \ theta > 45 $ º ) . These tend to become steeper if left alone , sometimes dramatically so . Let 's look at these in a bit more detail , with some explanation as to why these effects occur . Shallow turns . These tends to become less steep as the turn progresses , and most aircraft have a natural tendency to decrease the angle of bank throughout the turn . This tendency to lessen the angle of bank arises , I believe , entirely as a designed aerodynamic feature of the aircraft to have lateral stability . As shallow angles of bank are essentially a situation that 's is but a small perturbation about flying straight and level , it 's desirable for the angle of bank to decrease back to zero if left alone . If that is n't the case , the aircraft stability has to be actively maintained by constant manipulation of the control surfaces ( which is tiring or impossible for a human ) . This stability can be achieved through design features , such as ( i ) the dihedral of the aircraft 's wings , ( ii ) their sweep , and ( iii ) their height position -- if high , there is an increased degree of lateral stability due to the centre of mass of the aircraft being below the tilted plane of the wings , and , if disturbed slightly , it experiences a force $ F \ approx mg \ sin \ theta $ to " pull " the wings back upright again . The sole purpose of any degree of wing dihedral -- the angle they make with the horizontal -- is to improve lateral stability . If a perturbation causes one wing to drop , the resultant ( unbalanced ) force will produce a sideslip in the direction of the downward wing . In effect this is analogous to " creating " a flow of air in the opposite direction to the slip . This flow of air will strike the lower wing at a greater angle of attack than it strikes the upper wing . The lower wing will thus receive more lift and the airplane will roll back into its neutral position . Many small aircraft have a slight degree of dihedral on the wings . A similar effect occurs with ( ii ) swept wings -- when a disturbance causes an airplane with swept back wings to slip or drop a wing , the low wing presents its leading edge at an angle that is almost perpendicular to the relative airflow . As a result , the low wing acquires more lift , rises and the airplane is restored to its original attitude . As an aside , you do n't really notice you 're in a shallow turn , aside from the fact that you 're continually applying a little bit of stick and rudder . The $ g $ - loading is minimal . Medium turns . In this case , the aircraft is in a metastable state -- it will carry on at a constant angle of bank , but a ` shove ' to either side will result in the bank increasing or decreasing as appropriate . By this point , $ \ cos \ theta \ neq1 $ , and the outer wing is really generating a lot more lift than the other one -- and thus you 'd effect the angle of bank to increase , as it pulls the aircraft into the circle . The effects discussed above , however , still apply , and provide an effective restoring force back to the normal attitude . In a medium turn , aircraft are designed to have these forces balanced , and , in practice , you often need little-to-no aileron and almost no rudder to do a coordinated medium turn in a light aircraft . If it 's properly trimmed , you can take your hands off the controls and sit there merrily going around in a circle . Depending on your speed , the $ g $ - loading is apparent , but not great . Steep turns . By this point , one wing is generating almost no lift , and the other is generating quite a lot . We 've gone beyond the designed stability point of a medium turn , and the angle of bank tends to increase as the outward wing pulls the plane of the aircraft towards its axis of turn . This type of turn actively requires pilot input to maintain a constant angle of bank , and , depending upon the speed , it can physically be quite hard work . The $ g $ - loading of the wings is significant , and , as the stall speed of an aircraft approximately increases as the square-root of the $ g $ factor experienced , it 's entirely possible to enter an accelerated stall or even a spin here . You notice the
There are many higher-order effects . For example , yaw causes a slight increase in airspeed over the outer wing of the turn and a decrease in airspeed over the inner wing . As a result , the outer wing will generate more lift than the other , introducing a rolling motion . Yaw also causes side-slip which triggers several effects . Wings that are swept backwards , as on the B737 , contribute to the roll towards the direction of the turn , because the outer wing gets effectively longer ( <URL> ) and produces more lift . Further contributing to this roll is the outer wing having a higher angle of attack due to the dihedral effect ( <URL> ) . Similar effects apply to other control surfaces . It 's not true that rudder only causes yaw and ailerons only cause roll . Those are simplifications , even though aircraft are usually designed for these simplifications to hold fairly well . There is also a direct effect . The image below did n't show the center of mass ; I drew in a guess as a yellow circle . It 's clearly below the rudder , which is true for most aircraft . This means applying rudder introduces a rolling torque , roughly equal to the sideways component of the force on the control surface , multiplied by the distance between rudder and the longitudinal axis . The magnitude of this product is visualised as the area of the red rectangle .
You do n't brace -- you 're still operating the aircraft ! The pilot seats have shoulder harnesses ; in many cases you can lock them , plus they also have inertial reels that keep you from slamming forward at an impact . Additionally , the pilots can presumably see the moment of impact coming , and tense for exactly that moment in a way that passengers can not .
Three reasons I can think of : It 's easy to detect the general presence of a specific transmitting device ( a WiFi antenna , say ) , but very hard to precisely localize it . They could tell if there 's one on the plane , but someone with a very sensitive piece of equipment would have to walk up and down the aisles pointing it at people to actually find it in somebody 's pocket . And cellphones ( when not in use ) are generally burst transmitters : they do n't broadcast continuously , they just " ping " the tower every so often . This means it could take a long time and a lot of aisle-pacing . Many " electronic devices " which are banned are entirely passive and have no traceable [ * ] emissions . Think cameras , handheld GPS receivers , iPods . ( On the other hand this passiveness also means they are extremely unlikely to harmfully interfere with the operation of the airplane , but right or wrong , such devices are still banned in some cases . ) It 's not that important . There are a few incidents where electronic interference is suspected as a possible factor , but no conclusive evidence . As soon as there is actually a fatal accident where an electronic device can be conclusively blamed as the cause ( and I doubt this will happen ) , the airlines will be a lot more willing to spend the kind of money that would be required to implement this . For a full , evidence-based discussion of the actual risks , I refer you to this question on Skeptics Stack Exchange : <URL> [ * ] No traceable emissions . All electronic devices generate some very , very tiny incidental signals . But these are so weak that they will be virtually impossible to detect on a crowded plane filled with its own ( approved ) electronics . Such emissions are measured in laboratories with extremely sensitive antennas in special , heavily-shielded rooms under carefully controlled conditions .
The 747-300 was somewhat of a cross between -200 and SP . The -300 was almost same as the -200 except for the increased length of the hump . The -300 was never a success and was soon overshadowed by the -400 . The 747SP was the result of a requirement for longer range aircraft . Boeing engineers basically <URL> . However , by the time it flew for the first time , commercial air travel had changed ( in no small part due to the high oil prices ) and the model never sold as much as Boeing had hoped . However , when it was observed that there were no adverse effects when the rear of the cockpit lined up with the front of the wing , Boeing introduced the 747-300 with increased length of the hump with little else in terms of major change from -200 . However , just two years after -300 was introduced , Boeing introduced the -400 , which was a significant improvement - it eliminated the flight engineer , increased range among others , while retaining the -300 's hump ( which meant more economy seats ) . 747-400 is the most successful model of the series , with more than 690 orders . Most airlines jumped straight to the -400 , effectively killing the -300 . Actually , the 747-200 production ( with over 390 made ) ended after the -300 version ( of which only 81 were made ) . So they are more of contemporaries . Also , it 'll be a stretch to call that the older 747 versions are still in passenger service . 747-100 is <URL> , <URL> hardly qualify as passenger service and the most successful of these , the 747-200s are also <URL> , if you discount the VC-25s flying around with US President ( which are slated to be replaced by 747-8s ) .
It is to help the pilot land the aircraft ( the chase cars are also used during takeoff ) . The U2 is considered notoriously difficult to fly in low altitudes - a tradeoff in an <URL> : Because the U-2 was so specialized , it was amazingly difficult to fly . ... the lower the U-2 flew , the heavier its unassisted controls got , to the point where pilots literally had to brute-force the plane around during take-off and landing . ... landings were the biggest problem . The replacement for Johnson 's cart-and-skid ground system was a compact setup -- two centrally located landing gear in the fuselage and one detachable " pogo " gear on each wing -- that turned the U-2 into little more than a 30,000-pound bicycle . Because of the high-lift wings , pilots did n't so much land the plane as fly it really close to the ground ( usually about two feet ) , stall it , and then fall out of the sky . The decreased visibility of the pilots , combined with the highly efficient wings and bicycle landing gear meant that unassisted landings are difficult ( but certainly possible , as has been demonstrated ) - thus the chase cars . On of the chase car drivers ( themselves U2 pilots ) <URL> : ... the objective is ensuring that the pilot safely landing the aircraft ... calling him down to two feet ... holding them off there and then the plane will just kind of settle down on the ground .
The V22 Osprey yaws by tilting one rotor backwards from the vertical and one forward by moving the <URL> up on one side and down on the other causing a cyclic change to the rotor blade angles of attack . This is accomplished using the pedals in just the same way as a helicopter . Since the rotors are tilted from the vertical , this introduces a horizontal component to the thrust vector . The rearwards titled rotor produces a horizontal thrust component to the rear and the forwards tilted rotor produces a horizontal thrust component to the front . This produces a turning moment , using the wings as the lever , around the centre of gravity and therefore the aircraft yaws . The secondary effects will be as expected . Since some of the thrust vector is no longer vertical , a little more power will be required to maintain height and I expect that there will be a pitch change although I 'm not familiar enough with the aerodynamics of this type to figure out which way and how big .
The icing occurs due to the presence of supercooled liquid droplets . From <URL> : The condition most favorable for very hazardous icing is the presence of many large , supercooled water drops ... Thus , heaviest icing usually will be found at or slightly above the freezing level where temperature is never more than a few degrees below freezing . For ice to form on the aircraft , the following conditions are required : The presence of liquid water i.e. rain or cloud droplets . The temperature at aircraft structure should be at or below freezing point . Now , as the altitude increases , temperature decreases . Using this , the best way to avoid these conditions would be to either : Fly above the altitude where the temperature is below -15 degrees , where supercooled water drops are not present ( they would 've frozen already ) , or Fly below the altitude where the temperature is above freezing point , where the water droplets , if present are not supercooled .
Induced drag is caused by the backward inclination of the lift vector . Lift is defined as the aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction , and since lift is created by <URL> , the resulting force is slightly inclined backwards . The formula for the deflection angle ( called <URL> ) $ \ alpha_w $ : $ $ \ alpha_w = arctan \ left ( \ frac { 2 \ cdot c_L } { \ pi \ cdot AR } \ right ) $ $ To arrive at the drag , you now need to multiply the local lift with this angle . For small $ \ alpha_w $ s the arcus tangens can be neglected , and we get this familiar looking equation for the backwards-pointing component of the aerodynamic force : $ $ c _ { Di } = \ frac { c_L ^ 2 } { \ pi \ cdot AR } = \ frac { \ alpha_w ^ 2 \ cdot \ pi \ cdot AR } { 4 } $ $ Now consider a wing which will do this unevenly over the wingspan . Some parts create a lot of lift and , therefore , a lot of downward deflection . Others produce less lift and less deflection . Due to the quadratic dependency of induced drag with downwash angle , the sum of all parts will always be higher when there are variations in the local downwash angle over span . Only the wing with a <URL> will have the minimum induced drag for a given lift . This is not necessarily an elliptic wing . By selecting the right twist ( incidence variation over wingspan ) , any planform can be made to produce a constant downwash angle , albeit at only one angle of attack . Only the elliptic wing will combine the constant downwash angle over span with a constant lift coefficient over span such that variations in angle of attack still result in a constant downwash angle . This is strictly true only in inviscid flow and when elastic deformation and the weight of the wing ( which contributes to the need for lift and hence induced drag ) are not considered . Also , an elliptic wing will produce nasty stall characteristics . Adding handling , friction and structural weight will shift the optimum to wings which produce more lift near the center . The exact optimum also will depend on the absolute size of the wing because the structural mass fraction goes up with size due to <URL> .

Turbulence affects aircraft in the same way whether it is banked or not . The difference however would be the end result of the turbulence . For example , if an aircraft were to encounter turbulence strong enough to roll the aircraft 20 degrees to the right , the end results would be a 20 degree bank if starting from level , but 45 degrees of bank if they were already in a 25 degree banked turn . If this were to happen it puts them closer to their stall speed because of the higher bank angle , and if they were already going slow and the airplane is at a low altitude , it could be a problem . Fortunately , most turbulence strong enough to cause this while at low altitude is caused by the wake turbulence of other aircraft or microbursts , and we have pretty good procedures in place to keep it from being a problem these days . If they are n't at a low altitude it matters even less because there is altitude for the aircraft to recover even if it does get into an unusual attitude .

Which means , roughly 5 times more passengers can be accommodated by compromising half of the top speed . So , why does speed loses out so much to capacity that it ultimately becomes unfeasible to operate a supersonic airliner ? I think you are asking , " why do supersonic aircraft have such low capacity " ? To travel faster than the speed of sound you need to have a very sharp nose and minimal area exposed to the forward direction , to minimize the generation of shockwaves . Shockwaves are bad for people on the ground ( the ' sonic boom ' effect ) and they are terrible for fuel efficiency . Second you really do not want to trap air on flat surfaces facing forwards , because the air will get squashed in the supersonic flow and heat up a lot ( like when you blow up a bicycle tyre or a football it is warm afterwards , or when the space shuttle re-enters the atmosphere ) . Again this is an enormous drag and having hot air flowing around your aircraft causes problems with the structure ( Concorde used to grow by 300 mm during flight because of the heat ) . Since you can not be wide and you can not be tall ( without being aerodynamically inefficient ) , you need to be very long if you want lots of people . And then you have other problems . The design and construction of Concorde was never a commercial project , it was funded by two governments almost as a vanity project , as a prototype or as an experiment . Then it was given for free to two airlines to use as they wanted . So unlike the A380 and the B747 , no one has ever said " now we try to maximize the economics and the capacity of our design " : that never happened . All they ever asked was " How do we make this work !? " Whereas the subsonic aircraft get a lot of time , money and thought spent on how to make them more economical to use by filling them with more passengers . For more information I recommend this interview with a former Concorde pilot : <URL> Also , Concorde was developed 40 years ago . Are some more efficient supersonic Airliners possible today ? I am sure that these days a far more fuel efficient supersonic engine could be built for passenger operations . And I do believe there would be a market for it on say LON-NYC or even maybe LON-DXB . But designing supersonic aircraft is quite different to designing subsonic ones ; and then you have all the difficulty of modern safety regulations without being able to demonstrate you are relying on old , proven designs ; and then there are very few routes where it could work profitably so you have very high development and maintenance costs spread over a small number of airframes . Basically , it is n't worth the risk to anyone to make it .
You 're absolutely correct , camber equals curvature . The camber of the horizontail tail is changed by deflecting the elevator , not the camber of the elevator itself . And yes the local angle of attack changes when the elevator deflects , resulting in an aerodynamic moment .
It is actually not that simple to ensure the proper gas speed in a gas turbine . In the compressor you want to limit the flow speed over the compressor vanes to the high subsonic range , so the <URL> down to approx . Mach 0.4 - 0.5 . Less would mean less throughput and consequently less thrust . This speed , however , is far too high for ignition . The <URL> , and if flow speed is high , your combustion chamber becomes very long and the engine becomes heavier than necessary . Therefore , the cross section leading from the compressor to the combustion chamber is carefully widened to slow down the airflow without separation ( see the section below named " diffusor " ) . Around the fuel injectors you will find the lowest gas speed in the whole engine . Now the combustion heats the gas up , and makes it expand . The highest pressure in the whole engine is right at the last compressor stage - from there on pressure only drops the farther you progress . This ensures that no backflow into the compressor is possible . However , when the <URL> s ( this is quite like a wing stalling - the compressor vanes are little wings and have the same limitations ) , it can not maintain the high pressure and you get reverse flow . This is called a <URL> . The graph below shows typical values of flow speed , temperature and pressure in a jet engine . Getting these right is the task of the engine designer . Plot of engine flow parameters over the length of a turbojet ( picture taken from <URL> publication ) The rear part of the engine must block the flow of the expanding gas less than the forward part to make sure it continues to flow in the right direction . By keeping the cross section of the combustor constant , the engine designer ensures that the expanding gas will accelerate , converting thermal energy to kinetic energy , without losing its pressure ( the small pressure drop in the combustor is caused by friction ) . Now the accelerated flow hits the turbine , and the pressure of the gas drops in each of its stages , which again makes sure that no backflow occurs . The turbine has to take as much energy from the flow as needed to run the compressor and the attached pumps and generators without blocking the flow too much . The remaining pressure is again converted to speed <URL> . Now the gas is still much hotter than ambient air , and even though the flow at the end of the nozzle is still subsonic in modern airliner engines , the actual flow speed is much higher than the flight speed . The speed difference between flight speed and the exit speed of the gas in the nozzle is what produces <URL> . Fighter engines usually have supersonic flow at the end of the nozzle , which requires careful shaping and adjustment of the nozzle contour . Read all about it <URL> .
Firstly , to understand the answer , we need to understand that the Cessna 152 's and 172 's run a 4 Cylinder , Horizontally-opposed Engine . Each Cylinder has 2 spark plugs , one on the top side of the cylinder head , and one on the bottom side . The spark plug ignites the fuel/air mixture that has been sucked into the engine , and causes a controlled burn to push the piston down the cylinder and turn the crankshaft in turn ( hence turning the propeller as it is connected to the end of the crankshaft ) . Now , as I 've stated , each cylinder has two spark plugs , one connected to the " left " magneto , and one connected to the " right " . If we turn one magneto " off " ( or ground it to be politically correct ) , only one spark plug in each cylinder will " fire " to ignite the fuel/air mixture . This causes the mixture to have a delayed and less effective burn , meaning that the piston does not get pushed down the cylinder as effectively , meaning the crankshaft will not rotate as fast , and hence , leads to a drop in the Propeller RPM ( Revolutions per Minute ) . We check the magnetos on the ground to check that ; A . They both work , and the engine wo n't die if we lose a magneto ( we should be able to return to land on the remaining serviceable magneto ) B . We are checking that there is no " Spark Plug Fouling " . The fuel we use in aviation contains lead , and hence after a time of running the engine at low power settings on the ground , the lead in the fuel will accumulate on the spark plug head ( instead of being burnt off when the engine is working under power ) , and cause the spark plug to let off a limited spark , or completely block the spark , hence again , making our engine less efficient . If there is anything you want explained about this answer , please let me know ! :)
Check out this <URL> it provides a nice overview of some of the basics and how some of the systems are set up . Does the auto-throttle send its command directly to the EEC or to the mechanical throttle ? This may vary from design to design but the <URL> that physically move the throttle levers . You can read up on the <URL> . Are the throttle levers customized/calibrated for an engine model , or are their output standardized ( assuming the output is an electric signal ) . Does the electronic engine control apply further adjustment to the throttle input ? It seems that <URL> instead of mechanically actuating anything . With that in mind Im sure there are older designs out there that are closer to or a complete direct linkage from lever to engine . Is this correction transmitted back to the throttle lever ? I dont think so , it seems that when say full throttle is applied the throttle control will remain at full and the FADEC unit will take care of spooling it up as need be . Likewise if an engine suddenly cuts out or fuel flow becomes restricted as far as I know the throttles will remain in place . Auto throttle units will however physically actuate the throttles as need be . As per the comments here it seems this is only the case in Boeing aircraft . Airbus throttles must be set to maximum setting auto-throttle is allowed to use .
The purpose of trimming is to free the pilot from having to exert a constant pressure on the controls . This is often used to maintain straight and level flight , however trimming can also be used at any phase of flight - for example to maintain a constant rate of climb or descent . The most basic form , as found on most light aircraft is elevator trim . Usually operated by a wheel , it moves the elevator up or down by a small amount in the same sense as the yoke ( back to go up , forward to go down ) . This can be used to settle the aircraft into straight flight . Another form of trim is rudder trim . Often found in larger light aircraft and twin-engined aircraft it can be used to adjust for a crosswind to keep the aircraft flying straight . On multi-engine aircraft it can also be used to trim out the differential thrust caused by one engine failing .
TCAS gets fairly accurate altitude information from the same source as the transponder . Thus any extrapolation from this information can yield a fairly accurate prediction of whether two aircraft may collide , and provide more certainty that changes in altitude will avert any conflict . Range information is obtained by measuring the round trip time of the interrogation and response . This will also be fairly accurate . Direction information is obtained by using the TCAS antenna to detect the direction of responses from other aircraft . These values are then extrapolated to provide an expected path of other aircraft . Most airliners <URL> which only provides the vertical guidance . <URL> was envisioned to provide horizontal guidance as well , but : it was judged by the industry to be unfeasible due to limitations in the accuracy of the TCAS directional antennas . Even if TCAS can be accurate to <URL> in direction , this translates to over 300 feet of uncertainty at 1 nmi . TCAS IV was planned to use more accurate GPS information , but with ADS-B becoming more widely adopted , this development was stopped in favor of some future system that can use existing ADS-B technology . Another point is that airplanes are generally larger in the horizontal plane than the vertical , and thus would need to change course more horizontally to avoid collision than they would need to vertically . Especially as planes get larger , they also tend to be more maneuverable in pitch than in turns .
There is quite a lot written on the topic , especially as part of " ground effect " vehicles research . For example , <URL> cite two different types of lift coefficient . The first one ( simpler and given here ) is based on flat plate airfoils and is a modification to the well-known $ \ frac { dC_l } { d \ alpha } = 2 \ pi $ : $ $ C_L = 2 \ pi \ alpha ( 1 + \ delta ^ 2 ) ( 1-2 \ zeta ) $ $ with $ $ \ zeta = \ frac { \ sin \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ and $ $ \ delta = \ frac { \ cos \ alpha } { 4 ( h/c ) } $ $ In the above expressions , $ h $ is the height of the wing above the surface ( ground , water , etc. ) , $ c $ is the chord and $ \ alpha $ is the angle of attack . I strongly recommend you check out " ground effect " / " Ekranoplan " literature - should be useful .
If you are seated behind the wings , but close , you can usually see black markings ( thick line and a number ) near the inboard side of the engine pylon which indicate their extension . Some might not be visible when the wing is in cruise configuration . Same goes for leading edge slats , only you 'd need to be seated near the overwing emergency exit to see those . I 've personally seen them on both Airbus and Embraer jets ( no recent flights on Boeing airframes so ca n't confirm if they mark them too ) . <URL> ( <URL> )

What is the difference between the various automated airport weather observing systems ?
ASOS is basically a replacement for AWOS with more reporting parameters , and the first units were installed in 1991 . According to the <URL> , each different type has the following parameters : AWOS AWOS A : barometric pressure and altimeter setting ( in inches of Mercury ) . AWOS I : wind speed and wind gusts ( in knots ) , wind direction ( from which the wind is blowing ) and variable wind direction ( in degrees of the compass ) , temperature and dew point ( in degrees Celsius ) , altimeter setting and density altitude . AWOS II : all AWOS I parameters , plus visibility and variable visibility ( in miles ) . AWOS III : all AWOS II parameters , plus sky condition ( in oktas ) , cloud ceiling height ( in feet ) , and liquid precipitation accumulation ( in inches ) . AWOS III P : all AWOS III parameters , plus precipitation type ( rain , snow and sometimes drizzle ) identification .

The FAA ETOPS certification requires a certain standards fromboth the airline ( the operator ) and the aircraft ( the manufacturer ) . As far as the manufacturers are concerned , the ETOPS certification is given for a particular aircraft-engine combination satisfying certain requirements . The <URL> Section A deals with the Airplane-Engine Type Design Approval . According to the document , the type approval involves a two step process : First , the FAA determines that airplane systems meet certain design standards for safe operations during an airplane diversion . Some of these requirements are , The aircraft should have at least three independent electrical generators . Auxiliary Power unit ( APU ) ( when required ) can start after the airplane has been cold-soaked for several hours and can run reliably for the remainder of the flight . System safety analyses have to show that expected system failures will not prevent safe landing at a diversion airport . Systems with time limited capabilities , which typically is cargo fire suppression , need to have the capacity to support a maximum length diversion , including a 15-minute allowance for a hold or go-around at the diversion airport The second part of the approval process is an evaluation of engine in - flight shutdowns and other significant airplane system failures that have occurred while the airplane-engine combination has been in service . The aircraft-engine combination should have at-least 250,000 engine-hours for evaluation , though this can be reduced with compensating factors . The airplane-engine combination should maintain a target IFSD ( In Flight Shut Down , defined as " When an engine ceases to function ( when the airplane is airborne ) and is shut down , however briefly , whether self induced , flightcrew initiated or caused by an external influence . " ) rate at or below 0.02 per 1,000 engine-hours for 180min ETOPS approval . The manufacturer should also demonstrate that flying with OEI does n't cause undue stresses to the aircrew and is safe for the airframe . The ETOPS design approval has to be applied for with FAA and obtained after the relevant processes . Thus , the same aircraft will not have ETOPS approval if the engine is different or even the same aircraft-engine combination wo n't have ETOPS approval if used by another airline or if no certification was sought . There is another method of getting ETOPS approval called the ' early ' ETOPS approval which ... takes a systems approach to the development of an airplane and engine . ... an applicant must demonstrate that the design flaws on previously designed airplanes are not present in the new airplane . The applicant must also consider how the maximum length flight and diversion affect the design and function of airplane systems to ensure that they have the capability and reliability for safe ETOPS flight . After ETOPS certified , the airplane-engine combination and the operator are under continuous monitoring with the certificate being withdrawn in case of lapses or IFSD goes above the target rate and the manufacturer 's corrective action does not eliminate the unsafe condition . As far as the LAX-Hawaii incident is concerned , according to <URL> , both aircrafts ( the ' correct ' ETOPS airplane , A321H and the wrong one sent , A321S ) had the same configuration , but There are two small differences in terms of equipment to allow ETOPS certification . Since you ca n't divert for medical [ on a Hawaii bound flight ] , you 're required to carry extra medical oxygen on board and an extra fire suppression canister There are also reports that the ( ETOPS certified ) A321H <URL> , which the ( non ETOPS certified ) A321S did n't have , though the AA spokesperson had said that the fuel tanks and range were the same .
Yes there is a distinction , pitch , roll and heading are angles [ unit = radian ] and latitude , longitude and altitude are linear distances [ unit = meter ] . Together , these six parameters define the six Degrees of Freedom that define the momentary state of a rigid object with reference to the earth . All six are defined relative to earth axes . For the linear dimensions this is clear , we just need to define a suitable zero point . For the angles : Pitch is the nose up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Roll is the wingtip up/down angle relative to the gravity field of the earth . Heading is the angle relative to a suitable earth reference , usually magnetic north or geographical north . Conversion of aircraft axes into earth axes is a non-trivial matter and the cause of much confusion , for instance in questions comparing lift to weight : lift is always coupled to aircraft axes , weight to earth axes . The axes sets are defined as follows : Aircraft axes Origin : Centre of Gravity of aircraft X-axis : in the symmetry plane of the aircraft , + = forward to the aircraft nose Y-axis : in the span wise direction of the aircraft , + = to the right wingtip Z-axis : perpendicular to the XOY-plane , + = down into the floor . Earth axes Origin : Centre of Gravity at the start of the response X-axis : In the horizontal plane ( relative to gravity ) , + = pointing north . Y-axis : Perpendicular to XOZ-plane , + = pointing east . Z-axis : Pointing to the centre of the earth = + Edit Yes navigation lat/lon is given in [ degrees ] - the INS sensor ultimately converts displacement into proper navigational definitions of course . But for measuring 3-D aircraft inertial effects the SI system is used , and displacement is internally treated as a linear motion , units [ metres ] .
There is certainly a difference , but most of it definitely has a good explanation . Most of it is overhead such as taxi time that applies to both flights ( almost ) equally . This has a relative big impact on short flights . The taxi out time for both flights will be about <URL> is not exactly known for its quiet taxiways . Both flights will add about 30 nautical mile for their departure route . Both flights will fly approximately great circle routes , probably less than 2 % extra distance during cruise . The LAX flight will typically do a straight in arrival , almost no extra distance there . The DEN flight will typically do a full arrival , 30 NM extra distance there . The taxi in at <URL> on average , and <URL> . Let 's assume that both aircraft fly 460 knot true airspeed with 20 knots headwind during cruise , so 440 knots ground speed . My estimates for the total flight times are then : JFK-LAX GC distance 2150 n.m Departure detour 30 n.m Arrival detour 0 n.m ( straight in ) Cruise detour 25 n.m Total distance 2205 n.m Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 2085 n.m. @ 440 kts = 4 hour 44 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 12 minutes Total time : 5h50 minutes Margin : 10 minutes JFK-DEN GC distance 1400 n.m. Departure detour 30 n.m. Arrival detour 30 n.m. Cruise detour 15 n.m. Total distance 1475 n.m. Taxi out : 27 minutes Climb out : 60 n.m. @ 300 kts = 12 minutes Cruise : 1355 n.m. @ 440 kts = 3 hour 05 minutes Descent/Landing : 60 n.m @ 240 kts = 15 minutes Taxi in : 9 minutes Total time : 4h07 minutes Margin : 33 minutes
A shortcut is a deviation from the filed flightplan given to an aircraft by ATC during the flight , if traffic and other factors permit . A flight crew can not expect to get any shortcuts , so they can not plan for it . Routes in the RAD are flightplannable routes . If a direct route is available in the RAD , it can be used when filing the flightplan , prior to the flight . This allows airlines to plan for the shorter route , thus allowing them to bring less fuel and advertise a shorter flight time .
Although Lnafziger 's answer is correct , I 'd like to elaborate on the purpose of the airspace classes . Class A : This airspace is intended for high-speed , point to point travel . That is why pilots flying in Class A must be instrument rated and in contact with air traffic control ( ATC ) ; aircraft above 18,000 feet are likely to travel quickly and may not have time to avoid each other visually . This is the upper layer of the airspace system . * Class B : This airspace is intended for large airports with lots of jet traffic . The large number and size of aircraft require space for ATC to get them efficiently in and out of the airports . Approach control services are provided . As a result , class B areas are physically large . It is possible for small aircraft flying under visual flight rules to operate here with explict ATC permission , though permission to enter may be denied during periods of high traffic . Small piston-powered aircraft land at Class B airports infrequently , typically due to high landing fees and fuel prices . Class C : Smaller airports with a mix of piston-powered aircraft and jets . Most Class C airports are home to flight schools and small aircraft hangars as well as scheduled service by airlines . While still busy , Class C airports have less traffic than Class B , so ATC does n't need as much space to keep them organized . Like Class B , approach control services are provided . Pilots are only required to establish two-way communication to enter the airspace . Class D : The smallest airspace type for tower-controlled airports , traffic primarily consists of general aviation aircraft . Often these airports handle cargo , business jets , charter service , maintenance or assembly facilities , etc. as well as private aircraft and flight schools . They also host firefighting operations , airshows , or anything else that needs facilities but would interfere with normal traffic if put at a larger airport . Although Class D airports are small , some are very busy ; others handle only a few flights an hour . Approach control services are only provided if the airport is near Class B or C airspace . Class E : This is the lowest level of " controlled airspace . " " Controlled " does n't mean you have to talk to ATC , but that ATC services are available ( within the capabilities of radar and radio equipment ) . This is general-purpose airspace . Aircraft flying under visual flight rules can fly more-or-less whatever they want ( weather permitting ) , and instrument flight rules traffic operate under positive control by ATC . There are regulations in this airspace , but they are n't onerous , and they 're designed to accommodate the wide variety of aircraft and activities that are found here . Some small airports have Class E airspace surrounding them at the ground . Although Class E is a single class of airspace , there are tighter regulations above 10,000 feet , where there are no speed restrictions ( other than the prohibition on supersonic flight over land ) , compared to at lower altitudes where speeds are limited to 250 knots . Class F : See <URL> Class G : This is found near the ground everywhere except controlled airspace around airports , and occasionally at higher altitudes in remote areas ( Alaska or the Rockies , usually ) , but never above 14,500 feet . Most untowered airports have Class G airspace surrounding them . This is " uncontrolled " airspace , so there is no ATC service available at all . Radio and radar work better the higher you go , so at low altitudes you just ca n't expect good results . Class G serves as a notice that ATC services are unavailable , typically due to a lack of radar coverage . In remote areas , the same problems occur at higher altitudes ( radar wo n't see you if you go behind a mountain , and sometimes you 're just too far ) so Class G is found there as well . Most of the time , the only reason anybody goes into Class G airspace is because they 're taking off or landing at an uncontrolled airport , or transiting certain areas that lack radar coverage . Other : There are many kinds of special-use airspace , all of which serve as keep-out signs of varying levels from " please be considerate " up to " will shoot on sight . " In the US , these do n't really interact with airspace classification . * Technically , airspace above 60,000 feet is Class E , but nobody goes up there except scientific and spy/military flights .
Thanks to mins 's link , the <URL> explains everything in detail . To summarise the particular part I was asking about : FG on its own means fog ( visibility < 1000 m ) covers more than half of the horizon PRFG and BCFG are fog covering less than half of the horizon PRFG ( fog bank ) is more extensive than BCFG ( fog patches ) Another way of looking at it is like cloud cover descriptors . FG is like BKN or OVC : more than half the horizon is covered . PRFG is SCT , and then BCFG is FEW . All the above are used when the temperature is above freezing point and the fog reaches more than 2 metres above ground . If the fog is only below 2 metres agl , it 's shallow fog MIFG instead . If the temperature is below freezing , so the fog consists of supercooled water droplets , it 's freezing fog FZFG .
With many airplanes the longevity of the engine is a major factor in the price of the aircraft . Piston aircraft engines are generally good for 2000 hours of operation before they need to be overhauled , which is almost always painfully expensive . The more life left on the engine the higher the value of the airplane . SMOH and SFOH both have to do with the time since the engine was overhauled , both are in hours : SFOH = Since Factory Overhaul SMOH = Since Major Overhaul A factory overhaul means that the engine was sent back to the manufacturer for its overhaul , where a major overhaul could be done by anyone . In general factory overhauls are consistently good whereas non-factory overhauls vary more in quality . Factory overhauls are more expensive as a result . If you see an airplane that has 300 hours since overhaul then there 's plenty of life left , if you see one that has 1700 hours on the clock you know you are going to have to fork out a lot of cash much sooner , but you can get the airplane much cheaper . Another acronym you may see is SPOH , that is Since Prop Overhaul . Variable pitch propellers also have mandatory servicing requirements , and although less expensive it 's still not cheap , so a factor in the cost of the airplane .
Both engines use a turbine for power . This is where the " turbo " part of the name comes from . In a turbine engine , air is compressed and then fuel is ignited in this compressed air . The energy produced by the ignition turns the turbine . The turbine is then able to drive both the compressor at the front of the engine and also some useful load . In airplanes , it produces thrust . The first jet engine was a turbojet . This is a simple turbine engine that produces all of its thrust from the exhaust from the turbine section . However , because all of the air is passing through the whole turbine , all of it must burn fuel . This means it is inefficient , and the solution is the turbofan . In a turbofan , the turbine primarily drives a fan at the front of the engine . Most engines drive the fan directly from the turbine . There are usually at least two separate shafts to allow the fan to spin slower than the inner core of the engine . The fan is surrounded by a cowl which guides the air to and from the fan . Part of the air enters the turbine section of the engine , and the rest is bypassed around the engine . In high-bypass engines , most of the air only goes through the fan and bypasses the rest of the engine and providing most of the thrust . In a turboprop , the turbine primarily drives a propeller at the front of the engine . There is no cowl around the prop . Some air enters the turbine , the rest does not . The propeller is geared to allow it to spin slower than the turbine . Although this diagram shows only a single shaft , many turboprops have two , with a high pressure shaft driving the compressor and a low pressure shaft driving the propeller . Some engines such as the popular <URL> also reverse the flow direction multiple times . Turboprops are more efficient at lower speeds since the prop can move much more air with a smaller turbine than the fan on a turbofan engine . The cowl around the turbofan 's large fan allows it to perform better than an open propeller at high speeds , but limits the practical size of the fan . At supersonic speeds , turbojets have more of a performance benefit . They develop all of their thrust from the high velocity turbine exhaust , while turbofans supplement that with the lower velocity air from the fan . Since the air from the fan is also not compressed nearly as much as the core turbine flow , it is also harder to prevent the flow from going supersonic and causing losses . The Concorde used turbojets because it was designed to cruise for long periods at supersonic speeds . Modern fighter jet engines are turbofans , which provide a compromise between efficiency and speed . There are other benefits and drawbacks between turbojets , turbofans , and turboprops , but I think they are beyond the scope of this question . Work has been done on creating a " propfan " engine , in an attempt to get the efficiency of a turboprop and the speed of a turbofan . They have yet to come up with a viable design . Elsewhere in aviation , turbine engines are used in helicopters , as a <URL> driving the rotors instead of a propeller , and with a freewheeling clutch to enable autorotations <URL> s in jet aircraft and large turboprop aircraft Turbines also find use outside of aviation in power plants ( to generate electricity ) , and even vehicles ( like the Abrams tank ) . Turbocharged piston engines use a turbine much differently from the examples above . Instead of being the primary power source , the turbine only assists the piston engine . A turbocharger uses a turbine to compress air sent to the engine intake . The increased compression helps the engine generate more power . The turbine of a turbocharger is driven by engine exhaust gasses , and a supercharger is similar but is directly powered by the engine . See the <URL> for more detail .
At the absolute simplest , compared to a two-bladed propeller , a slightly smaller three-bladed propeller can produce more thrust at a given RPM , improving climb performance . Because of the smaller diameter , the propeller tips actually travel slower than the equivalent two-bladed design , reducing noise inside and outside the airplane . Hartzell Propeller has a great <URL> . Their explanation of why more blades produces less noise is pretty good : A 2-blade propeller produces two pressure pulses per revolution , where a 3-blade propeller will produce three smaller pulses per revolution ( for the same amount of total thrust ) which is inherently smoother and therefore quieter . The 3-blade propeller will generally have a smaller diameter than the 2-blade propeller that it replaces , which also reduces the tip speed and noise .
The statement is apparently from the <URL> of <URL> at George Mason University . One form of fog that is formed in airports usually is radiation ( or ground ) fog . As the flat open surfaces in airport are prone to cooling overnight due to thermal radiation , the air close to the surface is also cooled to the dew point . This reduces the ability of the air to hold moisture , allowing condensation and fog to occur . One reason for the statement may be that open areas in the airport give up their heat much quicker than urban heat islands , which does not have flat surfaces prone to thermal radiation .
NOAA has a great guide on their website called <URL> which covers these ( and more ) ! They actually describe it better than I could . The short version though is that TIBS is a telephone weather service while TWEB is a recorded route briefing that you can listen to while airborne . Both are used for supplemental information and do n't replace an official briefing . TIBS Telephone Information Briefing Service TWEB Transcribed Weather Enroute Broadcast PATWAS Pilot 's Automatic Telephone Weather Answering Service TRANSCRIBED WEATHER BROADCASTs ( TWEB ) are continuous broadcasts of recorded NOTAM and weather information prepared for a 50-nautical mile wide zone along a route and for selected terminal areas . TWEBs are broadcast over selected NDB and VOR facilities and generally contain a weather synopsis , in-flight advisories , route and/or local vicinity forecasts . Winds Aloft Forecasts , current weather reports , NOTAMs , and special notices . TWEB outlets are listed below by state : PILOT 'S AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE WEATHER ANSWERING SERVICE ( PATWAS ) , and the TELEPHONE INFORMATION BRIEFING SERVICE ( TIBS ) , provide continuous recordings of weather and aeronautical information . The information may include area and/or route briefings , airspace procedures , and special announcements . Telephone numbers for PATWAS and TIBS locations are found in the Airport/Facility Directory . TWEBs , PATWAS , and TIBS are for preflight or inflight planning and should not be considered a substitute for formal preflight briefings .
A monocoque fuselage has its skin holding the skeleton structure together while the semi-monocoque has both the skin and the skeleton holding together . Semi-monocoque also has " stringers " running horizontally down the plane to help hold the frame together . The monocoque fuselage also can not be used for airframes after a certain size ( small aircraft with single engine ) , but the semi-monocoque has been used from single piston engines to commercial airliners . A monocoque design would also have a safety risk involved if the skin was damaged because it is the load-bearing structure . <URL> Image and some text <URL>
A Line Replaceable Unit is a piece of hardware that can be exchanged for a replacement part in a relatively short time by only opening and closing fasteners and connectors . You will find the term LRU in avionics but also in ATC hardware . Examples are FMC , transponder , etc. . When you have a complex avionics system you tend to end up with a great variety of LRUs . All these LRU have a very specific function . To be able to quickly replace malfunctioning parts , maintenance needs to keep a large stock of spares for all these LRU 's . The Integrated Modular Avionics concept attempts to reduce the variety of LRU 's by designing the avionics with common components . E.g. one type of power supply , one type of memory unit , one type of processing board and only a few variations of input/output modules . This reduces the number of replacement parts needed to be kept on stock . The LRUs of IMA have more generic functions than in a traditional avionics system .
Your friend is right . Elevator trim is n't setting a pitch , it is compensating for control forces on the elevator , which vary with speed . If you are trimmed for level flight at 100 kias and reduce power the plane will initially slow . As it slows the trim will cause a nose-down moment causing the plane to pitch down . Given no input , the plane will equilibrate at whatever nose-down pitch is needed to regain the forces it was trimmed for , which means speeding back up to 100 kias . You are correct that to maintain 100 kias with reduced power the nose should be lowered , but the trim will take care of that for you . You might have a misconception about how trim works , based on your argument . A typical trim setup in light airplanes is essentially another control surface on the elevator : <URL> The elevator is the large control surface and that smaller control surface is the elevator trim . When you adjust the pitch trim you are adjusting this trim tab which provides a force on the elevator that counters aerodynamic forces . This is why the airplane responds in pitch to maintain constant aerodynamic forces ( e.g. constant indicated airspeed ) for a given trim setting . You can test this in the airplane easily . Take your plane up to the altitude you practice maneuvers at , set 75 % power ( or some other number ) and trim for straight and level . Add power and watch the plane climb , decrease power and watch it descent , both without touching the trim . Go back to straight and level and trimmed and accelerate without climbing -- note you are having to retrim as your speed increases . Decelerate without descending -- note you are retrimming as your speed decreases .
The wing fence is more or less what it is called - a fence . For swept wing aircraft , the local flow is not along the direction of flight , as there is a significant spanwise flow from the center towards the tips . It can be seen in the following figure . <URL> Image from <URL> The end result is that the boundary layer continues to grow ( thicken ) in this direction , with outboard regions more prone to stall than inboard ones . Basically , the wing fences stop the spanwise flow , with the result being a new ( thinner ) boundary layer starts on the other side of the fence . In case of a vortex generator , the VGs basically create a vortex which re-invigorates the boundary layer by mixing free stream air with that of the boundary layer , thereby preventing separation .
Acrobatic is being incorrectly used , although it is slightly more complicated than that . " Aerobatic " refers specifically to flight , and " acrobatic " refers specifically to feats of the human body , so referring to an aircraft as performing acrobatics is wrong . That said , <URL> and sounds nearly identical , so it 's an understandable and relatively common error .
Based upon the terminology I have heard over the years , a compass swing is the alignment of the compass , normally using a compass rose painted on a surface . The compass is adjusted and a deviation card is created for cardinal points on the compass . A check swing , as I have heard it referred to , is the checking of the compass , and done with the aircraft running , and electrical loads on , similar to a compass swing , but without the adjustment . The deviation card is verified , but there is no intent of adjusting anything . This was typically done before we ferried aircraft over the ocean , where there would be extended dead-reckoning ( before GPS and LORAN ) , and where flights were close to the polar regions , and compass operation needed to be verified prior to the flight . Not that a compass is worth much near the poles ( grin ) . My guess is that check swing is merely a slang term , whereas compass swing is well understood and extensively documented .
Generally speaking a checklist is an actual list of items to check , and a flow is a pattern of movement across the aircraft controls ( switches , dials , etc. ) which will accomplish some subset of the items on a checklist . A flow should be essentially " muscle memory " for a pilot and performed by rote , where a checklist may be more detailed and include more specific guidance . As you can probably tell flows and checklists are closely related ( with flows usually being derived from checklists ) . The two are complimentary tools that are used together : A pilot will follow a flow , and then verify that the required items have been completed using the checklist . In larger/more complicated aircraft it 's not possible to fully memorize some of the checklists , so flows are used to accomplish the " red box " immediate action items before proceeding to the full checklist . As a simple example , consider the engine power loss flow &amp; checklist for a Piper Cherokee . Engine Power Loss Flow ( Red Arrow &amp; Numbers ) Mixture ( Set appropriately - usually " Rich " ) Throttle ( Set appropriately ) Carb Heat / Alternate Air ( On ) Magnetos ( Both ) Electric Fuel Pump ( On ) Primer ( In &amp; Locked ) Fuel Selector ( On a tank that has fuel ) Manufacturer 's Engine Power Loss Checklist ( Blue Numbers ) Fuel Selector - Switch to a tank containing fuel . Electric Fuel Pump - On Mixture - Rich Carb Heat - On Engine Gauges - Check for an indication of the cause of power loss Primer - Check Locked . If no fuel pressure is indicated check tank selector position to be sure it is on a tank containing fuel . Ignition Switch - " Left " then " Right " then back to " BOTH . " Throttle and Mixture - Different settings . ( This may restore power if problem is too rich or too lean a mixture , or a partial fuel system restriction . ) Try another fuel tank . ( Water in the fuel could take some time to be used up , and allowing the engine to windmill may restore power . If power loss is due to water , fuel pressure indications will be normal . ) <URL> In this example the flow accomplishes nearly all the checklist items , but it does so moving over the panel in one direction . As a practical matter the flow is accomplished by just moving your hand along the bottom of the panel : " Push the mixture . Push the throttle . Pull the carb heat . Twist the mag key . Flip all the switches UP ( on ) . Pull the primer and make sure it does n't move . Move the fuel selector lever to the other tank . " Completing the flow takes less than 10 seconds and can be done with one hand while your other hand is pitching for best glide speed . The manufacturer 's checklist for an engine power loss moves around the panel in a more haphazard way , but it also adds a few items ( checking the engine gauges &amp; fuel pressure indication ) , and provides more specific guidance on possible causes like fuel contamination ( water in the fuel ) &amp; how to deal with them . These items could be important if the memory items from the flow do n't restore engine power , assuming you have time ( altitude ) to spend troubleshooting them .
The difference is in the minimum control speeds ( $ V _ { mcg } $ and $ V _ { mca } $ ) . In Assumed Temperature takeoff thrust , the pilots are allowed to advance the thrust levers to full rated takeoff thrust . However , in Derated takeoff thrust , the levers should not be increased beyond the fixed decate limit , otherwise a engine failure may result in loss of directional control . From Boeing 737 FCTM ( my emphasis ) : The fixed derate is considered a limitation for takeoff . Takeoff speeds consider ground and in-air minimum control speeds ( VMCG and VMCA ) at the fixed derate level of thrust . Thrust levers should not be advanced beyond the fixed derate limit unless conditions are encountered during the takeoff where additional thrust is needed on both engines , such as windshear . A thrust increase , following an engine failure could result in loss of directional control . The minimum control speeds are calculated based on the full rated takeoff thrust . The rated thrust is lowered in Derated takeoff but not in Assumed Temperature takeoff . Therefore , by calculating the minimum speeds based on a lower engine rating , the pilots can be ensured that sufficient directional control can be maintained on a slippery runway , whereas there is no such guarantee for Assumed Temperature takeoff . On a dry and long runway , there is no operational difference between Assumed Temperature and Derated takeoff . From the Boeing 777 FCTM ( my emphasis ) : Reduced takeoff thrust ( ATM ) may be used for takeoff on a wet runway if approved takeoff performance data for a wet runway is used . However , reduced takeoff thrust ( ATM ) is not permitted for takeoff on a runway contaminated with standing water , slush , snow , or ice . And : Derated takeoff thrust ( fixed derate ) may be used for takeoff on a wet runway and on a runway contaminated with standing water , slush , snow , or ice . The Boeing 737 FCTM has a nearly identical description . The A330/A340 FCTM explains that the slower $ V _ { mcg } $ / $ V_1 $ can also allow increased MTOW on short runways : When taking off from short or contaminated runways where ASDA [ Accelerate-Stop Distance Available ] is the limiting factor , a reduction in the minimum control speeds may generate a take-off performance benefit and a higher MTOW .

Is it possible to disengage only one axis of a two-axis autopilot ?
Some autopilots found on advanced aircraft can be engaged on selected axis only , for example Boeing 737 , 747-200 &amp; MD-11 . There are three autopilot indicators on the Boeing autopilots : auto throttle , roll and pitch . Each can be in a different mode . Here a Boeing 737 's autopilot roll mode is set to Heading Select ( HDG SEL ) while the Pitch is flown manually ( CWS P ) : <URL> The pilot can pull or push the yoke , and the autopilot will roll the aircraft automatically . If the pilot steer the yoke left or right , the roll mode will change to CWS R . In this image below , the pilot is manually Rolling the aircraft ( CWS R ) , but the autopilot pitch mode is set to Vertical Speed mode . <URL> Later models , such as the Boeing 777 , does not have this feature - both pitch and roll modes must be engaged together .
CNN has applied for and received multiple waivers for <URL> as allowed by <URL> . <URL> -- This allows " Small unmanned aircraft system ( sUAS ) operations over human beings in accordance with the CNN UAS Operations Manual , Fotokite Pro 1 Operator Guide , and Fotokite Pro 1 Specifications Sheet . " It allows operation " over private or controlled-access property with permission from a person with legal authority to grant access " and prohibits operations over open-air assemblies of people . <URL> -- This allows operations " conducted over human beings for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming " . Make and model of sUAS not specified , but all operations must comply with the operator 's manual . <URL> -- This waiver is granted for the Vantage Robotics Snap only , and allows " operations over all human beings ( including Nonparticipants ) " . It also limits the altitude when operated over people to 150 feet AGL , as opposed to the normal limit of 400 feet AGL . I assume this is the waiver you are interested in . The simple reason why only one particular model of UAS is allowed is that CNN only submitted that model for waiver and no others , and the FAA approved that . This is a somewhat unsatisfying answer , but neither CNN 's nor the FAA 's reasoning is included in the text of the waiver itself . The rest of this answer is speculation on my part . As can be seen on <URL> , the Snap is reasonably lightweight ( 1.37 lbs / 620 g including battery ) , has caged props , and has a high-quality camera . ( The camera is n't a matter of safety , but it is presumably something a cable news provider is interested in . ) If a prop were to fail catastrophically , the cage would hopefully contain at least some of it , thus eliminating risk of a crowd being hit by sharp objects . The height restriction of 150 feet AGL reduces the potential for injury of a nonparticipant should the sUAS fall on them , and the prop cages prevent contact with moving parts . I suspect that CNN applied for a waiver specifically for this model and the FAA approved it based on the following : It 's specific . The more general the application , the more likely it is to be rejected . If you know what you 're working with , you can evaluate all the parameters and come up with a safe solution . If there are more variables , it 's harder to reason about . It has certain safety features as discussed above , which make it more suitable for flight over nonparticipants than some other models . It 's standard . CNN has a single platform to train their over-crowd operators on . Once again , this also has safety benefits , because the operators are extremely familiar with one model of unit , instead of broadly familiar with many different ones . This particular model of sUAS had all the features that CNN wanted and that the FAA was interested in for this application . This may include such factors as weight , safety features , well-written operation and maintenance manual , and ease of maintenance . Additionally CNN may have liked the cost ( the FAA would n't care about that ) . The FAA maintains a list of <URL> .
In the movie Flight ( 2012 ) , Captain Whittaker ( Denzel Washington ) does not explain why he deliberately inverted his aircraft , but the obvious inference is : since the horizontal stabilizer has slipped off its jackscrew and become jammed into a descent angle beyond the authority of the elevators to correct , in inverted flight this would push the nose far above the horizon and result in either a climb or a stall . In this attitude , Whittaker would have been pulling back on the yoke to prevent the stall . In the movie , this worked . The aircraft was still not under control , but was no longer diving and overspeeding . Suddenly rolling the aircraft upright in the last seconds before contact with terrain is the unrealistic part . A hot fighter jet might accomplish this but the roll rate of a passenger jet is too slow . The movie 's flight emergency is based mostly on the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261 on January 31 , 2000 . In that incident , the pilots experienced a jammed horizontal stabilizer with uncontrollable dive , and inverted their MD-80 to arrest their descent . Unfortunately in real life neither flying officer was stuffed to the gills with booze and coke : the maneouver failed and the aircraft crashed with no survivors .
Yes take-off without flaps is possible . The Airbus A300 and Boeing 767 are approved for such take-offs and it is being done regularly . It results in a better climb gradient , especially with one engine out . The one engine out climb gradient is an important and sometimes limiting factor in take-off calculations . One important constraint is the length of the runway . Another limitation , perhaps less obvious , is the maximum rolling speed of the wheels . The tires are rated to a limited speed which may be exceeded by a flap-less take-off .
GPS units paired with older autopilots such as the S-TEC 30/50 mentioned here do not automatically give GPSS steering to the autopilot unless the GPS has a GPSS system built in . In this case the additional GPSS unit swaps between traditional NAV/APR/BC modes that seek using deflection from the CDI and GPSS steering which is data-driven straight from the GPS . It is possible to get a PFD that has GPSS built in as well ( Aspen Evolution ) and takes care of this functionality . A functional difference between these two systems is demonstrated as such with a Garmin GNS-530W / 430W and an STEC-50 autopilot with the separate GPSS unit : 1 ) with the GPS giving guidance and GPSS off ( or not installed ) the autopilot treats the GPS input signal as a CDI input - in other words , if there is a course change of greater than 10 degrees in either direction the autopilot will follow no guidance and do whatever it wants to , for example ignoring a 90 degree right turn in the flight plan ( other than making an initial heading change of a few degrees while attempting to track as the CDI quickly goes full deflection ) and then continuing on in whatever random way it wants without following guidance or a flag showing on the CDI ( there is no flag because the guidance is present , but it 's out of range just like a VOR signal would be ! ) . Accordingly all major course changes must be executed manually or in heading mode by hand then the autopilot is engaged in NAV mode to track the course once it is captured and within 10 degrees of the present course . 2 ) with the GPS giving guidance and GPSS on the GPSS unit sends direct roll steering commands to the autopilot that are extremely accurate . The autopilot must always be in HDG mode to accept these inputs . The heading bug on the DG or HSI is effectively ignored while GPSS is engaged . Here 's an example : while tracking a course ( or really at any point in flight ) , selection of a 90 degree right turn ( say , direct to ) in the GPS will result in direct roll steering commands being given to the autopilot and the autopilot executing those commands and following them extremely closely within the parameters of the autopilot design ( standard rate turn , etc. ) , resulting in an automatic turn to the new course , including automatic intercept of that course if the GPS performs that function , and any following courses and changes being flown precisely and automatically as they are sequenced in the flight plan . Source : I now own an aircraft that has this system and operate it all the time .
Possible : Yes You can in theory lift anything . To do this you will simply need to generate an equal or exceeding amount of lift than the weight of the object . You will also need to generate enough thrust to achieve said situation . The closest thing I can think of to this was <URL> which did actually fly . If you are talking about the kind of vertical hovering that the ship in the movie does you would need to generate an amazing amount of thrust to achieve that . A US <URL> displaces 100,000 long tons ( 224,000,000 LBS ) so you would need to generate at least that much thrust but in reality you would need to generate more to overcome drag and to actually accelerate the craft vertically . For a point of comparison the <URL> weighed 3270 tons ( 6,540,000 pounds ) . If we work through a quick example ( these are very very lose numbers ) , lets take the Nimitz at 224,000,000 LBS and the <URL> ( currently the biggest turbo fan jet ) . The GE90 generates about 115,000 lbf of thrust . So it would take just under 2000 GE90s to generate enough thrust . But lets round it off at 2000 for ease of use and a bit of extra power . The diameter of the engine is 3.429 m and the Nimitz is 332.8 m long . You would need arms with 10 engines a piece just to make all 2000 engines fit down the length of the side . If they were stacked directly next to each other the arms would be about 35m in length . The bigger issue here is fuel flow/mass . You would need to lift enough fuel to actually power these engines for a useable amount of time . On the more sifi side of things , you could use the Nimitz 's nuclear reactor to power ducted fans which overcomes the fuel problem to an extent but I dont have any numbers on that .
In an aircraft the brake pedals control the respective side brakes . This allows for the pilot to turn the aircraft not only with the pivoting nose wheel ( if it has one ) but also with the brakes . This allows for a very tight turning radius . <URL> ( <URL> ) If each pedals controls different sets of wheels eg the left wheels and the right wheels of the main gear , is that not a safety flaw rather than measure given that at any point in time , It is by design to allow for the tight turning . Some smaller aircraft also do not have a steerable nose wheel so differential braking is the only option . it is impossible for the pilot to apply an equal amount of pressure to the brakes ? Pushing equally on each toe pedal will result in equal brake operation . Is n't ABS enough to the point that only one pedal is enough . The pedals allow for brake steering which a single pedal would prevent . <URL> but that simply prevents the tires from skidding . Finally do both captain and pilot step on the brakes at landing . IF not then why have two pedals ? Im not sure , when I fly with an instructor or co-pilot in smaller planes only one person operates the brakes .
Yes , there are runways numbered on only one side . For example , the third runway in the Frankfurt Airport ( 18 , Runway west ) is used only for takeoffs ( to the south ) and not for landings . Hence only number 18 is used . The other runways are used for both takeoffs and landings and are numbered 07C/25C , 07R/25L and 07L/25R . <URL> Thomas Römer / OpenStreetMap data [ <URL> ] , <URL> This restriction is due to the fact that it will interfere with the traffic in other runways . <URL> Number 36 is not painted .
Well , as with many issues involving the FAA , the " why " is a bit of a mystery . Perhaps they thought that the pilot can " lead by example " if a bail-out is needed . I 'd imagine that a lot of passengers would be a little reluctant to jump out of an airplane , but once they see the pilot go I can see them becoming highly motivated ! As far as not needing the parachute if only crew members are on board , the FAA has long held the view that they are n't protecting pilots from doing stupid things to themselves since they are knowledgeable and informed , but their regulations are to protect the " general public " , or the passengers in this case , who do n't know any better .
fooot has pointed out the <URL> ( powers the B-1 Lancer ) has a BPR ( bypass ratio ) of > 2:1 and comes with an afterburner . Other examples are the <URL> ( 1.1:1 ) and the <URL> ( 0.97:1 ) . Generally , anything <URL> is a low BPR , and bypass air is needed for cooling . Pure turbojets resort to other means of cooling , such as the ram air inlet <URL> , or they run inefficiently at low combustion temperatures . I ca n't speak for the inner workings of a classified military engine , but an ideal supersonic engine would be a variable cycle engine ( VCE ) . Operating with bypass in the subsonic regime , and without in the supersonic high-power demand regime . Such theoretical ( to the public at least ) examples from the 90 's are shown ( and linked ) below . Do note the idea behind the VCE is the elimination of the wasteful and noisy afterburner . So , it 's an either/or situation . A dual operation of afterburner and high bypass in a non-VCE would not have benefits . <URL> ( <URL> ) Image shows how a VCE routes the bypass air in both modes of operation . Other variations by RR and Snecma can be <URL> . Note the novel design of the Snecma with the free-turbine -- extra-fan . VCE 's would definitely be heavier and more complex engines . Related : <URL>
Imagine you have a 60 knot headwind . You have to fly an indicated airspeed of 60 knots and you can hover over the ground . If you want you can try it out in flight sim , it makes lots of fun . That 's called a STOL .
Yes you may , but you need to carry a <URL> while above 10,000 ft or in some types of <URL> and have it switched on . Which pretty much negates the stealth capabilities of your aircraft . To quote the linked AOPA page : According to 14 CFR 99.13 , no person may operate an aircraft into or out of the United States , or into , within , or across an ADIZ designated in subpart B unless operating a transponder with Mode C. Certain exemptions might apply to aircraft that were not originally certified with an engine-driven electrical system ; see 99.13 ( d ) .
A meteorite could hit an airplane , sure . There 's no known cases of it happening because meteorites which survive atmospheric entry are very rare , and airplanes are pretty small so the likelihood of it happening is extremely low .

ILS approaches were in common use in 1970 when I got my instrument rating . The normal ( Cat I ) ceiling minimum was 200 feet . So , yes , a 707 would have been able to land with a 300 foot cloud ceiling in the 70s . I checked <URL> and and found the history paragraph below : Tests of the ILS system began in 1929 in the United States . [ 14 ] A basic system , fully operative , was introduced in 1932 at at Berlin-Tempelhof Central Airport ( Germany ) named LFF or " Lorenz beam " due its inventor , the C. Lorenz AG company . The Civil Aeronautics Administration ( CAA ) authorized installation of the system in 1941 at six locations . The first landing of a scheduled U.S. passenger airliner using ILS was on January 26 , 1938 , when a Pennsylvania Central Airlines Boeing 247D flew from Washington , D.C. , to Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and landed in a snowstorm using only the Instrument Landing System . [ 15 ] The first fully automatic landing using ILS occurred in March 1964 at Bedford Airport in UK . [ 16 ] The CAA referred to in the quote was the forerunner of the U.S. FAA .
Assuming that you 're in category 3 ( aircraft under 12,500 lbs ) then an approval is only valid for 365 days , so if you want to continue flight training after that then you need to request a new one : Once you have permission to train , you have 180 days to begin training and 365 days to complete the approved training . Both of these time periods start from the day you receive approval . For example , if you begin flight training 30 days after you have been approved , you now have 335 days to finish . If you do not finish , a new training request must be submitted . That 's from the <URL> ; the TSA 's <URL> is a bit more difficult to use .
It depends what you mean by " glider " . If you mean any craft that trades height for horizontal movement while flying without engines then yes . See the space shuttle . If you mean a craft designed to fly without engine power while losing as little height as possible and exploiting thermals then no . The problem is as you lose height you gain speed and when there is no significant atmosphere you have no good way of getting rid of that speed . So you inevitably hit the atmosphere extremely fast . The difficult part of coming back from space is losing speed to atmospheric drag without your craft burning up or ripping itself apart in the process . To reenter in one peice requires thick heat shields to avoid burning up and a compact shape and robust construction to avoid breaking up . To fly for a long time without engine power while losing as little height as possible requires a lightweight construction with long slender wings . These requirements are mutually exclusive . I did some quick searches to put this in perspective . Afaict a modern glider has a glide ratio of about 50 , a 747 has a glide ratio of about 15 , concorde has a glide ratio of about 9 and the space shuttle has a glide ratio of about 1 .
Only the KAP140 two-axis autopilot with altitude preselect supports capturing a preselected altitude ( which is the one installed in the Cessna 172 before the introduction of the Garmin GFC700 ) Preselect the desired altitude using the altitude preselect knob , switch to VS mode , select the desired VS and the AP will switch to altitude hold mode when the preselected altitude is reached . Taken from <URL> .
Absolutely not , as it would not be in the sense of security . It would block engine sounds ( eg you wo n't be able to hear a rough engine ) It would block warning sounds , for example stall warnings It would block any other abnormal sounds You will have problems understanding ATC ( and they will have even more problems understanding you ) These are just some reasons out of my head . If you want to listen to music inflight , buy a good headset with an AUX-In socket , those normally reduce the volume as soon as a transmission is incoming . And apart from the audio volume , it would also put a high load on the battery / alternator , which are probably not able to handle such a high load .
Yes , I have personally worked on multiple aircraft that were infested by animals . All of these aircraft were small planes , single engine Cessnas for example . A typical example would be one or two small mouse nests in the wings . I also found at least one wasp nest in an aircraft wing . The worst I ever saw was a Mooney that had extensive mouse nests throughout the airframe . That aircraft had been unairworthy for at least a year by the time I saw it . That Mooney ended up being parted out and scrapped , largely because of extensive corrosion in the wings which was either caused by , or aggravated by , the mouse nests . Urea can induce corrosion in aluminum , and finding a mouse nest or other evidence of rodent activity should prompt closer inspection . All the other instances of mouse nests that I have found in airframes were in aircraft that flew several hundred hours a year and these did not suffer any major damage . I have also heard stories from many pilots and mechanics of finding birds nests -- for example in engine intakes or the empennage -- and of rodents chewing into or through electrical wiring . There is also the classic warning to check the pitot tube in case a mud wasp has clogged the intake with a nest . I have never witnessed any of these occurrences myself . The mud dauber wasp is notorious and is suspected of being a contributing factor in at least one fatal airline accident that I am familiar with : <URL> . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA Many means of prevention are available , including typical pest prevention methods such as traps and poisons -- in my experience all reserved for use in the storage hanger . The most aviation specific forms are the various covers used to protect <URL> , <URL> , etc. . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA As far as the possibility of animals surviving , I suppose the odds are low . I have never encountered a live animal in an airplane ( pets excepted ) . For any animal stowing away on a pressurized aircraft operating at high altitude I should think the low oxygen partial pressure and temperature would both discourage survival outside the pressure vessel . Some flights , particularly international ones , apparently make a practice of spraying some form of pesticide in the cabin to kill mosquitoes and other unwanted creatures .

How do aircraft stall warning systems work ?
Audible Warning On light aircraft there is a reed ( much like used on a musical wind instrument ) mounted on one wing root , which is angled such that at the Angle of Attack which would cause a stall , the reed " plays " which can be heard in the cockpit . Here is a view of where this system is mounted on a Cessna <URL> On some aircraft , it is a similar principal , however instead of a reed , it uses a fin which at critical AoA pushes a micro-switch which activates a buzzer/horn inside the cockpit . Here is the assembly on a Beech 18 <URL> So , if you ever see anyone doing this : They are not kissing their aircraft for good luck , merely testing the stall warn as part of pre-flight checks ! Tactile Warning In addition to an audible reed/buzz/horn , most aircraft also provide tactile feedback to the pilot of an impending stall . In purely mechanical aircraft the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot when approaching a stall . In hydraulic or fly-by-wire aircraft , this is provided by a mechanical " stick shaker " linked to the same system as sounding the audible alarm .
To avoid overheating , the usual trick is to select the right material : The <URL> used a special aluminium alloy , called <URL> , which had higher strength at elevated temperatures and allowed the Concorde to cruise at Mach 2.02 . Aluminium melts at 660 ° C . The <URL> used stainless steel instead of aluminium to make its top speed of Mach 3.1 possible ( top speed without engine damage was Mach 2.83 ) . Titanium would had been even better , but was expensive and difficult to work with at that time . Stainless steel melts between 1400 ° C and 1450 ° C . The <URL> used <URL> in addition to stainless steel . Its cruise speed was also Mach 3.0 . Titanium melts at 1668 ° C . The <URL> used <URL> for 85 % of its structure to allow a cruising speed of Mach 3.2 . The X-15 was built from <URL> - X , a nickel-chromium alloy which has excellent strength at high temperature ( it starts to melt at 1393 ° C ) and allowed it to go up to Mach 6.5 . The Space Shuttle used a ceramic insulation on top of the load-carrying aluminium structure which kept the heat away from the structure during descent . Note that the Shuttle had to be <URL> to cool the on-board systems after landing . The next trick is to fly higher up where air is less dense . Lower density does not reduce the air temperature , but it reduces the heat flow so the airframe will settle at a lower temperature . Remember that the eventual heat is the combination of convection , radiation and heat conductivity . Flying high up allows especially the top surface to radiate heat freely into the black of space above . The hottest aircraft ever was the <URL> A-2 . For a speed record attempt , the whole aircraft was covered with <URL> so the process of sublimation would carry some more heat away . To protect the paint from liquid oxygen , a white topcoat was applied also . <URL> X-15 A-2 shortly after being dropped from the B-52 carrier ( picture <URL> ) . Note the small barrel under the lower fin : This was a ramjet which was test-flown on this occasion . <URL> Damage to the ventral stabilizer . The ramjet separated prematurely due to frictional heating ( picture <URL> ) A third trick is to fly fast only for a short time . A heat-seeking air to air missile will easily reach Mach 3 , but only for less than a minute . To keep the sensor cooled , a pressurized gas ( argon or nitrogen ) would be expanded ( the <URL> even uses a <URL> ) . By heating the structure or using an internal heat sink , the limited heat load can be tolerated , albeit only for a very limited time .
The general FAA regulation on turbine engines on airliners is § 25.939 § 25.939 Turbine engine operating characteristics . ( a ) Turbine engine operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics ( such as stall , surge , or flameout ) are present , to a hazardous degree , during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the engine . ( b ) [ Reserved ] ( c ) The turbine engine air inlet system may not , as a result of air flow distortion during normal operation , cause vibration harmful to the engine . The FAA has published Advisory Circular 25.939-1 which provides more detail as to how this regulation should be met . The takeoff phase is critical for safety , so the FAA requires testing to show that : No adverse engine operating characteristics ( mild , moderate , or severe ) should exist after the power setting phase ( normally completed by 60 to 80 knots ) of the takeoff procedure through attainment of the enroute configuration and climb to 1,500 ft. above the airport . The " adverse operating characteristics " are defined in more detail earlier in the AC . So to answer the question , no , it is required by law that jet engines have no issue with takeoffs in crosswinds . The faster an aircraft is moving , the less the crosswind airspeed component is . Once the aircraft is flying , aside from control inputs or changes in the atmosphere , the air stream comes from straight ahead . The highest amount of relative crosswind will actually occur while the aircraft is sitting on the ground . Note that unlike the takeoff phase : Taxiing : No adverse engine operating characteristics ( mild , moderate , or severe ) should exist during taxiing except for operation in crosswinds and tailwinds where mild adverse operating characteristics are acceptable .
I suppose with <URL> you mean a powered paraglider , as pictured below . <URL> Paramotor ( picture <URL> ) Since they obey the same laws of physics , they also stall , just like a fixed-wing aircraft does . There are , however , some peculiarities which should be mentioned : The shape of the wing is produced by ram air filling the <URL> , so speed will help to keep the wing inflated and in shape . At low speed and in gusty winds the risk of the parafoil collapsing ( severe deflation ) is higher . This was the reason for several fatal accidents in the early times of paragliders , when the aspect ratio of high-performance parafoils was increased beyond safe limits . Today 's designs will normally quickly recover from a deflation event , but not without a substantial loss of altitude . The pressure forces on the parafoil will change its shape depending on its angle of attack . At low speed the angle of attack is higher , resulting in a suction peak close to the leading edge which in turn will increase the local camber of the foil . This leads to severe lift loss in a stall , and recovery needs some altitude . A fixed-wing aircraft , on the other hand , can employ an airfoil with only little lift loss in a stall , so recovery needs less altitude . This is by no means universal - there are also fixed-wing aircraft with less benign stall characteristics . If the stall on a fixed wing starts near the wing tip , the aircraft might enter an uncontrollable roll . This can happen in steep turns and with badly designed aircraft . This is not possible in a parafoil ; it might instead slide sideways with a partially collapsed parafoil , but stay upright due to its low center of gravity . If the pilot panics and pulls his brake lines on one side during a stall , the parafoil can enter a spin . Similarly , if the pilot of a fixed-wing aircraft insists on applying rudder when stalled , the aircraft can also enter a spin . Generally , due to their low wing loading and the drag of the raiser lines , paramotors fly at much lower speeds than aircraft , so accidents involve less energy , but the pilot has no protection around her/him , so fatal accidents do occur more regularly than with fixed-wing aircraft . For paragliders , Wikipedia gives a number of 2 fatalities per year for 10.000 pilots .
First , the precise terms is not fins , but control surfaces . Fins would be fixed but the four rear surfaces can rotate around a spanwise axis . By rotating , they can be positioned at an angle to the airflow , thus deflecting it and creating an opposing force . Compare that to a <URL> . They work in the same way by creating a force normal to their plane . While this force has a vertical and horizontal component , the horizontal components of the single surfaces cancel each other when all surfaces are rotated by the same angle . Their vertical components will add up , creating a pitching moment . When the left and right surfaces are rotated by the opposite angle , their vertical force component will cancel while the horizontal component will add up , thus creating a yawing moment which swings the tail around . If it were to pitch downwards , which fins would need to move and in which direction ? All four surfaces will move trailing edge down , so the resulting force will point up and pitch the whole craft nose down .
Here 's how the PAPI lights work : Depending on the angle of the viewer , a different color is seen : Then each light is calibrated to an angle : The good thing about this is that it 's dead simple technology where very few things can go wrong : The lights have to be on and calibrated for the correct angle . The downside is that its usefulness decreases with lower visibility . Some new systems appear to have solar panels as an off grid ( and alternative/backup ) power source which is sensible . Many systems today also have LED lights . If two airplanes with two different altitudes approach , do they see different number of white and red lights ? Or are the lights set for the closer airplane ? The system is independent and passive , in the sense that it never makes contact or note of the aircraft approaching . It lights up all to all aircraft in the beam . Hence , it ' works ' for all aircraft at the same time . Some new systems feature <URL> ( Final Approach Runway Occupancy Signal ) giving an indication that the runway may be occupied by another aircraft by flashing the lights . For a little information on differences between similar systems to PAPI , see <URL> .
For a basic True Airspeed Indicator ( TAS Meter ) like the one shown below , you simply dial your pressure altitude into the top window using the knob ( aligning it with the appropriate temperature mark at the bottom of that window ) , and then read your true airspeed in the other window at the bottom . <URL> Your pressure altitude can be obtained by setting your altimeter to 29.92 and reading the indication , the air temperature can be obtained from an outside air temperature ( OAT ) gauge ( or you can use one from the Winds Aloft forecast if your aircraft does not have an OAT gauge ) , and the combination of the two gives you your density altitude . The meter itself is simply a mechanical slide rule , performing the same functions as you could do manually on an E6B flight computer . The indicator above is showing a true airspeed of about 202 MPH , at a pressure altitude of 10,000 feet and a temperature of -15 degrees . For a nice video tutorial <URL> .
It depends , partially on what you precisely mean with " trim " . Pilots use a rather narrow definition where trimming means to zero the control forces for a specific control surface deflection and speed . This is achieved by tabs or springs in the control linkage . Engineers use it more broadly and include the ability to deflect control surfaces such that the desired attitude can be stabilized . I guess that you refer to this line of thought . Long before the lift coefficient of a stalling airplane peaks , the flow over part of the wing will start to separate . Ideally it will do so near the trailing edge of the wing root , and the separation will slowly progress forward and outward as angle of attack increases . This separation will shift the local center of pressure back , such that the aircraft will experience an increasing nose-down moment as it approaches stall . To stabilize it at higher angles of attack will , therefore , need nonlinearly increasing elevator deflections . Depending on the position of the center of gravity , the installed elevator authority might not be sufficient to trim the aircraft all the way into the fully developed stall . If you mean the first interpretation of " trim " , then yes , most aircraft will not allow you to zero stick forces into the stationary stall . The trim range should cover the speed for steepest climb , not more . However , if the center of gravity range is wide enough , you should be able to trim an aircraft with rear c.o.g. all the way into the stall . After all , with neutral stability you can ideally trim ( second interpretation ) any angle of attack with the same elevator deflection angle ( note that the nonlinearity explained above will require more negative elevator deflections as you approach stall even in a statically neutral aircraft ) . I would rule out that the control forces are too high - after all , when stalling in level flight at 1g the aircraft will fly as slowly as possible , so stick forces should be small . The effects of thrust depend on the engine installation . With a propeller , more power will add torque and increase the dynamic pressure at the tail . Now it depends whether the prop blast will hit the empennage - if it does n't , the effect of adding power will at best be be an asymmetric stall . In case you have a configuration change where the older configuration is known and the new should give the same flight characteristics , use tail volume as a sizing parameter . Horizontal tails of the same volume should give the same control power . Volume is the product of area and the lever arm between tail neutral point and the center of gravity . If the new tail has a different dihedral angle , do n't forget to add the cosine of the dihedral angle . When comparing elevators of the same size but of different flap chords , use the square root of the relative flap chord for comparison . Say the old elevator has a 20 % flap and the new one 30 % . The new one will have 22.5 % more control power for the same deflection ( $ \ sqrt \ frac { 0.3 } { 0.2 } $ ) . Depending on elevator chord , at some point more deflection will not help much ( typically 20 ° for a 25 % elevator - going higher will add little control power ) . Now several options can be employed to increase control power : Change the incidence of the stabilizer . That is <URL> to compensate the massive trim changes caused by Fowler flaps . Add leading edge devices on the stabilizer to make the elevator more effective . This adds a lot of complexity for a small gain , however . Use slotted flaps and double flaps to eke more control power and higher useful deflection angles from an existing elevator . Again , <URL> should point the way . In damping , both the dihedral angle and the lever arm have a quadratic influence while they have a linear influence on control power . This way one can adjust damping and control characteristics individually .
For conventional designs , the tail is composed of two parts : the horizontal tail and the vertical tail . They play a role in the trim and the manoeuvrability of the aircraft but at different levels . The horizontal tail is mainly used for longitudinal stability ( and trim ) while the vertical tails used for the lateral stability ( and trim ) . About Stability It is possible to talk of stability only after having defined an equilibrium point around which the stability is studied . An aircraft is in equilibrium if the forces and moments it experiences are balanced . Using a simple model for the longitudinal analysis , it can be decomposed in three relations called the trim equations . In order to keep it simple , it will be assumed here that the angle of attack and the flight path angle are zero . ( Note that the same reasoning can be achieved with non-zero values but the equations then become quite messy . ) Longitudinal Equilibrium These three equations are : $ $ L = mg $ $ $ $ T =D $ $ $ $ M = 0 $ $ where $ L$ is the total lift , $ mg $ is the weight of the aircraft , $ T$ is the thrust , $ D$ is the drag and $ M$ is the pitching moment around the centre of gravity of the aircraft . The second equation wo n't be studied further since it does not help to understand the role of the horizontal tail and its influence . Looking at the following picture , one can see that usually , the centre of gravity and the point where the lift applies ( called the aerodynamic centre ) are not the same . This means that the lift generated by the wing creates an induced moment around the centre of gravity that one should add to the already intrinsic pitching moment due to the main wing ( usually a pitch down moment for conventional airfoils ) . Knowing that , it is possible to rewrite the two equations of interest including the contributions from the main wing and from the horizontal tail . $ $ W+L _ t = L_w $ $ $ $ M_0 + bL_t = aL_w $ $ From these equations and the figure , it appears that the horizontal tail is used to generate a lift which induces a moment helping to balance the moments equilibrium and thus prevent the aircraft to spin on itself ( pitchwise ) . Drawback and Solution From both the figure and the equations it turns out that the lift contribution from the tail is usually negative , meaning that more lift from the main wing is needed to keep a trimmed ( or balanced ) aircraft . This drawback can be overcome by the use of a canard configuration instead . Lateral Stability The same can be done for the lateral equilibrium and stability but there it is the vertical tail that is used . It is symmetrical so that there is no yaw induced and if there is some side force experienced , it will create a moment in order to reduce the side-slip angle . Comparison of Lift Created by the Tail and Main Wing For a trimmed configuration , it is easy to see that the lift created by the main wing is more or less the one created by the tail plus the total weight of the aircraft , which gives an idea of the difference between the two forces .
The typical aircraft smoke detector works using optical sensing which exploits the Tyndall light scattering effect . From Boeing : ( <URL> ) An LED illuminates a sample of air while a light sensor , which is not in line-of-sight with the LED , looks at the same sample of air . If enough light is scattered by smoke particles then the detector will signal an alarm .
Yes and No . The definition of a stall is that the airfoil stops generating lift , which happens when the critical angle of attack is reached . In an airplane , this happens during normal flight by pitching up until the critical angle of the airfoil is reached . In a helicopter , aft cyclic ( " pitching up " in an airplane ) will only serve to make the helicopter climb and slow down until it reaches equilibrium in the new attitude . Helicopters , however , can suffer from what is called " retreating blade stall , " when the blade is at full pitch on the retreating side of the rotor : <URL> This does n't happen under normal circumstances , but there are four factors which contribute to retreating blade stall : fast -- close to Vne heavy -- at max gross weight hot -- above 35C high -- at high altitude Retreating blade stall is considered an emergency , and can be recovered from by reducing power .
There are different ways of moving flaps . The trivial case where they rotate around a hinge point which lies within the airfoil contour does not increase wing area . Fowler-type , backward-moving flaps are possible in three general ways : Douglas flap : Here the flap rotates around a single hinge line which lies substantially below the airfoil contour . As the name suggests , this is used on many Douglas Commercial aircraft . <URL> Douglas flap , left : retracted ( <URL> ) ; right : extended ( <URL> ) . Their long and narrow supports make them easy to recognize . Four - or five-bar linkages : These are mechanically more complex , but enable a more compact mechanism . As their name suggests , four or five linkages are connected with bearings and enable a more complex movement . The drawing and the animated GIF below are taken from <URL> and show the mobility m which increases with the number of joints . This would be my recommendation for a Lego model ; just make sure that the forward bar is longer than the rear bar - this will give you a realistic movement of the flap . <URL> Above : Linkage mobility ( picture <URL> ) . Below : Four bar linkage ( picture <URL> ) <URL> Sliding block guide : Here you find real rails and rollers which move along them to enable the most complex and precise movement , even for multi-element flaps . While a four-bar linkage will have a continuously increasing ratio of deflection angle to backward shift , a sliding block guide makes it possible to set the deflection angle independent of the backward shift , and allows the biggest backward shift for a given size of the mechanism . See the Boeing 747 flap tracks below for an example . <URL> Boeing 747 flap tracks ( picture <URL> ) . Note that the upper block is supporting the first flap segment and the lower block the second . Actuation is via a spindle ; the linkage in the lower left corner is actually the mechanism for moving the flap fairing .
I attended the ACS webinar on June 25th . This is the response from Christopher Morris at the FAA . You can also read the <URL> on the FAA website . If the pilot recognizes the stall warning and promptly makes an appropriate correction or airspeed adjustment , a momentary activation of the stall warning horn does not constitute unsatisfactory performance on the maneuver . As with other standards , the problem would arise from continual deviation from the standard , lack of correction , and/or lack of acknowledgment . The goal is to ensure that the applicant does not perform the maneuver with the stall warning activated . The certification standard in 23.207 states for airplane certification testing , the stall warning must " begin at a speed exceeding the stalling speed by a margin of not less than 5 knots and must continue until the stall occurs . " This is the primary reason the suggested range above stall speed has moved from " 3-5 knots " to " 5-10 knots without stall warning activation . " The certification standard for the stall warning does play a role in the airspeed selection for the maneuver , and stall warning activation will vary from one airplane to the next , so it is important for the applicant to select an airspeed where the stall warning should not activate except on a momentary basis ( e.g. , due to turbulence ) . The PTS standard for maneuvering during slow flight was for the applicant to establish and maintain " an airspeed at which any further increase in angle of attack , increase in load factor , or reduction in power , would result in an immediate stall . " The current version of the Airplane Flying Handbook says slow flight should be performed at " the slowest airspeed at which the airplane is capable of maintaining controlled flight without indications of a stall -- usually 3 to 5 knots above stalling speed . " The guidance has always intended for there not to be a stall warning , and that is consistent with slow flight guidance published in AC 120-111 . However , the 3-5 knot range given does not pair well with the part 23 requirement for a stall warning ( § 23.207 ) . It is not practical to maneuver in that airspeed range and not have the stall warning , which is an indication of a stall . The standard in the PTS also implies being right above the critical AOA , which means the stall warning would be activated . This result does not align with the guidance , or with what the FAA advocates . Specifically , the FAA does not advocate intentional disregard for a stall warning while maneuvering . The purpose of teaching slow flight is to ensure that the pilot understands how the airplane responds with less airflow over the flight control surfaces . Since airplanes are operated at low airspeeds and high angles of attack during the takeoff/departure and approach/landing phases of flight , it is essential for pilots to learn the airplane cues and how to operate the airplane in this state . Regardless of airplane type , a pilot does not need to be just below the critical AOA to experience the desired characteristics and achieve the slow flight objectives . These objectives can be accomplished without deliberately activing the stall warning through flight just below the critical AOA . We want to influence the behavior and practices the pilot will follow outside the training environment . Therefore , with the exception of performing a full stall maneuver , a pilot should always perform the stall recovery procedure when the stall warning is activated . With respect to guidance , the change to AC 61-67 published just prior to the final decision on the AFH wording change , which drove the FAA 's decision to modify this ACS Task element . We are working on another change to ensure the AC will align with the AFH and the ACS and be consistent with AC 120-111 . To further explain these changes , we intend to publish a SAFO that is now in formal coordination . Teaching what an airplane will do at the critical AOA is part of stall training and should be addressed in that context . You allow someone to ' ignore ' the warning in one narrow instance -- as part of stall training . The pilot can still learn what happens at that point -- but as part of stall training and learning the proper recoveries -- not as part of slow flight .
Yes . Fighter aircraft have air conditioning systems . In general , they are called as Environmental Conditioning Systems ( ECS ) . Their primary functions ( as far as cockpit goes ) include , Cockpit Pressurization Heating/Cooling/air-conditioning Windshield anti-fog/anti-ice The systems usually use conditioned engine bleed air or this purpose . The cockpit air conditioning is usually managed by the pilot . For example , in case of F-15 , the <URL> : <URL> Image from f-15e . info with the available controls listed as , TEMP switch : A three-way switch to manage cockpit temperature . When AUTO , cockpit temperature is automatically maintained at the temperature selected on the TEMP knob . When MANUAL , cockpit temperature may be changed with the knob , but not maitained automatically . When OFF , it shuts down off ECS air . TEMP knob : A rotary knob to set the cockpit temperature . FLOW switch : A three-way switch to select air flow . MIN , MAX and NORM settings are available for minimum/maximum/normal air flow , respectively . FLOW knob : A four-position knob to set the air source . When BOTH , bleed air is supplied from both engines . When L ENG or R ENG , bleed air is supplied from the left/right engine only . When OFF , no bleed air is supplied . The following image shows the other controls associated with ECS . <URL> Image from f-15e . info
The short answer is that there 's no real difference between a " trainer " aircraft and an " owner " aircraft when they roll off the manufacturer 's assembly line . Below are two mid-1970s Piper Cherokee Cruisers - take my word for it that they both have virtually identical instruments , avionics , and interior finishing . One of these airplanes is the " trainer " I did much of my early training in , and had a little over 11,000 hours of flight time as of when the school sold it . The other is ( probably ) an owner-flown airplane with about 2,000 hours of flight time . Can you tell which is which ? The answer is in the spoiler box at the end of this post . " Trainer " aircraft generally have flight and operational characteristics that makes them " suitable for use in training " -- though what that means <URL> . In modern training aircraft you 'll almost always find the following : Dual controls Much like a Driver 's Education car has an extra brake , aircraft used for training will have dual controls so your flight instructor can correct any mistakes the student makes before they become dangerous . ( Dual controls are in fact required for flight training , at least under FAA regulations , though interestingly <URL> . ) 2-4 person seating capacity Hand in hand with dual controls goes dual seating - You need a place for both a student and an instructor . You do n't generally find many trainers that will seat more than four people , as those larger aircraft cost more to purchase and operate . Some kind of intercom Students and instructors generally wear headsets , and an intercom system makes it easier for them to communicate . One or more Radio systems Part of flight training includes learning how to communicate with Air Traffic Control and other pilots , and how to use radio navigation systems . This requires at least a communication radio , so there 's usually one either installed or available ( a handheld unit ) , and in most modern trainers you 'll find one or more navigation radios of various types . In addition trainer aircraft tend to be inexpensive to maintain ( mechanically simple ) , operate ( relatively fuel-efficient ) , and tend toward the slower end of the speed spectrum ( because it 's easier for a student to keep up with a slower aircraft ) . It 's important to note that not all " trainers " fit this mold : The <URL> is , by designation , a Trainer aircraft , but its goal was to train Air Force pilots , many of whom would go on to air combat roles . The things a T-6 is optimized to teach are very different from what a Piper Cherokee or Cessna 172 are optimized to teach . Not surprisingly many of those same characteristics are also desirable in a plane you might buy to fly yourself : Dual controls in case you take a friend or another pilot along ( or in case you want to take instruction in your own aircraft ) , an intercom to let you talk to your passengers , and radios so you can navigate and communicate in the air traffic system . Because of this many pilots who elect to buy an airplane purchase what we would consider " trainer-class " aircraft , frequently models similar to the ones they trained in ( and in the used market , frequently aircraft that were used for flight training at some point ) . When you leave the " trainer " range you tend to find faster aircraft , more complicated systems , more attractive finishing elements ( plush cabin interiors , fancy paint schemes ) , and more seating capacity . You also find aircraft that begin to specialize more : Where trainers tend to be well-rounded the " non-trainer " planes tend to excel in specific areas , serving specific niches in the market ( the <URL> is a high-performance aerobatic aircraft favored by many airshow performers , <URL> feature extensive speed optimizations and are favored by many pilots who use their planes for long-distance travel , the <URL> is a " luxury " cruiser/transportation aircraft suitable for flying corporate executives to and from smaller airports , etc. ) . N2269Q is the trainer , now sporting a shiny new paint job . N32711 is the owner-flown airplane , with its factory paint . ( <URL> )
Modern commercial airliners have 2 different wind shear protection system : 1 ) predictive wind shear warning system 2 ) reactive wind shear warning system . These systems work independently . PWS ( predictive wind shear ) works with weather radar . Reactive wind shear works with FAC ( Flight augmentation computer ) Basicly PWS can be switched ON and OFF from the WX-Radar panel and it has some prerequisite for working : Ground speed should be above 30 KTS , WX-Radar should be ON , At least one engine working etc. ( may differ with different types ) . PWS scans 5 NM ahead from 0-2300 ft and 1500 ft below according to phase of the flight . It works like a doppler radar . It scans the movement of air mass in front of you and " predicts " something goes wrong and warns you according to how bad is the situation . Doppler frequency will shift significantly in case of a microburst so PWS will catch this shift and warn pilots with amber or red cautions . Reactive Wind shear system works with on board computers that takes real time data from all sources . This system will be active generally from 50 ft 1300 ft. ( may differ ) Reactive Wind Shear basiclly monitors aircrafts energy level . For Airbus ; FAC is responsible for that . In computing the energy level FACs use different data from different sources : ADIRS - air , ground speed , vertical speed , slope . from other sources - wind gradient , vertical wind etc. . It will be active when the a/c energy level goes below predetermined threshold . It will alter from amber to red if your energy losing trend is faster . You can read this document from airbus includes many general aviation information for more details : <URL> Hope it helps .
The automatic hookup uses a catchment area to mechanically force the pushrod into a receptacle to ensure a proper mechanical connection when the parts of the plane are connected . As an example , I have sketched below how the ailerons would be connected . The blue structure is the fuselage-side part , and the green structure is the wing-side part of the control linkage . The pushrod coming from the stick is connected to a trapezoidal cone which is hinged at the same point as the wing-mounted pivot lever which is moving the pushrod connected to the aileron . <URL> The opening of the trapezoidal cone is sized such that the end of the pivot lever will always be caught by it , regardless of the stick position and the aileron deflection . At the base where the end of the pivot lever rests when both parts are connected , the exact position and play between both can be adjusted , so the automatic connection will not have an adverse effect on handling . I once witnessed an aborted winch launch of the <URL> in which the linkages to the ailerons were interchanged . The pilot noticed the wrong operation of his ailerons before becoming airborne and released the rope quickly , but could not avoid a ground-loop , because he had pushed the low wing into the ground when trying to correct the plane 's attitude . I was glad not to have been in his position , because I am not sure I had reacted as quickly . Automatic connections would have made this mishap impossible .
The 737 does not have a separate AHRS . Those functions are simply outputs from the two IRS 's . <URL> ( <URL> ) 737 IRS panel . ATT ( attitude ) mode selects the AHRS-only output of the IRS .
Altimeters are calibrated to a standard atmosphere model ( International Standard Atmosphere , <URL> ) . What the altimeter shows you is the vertical distance between the altitude equivalent to your current pressure ( pressure altitude ) and a reference " pressure altitude " . The reference pressure altitude is set in pressure units ( hPa or In . Hg ) on the altimeter subscale . This is known as the " altimeter setting " , set in the " altimeter setting window " . Image credit : <URL> Flying at lower altitudes ( below " transition altitude " ) , the altimeter is set to airport/regional QNH , which is a pressure calculated so that if you were standing on the measurement point , the altimeter would indicate your exact elevation . At other altitudes , it would approximate altitude above mean sea level , although it would show incorrectly if temperature differed from ISA . Above transition altitude , the altimeter is set to QNE , or standard pressure ( 1013.25 hPa , or 29.92 In . Hg ) . The altimeter will now only indicate correctly if both temperature and pressure are in accordance with ISA . You are now flying on " flight level " ( where the FL is your QNE indication in hundreds of feet , ie 20,000 ft = FL200 ) . For the purpose of avoiding obstacles , both QNH and QNE have to be corrected using various methods , which are described in various manuals . ( QNH for temperature , QNE for both temperature and pressure , both for other possible factors such as wind etc ) . For instance , this diagram shows three different aircraft , all flying the same pressure altitude , but with three different true altitudes : Image credit : <URL> However , altitude is also used for the purpose of traffic separation , and for this purpose , neither QNH or QNE is corrected . This might sound counter-intuitive , but as long as your altimeter is showing the same error as any conflicting traffic , you can be safely separated , therefore : The altitude shown on the altimeter is not corrected at all ( except by calibration for possible aerodynamic interference , such as compressibility , venturi-effects etc ) . In technically sophisticated aircraft , barometric altitude input is used for vertical navigation . Since vertical navigation is concerned with the true altitude of the aircraft , the aircrafts Air Data Computer ( ADC ) will calculated a true altitude based on information available to it ( either through sensors , or through pilot input ) . The true altitude is however , as stated , not shown on the pilots primary flight instruments .
General alerting sounds are chosen by the manufacturer of the cockpit systems . Stall warnings , autopilot disconnect alerts , fire alarms etc. are all not standardised , with the exception of the words spoken by the GPWS/TAW and TCAS system . Whilst the exact sounds of these two systems are not standardised in the sense that a standard . wav file is to used by all manufacturers , the phraseology in their aural alerts is standard . The Ground Proximity Warning System ( GPWS ) / Terrain Awareness Warning System ( TAWS ) will have to issue an aural warning ' PULL UP , PULL UP ' if the aircraft is approaching terrain , and ' GLIDESLOPE ' when the aircraft is deviating far below the glideslope . Also the cautions ( ' SINKRATE . ' , ' TERRAIN . ' , ' DO N'T SINK . ' , ' TOO LOW , GEAR . ' , ' TOO LOW , FLAPS . ' , ' TOO LOW , TERRAIN . ' and ' FIVE HUNDRED . ' ) 1 are standardised . Whether it is a male , female or robotic voice is up to the manufacturer of the system , but the words are uniform across all systems . Additional cautions and aural alerts are allowed as long as they are clear and unambiguous . The same holds for TCAS ; ' TRAFFIC , TRAFFIC . ' , ' CLIMB , CLIMB . ' , ' DESCEND , DESCEND . ' , ' INCREASE CLIMB , ' , ' INCREASE DESCENT , ' , ' REDUCE CLIMB , ' , ' REDUCE DESCENT . ' , ' CLIMB , CLIMB NOW . ' , ' MAINTAIN VERTICAL SPEED , MAINTAIN . ' , ' LEVEL OFF , LEVEL OFF . ' ( supersedes " ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED , ADJUST ) , ' MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED . ' , ' CROSSING . ' and ' CLEAR OF CONFLICT ' are all standard phrases which have to be implemented in this exact wording ( 2 ) . 1 <URL> Table 4-1 ( pages 16 -- 18 ) 2 RTCA DO-185B , Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II ( TCAS II ) Version 7.1 , Volume I section , 2.2.6.3 : Aural annunciations )

Why were there passengers allowed on Concorde 's route proving flights ?
Bear in mind that these tests were n't to prove the safety of the aircraft per se , just to show that it would work as an airliner . It had to be loaded up with an appropriate complement of passengers and luggage to prove this . However proving flights may not generate revenue from passengers - they are either selected through an application process or chosen at random , and take part in the proceedings free of charge . <URL> ( Page 2 , point 3 )
In my 10 years of flying 747s on international flights , there was no way we would know of passenger reactions upon landing unless one of the cabin staff told us , and that was rare .
<URL> . When a business goes bankrupt or bust , depending on jurisdiction , the assets of the company may not belong to the company anymore , they may belong to creditors . Monarch may not have even owned them in the first place , since some airlines use leases from other airlines or banks to get aircraft . Even if Monarch did own the aircraft , and they went belly-up meaning the aircraft were basically nobody 's , now you have to worry about insurance and liability . The aircraft need to be insured to fly , and there is an assumption of liability if something ( like a crash ) were to happen . There are logistics like maintenance , repairs , etc. . Somebody will have to go through all the aircraft and make sure that they are legal to fly ( review logs , maintenance records , etc ) . Then you have the crews : they are not employed , and the CAA is n't going to employ a bunch of pilots for a couple of weeks just to run ferry flights . The pilots may demand benefits , etc. . It would be difficult or impossible to contract them as private parties ( since most insurance companies would not let you do that ) . So the easiest option is to let somebody else take care of all that by using charter flights . They have the infrastructure ( pilots , planes , fuel contracts , insurance , etc ) to get these people out . The CAA just has to call them up and say " we need X number of people picked up from ABC on some-date " , and the charter company takes care of it . Of course it is a little more expensive than doing it yourself , but you are n't trying to basically build a short-term airline and then shut it down again .
A shortcut is a deviation from the filed flightplan given to an aircraft by ATC during the flight , if traffic and other factors permit . A flight crew can not expect to get any shortcuts , so they can not plan for it . Routes in the RAD are flightplannable routes . If a direct route is available in the RAD , it can be used when filing the flightplan , prior to the flight . This allows airlines to plan for the shorter route , thus allowing them to bring less fuel and advertise a shorter flight time .
Direct link vs satellite There are three major ways of sending control messages to an aircraft : Direct radio link [ when ] in line of sight , satellite , ground stations , e.g. , tracon . The way the question starts brings confusion so the many comments . There are two categories of radio links involved in voice/data communication : Between a ground station and the aircraft and via a relay , e.g. a satellite . Satellites are merely used today for air traffic control , it 's a thing of the future ( 2 to 3 years for tracking the aircraft using <URL> ) . However satellites are sometimes used for aircraft communication with the airline technical staff and/or the manufacturers . However the information exchanged here is not ATC related at all : It can be technical , e.g. live <URL> sent to airline technical staff or to the engine manufacturer , to prepare maintenance at the destination airport . It can also be internal exchange with the airline operations . Satellite communication is also used for passenger services like telephone and Internet access aboard the aircraft . So ATC uses the other kind of links , the direct ones , which means a transmitter on the ground . However these " ground stations " can serve different purposes because ATC is organized so that ATC facilities are specialized . Simple ATC organization There are ATCOs on the site who may add details to this answer , but I 'll draw the mainlines . In the US , ATC operational facilities are divided into 4 categories : ATC Tower . Controllers are located in the airfield tower and they control aircraft on the ground ( e.g. at their gates , or on the taxiways ) , aircraft on the runways ( landing or taking off ) , aircraft approaching the airfield to land , aircraft leaving the airfield and climbing to their cruise altitude . The tower controllers have a good sight on all those aircraft . Tracon ( terminal radar approach control ) . Controllers maybe located in the tower or at other locations . They are in charge of taking over the aircraft that just took off and are now departing . They continue the control that was started by their colleagues of the Tower . They also take care of the descending aircraft before they are handed over to their colleagues of the Tower for landing . As you see , tracon actually takes aircraft from cruise altitude to near the landing runway , and from near the takeoff runway to cruise altitude . Next , there is the enroute ATC center for controlling aircraft in cruise , between the departing tracon and the arrival tracon . This facility is also known as air route traffic control center ( ARTCC ) . The enroute controllers can be located anywhere , they do n't need to see the sky , and usually they do n't see it at all , they work in a dark room using only displays and microphones . There are a <URL> to control the whole US airspace . This split is shown on this figure : <URL> that is extracted from <URL> . The last type of ATC facility is the oceanic ATC which controls an ocean area , because the procedures and tools used are a bit particular . Oceans are not belonging to a particular country , however all countries have agreed to delegate the control to a particular country for a particular area . In the US , for the East coast , New-York oceanic center will control an area , Canada will control another , UK and France will manage the other side of the pond . These centers control areas named OCA , for oceanic control area . See <URL> for North Atlantic . When the aircraft progress along its route , it is handed over to the next area controller . This was the first part : We have clarified who are the controllers and ATC facilities , where they are and what phase of flight they control . Now let 's see the radio equipment they use . Radio links First let 's clarify between radio and radar . Radar is used to determine the position of the aircraft . This can be done everywhere , except over oceans . The reason is radar has a limited range , and there are no radar stations in the ocean ( at least not for civil aviation ) . Radar stations are located at selected locations , on hills and other high places , to increase their range . some radar are located on airfields too , but that 's not a requirement . Actually , all information collected by all radar stations are gathered and distributed to all control centers as a synthetic picture . Radio is used to exchange voice messages and data . As I wrote , all radio links have a ground station at the center . This ground station is usually at the same location than the controllers . So some ATC radio equipment is at the airfield , some at the enroute centers , etc. . For OCA , the equipment can be remote from the controllers , but this is just a technical detail . Aviation radio for ATC messages can use two types of frequencies : VHF ( very high frequency ) which works mostly in line of sight , so the range is something around 50 km to 200 km depending on propagation conditions and location . VHF is used when the aircraft is flying over lands . Controllers at the towe
Some deicing fluids can leave a gel-like residue on the airplane . Several incidents occurred with 737s where the residue accumulated in the elevator balance bay , causing severe oscillation/vibration in flight above 270 KIAS . These incidents resulted in the issuance of <URL> , which required adding the 270 KIAS limitation you discovered into the 737 's Airplane Flight Manual ( AFM ) . The required " maintenance procedures " consist of cleaning off the deicing fluid residue . The AD also requires a one-time cleaning and sealing of the elevator balance bay . The FAA has received reports of numerous incidents of severe airframe vibration , or limit cycle oscillation ( LCO ) , in flight after the horizontal stabilizer had been deiced/anti-iced on the ground . The reported incidents occurred on Boeing Model 737-600 , -700 , and -800 series airplanes . The empennage structure on these , as well as Model 737-700C series airplanes , is identical ; therefore , all of these airplanes are subject to the identified unsafe condition . These events have been attributed to an accumulation of deicing/anti-icing fluid or other residue in the elevator balance panel cavities and on the external surfaces of the elevator tab . A <URL> gives some more information and also has some photos showing the residue . Here 's what a gummed-up 737 elevator balance panel looks like : From the article : Airplane deicing and anti-icing fluids can leave residue in critical areas in the wings and stabilizers . This residue can rehydrate and expand into a gel-like material that can freeze during flight and cause restrictions in the flight control systems . Therefore , attention to this residue should be part of a regularly scheduled inspection and cleaning process . ... Although Type III fluids have not been specifically linked to any events involving flight controls , the composition of these fluids makes them equally susceptible to residue problems as the Type II and Type IV fluids .

FAA considers space shuttle either a military aircraft or spacecraft and hence its rules do n't apply on space shuttle . However , requirements to be a <URL> : ... at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-command time on jet aircraft It means that you need type rating to operate a heavy jet aircraft ( not light jet ) . <URL> is 172,000 lb ( 78,000 kg ) 1 .

As the previous answers have stated , their schedules are determined by what best suits their needs . However , those schedules can be complicated by contractual and curfew requirements . A contractual example : Thousands of expatriate Brits live in the south of Spain . They want their morning London papers . We would depart Stansted ( just north of London ) as soon as possible . We were contractually committed to have the load to Barcelona by 07:00 local , with huge penalties if we failed ( the papers were worthless by noon ) , and then on to Palma de Mallorca . Hopefully by now , they transmit the papers electronically and print them locally . A curfew example : A cargo flight departing Hong Kong bound for Chitose , Japan ( refuel there then on to Anchorage ) . The old Kai Tak airport at Hong Kong had a 23:00 local curfew ; Chitose had a curfew until 06:00 local . The solution to that was to depart Hong Kong just before the curfew , land at Taipei and park for a couple of hours ( I forget the exact time ) , and then continue to Chitose to arrive just after 06:00 local . All Japan airports at the time had a curfew from 23:00 local to 06:00 . You could go out to the south end of the airport just before 06:00 local , and set your watch by the first arrival of what was tens of aircraft , both passenger and cargo , whose departure time was determined by the need to arrive as soon as possible after the airport opened
While there is a chance it can interfere with aircraft equipment there are lots of other reasons as well . It 's disturbing , you would not want a can full of people yapping on their phones for 5 hours while others tried to sleep . Lets be honest does asking someone to " Keep It Down " ever really work . It 's very taxing on the cell network itself . Without going into lots of detail about how <URL> , the short and sweet of it is that when you are moving ( say in a car ) your phone is constantly hopping form tower to tower . At the speeds a plane moves at you would hop tower at a rate that would be far more taxing on the system than when you are in a car and could lead to dropped calls and other connection issues . You need to listen up ! While the laws on in flight entertainment have become more relaxed over time , one of the reasons you are not to use things during takeoff and landing is these are critical times in the flight ( for something to go wrong ) and if it does , you need to be attentive and able to listen to instructions . This , on some level , holds true for the whole flight as well I would think . The phone itself occupies <URL> outside of the band that <URL> however there is always a possibility when you have 2 EM waves that <URL> .
It does , but there is much less of it on the fuselage than on the wing . There are two ways how ice is accumulated on the aircraft 's structure : When flying through air containing <URL> , the water will freeze on impact . It does not make much of a difference whether the water impacts the fuselage nose or the leading edge of the wings and tail surfaces : It will form a sheet of clear ice . When flying through moist air at a temperature close to freezing , the <URL> will <URL> , so the moisture condenses and , if temperature allows , will form ice accumulations . Those in turn exacerbate the suction peaks , leading to more ice being collected . The wing 's leading edge shows the most pronounced suction peaks , so they will collect most ice . However , if the icing conditions are right , the fuselage nose will also pick up it 's share of ice . Along the length of the fuselage , pressure is similar to ambient , so it will collect ice only when sitting on the ground in freezing rain . <URL> Iced engine nacelle in the NASA Lewis ( now Glenn ) Research Center icing research tunnel ( picture <URL> ) . Here , water is sprayed into the tunnel and forms supercooled droplets . In both cases icing has nothing to do with the boundary layer - with supercooled water it is simple ballistics , while the second case of ice accumulation is dominated by the pressure of the flow around the aircraft .
The robot , or better the software analyzing the sensor output , needs to be programmed for every eventuality . After all , wear and tear does not leave standard traces , and a human is still better in spotting when something does not look quite right . This does not concern the obvious cases , but those where experience and intuition make the difference . Next , aircraft structures are made with human inspectors in mind . A robotic system would need to be able to access all points at least as well as a human can . This puts some heavy restrictions on the robot 's physique . Eventually , a robotic system will surpass most humans , but only after thousands of man-hours of training . Maybe someone is developing just such a system right now , but I am unaware of this . One point remains , however : Who will be liable if the robotic system makes a mistake ? The manufacturer will need to buy insurance to cover those corner cases where the robot fails , and this will come on top of the hefty expense for developing and training such a system . I expect that the military ( e.g. <URL> ) will be the first to make the plunge , and only when the robot has a positive track record will civilian operators start to consider using it . The EasyJet drones are just helping to get a camera on top of the aircraft ; the eventual monitoring of the feed will still be performed by humans . They are a high-tech version of a periscope , if you want .
There were a few problems : Pressurization ( while not impossible ) was difficult requiring extra effort . It also increased weight and complexity . Pressurization was still a relatively new technology at the time . For reference , the first pressurized commercial aircraft , the <URL> , made its first flight later the same year ( 1938 ) as the B17 . Note that it was developed from the B17 . There was an incredible amount of openings on early planes for gun turrets , bomb bays , etc. . Sealing these off airtight would have been a impractical nightmare . You would traverse the bomb bay move to the back and front of the plane . It 's also better from a reliability standpoint - it 's pretty easy to damage and make a hole in the fuselage , but everybody having their own oxygen masks removes that single point of failure . While perhaps ( I imagine ) not incredibly comfortable for long duration missions oxygen masks worked fine . 30,000 ft corresponds to around 9,200 m , although that altitude is a ceiling defined by Boeing . With full load , they never achieved those altitude and hung around a lot lower . While I ca n't verify it , these <URL> appears to suggest that 19,000ft-28000ft with bombs was more common . To do the math , the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level is around 0.21 bar . If you 're being fed 100 % oxygen through your mask , this is the same pressure as at 11,000 m.

You 're really asking two questions here 1 ) What is the procedure ( ie when are the calculations made ) ? 2 ) Do additional passengers affect the weight ? What is the procedure As soon as check in closes , the numbers for passengers and bags is finalized - nothing else can be added to the plane , otherwise it could potentially run out of fuel . Passengers can be removed , but the captain must be informed in case it affects balance . At this point the captain calculates the required information for weight , fuel , and balance . It 's done shortly after check in closes as there is a limited window in which to add extra fuel etc - remember that the tanker needs to be long clear before the engines can be started and other departure checklists can be run . This is done so early because the pilot needs time to prepare the aircraft for departure , he does n't have time to mess about later on adjusting the numbers , and if he has to re-calculate later it adds a whole extra area where mistakes can be made - especially since later on the pilot is likely to be more distracted . Doing it once is fairly easy , you plug the number of passengers into a set of sums along with temperature and other related factors , and it works fuel load out for you . If you try adding passengers you have to re-calculate this , then work out how much extra to add ... it 's just a whole bunch of extra things that can go wrong . Do extra passengers affect the weight/balance of the aircraft Short answer : yes Take an A319 as an example aircraft : empty , it weighs 40,000 kg , up to a maximum of around 60,000 kg Now I have no idea what you and your family and bags weigh , but let 's produce a range . Please do n't be insulted by the range : the airline are n't judging your weight when deciding if you can board late : they have to have a single rule regardless of whether it 's a skinny teenager travelling alone or a party of 15 obese people You 're an adult , so you presumably weigh anywhere between 50 and 150kg You said children but do n't state an age , so they could be newborns or adults : weight anywhere between 2kg and 150kg I do n't know how many children you have , but for the sake of argument I 'll guess it 's between 2 and 5 ( as you said " children " ) - that 's somewhere between 4 and 750kg So your total weight for a single family is anywhere between 54kg and 900kg . Chances are most families are more like 250-300kg ( a couple of adults at 60-100kg each , and a couple of kids at 20-40kg ) , but airlines have to assume worst case , otherwise their check in staff have the impossible job of deciding who 's too fat to board late . So take that worst-case scenario ( 6 obese people ) and add a 7kg carry-on bag each , that 's nearly 1000kg of weight which the pilot does n't know on the plane . Or over 2 % of the aircraft 's empty weight and nearly 1.5 % of the maximum takeoff weight . This is assuming they have no hold bags . Even if your family only weighs 250kg between you and your bags , that 's still nearly 0.5 % of the aircraft 's empty weight - a not insignificant number . And finally you have to remember that by carrying the extra 0.5 % of weight in people , the aircraft needs some extra fuel . And a bit more fuel to carry that extra fuel , and both of those extra amounts of fuel change the balance of the aircraft . In most " normal " flights you are n't going to make a huge enough difference to balance to cause a crash , or change the fuel requirement enough to cause an issue , but if the aircraft had to divert , you could be the difference between running out of fuel or not , and in some worst-case circumstances a really big family could upset a small aircraft .
It seems you looked at flights which had begun shortly before . Since intercontinental flights require a higher <URL> to carry enough fuel for the trip , the airplane can not climb as high initially as one with little fuel onboard . Note that the maximum range of a <URL> , while the flight you chose to take as the basis for your question covered only 1936 km . The tanks were probably less than half full , and depending on the <URL> , the airplane was probably well below its maximum take-off mass , hence it had <URL> early in the flight . Had you included intercontinental flights close to their destination , your question would had been different . Note that TSC284 flew in <URL> shortly before descending . At this point , the tanks held only a fraction of the fuel at take-off , and for a flight of 7526 km it had probably taken off close to its maximum take-off mass . The fuel load of long-range aircraft like the <URL> can be more than 40 % of the take-off mass , so <URL> can make a lot of difference in the maximum possible flight altitude .
Yes , cargo and passenger aircraft of the same basic model are sometimes flown differently when there is no live cargo . A friend of mine who flies cargo put it almost exactly as you did in your question when you say boxes can not complain , so he sometimes hand flies the aircraft when passenger pilots would be required to use autopilot . Cargo pilots do n't have to worry about tender stomachs in the back , so steeper climbs and descents and tighter turns are acceptable as long as the aircraft remains well within the flight envelope .
All studies which so far showed an advantage for blended-wing bodies ( BWB ) were flawed . The trick mostly used is to compare an existing airliner with a hypothetical BWB which uses equally hypothetical engines of improved efficiency , like what could be expected 20 years into the future . This masks the inefficiency of the BWB concept and makes the combination come out ahead . The BWB will always have more surface area than a comparable conventional design . This translates into more friction drag and more skin mass , which more than offsets any advantage given by the bigger wing root ( which helps to reduce wing spar mass ) . If you like real data , use the <URL> as an early BWB and compare it to its contemporaries . Note that design attempts for an airliner based on the Vulcan ( <URL> ) went nowhere . Why are these BWB studies published ? The author gets more attention when he/she claims a " revolutionary breakthrough " than when he/she is more honest and admits that the concept is a dud . Even Boeing or Airbus like to publish BWB studies , so the public gets the impression they are ahead of the competition . It is sickening to read such academically dishonest studies - you need to spend time to dig to the bottom of the thing and to unravel the plot ; however , once you have done this a few times , they all become alike . But compared to studies made 60 or 80 years ago , where the author factually lists what he did and why it did n't work out ( which is the only way you can learn something ) , those modern studies are a waste of time .
You pose several scenarios . Is more cargo added if people do not show up ? No . By the time a person does not show up , the cargo is usually already delivered and loaded on the aircraft . If the plane is over the estimated weight - does cargo get removed ? Passenger bags removed ? Passengers removed ? Yes , although passengers almost always have priority . On heavy cargo flights , the cargo department will send a priority list if the load planners need to bump cargo . Is it within the airline 's strategy to achieve 100 % seat capacity utilisation ? Absolutely , although on payload restricted flights , non-revenue passengers may not always priority over cargo . This depends on the route . Many long-haul flights , if payload restricted , a scenario could happen where a staff member traveling as a non-revenue passenger will not be accepted because accepting them would exceed the max payload for the flight .
I ca n't say for sure , but I would assume that the pattern-based drills were removed because of the new emphasis on scenario-based ( " real world " ) training the FAA has been moving toward : While Pattern A and Pattern B are useful for honing your skills ( and I 'll even admit they 're kind of fun to fly ) they 're not something you 'll fly in the " real world " - you are unlikely to string together that particular set of elements in that particular order on any kind of regular basis . That does n't mean the Pattern A / Pattern B maneuvers are not useful tools or that the FAA " frowns on " them - they really do n't care how you acquire the skills necessary to pass your checkride and if flying Pattern A / Pattern B helps then by all means fly your heart out ! Just know that when you take your checkride you will not be asked to " Fly Pattern B " - it 's not an element of the practical test . A copy of the maneuver diagrams for Pattern A and Pattern B can be found in Gleim 's <URL> handout , which also has some valuable notes on how the maneuvers should be performed . Personally I prefer the diagrams from <URL> because I find them a little easier to read ( Patterns A &amp; B are listed as Patterns D &amp; E respectively , except the Gleim version of Pattern B includes a descent &amp; go-around at the end of the hold ) . I 've reproduced the Pattern E diagram below in case any of the links above break . <URL>
Boarding takes a long time , true . There are <URL> which <URL> to speed up boarding by between 20 % and 50 % , still they are not adopted . Why ? You need to load the baggage , too . Also the catering . And fuel . You need to inspect the aircraft , run through checklists and brief the new crew . This all takes up time , too . Airlines do not see a big saving by loading passengers faster , and then waiting for all other jobs to be completed . Your radical idea of containerizing passenger transport would certainly speed up things , but it would cost a lot of payload . The most efficient pressure vessel is a sphere , and the next efficient is a cylinder with spherical ends . Pressurizing a boxy container is structurally very inefficient . Loading passengers on palettes first and sliding those palettes through a narrow opening takes time in itself . And the palettes have their own weight , their own floor , their own support structure for the baggage racks , their own cabeling for the entertainment system . They would , however , not need their independent pressurization , so their weight impact would be moderate . A possible " flatbed " airliner which could attain the shortest boarding times has only half as much fuselage height ( or less ) to transmit bending loads along its length . <URL> for an example of buckling in a fuselage skin due to bending loads . Now consider that reducing height by 50 % will need four times more cross section in the longerons to keep stiffness constant . That will make the fuselage much heavier . In the end , airlines go with the solution which maximizes their profits . By using a hollow cylinder and let their " cargo " self-load , they can maximize their payload and get tolerable boarding times . Tolerable for them , that is . That better loading procedures could allow you to come to the airport later is of no interest to them . If they would see an advantage in shorter boarding times , there would be ample of opportunity by improving strategies , even with existing airplane designs .

Why did the Beechcraft Starship use a delta wing ?
Because it was something of a <URL> trademark since his early days . His first designs , the VariViggen and VariEze , had such a wing already , and apparently he saw no reason to optimize the wing of the Starship . <URL> Rutan VariEze in flight ( picture <URL> ) The only true innovation was a variable geometry canard , which he even <URL> . Being only 85 % scale , the performance of the Starship prototype was formidable , but once the real production aircraft had been designed with full compliance to airworthiness regulations , the Beech Starship turned out to be less impressive . The additional wetted surface produced more friction drag . Piaggio 's design is clearly superior . By the way , the idea behind the variable geometry canard was sound : In the landing configuration it would balance the additional lift from the fowler flaps on the wing . But the whole mechanism cost more in weight than the reduction in drag during cruise could save . <URL> Drawing from US Patent 4641800 .
An assumed temperature takeoff ( also known as " flex " on Airbus/Fokker aircraft ) is where the engine thrust is reduced to match the performance on a higher-temperature day , up to either the maximum thrust reduction allowed or the maximum assumed temperature that meets takeoff distance requirements . Unlike a derate , assumed temperature takeoffs do not reduce the minimum control speed used for calculating takeoff speeds ( $ V _ { MCG } $ for $ V_1 $ , $ V _ { MCA } $ for $ V_2 $ ) . The minimum selectable temperature is the lowest temperature beyond the flat rating temperature range ( the range of temperatures where maximum thrust is achievable , limited by an engine control unit ) , and the highest temperature is the temperature at which the maximum thrust reduction allowed will be met . Except with specific certification and approval ( such as 40 % flex on the A340 ) , such a procedure must not reduce the thrust beyond 25 % of the nominal takeoff thrust ( either full rate or a takeoff derate ) . For example , the range of assumed temperatures permitted is 30-75 ° C ( flat rated to $ ISA +15 $ , thrust at 75 ° C is 75 % of normal rating ) . The main reason for performing an assumed temperature takeoff is to conserve engine life , therefore reducing maintenance costs . According to Boeing , engine wear exponentially increases with the takeoff thrust used -- with engines costing about 10 million USD each , this has the potential to save a lot of money for airlines . If you are taking off using assumed temperature , you may ( but are not required to ) add thrust to TOGA in the case of an emergency , however if you are using a takeoff derate , you must not increase the thrust beyond the derated N1 , as this could cause a loss of control ( higher thrust = higher actual $ V _ { MCG } $ ) . Not all aircraft allow assumed temperature in conjunction with derates . For example , you can only select a derate or a flex temperature on all Airbus aircraft ( if a derate option is offered ) . NOTE : do not attempt to " copy the jet jocks " in a piston aircraft and attempt a reduced throttle takeoff : only at takeoff throttle levels is extra fuel injected for cooling and reduction beyond this point could result in CHT levels rising to unacceptable levels , increasing the risk of engine damage .
Bird strike happens all the time - almost on a daily basis . See <URL> : there are 9 instances of bird strike on the past 7 days at the time this answer is written . Usually it is ingested into the engine ( which usually <URL> ) , other times it impacts the cone or leading edge of the wings or knocks off a pitot tube . While a few incident make it to mainstream news from time to time , bird strike is a common occurrence in the aviation industry . It is an unusual situation , but not a dangerous situation if the pilots handle it properly . How severe if it collided with the windshield ? The windshield is <URL> during certification . At worst the outer layers will crack , and the pilot will execute the landing using the " cracked windshield " procedure ( Yes there is a procedure written for this scenario ) . A note about the UFO : technically it is an UFO , an Unidentified Flying Object . It could be a bird , a drone , weather balloon etc. . Examination of the impact area might reveal what the object was .
There is actually quite a lot of difference between ARINC-429 and MIL-STD-1553 . They are different because they were developed by two different groups with different needs . Both started in the 1970 's . Before then there was almost no digital data of any kind on a an aircraft . It was almost all analog or discrete . The biggest issue was noise and interference of the signals . The introduction of microprocessors in the early 70 's opened up the option for reasonably priced digital bus technology . The MIL-STD-1553 bus was a major component of the F-16 . Like most military programs , this was a push for maximum performance . ARINC-429 came out of the Boeing 757/767 development effort . Civilian aircraft certification does n't like a lot of risk and the simpler bus architecture made it easier to design , analyze , and certify . Since then there have been a number of new buses introduced into aviation . Some have lasted longer than others . B777 introduced ARINC-629 and Fibrechannel . B787 uses ARINC 664 for the main buses with a large mix of ARINC-429 and ARINC-825 ( CAN bus ) as well . There are a number of data concentrators/converters on the aircraft to get data where it needs to go . The primary reason for moving away from ARINC-429 is that it is a single transmitter/multiple receiver architecture . This results in a large amount of physical wire . That adds weight and requires maintenance . A bus such as ARINC-664 , which is based on Ethernet , can significantly reduce wire . The down side is that it costs a lot more and is n't very efficient when all you need is a small , low rate connection to an odd corner of the aircraft . So you end up with a mix of buses . And B787 opted for fiber optic cable for the ARINC-664 network to reduce interference from high-intensity radio frequency ( HIRF ) and lightning . MIL-STD-1553 is a powerful bus , but it 's not as good a fit as many of the newer buses available in the commercial market . The military keeps using it because they have a huge installed base of equipment , it 's flexible enough to support their newer functional needs , and commonality reduces their logistics costs . ARINC-429 sticks around because it 's cheap and it has its own large installed base as well .
<URL> : The B-1 [ variant ] was also fitted with " Jericho trumpets " , essentially propeller-driven sirens with a diameter of 0.7 m ( 2.3 ft ) mounted on the wing 's leading edge directly forward of the landing gear , or on the front edge of the fixed main gear fairing . This was used to weaken enemy morale and enhance the intimidation of dive-bombing . After the enemy became used to it , however , they were withdrawn . The devices caused a loss of some 20 -- 25 km/h ( 10-20 mph ) through drag . Instead , some bombs were fitted with whistles on the fin to produce the noise after release . So , yes , it was purely psychological and actually hindered the pilot by reducing air speed in ordinary flight and they were removed when they stopped having the psychological effect .
Are they really ? In a high wing aircraft the center of lift is above the center of gravity . This will not increase stability when the aircraft banks , however , as you rightly say , will help once the aircraft is in a sideslip . In order to keep the fuselage at an angle to the airflow , the wing has now to create a sideways lift component , which it does by flying at an angle to the horizontal . This roll angle of the aircraft will shift the center of gravity sideways , so it is not exactly below the center of lift , but offset laterally . This lateral offset seems to produce a rolling moment which works against the roll angle . Below I sketched the major forces in a sideslip . Note that the aircraft has a sideways speed component which creates a side force on fuselage and tail ( green ) which needs to be counteracted by the sideways component of lift ( blue ) . <URL> Short Sandringham in sideslip ( based on <URL> ) But still the weight ( black ) is attacking at the center of gravity , so it will not roll the aircraft , and the lift is in the vertical plane of symmetry , so it , too , will not create a rolling moment . Ergo , we have no stabilizing effect due to the high wing location ! In a sideslip of a high-wing aircraft the <URL> . This would indeed create a rolling moment because it will shift the center of lift sideways , out of the plane of symmetry . In a static sideslip the pilot will deflect the ailerons to maintain the roll angle as well as the rudder to maintain the sideslip , shifting the lift vector back into the vertical plane of symmetry . Now any stabilizing effect of the lift asymmetry is on purpose cancelled by the pilot ! However , this is achieved in a low wing airplane by adding dihedral . Therefore , a low wing aircraft can easily be made as stable as a high wing aircraft in a sideslip . You will notice that the lateral aerodynamic force ( green ) acts above the center of gravity and <URL> . This is dictated by the location of the vertical tail , which contributes little to the location of the center of gravity , but produces a considerable share of the lateral force ( reduced in the sideslip case by rudder deflection , however ) . This rolling moment , though , is almost independent of wing location . In a low wing , the center of gravity will be lower in total , especially when the engines are mounted on the wing , so the rolling moment contribution of the vertical tail is somewhat higher . The effect is small in a sideslip since the rudder deflection means that the fuselage contributes the majority of the side force . And this is not the pendulum effect which you asked about and which does not exist . In airships , <URL> , however : Since buoyancy always acts against gravity , a lateral offset of the heavy gondola will create an uprighting moment , just as it does in a pendulum . When turning , the heavy gondola will be pulled sideways by centrifugal forces , and the airship will roll . Since the turn is commanded with rudder , the rotation will give the rudder a small nose-down moment , which must be compensated by a nose-up elevator command . The pendulum effect will ensure that the gondola is at the lowest point in straight flight . P.S. : Thanks to the hint of @kepler22b I have now discovered the <URL> on Wikipedia . It also mentions the pendulum effect and calls both the fuselage contribution to the dihedral effect . Man , if there is ever a competition for the most misleading name of an effect , this would be the winning entry . A pendulum is a mass mounted below the hinge point , so it will stabilize in the down position . A flying aircraft is not hinged , so all motion is around the center of gravity . There simply is no pendulum effect in aircraft .

@acpilot is right - the Jaguar version of Beechcraft Bonanza differs only in the paint job and interiors . <URL> : Like the Jaguar edition of the Beech King Air C90B offered last year , the Bonanza and Baron will have specially outfitted interiors and unique paint schemes . ... Seats in the Jaguar airplane will use the same frames but have new cushions tailored to look like those found in the Jaguar Vanden Plas luxury car . ... tastefully wrapped the yokes in leather . On the outside , a special paint scheme has been designed to set the Jaguar airplanes apart from standard Bonanzas and Barons . and also , The new soundproofing Beech plans for the Jaguar airplanes appears to work well in the rear of the airplane . Looks like the only differences were the <URL> : Jaguar Cars ' automotive stylists designed the paint and interior for these packages . Inside , they applied more and finer hardwoods -- including a polished Jag-logo inlay on the right yoke -- better carpeting , and the finest leathers from Jaguar 's own vendors . Outside , the Jag-edition Bonanzas ... get a distinctive four-color metal-flake paint scheme finished off with Jaguar Cars ' stylized leaping-cat insignia leaping from the vertical stab and rudder . These are the only differences and everything else is the same . The performance changes if any would come from these - which I doubt . Around the same time , the Continental engines were refined ( they were the same 300 hp though ) , which might have made the aircraft appear different , though there are none .
The main reason for having variable incidence wing in the F-8 was that it allowed the production of increased lift due to a greater angle of attack without reducing pilot visibility as the fuselage stayed level . For aircraft with high angle of attack TO/landings ( like delta winged aircraft ) , pilot visibility is a problem in low speed landings , as the nose will obstruct the runway ( or carrier , for that matter ) in extreme cases . There are two ways to solve this problem : Droop the nose , like the Concorde or Make the wings variable incidence , like the F-8 . The first option is usually preferred ( same thing was done in Tu-144 ) as the weight penalty is ( significantly ) less . However , this was n't possible in the F-8 as the engine air intake was in the nose ; so the incidence of wings was changed . The variable incidence wing had the added advantage of reducing the length of landing gear required and improved the low speed characteristics . In case of Martin XB-51 , the variable incidence wings were used to reduce take off distance as it was expected to be operated from forward airfields .
This situation is due to usually 2 + sectors being worked . Each sector will use its own frequency when split . When these sectors get combined , one of 2 things will happen . 1 ) The controller will just work with both sectors frequencies keyed up and be listening on both and transmitting on both and have everyone go to the approrpriate frequency for the sector they 're in or near . 2 ) The controller wants everyone on one frequency and has everyone going into those sector 's that they are working to be on just one frequency . Frequency congestion and capability ( if the transmitters/receivers are different locations for the different frequencies ) are also factors .
Generally speaking , airliners do not have microwave ovens for safety reasons . I could not find any reference where commercial airplanes used to have microwaves . Probably some smaller business jets have them . Some flight attendants <URL> that they can warm your food , but some <URL> that they will not for legal and health reason . As also <URL> in comments to the question , meals are not heated at the airport . Airline catering companies like <URL> prepare the meal near the airport and deliver it to the airplane . Inside the airplane , they use <URL> to heat it .
It is called " standard pressure " because 29.92 In-Hg ( or 1013.25 hPa ) is the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level according to both the <URL> ( International Standard Atmosphere ) and the <URL> . Below 18,000 ft , local altimeter settings are used because you need to know how high you are above terrain , or whether or not you 're at the proper altitude for an instrument approach , or at pattern altitude , etc. . In cruising flight above 18,000 ft , except for a few places in the world , you are well above any terrain , so errors in actual altitude of even a couple thousand feet is unlikely to cause a problem . In this case , having all airplanes use a common altimeter setting is useful because it 1 . does n't require you to change it frequently as you pass through changes in pressure , and 2 . it helps ATC ensure separation without having to inform flights every 10 minutes of a new setting . It makes sense to use standard pressure in this case because it represents a good baseline average , and you may have noticed that reported altimeter settings tend to average around 29.92 anyway . That being said , there are instances where you may still need to know the en-route altimeter settings for flight planning purposes . Suppose the minimum safe altitude along your route is 19,000 ft MSL and current pressure is 29.42 . If you decided to cruise at FL190 , you would actually be flying at about 18,500 ft MSL , and would be below your minimum safe altitude . Colder than standard temperature can have similar effect as low pressure , and will result in the airplane being lower than the indicated altitude .
The flying boom method uses a rigid boom which is " flown " by an operator in coordination with the pilot in order to make a connection with a receptacle on the second aircraft . The boom is retracted when not in use . Though <URL> if it comes in contact with an aircraft , <URL> . The probe and drogue method uses a trailing hose with a basket on the end . Pilots will guide a probe on their aircraft into the basket to connect with the hose . The hoses are retracted when not in use . Though the crew has less control of the drogue , which <URL> , there is less danger to the aircraft than from a boom , and it could allow the aircraft to stay further away from the tanker . The boom method was developed early on in the Cold War , when <URL> . They needed a method that would transfer fuel as fast as possible in order to reduce the time it took to transfer the large amounts of fuel needed . Because the boom is rigid , it is capable of a higher transfer rate . The importance of bombers meant that SAC got their way , and the KC-135 fleet was equipped with booms . Today , almost all US Air Force planes capable of aerial refueling use the boom system . The US Navy on the other hand , along with most aircraft in other countries , uses the drogue system . Though this method is not capable of the high transfer rates of a boom , it is much more flexible . A refueling aircraft may only be fitted with one boom , and this requires extra design work and integration with the fuselage . The drogue system , on the other hand , is more simple , and does not need a dedicated operator . This means that it can be more easily fitted to the refueling aircraft , even <URL> , and larger aircraft can have multiple drogues . Another point is that smaller aircraft such as fighters are not capable of receiving fuel at the full rate the boom provides , so they have less benefit from the system . Although a boom can have a <URL> , this still commits the tanker to one aircraft at a time and one type of system per flight . Also , aircraft such as helicopters <URL> . When the Air Force was looking at a replacement for its tanker fleet in the early 2000s , a <URL> to determine what standard the new tanker should support . The report suggests some options for the best combination of methods . In the end , the Air Force selected the <URL> for the contract , which will include both the boom and the drogue options for refueling . This will provide better support to aircraft from other branches or countries , while maintaining support of the existing aircraft that use a boom .
There are several sources for a sideslip-induced rolling moment : The dihedral angle $ \ nu $ of the wing , which will increase the local angle of attack $ \ alpha $ on the windward wing according to $ \ Delta \ alpha = \ beta \ cdot sin \ nu $ ; $ \ beta $ being the angle of sideslip , The <URL> , which in a sideslip causes a de-sweeping of the airflow over the windward wing ( and an increased sweep effect on the leeward wing ) . The local change in angle of attack is $ \ Delta \ alpha = ( cos ( \ varphi ± \ beta ) - cos \ varphi ) \ cdot ( \ alpha - \ alpha_0 ) $ and is proportional to the angle of attack , The crossflow around the fuselage ( see sketch below for illustration , sorry , no simple formula here ) , and The location of the vertical tail , or more precisely , the side force created on it by a sideslip angle in relation to the location of the center of gravity . This effect dictated the anhedral of aircraft like the <URL> . Please see <URL> for a more complete explanation of effect 3 . The sketch below is taken from the linked answer and shows a high and a low wing configuration in sideslip . The thin blue arrows indicate the sideways component of airflow $ v _ { \ infty } \ cdot sin \ beta $ . In the end , some rolling due to sideslip is good , but too much must be avoided , and dihedral is used to complement the other effects such that the total is just right . A high wing already provides some positive rolling moment due to sideslip ( negative $ c _ { l _ { \ beta } } $ : When you deflect rudder to the left , the resulting sideslip should roll the aircraft to the left , too ) , so the wing does n't need to contribute as much ( by means of dihedral ) as in low wing aircraft . Dihedral ( or for that matter , even a low center of gravity ) will not roll the aircraft level : There is no aerodynamic way to achieve that ! Dihedral will only give you a rolling moment when the aircraft sideslips .
Flow separation happens when the pressure gradient of the airflow along the flow path becomes too steep . In subsonic flow , the oncoming air is first decelerated ahead of the wing , then swiftly accelerated when it flows around the strongly curved nose section of a wing . This acceleration is the consequence of the wing 's curvature . See it this way : If the airflow would be along a straight line , it would move away from the surface , creating a local vacuum . In reality , the air settles at a compromise between the straight path and following the contour , creating decreasing pressure along a surface with increasing curvature and increasing pressure along surfaces with decreasing curvature . More precisely , it is always in an equilibrium between inertial , viscous and pressure forces.This suction not only bends the airflow into following the wing 's contour , but also accelerates the air ahead of it . The lower the pressure , the more the air speeds up , such that the total energy of air ( the sum of pressure and kinetic energy ) stays constant . Therefore , pressure and local speed change in sync.When the curvature decreases further downstream , the flow path becomes straighter and pressure rises again . However , the air particles close to the wing slow down because of friction . The layer of air where this slowing is noticeable is called boundary layer . In it , the deceleration effects due to pressure rise and due to friction add up , and at some point the air comes to a standstill relative to the wing . Where this happens , static air will collect and build up , causing flow separation . Thankfully , the exchange of air across a turbulent boundary layer kicks the slowest air particles downstream , so at moderate angles of attack the air still moves along until it reaches the trailing edge . Only when the suction peak around the nose becomes very high at high angle of attack , the consequent steep pressure rise along the remaining flow path overpowers the possibilities of the turbulent boundary layer , the air decelerates completely and the flow separates . This is a wholly subsonic affair . If the wing moves at high subsonic speed , the curvature-created suction accelerates the flow such that it reaches supersonic speed . Now something odd happens : Supersonic flow accelerates further when subsonic flow would decelerate . This is caused by the change in density which is dominant at supersonic speed . Incompressible ( = very slow ) flow has constant density , and all speed changes affect pressure . At Mach 1 , the pressure and density changes are of equal magnitude , and in supersonic flow the density changes dominate . Now we have a supersonic pocket of air on the upper surface of the wing where speed increases and density decreases downstream , and the surrounding subsonic air sees little change in density . This picture should give you some idea how it looks : The whole wing moves at Mach 0.68 . Compare the green color at some distance from the wing with the scale on the left side , which gives the Mach number for each color shade . At the airfoil nose , you see a blue area . This is where the air decelerates - it gets pushed together by the approaching wing . Now follow the colors along the upper side - they quickly turn green , yellow and red as the air is accelerated into the low pressure area ( remember , low pressure equals high speed , so the reddest area has the highest local flow speed and the lowest pressure ) . In subsonic flow , the suction peak would be somewhere between 20 % and 30 % of chord , and the colors would slowly change back to yellow and green if you move further downstream . Now we have local supersonic flow ( everything redder than light orange is supersonic here ) , and instead of slowly decelerating , the air is speeding up to a maximum Mach number of 1.23 at almost 60 % of chord length.This can not last , and at some point this supersonic pocket collapses . This happens instantly in a shock , and as you know , in a straight shock density increases suddenly and speed decreases such that the <URL> . In the picture above , boundary layer effects create a lambda shock , which has its name from the Greek letter which looks like the shock pattern here . Aft of the shock , you have subsonic flow again , and a much thicker boundary layer which moves very slowly ( blue shade ) . This is due to the energy conversion through the shock , which converts kinetic energy into heat . But the flow is still attached - even this shock did not cause separation . If this pressure rise is big enough , the boundary layer will come to an instantaneous standstill , and then the flow separates . This is the shock induced separation you asked about . Unfortunately , the picture above is the best I could find , and I have none with separated flow aft of the shock . But it helps to show that the center of pressure moves aft . This causes a strong nose-down moment . Also , with higher subsonic Mach numbers directional stability decreases . Now even more nasty things can happen : The location of the sho
The chines help when the nacelle is very close to the wing . When the engine of Boeing 's 737 was changed from the slim JT-8D to the higher bypass ratio CFM-56 on the 737-300 and later , the chines were essential to avoid large flow separation . Generally , aircraft with higher landing gear can afford to have more space between nacelle and wing and do not need fixes like chines . But when a new engine has been fitted to an existing design , chances are that some vortex generators are needed to fix the new flow conditions . For the nitpickers : The 737-100 and 200 had underslung nacelles which left no space between wing and nacelle , but that is aerodynamically similar to a nacelle at a larger distance , because no narrow flow paths are created which produce steep pressure gradients . Only a closely mounted , but still separate nacelle will have these flow conditions which need to be remedied by energizing the boundary layer .
the <URL> is the line stretching from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge parallel to the centerline . <URL> There are different variations to describe the chord of the whole wing . The Standard Mean Chord Defined as $ \ frac S b $ with $ S$ the surface area and $ b $ the span of the wing . This is not used in aerodynamics . The Mean Aerodynamic Chord Defined as $ \ frac2 S \ int_0 ^ { \ frac b 2 } c ( y ) ^ 2 dy $ with $ y $ the coordinate along the wing and $ c ( y ) $ the chord at $ y $ . For swept or delta wings this gives the equivalent chord for a rectangular wing , and is important for placing the Center of Gravity for stability .
Most important factor affecting drag is frontal area . Almost all frontal area of the engine pod is the intake and it has to have the size it does to collect the air the engine needs . So there is not so much drag to be saved . Beside that , embedding the engine in wing roots like <URL> did has many disadvantages , most of which also apply to the central engine of three-engined jets ( B727 , DC-10 ) : The wing root carries the weight of the aircraft , so weakening it by embedding the engine is design and construction complication . Access for maintenance is difficult . Engines need a lot of maintenance and sometimes need to be replaced . Uncontained failure is more dangerous ( see <URL> ) . There is not much structure to damp vibration , so it is awfully noisy . And last but not least , modern high-bypass turbofans are huge . They would not fit in the wing anyway . And reasons for not attaching the engines directly to the fuselage or wing are already mentined in <URL> . Mainly , the inlet needs : Free space around it from which it can draw air at slow speed . Free space around it to which it can spill the excess air at high speed . And the engines mounted forward of wing actually improve the distribution of cross-sectional area according to the <URL> .
That 's a good question , and brings up a joke that many pilots know well : " What 's going to be in the cockpit of the future ? " " A dog and a pilot . " " A dog ? Why a dog ? " " Well , the dog is there to keep the pilot from touching anything . " " Ummm , why have the pilot then ? " " Well , someone has to feed the dog ! " Technology has improved to the point where airplanes can pretty much fly and even land themselves . They are even getting pretty good at handling " normal " emergencies like engine failures and depressurizations . Where pilots really shine though are the type of abnormal and emergency situations that are n't " in the book " . <URL> , a computer will be out of options because it was never programmed to handle that ( because it was considered " virtually impossible " when it was designed ) . A pilot on the other hand can analyze and experiment until he finds enough of a solution to keep the airplane in the air as he works through other issues . During a total electrical failure , the computers wo n't be much good . Sure , you can design redundant systems and make it so that it " can never happen " , but what about when it does ? There are also all of the little things that a pilot is constantly making decisions on how to handle . Some examples could include : Can the airplane fly with a particular feature inoperative ? What about multiple features inoperative ? How do they interact with each other ? What do you do when the passengers take too long to board and you are going to miss your departure slot ? What do you do when the ground crew forgets to close a door ? What about when the tug driver does n't push you back quite far enough ? Or ATC wants to change you to a different runway ? Or you ask ATC to change you to a different runway because it might save a few minutes and that will keep you from having to deice again ? Or another airplane unexpectedly pulls out in front of you while taxiing ? A pilot can see " ugly " clouds off the end of the runway and decide that it would be better to wait a bit before taking off . What happens when a flock of birds suddenly appears during the takeoff roll ? What happens when a passenger gets sick or unruly ? When do you need to divert and when can you continue ? On a typical flight , a pilot will make hundreds of small decisions that can make a big difference in the flight . Any one of these ( or one of the tens or hundreds of thousands of other things that could happen ) could trip up a computer . The pilot is also there as the " final authority " . If a hacker were to somehow hack into the automated systems , a pilot can always disconnect them and fly the airplane manually . He can turn off systems , he can be ... Well , the pilot can be creative and a computer can only do what it was programmed to do . Right now when a drone crashes it is n't such a big deal because nobody was on board . If an airliner with a load full of paying passengers crashes it is a big deal . Even just one . Many of these problems can be overcome . Some of them already have been . Some of them may never be fully handled in an automatic way but maybe we could still do automated flights with an acceptable level of safety . Some automation is actually better than some pilots in certain areas . However , the biggest reason that we do n't have fully automated passenger airplanes is because the general public feels comforted by a person being up front who can take over and carry them to safety if needed . Even if the technology were 100 % ready for automated passenger flights , I think that the number of people willing to purchase a ticket would be so low that it would be financially unfeasible for an airline to deploy it .
It 's actually " ded " reckoning ( short for deduced ) , and it does n't involve landmarks , it is simply flying a heading for a certain amount of time , that 's it . When you start adding in landmarks and things , that is called " pilotage . " Typically , visual navigation over land is mostly pilotage , with a bit of ded reckoning occasionally . When you get over the water , like Charles Lindbergh , you do mostly ded reckoning . When you do have a chance to use a landmark , you can update your location and basically restart your ded reckoning from a known point . Lindbergh also used the stars to update his position and based new ded reckoning tracks on those positions .

start question
Why do we call moving an aircraft on the ground " taxi " ?
The verb , " to taxi , " as it relates to a moving airplane on the ground , dates to about 1911 . The verb appears to be derived from the noun , " taxi , " referring to a nearly flightless training aircraft that dates to about 1909 . The word may allude to driving around like a taxicab , as others surmise , or it may relate to the fact that flight instructors gave rides to new students in the " taxi " airplane . Eventually , they started calling getting around on the ground ( or water ) " taxiing . " The expression started at Henri Farman 's flight school outside Paris , and was later picked up by pilots at flight schools in England . A " taxi " had shorter wings and a heavier body , so that it could not really take off and fly away at the hands of a new pilot , but a new pilot could get the feel of handling the aircraft and learn to take off and fly short distances , especially downhill along a slope . See : <URL>
In addition to the systems listed by RedGrittyBrick , it is also possible to let the aircraft detect itself , from its sensors , potential crashes . This problem has been studied , and is pretty well documented in a report made by the BEA ( the French equivalent of the NTSB ) after the crash of the flight AF447 . The full report is available in <URL> and in <URL> . I made a summary of their work in this answer . The solution proposed in this report is a triggered transmission of flight data . The aircraft transmits them only if it detects a potentially dangerous situation from its sensors ( this reduces the load on communication systems ) . Two types of triggering criterion are proposed : One base on binary logic One based on Fuzzy logic They both take into account several parameters ( speed , pitch angle , pilot 's inputs ... ) and verify some relations about them . For example , if , something is probably wrong . The criterion have been check against a database of real flight data recovered from crashed aircrafts , in order to assess their performances : The robustness of the triggering criteria was evaluated using the following metrics : False detection rate ( or nuisance trigger rate ) : out of all the normal flights , how many are considered as containing an emergency situation Nuisance transmission time that the nuisance triggers generate Emergency situation detection rate : out of all the accident/incident flights , how many are considered as containing an emergency situation For flights with a correctly detected emergency situation , what is the warning time between the time of detection and the time of impact with the surface The conclusion of these tests is that accidents were almost always predicted ( binary logic failed in only one case out of 44 , fuzzy logic detected every case ) . On average , the problem was raised about 350s before the actual crash ( the median is around 33s , minimum at 3s and maximum at 10,019 s ) . The second half of the report discusses different system to transmit these triggered alarms to infrastructures on the ground . It is also interesting and well written , but outside the scope of this question .
They do in fact exist , though they often use smaller helicopters . A Google search on the term " heli taxi " yields thousands of results , and while a lot are probably irrelevant , the first few pages give hundreds of operators around the world , ranging from companies ferrying passengers between airports and major cities to companies servicing oil platforms at sea , islands too small to have airfields , etc. .
Why do passenger embark on the left side of an aircraft ? Because the cavewoman who invented the log-canoe was right-handed ? Note : I arrived at this answer by looking at a kind of etymology of the terms starboard &amp; port but that 's incidental . The answer to this question happened to be contained in an answer to a rather different question . Some groups of aviators may have dropped the archaic terms while still being subject to a continuation of an archaic habit/convention . People get on the left side of a jet airplane because Vikings ( etc ) steered their wooden boats with a steering board ( hence starboard ? ) held in their dominant right-hand . Since it was inconvenient to have your steering apparatus wedged against a quayside ( or earthen bank ) they docked at the port along their left side and therefore loaded and unloaded on the left . <URL> leads you to <URL> in English.se which I reproduce here for convenience Excerpt from <URL> : Port and starboard Port and starboard are shipboard terms for left and right , respectively . Confusing those two could cause a ship wreck . In Old England , the starboard was the steering paddle or rudder , and ships were always steered from the right side on the back of the vessel . Larboard referred to the left side , the side on which the ship was loaded . So how did larboard become port ? Shouted over the noise of the wind and the waves , larboard and starboard sounded too much alike . The word port means the opening in the " left " side of the ship from which cargo was unloaded . Sailors eventually started using the term to refer to that side of the ship . Use of the term " port " was officially adopted by the U.S. Navy by General Order , 18 February 1846 . So it 's a historical convention , many arbitrary choices are of this sort . Pioneers of a new form of transport adopt the terms ( port , startboard ) and habits of more ancient forms of transport . Ironically , since aircraft became able to carry substantial non-human cargo , the cargo entry has moved to the other side to reduce the chances of crushing the human cargo with the non-human cargo . Presumably also because having lots of large holes all in one side may be structurally disadvantageous .
There is nothing " special " about an aircraft engine that requires lead in the fuel -- Engines do n't much care about the lead in tetraethyl lead , nor do they much care for it ( it gets everywhere , fouling sparkplugs and contaminating the oil ) . What they care about is the octane ( anti-knock ) rating of the fuel . Many " low performance " aircraft engines run just fine on unleaded fuels with a lower octane rating ( among them the Lycoming O-320 and O-360 family that power a good chunk of the GA fleet ) , but high-performance aircraft engines ( e.g. the IO-520 you 'll find in Beech Bonanzas ) require a 100 octane fuel . The approved specification for 100 octane aviation gasoline ( <URL> ) lists tetraethyl lead as the octane booster of choice . It 's also worth noting that some of the octane boosting techniques used in automotive gasoline are not acceptable for aircraft engines ( the most common in the US being the addition of ethanol , which has two undesirable effects : reducing the energy content of the fuel , and damaging aviation fuel system seals and other components ) . So why do we still make 100LL , and why do n't we offer the other unleaded options at every airport ? Aviation gasoline is a minuscule slice of the gasoline market , so it does n't make sense to have 5 tanks with 5 different grades of fuel at every airport : All aircraft engines will run on 100LL , so 100LL ( leaded ) aviation gasoline is still produced because it is a " single fuel " solution to piston aviation 's needs . If leaded avgas were to disappear tomorrow the engines that require it would be left without an approved fuel , which would result in those aircraft being grounded until such time as an alternative fuel could be developed or the engine manufacturers develop a procedure for derating the engines ( operating them at reduced power ) . For obvious reasons neither of these options is attractive , particularly to folks who own higher-power engines which were presumably purchased for the performance ... Changing the avgas specification is quite a bit of work - it requires ensuring that the new fuel is a " drop-in replacement " for 100LL -- one which can be mixed with 100LL in any proportion , and will work correctly in any engine designed for 100LL fuel . <URL> ( a Google search for also produces useful results ) , and hopefully a universal unleaded aviation fuel specification and one or more products will come out of those efforts .
Actually , for all but very long haul flights , airline aircraft only require two pilots , a Captain and a First Officer . For those long haul flights that exceed the duty time in a pilot seat , a relief pilot is also carried . Older aircraft often also had a flight engineer . Technically speaking the f.e. was n't usually required to be a pilot , but he was a very necessary crew member . You could say that airlines became more efficient crew-wise when they moved from 3-man cockpit crews to 2-man cockpit crews . For example , the 747-100/200 series uses 3-man crews , but the 747-400 uses 2-man crews . The change was made possible by using automation and instrumentation that was n't available when the first 747 models came out . Indirectly the increase in engine reliability also helped . If you lost an engine in an 3-man crew 747 , the typical manner of handling the loss was to have the first officer fly the airplane while the captain and the f.e. worked the problem . To illustrate the increase in automation , the 747-100/200 series had , typically , seven or nine fuel tanks , and there was a fuel burn schedule that had to be followed to keep the structural stresses and balances between different levels of the tanks within limits . The f.e. took care of that , doing it manually by throwing switches on his panel . The 747-400 and follow on models do that automatically by computer . Basically the number in the cockpit crew is determined by safety . There 's the basic consideration that if you had only one pilot , and that pilot died or otherwise was disabled , that might well be catastrophic . Beyond that , though , there 's the matter of what all has to be done and for how long . Pilots make mistakes , and the longer they 've on duty , the more mistakes they make . And if an emergency occurs , the work load can get very high . You ca n't reasonably compare an aircraft to a car for at least two reasons . First , a car is moving in only two dimensions , an aircraft in three . Second , a car can stop moving , an aircraft ca n't ; it has to keep moving . Let 's say your car loses power . Usually that wo n't result in anything more than inconvenience . If your aircraft loses power , you 've got a much more serious problem . Most airline aircraft have at least two engines . Losing one is n't going cause a crash in most two engine aircraft , losing all power will .
A great site to download airport diagrams and other charts is <URL> . As of April 2015 , however , the site seems gone . Airport diagrams show all the taxiways and ramps , which is what you are looking for . Keep in mind that this is an unofficial website . The charts should not be used for actual navigation .
The rule I was always taught is to cross any ' step ' - up or down - at an angle with the elevator full back : It minimizes the chance of a prop strike , which is much more expensive than a wingtip strike When going ' up ' , you avoid having both wheels up against the step at the same time , which usually means you need a burst of power to get over it , which could lead to sudden acceleration and sharp braking When going ' down ' you avoid the aircraft dropping down suddenly , with the same risks of strikes or an increase in speed Lifting the elevator reduces the chance of it striking There may be some differences for specific aircraft types , but I 've always followed that advice and never had a problem . I 've also never seen an aircraft get close to a wingtip strike doing this , but I suppose it could happen if the step is large enough . Although in that case you might want to just find another taxi route .
Navigation has gotten much simpler over the years . Initially , navigation would be done by a combination of dead reckoning , looking out the window for landmarks , and for night or long-distance flights , by celestial navigation ( many old airplanes have a window at the navigator 's station specifically to let the navigator see the stars ) . This took quite a bit of time and effort , so the pilot could n't do it and also fly the airplane . In the 1920s , radio navigation was added to the navigator 's toolkit , but finding bearings to beacons and calculating a location was still an entirely manual process . Additionally , radio beacons did n't cover the entire world , so older navigation techniques were still needed for most flights . In the 1950s , fully-automatic radio direction finding systems became common and navigation beacons were available across most of Europe and North America . At this point , the workload involved in navigation dropped to the point that the pilot could also navigate : plot out the sequence of NDBs to follow ahead of time , then tune the radio and follow the navigation display . Very recently , navigation has been integrated with the autopilot to the point that the pilot can punch in a sequence of waypoints and have the airplane fly the route entirely on its own . And yes , even today if the electronic navigation system fails , the fallback is map , compass , and slide rule .
The first and perhaps most important thing to do is NOT turn around . Generally speaking you wo n't have the airspeed/altitude to make a full 180 and return to the field . While it can be done , it 's advised to continue forward and put the plane down as you would in any emergency . Trim for best glide and pick a landing spot ( limited options in this case ) . In some cases with small plane/long runway situations you will be able to execute something like a short field landing with the remaining runway but that is very situationally dependent . When I flew out of KPNE in a Warrior 24 was 7000ft ; if you lost an engine at rotation you had plenty of runway . At DYL where I fly now that 's not really the case . Every airport is different but a good deal of the airports I have flown out of recently have had long fields at either end of the runway giving maybe an extra 1000 ft or so . Airports in populated areas may have roads you can touch down on . You should always consult the POH of the specific aircraft in this case for proper emergency procedures . Specifically to the 152 point , the take off distance is around 1400 ft. full loaded if memory serves . Unless you are training on 2000 ft strips you should have no problem getting the plane back down with remaining runway at all but the shortest of fields . If you are only 10ft up you should be able to put the plane down fast , albeit a bit hard , but fast none the less . For what it 's worth <URL> . Once you have touched down it would be advised to retract your flaps , this will increase the load on the gear ( by reducing your wings ' effectiveness ) and increase brake effectiveness . You should take care to not lock the brakes as well . Side Story : This happened to a buddy of mine in his Archer a bunch of years back ( I 'll try to find the incident report ) . The plane was fresh out of annual and something was not hooked up correctly and shook loose on take off causing the engine to cut out around 100ft or so . There was a corn field dead ahead and he was able to put the plane down smoothly . Thankfully no one was hurt and he simply owed the farmer for the corn he took out on landing & hellip ; .
The decrease in air means less oxygen . If the fuel is burnt at " rich " there would not be enough oxygen in the air to burn some of the fuel , thus reducing efficiency , increasing the risk of carbon monoxide , and adding grime to the exhaust system . That is why " lean " is used for high altitudes , to burn efficiently and safely .
The <URL> seems to be that no one knows for sure , but the most likely explanation is that before class A existed there was Positive Control Airspace ( PCA ) that started at FL240 , and DME was a requirement in PCA . The main reasons for requiring DME were : There 's a limited number of <URL> so it is n't easy to use cross-radials from other VORs for fixes or position reporting ; DME is a simple alternative If there 's no radar coverage then ATC can still manage lateral separation effectively using DME That all seems plausible enough , but some sources out there say that PCA started at FL180 , not FL240 , e.g. this <URL> : [ VFR on top ] was a principle [ sic ] factor in the <URL> and led to " Positive Control Airspace " ( PCA ) FL180 and above . Because of the speeds of the aircraft involved , non-radar procedures were unwieldy ( standards called for ten minutes between aircraft ; some 80 miles for a typical jet ) , even with the development of aircraft installed Distance Measuring Equipment ( DME ) and the reduced separation available between DME equipped aircraft ( 20 miles ) . FL240 is also where ATC starts using Mach numbers instead of knots ( ATC orders <URL> ) and the separation minima change ( section 8-4-4 ) . I do n't know if that 's for historical reasons or physical/operational reasons , but it looks to me like FL240 is considered the general starting point for high-altitude operations ( <URL> requires a high-altitude endorsement for aircraft that can operate above 25,000 ' MSL ) .
Usually , no . There are two main methods used to deice an airplane in the air . One is letting warm air that is bleed from the jet engine to heat the wing leading edge . The other is to have have rubber air bladders ( called deice boots ) on the leading edge of the wing and tail surfaces that are pumped up and the ice falls off . Both of those methods are only useful to deice the leading edge of the wing and tail surfaces which is pretty much the only dangerous place where an airplane can gather ice while it is flying . Airplanes on the ground are a different story . Ice can be built up pretty much anywhere as there is no airflow to prevent it . Excessive ice on control surfaces can make them behave " unevenly " or in extreme cases even unresponsive . Bigger chunks of ice breaking off the fuselage can get ingested by the engine and cause problems . It is therefore important that the airplane takes off ice-free . In fact , as little as frost on the surface of the wings can cause a significant loss of lift and can even cause a plane to crash .
I 'd expect <URL> : Executive One is the call sign designated for any United States civil aircraft when the President of the United States is on board .
The three main reasons are : Prevent theft of headphones due to incompatibility with home systems Redundancy , if one connector breaks , the other will still provide audio Before the 3.5 mm jack was used , a pneumatic system was in use , which required two connectors . This question has been asked on different websites already , but here is a detailed explanation that sums it up nicely : There are a couple main reasons : First , the airlines were trying to prevent theft of headphones . The two-pronged plugs have been around on airplanes since way before the airlines started charging for headsets . Back then , headphones were not usually easily carried around as the portable earbud style had not become popular yet . By using a two-pronged setup that is not used in most other audio systems , the motivation for passengers to steal the headsets went down immensely . The second reason is redundancy . When a standard stereo headphone jack with three internal connections ( right , left , and ground ) breaks , you will often lose audio in both the left and right channels . However , with the two-pronged design , if one of the jacks breaks then there will still be audio going through the other channel . While this is annoying for the user , it is an easy way for the airline to defer maintenance on that individual seat 's audio system until both the left and right channel are non-functional . The two-prong design is a relic of the past , before headphones were bundled with so many of the mobile devices we now buy . Planes with updated inflight entertainment ( IFE ) systems usually have the standard stereo jack as most passengers prefer using their own headsets now . Slowly these old connectors will be completely phased out . Another less obvious ( and probably less likely , but interesting nonetheless ) reason , though , is based on airline complacency . Airlines , especially US based airlines , are notoriously slow in changing their tactics . Back before the 3.5 mm jack became the standard for headphone audio connections for IFEs , airplanes used a pneumatic headphone design . These headphones were similar to stethoscopes where hollow tubes would be plugged into the armrest which had actual soundwaves coming out ( instead of analog electrical signals ) . These systems were much more reliable than the standard electrical system and the headsets themselves were very cheap to replace . Since the pneumatic system required two separate plugs for the left and right channel ( since you can not mix physical sound waves into a single hole ) , all armrests were designed with two holes for audio . Airlines were likely so used to having two jacks for audio that they continued with the same design when they switched to electrical audio signals . ( Source : <URL> - Author : Raj Misra )
They use the airport power . The airport and its important equipment have backup power and/or a dedicated power plant ( which itself will have backup plans ) . This is what the FAA says : The FAA recognizes the need to have a reliable power source to operate NAVAIDs , even during utility power outages . Order 6030.20 establishes Continuous Power Airports ( CPAs ) that provide continuous operations in the event of an area-wide utility failure . Backup power to designated runways at these airports must be able to supply power for at least 4 hours for runway lighting as well as navigation , landing and communication equipment . In addition , FAA policy also requires that power systems used for support of Category ( CAT ) II and CAT-III operations must be capable of transferring to an alternate source within one second . Source : <URL> Basically it 's to avoid having to <URL> . Select airports and runways have to be able to operate . ICAO recommends the same thing and lists the criteria airports need to meet in Annex 14 , section 8.1 Secondary power supply . For example : 8.1.5 Recommendation . -- Requirements for a secondary power supply should be met by either of the following : -- independent public power , which is a source of power supplying the aerodrome service from a substation other than the normal substation through a transmission line following a route different from the normal power supply route and such that the possibility of a simultaneous failure of the normal and independent public power supplies is extremely remote ; or -- standby power unit ( s ) , which are engine generators , batteries , etc. , from which electric power can be obtained . For navaids in general that are not within an airport , then ICAO Annex 10 , Volume I , Part I , Chapter 2 handles the recommendations .
It will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft , but I will try to give some general estimates . Time on the Ground Part of what you are referring to what is sometimes called <URL> . It 's not really directly related to my calculations for your overall question ( though it is certainly a factor for short-haul jets ) , but in <URL> , minimum turn times for the Boeing 757 was studied , and it was found that the estimated turn time for a 757-200 was 52.5 minutes , based on actual operations . The 757-300 , a stretched model with more seating , would take about 59 minutes . From <URL> , presented by United Airlines , they show a general guideline MSGT ( Minimum Scheduled Ground Time ) , that is a generalization depending on flight locations , field facilities , and airlines . Some times are : Boeing 747 : 80 minutes Boeing 777 : 70 minutes Boeing 767 : 60 minutes ( -300 model ) Boeing 737 : 35 minutes ( -300 model ) Airbus A320 : 40 minutes <URL> has a discussion of a number of airliner turn times , however none are from official sources . Most vary between 20-45 minutes , depending on if cleaning is required . So for a typical airliner we can say it takes about 45 minutes-1 hour for a typical servicing . Aircraft Lifetime Now as to how many times they fly , you can find their aircraft design cycle limit ( essentially , how many takeoffs and landings it can make in its lifetime ) in <URL> ( summarized <URL> ) . Some listed numbers : Boeing 747 : 20,000 cycles Boeing 777 : 40,000 cycles Boeing 767 : 50,000 cycles Airbus A320 : 48,000 cycles ( 60,000 hours ) Airbus A300 : 40,000 cycles So for a ' typical ' airliner we can say it can survive about 40,000 cycles in a lifetime You can find the average age of airliners in different places online . <URL> splits up by airline and aircraft , and most airliners have an average age of 12-15 years . But note that this is the active fleet . The average age at retirement for an airliner is now <URL> . You can find a related Aviation.SE question <URL> Aircraft Usage <URL> discusses the average cycles and flight hours per day . Long haul aircraft ( like the 747 , 777 , A380 ) tend to spend more hours in the air per flight , but also have less cycles per day . I ca n't find official sources , but the thread presents a couple example averages for peak usage rate : Delta Boeing 757 : 9.5 hours/4 .8 cycles United Boeing 747 : 13.2 hours/1 .6 cycles ( I find these probably accurate , as there have been some publicized accidents that have much higher usage , like <URL> , which flew 48,740 hours and 39,781 cycles in 15 years - about 7 flights/day ; short-haul jets like the one in the article end up with more cycles than long-haul , as I noted above ) . It is difficult to find hard numbers , but overall , the average flight length for a short-haul jet is about 2 hours , whereas a long-haul jetliner is around 6-7 hours . Again , there are a lot of variables in this question , but using the above data , we can estimate the answer to your question , using these estimated figures from above : 40,000 cycles ( ~ 20,000 flights ) 25 years 2 hours/flight This means approximately 40,000 flight hours for a typical short-haul jet ; over 25 years ( 219,000 hours ) , this works out to about 1 hour in flight for every 5 on the ground . Obviously this varies widely , but for a ballpark number , that 's the best I can do . The highest usage would be a heavily used long-haul jet used on the longest routes from a busy airline ( i.e. trans-Pacific ; Middle East to U.S. ) , whereas the lowest would be a moderate-length flight on a low-volume route . In general , you are probably looking at about 1:3 to 1:5 air : ground time .
Frost can be formed in two ways . On a colder object by water directly desublimating on its surface or on any object when air is saturated with water . Frost can form on a moving airplane , but only the second way . Why would they have anti-ice on pitot tubes , propeller and leading edges otherwise ? When the air is not saturated with water , ice will sublimate . If the air is moving it carries away the sublimated vapour and thus increases the sublimation rate . When flying in visual meteorological conditions , that 's generally the case , so frost wo n't form in VMC , thogh watch out when dew point is close to temperature ; in such case light haze may form that already causes some icing while visibility is still above the VMC limit . Ram and friction heating also help sublimating the ice a bit . However when you fly into a cloud in freezing temperature , the water droplets will freeze on the aircraft when they hit it . They will hit it on forward-facing surfaces : wing and stabilizer leading edges , propellers , engine inlets , pitot tubes and nose and windscreen . That 's why these components have anti-ice , either using heating or deicing boots . VMC-only aircraft will often only have pitot tube heating and carburettor heating , because those can sometimes gather frost in sufficiently moist air that is not yet forming cloud . This lack of anti-ice makes flying into IMC even more dangerous in winter than it already is for all the other reasons . Icing only happens when the cloud contains supercooled water droplets , which occurs in clouds where the ambient air temperature is between freezing point ( 0 ° C/32 ° F ) and around -40 ° C / -40 ° F when the droplets freeze to ice pellets . The exact point the droplets freeze varies somewhat because it depends on other parameters like amount of dust , but pilots can check whether they are accreting any ice by looking in the corners of the windscreen . Whether freezing conditions are to be expected will also be mentioned in the detailed weather forecast .
Most airliners have a protection system for this which is based on Weight-on-Wheels ( WoW ) : sensors which detect load on the wheels ( which implies that the aircraft is in contact with ground ) . For safety reasons this can be bypassed and there 's usually a small lever in connection to the gear lever to do this . This image illustrates the 737 gear lever where you can clearly see a " lock override " which fills this functionality ( red part ) <URL>
A few different reasons : Good pilots put the aircraft into a well-known ( up ) configuration after landing , so that the aircraft is ready for use on the next flight . Flaps down during taxi was a signal to the tower that the aircraft had been hijacked . Take-off flaps ( 10 degrees on my airplane ) and landing flaps ( 45 degrees ) , are nearly always different , so leaving the flaps down after landing at , say , 45 , does n't save any steps for departure . If the pilots forgets to set flaps before takeoff , some aircraft ( like mine ) will make it almost impossible to depart and climb out on full flaps because of the induced drag , <URL> . Prevent trucks and people from hitting the flaps while the airplane is parked , especially in the full-down ( landing ) configuration . Some pilots employ the practice of <URL> because it puts more weight on the wheels , reducing stopping distance . Flaps down increases the amount of lift generated by the wing , so some aircraft might actually lift off the ground while parked with full flaps in high winds .

Can an engine that is extinguished by foam be returned to service ?
A foamed <URL> <URL> ( <URL> ) Inaugural Virgin Atlantic flight to Atlanta cancelled after ' water cannon salute ' is swapped for foam and clogs engines The de-clogging work was carried out as the pilot and flight crew went on a diplomatic mission to explain exactly what had gone wrong .

ATC is , broadly speaking , required to ensure that pilots hear , understand , and acknowledge information that is delivered . The way they do that is via read-backs , and although the AIM mentions a few of the things that are required it 's a good idea to read back anything that 's important ( If you 're not sure , err on the side of " It 's important " ) , with your aircraft callsign ( No callsign ? Does n't count ! ) . What are some important things controllers usually expect you to read back ? Clearances ( headings , vectors , altitudes , transponder codes , and radio frequencies ) . Like the AIM says , mutual verification . Runway assignments , hold short instructions , line-up-and-wait , and takeoff clearances . Taxi routes Instructions , ESPECIALLY runway crossings &amp; hold-short instructions . Wake Turbulence advisories . Traffic point-outs . The magic words here , by the by , are " Negative Contact " and " Traffic In Sight " . I think if you say " Tally Ho ! " you 're required to buy everyone on the frequency a bottle of 30-year-old scotch . Instructions to " Maintain visual separation with " some traffic ATC is handing off collision avoidance responsibility to you as the pilot . They need to hear " Will maintain visual separation with " the traffic in question . They also need you to tell them if you lose visual contact . Airport Point-Outs ( Especially if there are several airports close to each other ) You can also pre-empt this by calling the controller : " Cessna 12345 has Podunk Municipal in sight " , possibly with a bearing and approximate distance . Landing Clearances If you 're in a busy pattern and they give you a sequence ( " Number 3 , cleared to land " ) they want to hear that part too . That altimeter setting you get after a handoff . ( I blame <URL> for getting me into this habit , but it IS a good one unless the frequency is crazy ) This list is by no means exhaustive , but it 's most of the big stuff .
Can it be done ? Yes . Is it done ? No . The consequences of unintended operations are serious . To the best of my knowledge , no aircraft has the option set automatic thrust reverser . Using the levers are the only way to operate them . In fact , most of the design efforts have gone the other way - to ensure that thrust reversers are not deployed inadvertently . In most aircraft , the Reverse Thrust Levers can be raised only when the Forward Thrust Levers are in the idle position . The thrust reversers have separate levers in front of the engine controls , which are prevented mechanically from operating otherwise . <URL> Source : bloginblack.de There are sensors installed in the engines which auto-stow the thrust reversers in flight . The design philosophy of thrust reversers is that it is better to not deploy them when needed rather than deploy them when not needed i.e. they are designed to fail . The main reason for such a design philosophy is safety . Any uncommanded deployment of thrust reversers in any phase of flight can have serious consequences . Takeoff - If the trust reversers are deployed in one engine before $ V _ { 1 } $ , the aircraft will veer off the runway . If it is deployed after $ V _ { 1 } $ and before $ V _ { 2 } $ , the aircraft can not achieve $ V _ { r } $ required to initiate rotation . Flight - Deployment of thrust reversers during flight can lead to <URL> . Landing - Deployment of thrust reversers during landing <URL> the option of rejected landing . Because of these reasons and reliability issues with thrust reversers , there is no option for automatic deployment of thrust reversers .
The 747-300 was somewhat of a cross between -200 and SP . The -300 was almost same as the -200 except for the increased length of the hump . The -300 was never a success and was soon overshadowed by the -400 . The 747SP was the result of a requirement for longer range aircraft . Boeing engineers basically <URL> . However , by the time it flew for the first time , commercial air travel had changed ( in no small part due to the high oil prices ) and the model never sold as much as Boeing had hoped . However , when it was observed that there were no adverse effects when the rear of the cockpit lined up with the front of the wing , Boeing introduced the 747-300 with increased length of the hump with little else in terms of major change from -200 . However , just two years after -300 was introduced , Boeing introduced the -400 , which was a significant improvement - it eliminated the flight engineer , increased range among others , while retaining the -300 's hump ( which meant more economy seats ) . 747-400 is the most successful model of the series , with more than 690 orders . Most airlines jumped straight to the -400 , effectively killing the -300 . Actually , the 747-200 production ( with over 390 made ) ended after the -300 version ( of which only 81 were made ) . So they are more of contemporaries . Also , it 'll be a stretch to call that the older 747 versions are still in passenger service . 747-100 is <URL> , <URL> hardly qualify as passenger service and the most successful of these , the 747-200s are also <URL> , if you discount the VC-25s flying around with US President ( which are slated to be replaced by 747-8s ) .
One example of a system that can not be switched off by the pilot that is probably more common to all other airframes than just the one airframe I 'm indicating . Whenever electrical power is applied to a Gulfstream G550 , whether it is powered by battery , generators , an apu , or some external power source , each engine 's FADEC Electronic Engine Control ( EEC ) computer will be powered and the pilot can not switch them off . The pilot could only indirectly turns them off by switching off all power sources . However , when the engines are running , he ca n't even do that since there is an engine-driven generator dedicated to powering the EECs in the event of a total power loss . In fact , while the engine is running or even windmilling above 35 % rpm , the EEC 's dedicated generator is supplying all power to the EEC and there is no switch or circuit protection that can be manipulated by the pilot to interrupt it .
From the <URL> referenced by mongo , Frequencies ( MHz ) : 121.425 - 121.475 Use : Band Protection for 121.5 Frequencies ( MHz ) : 121.525 - 121.575 Use : Band Protection for 121.5 It seems that these frequencies exist only to be silent space around Guard/121 .5 . No one should transmit on them , and you should probably hear total silence there . I think these are an excellent place to look for quiet space .
You must request a <URL> from the <URL> ( Flight Standards District Office ) . You 'll need to fill out <URL> , Application for U.S. Airworthiness , appropriately calling out the reasons you need a SFP ( ferry flight , etc ) . Once the form is submitted , you may be subject to an inspection by an FAA official or representative , verifying that your aircraft is in fact <URL> . Avemco , the insurance company , has <URL> that might be worth an extended read and which I do n't intend to copy here .
Yes , this is possible , as demonstrated in this video from almost 2 years ago : <URL> Each helicopter probably does not weigh more than the woman being lifted . The two helicopters are tilted such that the forces are in equilibrium with no collisions . Both are coordinated as two pilots are flying these by Line-of-Sight .
As one of my instructors was fond of pointing out , there 's pretty much a regulation for everything -- <URL> which is pretty short and to the point as far as government regulations go . The big rules regarding kites/balloons kick in for a kite " over 5 pounds " or a balloon " over 6 feet in diameter / 115 cubic feet of gas capacity " , and are : You have to keep them at least 500 feet below any clouds . You have to keep them less than 500 feet above the ground . You must be at least 5 miles from the boundary of any airport . If your kite/balloon is going to be more than 150 feet above the surface you 're also supposed to coordinate with the closest ATC facility ( who would theoretically put out a NOTAM saying " John Doe is going to be flying a kite/balloon/thingy here , between these hours . Please try not to hit it . " ) There are also some lighting requirements ( if you fly the balloon/kite at night ) , and visibility requirements ( but really , who wants to fly a kite in less than 3 miles visibility ? That seems like pretty lousy kite weather . ) As a favor to your local pilot community ( and to prevent having your wayward kite dragged off by a Cessna on short final ) it 's probably best to observe the three " big rules " above regardless of the size of your kite - a 6-ounce piece of balsa and cellophane can still make a lot of people 's days more interesting if it appears in an unexpected location .
Honestly , very little . First , be clear as to whether you are actually see something failing . If you see flames , or a wing has broken off , then yes , it 's a problem . However , if you see someone doing a slow spiral towards an empty field with the power idling , they 're more likely to be practicing engine out procedures ( something that 's required for all US pilots to practice and demonstrate during their checkride for their certificate ) . In the event that you actually see an impact , fire , off-airport landing and so on , call 911 and give them your location . They 'll send the appropriate crews . Otherwise , if the aircraft is still flying , there 's a strong chance the pilot ( s ) are already talking to ATC about their problem , if it actually exists . There 's nothing you really can or need to do in this case . Quick Anecdote : I 've been told the story of a local police department who gets phone calls virtually every time a citizen lands his small airplane in his private field . Fire/police/medics / etc are summoned , when absolutely nothing bad has happened . This is why you should make an attempt to verify that a problem actually exists before reporting it .
It is in the <URL> allright . <URL> As @Dave pointed out , this value can change depending on configuration and other limitation/alterations .
Can a commercial airplane fly outside the safety area ? Yes , there is nothing physically stopping the plane from doing so . Is it allowed to do so ? No , precisely for the event should an engine fail then it will have enough range to get to the airport and make a safe landing . Extending the allowable range of twin engine aircraft is what <URL> is about . By default commercial airplanes with 2 engines must remain within 60 minutes flying time of an airport in case of engine failure . This was decided at a time where engines were unreliable . However as engine reliability increased airplanes could have that range increased with an ETOPS certificate .
You can cross behind the aircraft on departure roll . This type of operation is done heavily at ATL , on the middle complex during an east flow . Aircraft will depart runway 9L at M2 , and arrivals from either of the south runway will cross behind them the whole time at M1 , to get up to the gates .
You can not ( as far as I know ) , Flush the toilets Control the IFE system ( aside from possibly pulling the breaker to shut it off ) ( there seems to be some debate on this one and it could vary by plane/system ) Open the doors ( of a passenger plane , cargo planes this may be possible ) Update the software for glass cockpit planes ( if the computers are not located in the cockpit ) . I 'm still looking for the link but FMS units are updated via USB on a unit usually housed with the other flight computers which is often below the cockpit . <URL> these units are in the cockpit as are the USB ports so this may only hold for some aircraft . General passenger tasks ( reading lights etc ) . Although it should be noted that generally speaking the master breakers are in the cockpit so while they may not have control over individual system components ( e.g. single reading lights ) they can often shut them down completely if need be . Ovens ( for heating meals ) and coffee machines . Only circuit breakers are in cockpit again ( and they are needed ; faults in these things cause relatively high fraction of diversions ) .
Yes , I have personally worked on multiple aircraft that were infested by animals . All of these aircraft were small planes , single engine Cessnas for example . A typical example would be one or two small mouse nests in the wings . I also found at least one wasp nest in an aircraft wing . The worst I ever saw was a Mooney that had extensive mouse nests throughout the airframe . That aircraft had been unairworthy for at least a year by the time I saw it . That Mooney ended up being parted out and scrapped , largely because of extensive corrosion in the wings which was either caused by , or aggravated by , the mouse nests . Urea can induce corrosion in aluminum , and finding a mouse nest or other evidence of rodent activity should prompt closer inspection . All the other instances of mouse nests that I have found in airframes were in aircraft that flew several hundred hours a year and these did not suffer any major damage . I have also heard stories from many pilots and mechanics of finding birds nests -- for example in engine intakes or the empennage -- and of rodents chewing into or through electrical wiring . There is also the classic warning to check the pitot tube in case a mud wasp has clogged the intake with a nest . I have never witnessed any of these occurrences myself . The mud dauber wasp is notorious and is suspected of being a contributing factor in at least one fatal airline accident that I am familiar with : <URL> . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA Many means of prevention are available , including typical pest prevention methods such as traps and poisons -- in my experience all reserved for use in the storage hanger . The most aviation specific forms are the various covers used to protect <URL> , <URL> , etc. . <URL> Photo <URL> , courtesy of the FAA As far as the possibility of animals surviving , I suppose the odds are low . I have never encountered a live animal in an airplane ( pets excepted ) . For any animal stowing away on a pressurized aircraft operating at high altitude I should think the low oxygen partial pressure and temperature would both discourage survival outside the pressure vessel . Some flights , particularly international ones , apparently make a practice of spraying some form of pesticide in the cabin to kill mosquitoes and other unwanted creatures .
Q1 : Assuming that by operating temperature you mean turbine inlet temperature , <URL> article says the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine in the F-35 ( JSF ) has a TIT of 3600F , but that most high performance aircraft engines do not exceed 3000F , while non aviation engines are nearer 2700F or lower . Exact figures for modern engines are very unlikely to be stated in public . Mattingly , in his <URL> " Elements of Propulsion : Gas Turbines and Rockets " has a table ( 6-2 , P363 ) that gives a general guideline , depending on the age of the engine . He says : 1955-1965 2000 R = 1540F 1965-1985 2500 R = 2040F 1985-2005 3200 R = 2740F 2005-2025 3600 R = 3140F The GE <URL> gas turbine which had its first run in 1954 is claimed to have a TIT of 1710F , so these guidelines look reasonable . Q2 : Increasing the turbine inlet temperature allows more fuel to be added , which increases thrust and hence thrust to weight ratio , and specific thrust ( thrust per lb of air ingested ) . Increasing TIT ( at the same pressure ratio ) also has some effect on improving the specific fuel consumption . At the same TIT , SFC is improved by increasing the compressor pressure ratio . The chart <URL> shows the effects for a particular engine , the specific effects will differ for each engine depending on the bypass ratio etc. . <URL> Q3 : There are three methods that can be used to cool turbine parts . The primary approach is to bleed off a portion of the compressor exit air , which then bypasses the combustion , and is feed into the turbine vanes and blades . The below picture also includes <URL> for the % flow of compressor exit air that is used . <URL> Other methods that are often used as well include the use of small holes over the blades and vane surfaces , through which the cooling flow emerges . This provides a film of cool air over the part , and is known as film cooling ( left picture ) . On some more modern engines , thermal barrier coatings are also used ( right picture ) . These are ceramic coatings that act as insultion of the base metal from the hot gas . Usually the TBC is added as an extra method to help gain additional part life . But sometimes , the TBC is needed to obtain the base life , and is then know as <URL> . <URL> <URL>
Every time an engine is shut down in flight , it is tracked . Engine reliability does affect ETOPS certification . In addition to the aircraft being certified , each airline is also ETOPS certified . An aircraft or an airline with a poor record could have its ETOPS certification downgraded , or even potentially revoked . <URL> ETOPS approval is a two-step process . First , the airframe and engine combination must satisfy the basic ETOPS requirements during its type certification . This is called " ETOPS type approval " . Such tests may include shutting down an engine and flying the remaining engine during the complete diversion time . Often such tests are performed in the middle of the ocean . It must be demonstrated that , during the diversion flight , the flight crew is not unduly burdened by extra workload due to the lost engine and that the probability of the remaining engine failing is extremely remote . For example , if an aircraft is rated for ETOPS-180 , it means that it should be able to fly with full load and just one engine for 3 hours . Second , an operator who conducts ETOPS flights must satisfy their own country 's aviation regulators about their ability to conduct ETOPS flights . This is called " ETOPS operational certification " and involves compliance with additional special engineering and flight crew procedures in addition to the normal engineering and flight procedures . Pilots and engineering staff must be qualified and trained for ETOPS . An airline with extensive experience operating long distance flights may be awarded ETOPS operational approval immediately , others may need to demonstrate ability through a series of ETOPS proving flights . Regulators closely watch the ETOPS performance of both type certificate holders and their affiliated airlines . Any technical incidents during an ETOPS flight must be recorded . From the data collected , the reliability of the particular airframe-engine combination is measured and statistics published . The figures must be within limits of type certifications . Of course , the figures required for ETOPS-180 will always be more stringent than ETOPS-120 . Unsatisfactory figures would lead to a downgrade , or worse , suspension of ETOPS capabilities either for the type certificate holder or the airline .
No , nothing addresses that case . Let 's say you 're 20 minutes out from your destination , and because it 's a clear VFR day you have minimum normal reserves -- roughly an hour of flying ( on 2 engines , at medium-to-low altitude ) . Those reserves are already prescribed for you by FAR 's . Now you lose the engine . How long can you fly ? Until you run out of fuel or the other engine quits -- so in all probability , about that same hour , plus or minus . Different case , you 're over at Atlantic heading to Bermuda or the Azores or Iceland or NYC to the Caribbean , or over the Gulf of Mexico -- not ETOPS but a long ways from anywhere . The fuel on board will be lots more , because you were planning for a much longer flight . ( And again , those fuel requirements are defined elsewhere . ) You now have the added twist of drifting down on one engine to a single-engine ceiling -- you set max continuous thrust on the good motor , and descend at a speed that gives you max range , which probably comes out to a few hundred feet per minute of descent . Back in the flight planning , the check had to be performed that at the worst case , you could lose the motor , drift down , and continue to reach a suitable airfield without needing more gas than you 'd have . But in something like a 737 , the gas you 'll have on-board anyway is almost certainly more than sufficient . But in this latter case , the time you can stay aloft is going to be hours -- way beyond what you had in the first case . So no , the regulations do n't prescribe a time that you have to be able to keep flying after losing one engine . You DO have to be able to keep flying -- that 's important -- and you have to have enough fuel to get to a destination with the one motor shut down . But in terms of a prescribed time , that is n't given in the FAR 's .
The crash was only one of the ( albeit an important ) reason for the grounding of Concorde . Actually , the aircraft was retired around three years after the crash . The main reason was that not enough people were flying it to keep it profitable . The Concorde as a technological marvel , but it had a number of disadvantages : The aircraft was costly - The program cost over $ 3B and produced 20 aircraft , of which 14 were used in commercial service . Maintenance costs - The small number of aircraft and technological sophistication meant that the cost of spares was high and options limited . Operating costs - The Concorde consumed nearly three times per passenger fuel when compared to the Boeing 747-100 . Still , the aircraft made operational profit due to the high cost of tickets . Recession - After 9/11 attacks exacerbated the global downturn in aviation due to recession , there was an enormous drop in first class air travel , on which Concorde was dependent on . While announcing the retirement , British Airways cited commercial reasons , with passenger revenue falling steadily against a backdrop of rising maintenance costs for the aircraft .
The slide has to be removed from the aircraft completely ( generally ) and sent back to it 's manufacturer to be inspected and repacked , but yes , it can be reused . <URL> As a far as " how many times " , I would assume until it breaks ;) . Though honestly , I doubt a slide would ever be deployed more than once , maybe twice in it 's life span .

Why is the altimeter unwinding unevenely during a spin ?
The altimeter works by measurements of the pressure in undisturbed air , also called static pressure . A static port is placed , usually on the side of the hull , perpendicular to the airflow . During a spin , the airflow will not flow evenly past the static port , but will occasionally flow directly onto the static port . This will cause a rise in measured pressure , leading the altimeter to believe it is lower than it actually is . This cause fluctuations in the indicated altitude .
Looking at the hurricane manuals for a few airports , evacuating flyable aircraft to a safer location tends to be the most common choice . From the <URL> Effective with the issuance of a Storm WARNING and/or Hurricane WARNING : Relocate flyable aircraft to other geographical areas , place under suitable shelter , or secure as appropriate . Also , from the <URL> Upon receipt of a Hurricane Warning , Airside Operations will : Initiate evacuation of all flyable aircraft and post Airfield Operations Senior Agents and Agents in detail to insure compliance and report results .
This FAA <URL> is about using electronic checklists for airline flights ( it concludes that they 're better than paper ones ) and includes this quote : They found the crews averaged 3.2 checklist errors per flight ( one of the observed flights had 14 . ) The most-common checklist error involved the omission or deferral of an item , which was later forgotten . NASA commissioned a <URL> into checklists in 1990 , but it does n't identify specific items that are commonly overlooked . It does say that as the number of items on a checklist increases , the chances of overlooking any individual one does too : Swain and Guttman ( 1983 ) , in their study of nuclear power plant operations " recognized the fact that as the list of items grows , there may be a higher probability of overlooking any given item " ( chap . 15 , p. 13 ) The final section of the paper has recommendations for checklist design , which could be considered the " best practices " you mentioned , but of course it 's a very general list , e.g. . The most critical items on the task-checklist should be listed as close as possible to the beginning of the task-checklist , in order to increase the likelihood of completing the item before interruptions may occur AOPA 's Flight Training magazine has an <URL> on " frequently forgotten " checks that is more specific and most of the checks seem to apply to most ( light ) aircraft , but it does n't provide any authoritative sources . They also have a " how to preflight " <URL> that gives more information and includes this interesting observation : As an experiment , I held a preflight contest with a " bugged " trainer . I reversed the rigging on the ailerons so their movement was contrary to control inputs . Every one of the contestants checked control movement and freedom , but no one caught the problem . Putting all that together suggests - only to me , and I 'm not an expert - that it 's less important to think about specific items that you might forget , and more important to ensure that you complete the checklist fully and really verify the results of each check . If you consider some checklist items to be ' more important ' than others then it could also lead to mistakes because you overlook the ' less important ' ones .
The Air Traffic Control system does transmit information over the internet . The Air Traffic Control system has a number of components , some of which transmit information over the internet . According to <URL> , Office of Inspector General , DoT , . . Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has increasingly turned toward the use of commercial software and Internet Protocol ( IP ) - based technologies to modernize ATC systems . Note that the ATC is not connected directly to the internet . It is the behind scene connections , that are routed through the internet . According to <URL> , ... when most managers say there is no connection to the Internet , they are unaware of maintenance connections . Behind the scenes there are almost always semi-direct connections through routers shared between the control system and business systems that can be exploited Actually , the use of internet for sharing of information is increasing . <URL> modernization involves a significant amount of information transmission over the internet . According to US <URL> , NextGen is a modernization effort begun in 2004 by FAA to transform the nation 's ground-based ATC system into a system that uses satellite - based navigation and other advanced technology . ... These new technologies will use an Internet Protocol ( IP ) based network to communicate . <URL> Image from GAO report on Air Traffic Control This increasing connection to the internet does increase the associated risks . From the same GAO report : ... the shift to NextGen technologies will require FAA to replace its proprietary , relatively isolated ATC computer systems with information systems that interoperate and share data throughout FAA 's operations and those of its aviation partners . ... These new systems ... will also employ digital and Internet-based computer-networking technologies , exposing the air traffic control ( ATC ) system to new cybersecurity risks . As to why the ATC is connected to the internet , it basically boils down to ease of operation . According to [ NATS ] , which manages UK airspace , We ... are now working all over the world within an industry where systems are connected across organisations , countries and continents . Such an interconnected worldwide system requires a standard platform , which will not be possible ( or atleast very difficult to maintain ) if a closed , proprietary platform is used . So , the ATC does use internet , though this is mainly to transmit information . However , I 'm not aware of the security systems , though we can be sure that they do have some sort of encryption ( If I 'm correct , Lockheed Martin supplies the software ) and have firewalls to protect the systems .
According to <URL> : " The origin of the name Dutch roll is uncertain . However , it is likely that this term , describing a lateral asymmetric motion of an airplane , was borrowed from a reference to similar-appearing motion in ice skating . In 1916 , aeronautical engineer Jerome C. Hunsaker published the following quote : " Dutch roll -- the third element in the [ lateral ] motion [ of an airplane ] is a yawing to the right and left , combined with rolling . The motion is oscillatory of period for 7 to 12 seconds , which may or may not be damped . The analogy to ' Dutch Roll ' or ' Outer Edge ' in ice skating is obvious . " In 1916 , Dutch Roll was the term used for skating repetitively to right and left ( by analogy to the motion described for the aircraft ) on the outer edge of one 's skates . By 1916 , the term had been imported from skating to aeronautical engineering , perhaps by Hunsaker himself . 1916 was only five years after G. H. Bryan did the first mathematics of lateral motion of aircraft in 1911 . " Sadly , this question is probably not answerable beyond what wikipedia has on this site ( unless there is an English Major looking for a Ph.D. thesis . ;)
Not necessarily ; it is the pilot 's prerogative to use the weather radar as required . If the weather is clear and the pilot decides that the weather radar display is going to take up valuable space in display , he/she can fly without the weather radar on . Of course , in cases like night flying , it is better to have it on during the entire flight , but it is the pilot 's decision . The regulatory requirements are for the weather radar to be operational only if potentially dangerous conditions are expected en route or for night flying . From <URL> : ( b ) No person may begin a flight under IFR or night VFR conditions when current weather reports indicate that thunderstorms , or other potentially hazardous weather conditions that can be detected with airborne weather radar equipment , may reasonably be expected along the route to be flown , unless the airborne weather radar equipment required by paragraph ( a ) of this section is in satisfactory operating condition . European regulations are also similar . From <URL> : ( a ) An operator shall not operate : ( i ) ( 1 ) A pressurised aeroplane ; ... ... unless it is equipped with airborne weather radar equipment whenever such an aeroplane is being operated at night or in instrument meteorological conditions in areas where thunderstorms or other potentially hazardous weather conditions , regarded as detectable with airborne weather radar , may be expected to exist along the route .
" Dictate " is the wrong word . Within the ranges listed in the POH , the pilot may select rpm/MP settings as he pleases to meet other criteria . Charles Lindbergh instructed many WWII pilots in a technique to extend range , by flying with low rpm and high manifold pressure . This extended range by reducing the " pumping losses " required to maintain low manifold pressure . Over long distances this technique did extend range considerably . Secondly , lower rpm reduces noise - remember that the propeller is the largest contributor to a propeller-driven plane 's noise signature . This is important in the terminal environment where the noise can affect the ground , but it also affects in-cockpit noise regardless of altitude . This answer does not contradict the former answer , but it extends it to point out that there are other important factors that the pilot should consider in selection of engine operation parameters .
A <URL> ( MOU ) is n't an aviation term or practice , it 's a general business/legal term for a ' pre-contract ' of some kind . Before two companies commit to a legally binding and perhaps very expensive contract , they 'll often prepare an MOU to make sure that everyone involved has the same understanding of what will be in the contract . That way , there should n't be any big surprises or fundamental disagreements when the real contract is prepared . In the context of aviation , that could be things like how many aircraft will be purchased and when , or what the price is anticipated to be , or anything else that both side consider important . That means that the information in an MOU could be very interesting for other parties ( " can you explain why our competitors are paying you $ 50m less per aircraft than we do ? " ) , so they 're usually confidential . Another common use for MOUs is for PR/Marketing purposes . If two companies are discussing a joint business venture they might come up with an MOU and use it to generate market interest or even raise capital ( " I know we 're a small company but we have an MOU with Boeing to jointly research alternative fuels " ) . Given that background , I do n't think it 's likely that you 'll get any specific answers to your questions . An MOU could include all the things you mentioned but only a real contract is enforceable .
Theres two different approaches , passive and active stability on all three axis . X axis ( roll ) : In the X axis , flying wings are stabilized the same as any other plane . Passive stability is achieved through a slight upwards dihedral between left and right wing . As such the " lower " wing creates slightly more lift in upwards direction and allows the plane to roll back to horizontal flight . Active stability is achieved through ailerons near the wing tips which create a controlled differential lift allowing the pilot or flight computer to control the roll velocity . Y axis ( pitch ) Passive stability in the Y axis in traditional planes is achieved through the high-leverage corrective force of the horizontal stabilizer ( with the exception of canard type planes where the main wing itself takes this role ) Active stability is achieved through elevator controls on this stabilizer , which increase or decrease the vertical force in one or the other direction . In a flying wing this stabilizer is not present . Instead the rearward area of the main wing takes this role . For this to work , a stable flying wing needs to have wings that are significantly swept backwards in such a way that the overall torque force at both positive and negative high angle of attack is always decreasing this angle of attack . Active stability is achieved through control surfaces at the very back of the wing . These are often the same control surfaces also used for Roll control , but deflecting in unison instead of opposite directions ( Elevons ) Z Axis ( yaw ) Similar to pitch , the passive and active yaw control on conventional planes is done with a stabilizer fin with a rudder at the tail . In true flying wings this is not present ( Some do n't even have winglets ) But the high wing sweep ( usually the wings of a flying wings meet at roughly 90 ° angle at the tip ) causes a higher drag force at the forward facing wing if the craft yaws to one side , which enacts the required corrective force . Active control is achieved by causing additional drag through some sort of braking flaps near the wing tips ( the actual implementations vary - split elevons - separate break flaps - ... ) This can also be augmented by using differential thrust . ( Note : The corrective force is much lower than that caused by a tail fin . As such a powered flying wing should have its engines relatively close to the center , otherwise a one-engine-out scenario would cause an uncorrectable yawing moment . This however limits the effectiveness of differential thrust if the craft is supposed to stay flyable in such a condition ) Speed and stall stability : A speed stable plane has its nose pitch up at higher speeds and pitch down if the craft gets slower , thanks to the center of gravity being in front of the center of lift , which causes the nose to drop . This is balanced out by a ( usually parasitic ) downward force from the horizontal stabilizer acting at the tail of the plane . This arrangement of forces should also cause the nose to drop and the angle of attack to reduce in a stall situation . As a flying wing does not have this stabilizer , a similar balance of forces needs to be achieved through a careful design of wing profile and twist . If you look at Horton flying wing glider designs for example , they have a " thick " profile creating the majority of lift in the center ( which thanks to the wing sweep is also the front ) Towards the end and back of the wings , the profile becomes thinner and more symmetric . At the same time , the wings are slightly twisted , so the intrinsic angle of attack is a few degree lower at the tip ( and as such at the rear of the wing ) than near the nose . At high speeds , the front of the wing creates more lift than the back and rises the nose . This part has the highest wing load and will stall first , while the swept back outer wing area - thanks to its profile , lower AoA and lower load will not have stalled yet . The nose drops , and the control surfaces in this rearward part stay functional . It should be noted that not all flying wing designs did achieve a safe stall behavior . Some , like early 1940 's and 1950 's American designs failed to implement stall stability correctly , while others ( like the B2 bomber ) the plane was deliberately designed aerodynamically unsafe to faciliate other features ( stealth ) which would have been compromised by a " twisted " wing .
Basically , it 's a combination of historical significance , passenger comfort , and ease of mental calculation . Historically , before aircraft were pressurized a rapid descent would be uncomfortable for passengers . At the speeds typically flown , a 300ft/min descent was deemed to be comfortable enough for the typical passenger . Many aircraft had a cruising speed between 100 -- 120 miles per hour ( 160 -- 190 km/h ) . Three miles would be traveled in about 1.5 -- 1.8 minutes , resulting in a rate of descent of about 550 -- 660 feet per minute . That was about as fast as passengers could comfortably adapt to the changing pressure on their eardrums . However , many pilots used a 300-feet-per-minute descent rate because doing so is almost unnoticed by passengers . A pilot cruising at 10,500 feet would calculate that in order to be at 1,000 feet at his destination , he would have to descend 9,500 feet . Dividing 9,500 feet by 300 feet per minute , that descent would require about 32 minutes . If his ground speed was 120 miles per hour ( 190 km/h ) , he would begin his descent about 64 miles ( 103 km ) from his destination ( traffic permitting ) . As you can see , there is a reasonably simple mental calculation that can be done there . This is commonly referred to as <URL> which is in part quoted above . That covers descent from cruising altitude , however you are right that flight in IFR will depend on procedures , and scenario . An example is <URL> which uses a much steeper descent profile of 5.5 degrees on approach to land .
You can see the requirements for all FAA medicals in <URL> . Specifically , S <URL> deals with second class medicals and <URL> deals with first class medicals . The only difference my cursory read of these regulations revealed is : x. 111 - Cardiovascular . A first class medical requires EKG after your 35th birthday and every year after age 40 . This leads me to believe any real differences are likely in the ME 's guidelines for issuing the medical , and I am not familiar with those . The only other differences relate to duration and requirement for the exercise of privileges . On your second question , if you apply for a first class medical and for some reason could not qualify for one , you will be denied or deferred even if you could hold a lower class medical ( this is also true of a second class application ) . The only possibilities at the end of a medical exam are walking out with a medical of the class you applied for or walking out without a medical . There is no fallthrough to a lower class . If you have an issue that you believe would inhibit your ability to get a first class medical , an avenue to explore this is through <URL> where you can talk with a doctor and get advice on your ability to pass a medical and support in handling a deferred medical application .
Flutter happens when structural and aerodynamic <URL> converge . Aerodynamic eigenfrequencies depend on the time the air molecules take to transverse an aerodynamic surface .
Ideally it would not . With increasing Mach number the <URL> of the vertical tail goes up proportional to the Prandtl-Glauert factor $ \ frac { 1 } { \ sqrt { 1-Ma ^ 2 } } $ while the destabilising fuselage as a slender body is mainly unaffected by Mach effects . But that is only theory which assumes a perfectly rigid body . In reality , elasticity decreases the effectivity of the vertical tail . Higher loads lead to higher deformations which in turn decrease the loads and with them the stabilising moments . What happens in detail depends on the structure : A light aircraft will experience decreasing directional stability as dynamic pressure increases . At supersonic speed , fin effectivity is further reduced by the now again decreasing lift curve slope as Mach increases further . Now even the rigid aircraft experiences decreasing directional stability and elasticity will reduce stability further . <URL> Directional stability over Mach , from Ray Whitford 's Fundamentals of Fighter Design
Sounds most like the pilot released back pressure on the control stick abruptly once the main wheels touchdown . The idea here is that you gently lower the nose wheel to the pavement once the mains are on the ground in order to prevent that kind of a bounce . As I recall the Cessna 162 has a tendency to bounce on the nose wheel as well as to porpoise if the landing attitude is not done correctly it 's just a quirk of that airplane .
As DeltaLima said , it is kind of hard answering your question . After looking at the <URL> you might have found the answer already . Let me try to answer your specific question though : Assuming an airliner , let 's say the A320 , for some reason got into a spin , can it be recovered ? The general answer would be yes ! Here are some things to consider though : The FAA requires all single-engine normal category aircraft to demonstrate spin recovery in <URL> . It depends a lot on the center of gravity of the airplane whether it is recoverable from a spin or not . If the center of gravity is too far aft , it will not be recoverable from a spin . Gliders , being light , have an easy shiftable CG , and there is some that do n't enter spins at all or need extra weights in the back in order to make them spinnable ! Airliners are not required to do so as they are not as likely to get into a spin in the first place ! The structure of an airliner is designed for air flowing over it , not for being in a spin ! Centrifugal forces will be applied to the structure due to angular acceleration . Also , spins by airliner would be a lot faster then by little aircraft and more forces would be applied to the frame . If the recovery from the spin is made too fast or abrupt , it can overstress the airplane as well ! All Airbus I know are fly-by-wire , and Airbus is well known for its computer based controls . Most airliners have a lot of systems , which prevent them from even getting into a stall . There a incidents where these systems failed and it went back to the pilot doing the right thing . As a spin always always always requires a stall first , and pilots are trained to avoid stalls in the first place , it is very unlikely for an airliner to enter a spin , having the pilot and various systems working against entering a stall !
Yes , what you describe is perfectly possible . A stall in banked flight can result in a spin , given you fly the " right " plane . My first flight in an ASW-20C was late in the afternoon , when most thermals had died down . I got a winch launch to maybe 350 m ( the ASW-20 is rather poor in winch launches ) and tried to find an updraft . In maybe 270 m I found one , but it was weak and narrow . So I slowed down to tighten the circle . Having flown a Discus all day before , I was not really alerted to watch out for a departure on stall . At some point the lateral stick force faded markedly , and out of the Discus habit I threw the stick into the circle so the inner aileron would deflect downwards to support the stalling wing . Bad choice ! This aggravated the incipient stall , the aircraft rolled into the circle and pitched down . While the view from the cockpit before was blue above and green below , it got now all green . I was entering a spin . The weakening stick force was the result of flow separation over the aileron , and while the Discus airfoil would still provide more lift with more deflection , the ASW-20 airfoil simply went into full stall . I immediately pushed down and levelled the plane , and went on to land straight away , having lost maybe 100 m . It all took only seconds , and only long after the flight I could piece all details together . My next flight in the ASW-20 was when the thermals were much stronger . I went up to 1000 m and did stall training until I knew how it felt when stall starts and what my options are . I should had done this on the first flight , and do so on all subsequent new types I fly .
Briefly : yes , it 's possible ( but very unlikely ) ; small pressurized aircraft are the more likely scenario ; maybe it has happened but if so it 's very rare . According to the FAA 's AC on <URL> it 's possible and more likely to happen in a smaller pressurized aircraft : ( a ) Explosive Decompression . A change in cabin pressure faster than the lungs can decompress . Most authorities consider any decompression that occurs in less than 0.5 seconds as explosive and potentially dangerous . This type of decompression is more likely to occur in small volume pressurized aircraft than in large pressurized aircraft and often results in lung damage . [ ... ] ( b ) Rapid Decompression . A change in cabin pressure where the lungs can decompress faster than the cabin . The risk of lung damage is significantly lower in this decompression compared to an explosive decompression . Unfortunately they do n't cite any statistics or source for the statement " often results in lung damage " so it is n't clear when it has actually happened . Other sources suggest that it 's very rare , for example Beyond the Black Box : The Forensics of Airplane Crashes <URL> this : The Air Force reports no serious injuries resulting from rapid decompression with open airways , even while wearing an oxygen mask . However , disastrous , even fatal consequences can result if the breath is forcibly held with the lungs full of air . [ ... ] Lung damage is considered nearly impossible in a commercial aircraft because of the large volume of air inside the plane . [ ... ] Even <URL> [ ... ] did not decompress fast enough to cause internal injuries . In other words , it 's not going to happen unless you hold your breath , but <URL> says that you wo n't be able to do that anyway : I 've had pilots tell me they would be able to hold their breath [ in order to extend the <URL> . That wo n't happen . First of all , the surprise of the event will override any defensive measure you may have thought you could put into place . Secondly , the rapid change in pressure differential will make it impossible to hold your breath . ( Remember , we can be talking about a pressure differential of 8.8 PSI . Let 's put these pressure differentials into perspective . A differential of 8.8 PSI is 1267 pounds per square foot . I think the surprise is a key point here : the <URL> increases your breathing rate so even if it were physically possible to hold your breath it 's extremely unlikely that you would do so . Interestingly , Google finds numerous sources that claim lung injuries are commonly caused by aircraft decompression , but I could n't find any source that mentioned a specific incident or even any statistics on it . I did find <URL> that studied 47 incidents of aircraft decompression but there was only one single barotrauma event among them and it affected the ears , not the lungs .
In order for a spin to develop , you need two things from the airplane : it must be stalled it must be yawing . Since the airplane is not yawing while in a slip ( it is actually flying straight ahead , although uncoordinated ) , the airplane simply wo n't spin . Instead , when the stall occurs the higher wing ( which has the higher angle of attack ) will stall first , the wing will drop , and the wings will tend level . That being said , it is still a stall and can be dangerous at low altitudes . It can also turn into a spin if you leave the rudder applied as the wings level and you come out of the slip ( and into a skid ) . The best protection for all of this is to watch your airspeed and angle of attack to make sure that you always have sufficient airspeed so that you never stall in the first place . Additional Information Since this has generated some debate , here is additional information : Spin According to <URL> ( emphasis added by me ) : Spins can be entered intentionally or unintentionally , from any flight attitude and from practically any airspeed -- all that is required is sufficient yaw rate while an aircraft is stalled . Yaw So this brings us to <URL> : The yaw axis is defined to be perpendicular to the body of the wings with its origin at the center of gravity and directed towards the bottom of the aircraft . A yaw motion is a movement of the nose of the aircraft from side to side . Skid <URL> actually covers this exact scenario : The skid is more dangerous than the slip if the airplane is close to a stall . In the slip , the raised wing -- the left one if the airplane is turning to the right -- will stall before the lowered one , and the airplane will reduce the bank angle , which prevents the stall . In the skid , the lowered wing will stall before the raised one , and the airplane will tighten the turn , and the stall can develop to a spin . Slip <URL> says : A slip is an aerodynamic state where an aircraft is moving somewhat sideways as well as forward relative to the oncoming airflow or relative wind . In other words , for a conventional aircraft , the nose will be pointing in the opposite direction to the bank of the wing ( s ) . The aircraft is not in coordinated flight and therefore is flying inefficiently . Note that the aircraft is moving sideways . The nose of the aircraft is not moving , and it is therefore not yawing . It also says : Often , if an airplane in a slip is made to stall , it displays very little of the yawing tendency that causes a skidding stall to develop into a spin . A stalling airplane in a slip may do little more than tend to roll into a wings level attitude . In fact , in some airplanes stall characteristics may even be improved .
Climbing further while cruising is saving fuel , not wasting it . First , every airplane has an <URL> for most economical cruise . If it loses mass ( due to fuel consumed ) , it needs to adjust either its altitude or its speed to keep that angle of attack . The goal is to keep dynamic pressure , the product of air density and the square of airspeed , constant . Since you want to reach your destination in the shortest time , climbing into less dense air is the better option . Secondly , gas turbines need less fuel per unit of thrust when flying in colder air . As long as the plane stays in the <URL> , <URL> when it flies in colder air .
Spoilers lower lift and increase drag on the side where they are deployed . Symmetric spoiler deployment , therefore , is for slowing down . Asymmetric deployment not only creates a ( small ) rolling moment , but primarily a yawing moment which helps to counteract the <URL> created by ailerons , especially at the high lift coefficient at takeoff and early climb . Spoiler deployment increases pressure ahead of the spoiler due to the slowing of local flow ahead of the obstruction caused by the spoiler , and it creates a local flow separation at and behind the spoiler , which in turn lowers the local pressure . Only the first effect lowers lift , but both create drag . The main effect of a limited spoiler deflection , therefore , is to increase drag .

Is there a boomless sonic technology in any state at this time ?
Shock wave is a physical phenomenon and as such is unavoidable . The best we can do is to reduce their intensity and reduce their effects on ground . A method to eliminate the shock wave ( theoretically ) was proposed by <URL> . His airframe , called the <URL> which consists of two triangular cross-section plates a certain distance apart ( so that choking is prevented ) with the flat sides parallel to the fluid flow . <URL> Image from Supersonic biplane -- A review by Kazuhiro Kusunose et al. . The idea is that the shock waves are formed internally between the two ( triangular ) ' airfoils ' and cancel each other out at design condition , shown in the first case . <URL> Image from Supersonic biplane -- A review by Kazuhiro Kusunose et al. . At off design conditions , shock waves are produced . However , this does n't produce any lift at zero angle of attack , as is obvious . As <URL> , ... the design lacks lift : The two wings create a very narrow channel through which only a limited amount of air can flow . When transitioning to supersonic speeds , the channel ... could essentially " choke , " creating incredible drag . While the design could work beautifully at supersonic speeds , it ca n't overcome the drag to reach those speeds . Research is being carried out to overcome this issue - One method proposed is to <URL> - so that they are efficient at all speeds . Another group is working to optimize the shape of the airfoils in Busemann 's Biplane so that the shock-wave is reduced at all stages of supersonic flight . However , all these studies are in conceptual stage and no experiments have been carried out so far . NASA carried out the <URL> ( SSBD ) , in which the fuselage of a Northrop -5 E was modified ( kind of like pelican 's beak ) so as to change the pattern of shock waves formed in supersonic flight . <URL> " <URL> " by NASA/Carla Thomas - <URL> . Licensed under Public Domain via <URL> . NASA reported that the modifications were able to reduce the intensity of the shock wave by a considerable amount , as shown in the image below ( the ' flat ' pressure line is from the SSB demonstrator ) . <URL> Image from Quieting the Boom - The Shaped Sonic Boom demonstrator and the Quest for Quiet Supersonic Flight by NASA Active research is still being carried out by various organizations in this field .
The components of attitude vector are called : yaw ( or heading ) is the angle of longitudinal ( x ) axis in horizontal plane , pitch is angle of longitudinal ( x ) axis from the horizontal and roll is angle of lateral ( y ) axis from the intersection of the yz ( orthogonal to longitudinal axis ) plane with horizontal . And their derivatives are usually yaw-rate , pitch-rate and roll-rate . Second derivative names probably vary . Regarding coordinate system , the first axis , called x , is always longitudinal and positive direction is forward . The second axis , called y , is usually lateral one , but positive direction is right in some systems and left in others . And z completes a right-handed coordinate system ( so your vector products work the usual way ) , so z down if y points right . Edit : I thought u , v , w is sometimes used as alias for the axis , but actually they are usually rather used for the velocity vector components .

Over Central Europe in the winter time , air becomes tremendously cold . Since warm bleed air from the compressor stage of a jet engine is used for cabin heating , the pilots might have set temperatures to maximum in order to warm the cabin . But being in a climb , almost all power of the engines is required for lifting the aircraft , thus leaving only little excess bleed air to be used for heating . During normal days and outside air temperatures this should be enough , though . By levelling out the aircraft , the engines are spooled back ( less power required than in climb - > hence more excess bleed air available - > higher ability to warm the cabin in cruise than in climb ) . If the pilots/cabin attendants just did n't realize this circumstance rapidly enough , the cabin is being flooded with maximum heating air from the engines .
As jwenting said , it 's unlikely to happen for many reasons , and if it does , the participants are even less likely to admit it since doing so could get them in trouble both professionally , and with a government regulatory agency for endangering safety . I seem to remember the FAA taking action against a pilot who posted photographs of himself flying with either naked or bikini clad women at his side , but I ca n't seem to find a link right now . There is one <URL> which is somewhat famous in the aviation community for describing a general aviation crash which was likely caused by sexual activity . However , the summary is very delicately worded , to say the least : The private pilot and a pilot rated passenger were going to practice simulated instrument flight . Witnesses observed the airplane 's right wing fail in a dive and crash . Examination of the wreckage and bodies revealed that both occupants were partially clothed and the front right seat was in the full aft reclining position . Neither body showed evidence of seatbelts or shoulder harnesses being worn . Examination of the individuals ' clothing revealed no evidence of ripping or distress to the zippers and belts .
From a single spotting location , then yes by training . But for any location , then it 's very hard . <URL> when the sound reflects off the surrounding surfaces , e.g. , ground , buildings , etc. . And when the sound comes from above . Most mammals are adept at resolving the location of a sound source using interaural time differences and interaural level differences . However , no such time or level differences exist for sounds originating along the circumference of circular conical slices , where the cone 's axis lies along the line between the two ears . Consequently , sound waves originating at any point along a given circumference slant height will have ambiguous perceptual coordinates . That is to say , the listener will be incapable of determining whether the sound originated from the back , front , top , bottom or anywhere else along the circumference at the base of a cone at any given distance from the ear . Tilting your head might help though . So much so , airplane spotters in WWII judging only by sound <URL> and the entire Luftwaffe was sent looking in the wrong direction , only to realize the direction reported was incorrect and they had to land once they started running out of fuel . Göring freely admitted the laugh was on him , that he had sent the Luftwaffe on a mammoth tour of their own air space . But with computers it can be done using <URL> . Or good old <URL> : <URL> ( <URL> ) Chinese soldiers man a sound detector which directs the firing of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns , around the city of Chongqing , China , on May 2 , 1941 . P.S. Same problem arises when trying to figure out where an artillery fire is coming from or going to .
Flight time is only considered compensation when the pilot is not paying all the costs associated with the flight . If the costs are to be shared the following advice is recommended . A private pilot can be compensated , up to a pro-rata share , of the cost of that specific flight . This would include rental fees , fuel , oil and such . It does not include items like insurance and annual inspection fees . The overall regulation is found in <URL> ( b ) A private pilot may , for compensation or hire , act as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if : ( 1 ) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment ; and ( 2 ) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire . ( c ) A private pilot may not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating expenses of a flight with passengers , provided the expenses involve only fuel , oil , airport expenditures , or rental fees . You should be able to see pretty quickly that you are allowed to transport yourself by private airplane to a business meeting . There is good reason to fly to ; depending on the distance , it could be quicker to fly a private airplane than it is to drive saving you time and money . However , the moment the company decides that you should fly to all of your meetings it is no longer incidental to that business and operations must cease . If you want to fly passengers , and also want them to pay their pro-rata share . There are three things that must be considered . There must be a bona-fide purpose for the PIC to make the flight . The reason can not be that the passenger has a business meeting at the destination and you want to get lunch . You , as the pilot , must have a reason to make the trip , whether or not the passenger ( s ) come along . The PIC must dictate where the flight is going to go . Again , you can not make a flight with passengers where you drop them off at one airport while you fly to a different airport . Why would you land at the first airport , if you have no need to land there ? You can not " hold out " or advertise that you are going somewhere and wait to see if other passengers are interested in going to the same location . There are <URL> that have been shut down by the FAA for doing just that . <URL> <URL> The Chero Interpretation December 26 , 1985 Thomas H. Chero Vice President - Legal AVEMCO Insurance Company Frederick Municipal Airport 411 Aviation Way Frederick , MD 21701 Dear Mr. Chero : Thank you for your letters to this office , dated September 9 , 1985 , and October 23 , 1985 , respectively , concerning the actions of the Pilots and Passengers Association ( PPA ) . You are correct in stating that Section 61.118 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ( FAR ) prohibits private pilots from participating in PPA 's operations . Section 61.118 provides that a private pilot can not act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers for compensation or hire unless the flight falls within one of the four listed exceptions in 61.118 ( a ) - ( d ) . Section 61.118 ( b ) allows a private pilot to share the operating expenses of a flight with his or her passengers . Additionally , the FAA has interpreted 61.118 ( b ) so that the only allowable share-the-costs operations are those which are bona fide , that is , joint ventures for a common purpose with the expenses being defrayed by all passengers and the pilot . Nor does Section 61.118 permit pilots who want to build up time toward their commercial pilot certificates to carry expense sharing passengers to a destination at which they have no particular business . ( emphasis added ) PPA pilots apparently would not share in the expenses of the flights they would undertake . It also appears that PPA pilots could be flying to destinations at which they had no particular business . The PPA system is not a casual one of an individual pilot wishing to take some friends or acquaintances with him on a trip . The PPA system would violate the letter , as well as the spirit , of Section 61.118 . Even if the pilot bears an equal share of the expenses with his or her passengers and indeed has his or her own need to fly to a particular destination , yet another problem arises . Since PPA 's passengers would be solicited for flights by PPA from a broad segment of the general public , we conclude that each pilot carrying paying passengers from PPA would probably be engaged in common carriage . This means that each pilot would become an air carrier subject to the certification and operating rules of Part 135 of the FAR . We appreciate your calling our attention to this matter . Sincerely , John H. Cassady Assistant Chief Counsel Regulations and Enforcement Division

If the aircraft has not established a <URL> , a go around is required . According to EUROCONTROL 's Skybrary , a stabilised approach is defined as : Their Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction ( ALAR ) Briefing Note 7-1 suggests that " all flights must be stabilised by 1000 feet above airport elevation in IMC and 500 feet above airport elevation in VMC . An approach is stabilised when all of the following criteria are met : The aircraft is on the correct flight path Only small changes in heading/pitch are necessary to maintain the correct flight path The airspeed is not more than VREF + 20kts indicated speed and not less than VREF The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration Sink rate is no greater than 1000 feet/minute ; if an approach requires a sink rate greater than 1000 feet/minute a special briefing should be conducted Power setting is appropriate for the aircraft configuration and is not below the minimum power for the approach as defined by the operating manual All briefings and checklists have been conducted Specific types of approach are stabilized if they also fulfill the following : ILS approaches must be flown within one dot of the glide-slope and localizer a Category II or III approach must be flown within the expanded localizer band during a circling approach wings should be level on final when the aircraft reaches 300 feet above airport elevation ; and , Unique approach conditions or abnormal conditions requiring a deviation from the above elements of a stabilized approach require a special briefing . An approach that becomes unstabilised below 1000 feet above airport elevation in IMC or 500 feet above airport elevation in VMC requires an immediate go-around . ( Source : <URL> )
In the US , taxi time can be logged . <URL> says the pilot must log ( emphasis mine ) : Total flight time or lesson time . And <URL> says ( emphasis mine ) : Flight time means : ( 1 ) Pilot time that commences when an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight and ends when the aircraft comes to rest after landing ; or ( 2 ) For a glider without self-launch capability , pilot time that commences when the glider is towed for the purpose of flight and ends when the glider comes to rest after landing . Note that in reality , general aviation pilots ( I do n't know about airline pilots ) usually just log whatever is on the <URL> , which may include some time sitting still on the ramp doing post-startup checks , setting up avionics etc. . That might not be strictly correct per the regulations , but absolutely no one cares . <URL> is closely related .
Sonic booms from low flying aircraft , while loud , do n't seem to cause hearing damage , as this F-14 pilot demonstrates during a Tiger Cruise air wing demonstration . Now military fighters will sometimes make a ' show of force ' in the form of a low altitude , high speed pass against threat forces which do n't have a substantial IADS capability in order to motivate them to disperse under threat of employing ordanance on them if they continue belligerence . UPDATE : I found this story about an F-16 2-ship over Iraq on a CAS patrol mission . The pilots get a radio call from desperate SOCOM operators pinned down by enemy troops at night . The pilots can not get a IR strobe to track for bombing , so the lead Viper uses a sonic boom delivered from a dive to frighten off the combatants .
Vortex ring state is characterized by rapid descent and reduced effectiveness of control inputs . At the onset , it is characterized by increased vibration and buffet of the airframe , with uncommanded changes in helicopter attitude . Also , any increase in the collective is ineffective and counterproductive . From <URL> : Incipient vortex ring conditions are typically : increased vibration and buffet , the onset of small amplitude ' twitches ' in pitch and evidence of longitudinal , lateral and directional instability . Established vortex ring conditions are characterised by : a very rapid increase in rate of descent towards and beyond 3000fpm , reduced effectiveness of cyclic inputs in roll or pitch the application of collective pitch failing to arrest the rate of descent and usually increasing it . From FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook - <URL> : A fully developed vortex ring state is characterized by an unstable condition in which the helicopter experiences uncommanded pitch and roll oscillations , has little or no collective authority , and achieves a descent rate that may approach 6,000 feet per minute ( fpm ) if allowed to develop . The best measure against vortex ring state is quite simple - go forward i.e. increase airspeed . Basically , you enter into forward flight so that the rate of descent does n't oppose the induced flow . You need ' undisturbed ' airflow over the rotor disc . Power is to be applied after gaining sufficient airspeed . From skybrary : Incipient Stage ... Keep the collective position unchanged and apply forward cyclic to achieve an accelerative ( nose down ) attitude so as to increase forward airspeed quickly . As soon as a steady increase in airspeed is indicated , and above 30 KIAS , more power can be applied if necessary without waiting until the best rate of climb speed is reached . If this action does not resolve the situation rapidly then it is best to treat the condition as established and take the actions below . Established Condition . Recovery can only be effected by changing the airflow around the rotor and will inevitably lead to significant loss of height , which makes recovery from a low level occurrence impossible . There are two theoretically possible actions : Moving the cyclic forward and lowering the collective . Combining these actions is likely to produce the quickest recovery with the least height loss . Application of forward cyclic should increase airspeed but a large input held for several seconds may be required before significant pitch attitude and consequent speed change is achieved , with a significant nose down attitude resulting . Lowering the collective to reduce power towards auto-rotation , so unstalling some of the inboard portion of the blades , may also be effective but forward airspeed must be gained before power is re-applied during recovery . Autorotation has also been suggested as a measure for overcoming the vortex ring state ( by the FAA handbook , for example ) , but it may lead to further loss of height , which has to be taken into account . Another issue is that there are some variations between the different helicopter types - in case of tilt-rotor aircraft like V-22 , the only way is to go into forward flight .
As others above have stated , the Kamov KA-50 family is fitted with an ejection seat . First the blades are separated from the blade sleeves , which remain attached to the mast ( rotor hub ) . a few fractions of a second later , the conventional upwards firing ejection seat is launched , using extraction rockets tied to cables to drag the seat clear of the airframe . This cutaway image shows it to reasonable effect . ' 46 ' indicates where the blade separates from the sleeve . The little sketch of the smoke on the lower right blade shows the separation , and the ' 18 ' and ' 19 ' show the extraction rocket . <URL> Digital Combat Simulations 's ( DCS ) line of computer simulations models the ka-50 , including the ejection seat . I 'm sure there 's video from the game online somewhere . <URL>
You ca n't get real-time data from the FAA without an operational need , and organizations which do receive real-time data can not legally re-distribute this data publicly , except to other organizations approved by the FAA . An operational need pretty much means you have to be a flight dispatcher for an airline or commercial operator , not just have an interest in tracking flights . You can get some real-time data from your local area using an ADS-B receiver . See this question for more information : <URL> . If you are okay with the five minute delay , then <URL> you might consider . The direct feed from the FAA is called <URL> and I believe you can apply for the delayed feed , though I 've never gone through the process , and the government 's site is very sparse in information . I would suggest contacting them before attempting to apply if it 's something you 're interested in .
straight out of the Airplane Flying Handbook , pp 9-4 Operating the engine at idle speed for any prolonged period during the glide may result in excessive engine cooling , spark plug fouling , or carburetor ice . To assist in avoiding these issues , the throttle should be periodically advanced to normal cruise power and sustained for a few seconds . This procedure is common during emergency descents or steep spirals to prevent the engine from cooling off too much . If the engine mixture is excessively rich , spark plug fouling can occur . Fouling can be cleaned off the plugs by running the engine at Cruise power settings with a properly leaned mixture in about 10 or so seconds .
is the speed reported in this story wrong ? No No it is not a misprint that the SR-72 is intended to be capable of Mach 6 From the <URL> : Envisioned as an unmanned aircraft , the SR-72 would fly at speeds up to Mach 6 , or six times the speed of sound . At this speed , the aircraft would be so fast , an adversary would have no time to react or hide . The SR-72 's design incorporates lessons learned from the HTV-2 , which flew to a top speed of Mach 20 , or 13,000 mph , with a surface temperature of 3500 ° F. Yes Yes it is not true that Mach 6 is necessarily 4567.2423 MPH From <URL> : <URL> Cmglee . License : CC by SA 3
There 's one I can think of immediately , and that 's the granddaddy of them all , the <URL> . The X-1 's control system was unassisted and it had no hydraulic system . The only part of the control system that was assisted was the horizontal stabilizer , which was <URL> . I think most of the early supersonic test airplanes were mechanically operated .
Searching the <URL> which also covers some international commercial flights for the key words " hack " , " hacked " do not provide any results related to hacked avionics . Likewise using the keyword " tampered " does not provide any results related to deliberate tampering with avionics ( mostly " tampered " wreckage ) . There is one individual , <URL> , who claims to have hacked into the In-Flight Entertainment System ( IFE ) to cause the aircraft to deviate from its course , however I find it highly suspicious . From a security perspective , I ca n't of any good reason to have the <URL> , however that is n't to say that there is n't some possible connection . The FBI certainly <URL> . So as of today there have not been any aviation accidents that are attributed to hacked or deliberately tampered-with avionics as a cause of said accident . The closest thing I think you will find is pilots loading incorrect flight plans , outdated ( or even pre-dated ) navigation data , and other cases of pilots not correctly using the equipment . I did read your original question and would like to clarify . Conspiracy theories , guesses , and internet speculation are not a replacement for hard evidence . In the case of MH-17 the wreckage was recovered and no evidence has been presented in the favor of hacking , while there is a lot of evidence of the shoot-down . Airliners even at cruising altitude can be shot down by surface to air missiles rather easily . As for MH-370 , until the wreckage is found we may never know ( and even if it is we may never know ) . Black boxes do not have an indefinite life span especially if they are under water . Until then theories of that flight being hacked are just as credible as those saying aliens abducted the entire flight and they are living on Neptune in specially constructed Igloos .
My experience transitioning from airplanes to helicopters and then to gliders is that I never forget what I 'm flying . I know that sounds obvious , but its no different than the difference between driving a car with automatic transmission and manual , riding a motorcycle which has all the controls in a different place than a car and <URL> , and flying an airplane . I do n't reach for the throttle when I want to slow down in a car , and I do n't turn the wheel in the direction of the turn when I 'm riding a motorcycle . Similarly , when taking off in an airplane , I know I have to add power and pull back a bit to get it off the ground , and in a helicopter I inch the nose forward to gain <URL> . The reason I do n't act/react improperly when flying different aircraft is that it 's all been trained into my muscle memory to do the right thing depending on the circumstances . I do n't think of the horn in a helicopter as a stall horn , just like the buzzer in my alarm clock and smoke alarm are not stall horns . The horn in the heli is a low-rpm horn , and I ease the stick back not forward . Another complication is instrument flight . Although I am an instrument rated airplane pilot , I have a little hood time in a helicopter . I 'm so used to flying pitch and power against the AI that all my instincts under the hood in the heli were completely wrong . Nevertheless , I do n't think I 'll ultimately have any trouble flying instruments well in a heli .
